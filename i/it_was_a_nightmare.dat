5|$|Depp {{collaborated with}} costume {{designer}} Penny Rose on his character's appearance, handpicking a tricorne as Sparrow's signature leather hat; to make Sparrow's unique, {{the other characters}} did not wear leather hats. A rubber version {{was used for the}} scene in Dead Man's Chest when the hat floats on water. Depp liked to stick to one costume, wearing one lightweight silk tweed frock coat throughout the series, and he had to be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes. The official line is that none of the costumes from The Curse of the Black Pearl survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts. However, one remains which has been displayed in an exhibition of screen costumes in Worcester, England. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow's sash in Turkey. Rose did not want to silkscreen it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel. Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{television}} commercial for Brazilian soft drink Guaraná Antarctica portrayed Maradona {{as a member}} of the Brazil national team, including wearing the yellow jersey and singing the Brazilian national anthem with Brazilian caps Kaká and Ronaldo. Later on in the commercial he wakes up realizing <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> after having drunk too much of the drink. This generated some controversy in the Argentine media after its release (although the commercial was not supposed to air on the Argentine market, fans could see it online). Maradona replied that he has no problem in wearing the Brazilian national squad jersey despite Argentina and Brazil having a tense rivalry in football, but that he would refuse to wear the shirt of River Plate, Boca Juniors' traditional rival. There is a documented phenomenon of Brazilians being named in honour of Maradona, an example being footballer Diego Costa. In 2017, it was announced that Maradona would feature as a legendary player in the football video games FIFA 18 and Pro Evolution Soccer 2018.|$|E
500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People {{come up to you}} in the street and shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E

50|$|His editor, Charles Prentice, quickly {{rejected}} {{the story as}} too strange: <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> Just too terribly persuasive. It gives me the jim-jams. Beckett later (1962) gave the typescript to Lawrence Harvey. The typescript and a carbon copy ended up in Beckett archives, and has been available for study by scholars.|$|R
5000|$|In another context, she remarked: [...] "It's true {{that the}} Russian {{television}} follows Putin step by step. But French television is so politically correct <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> We have laws Stalin could have thought up[...] [...] People cannot express {{an opinion about}} ethnic groups, the Second World War, and plenty of other things. You’ll be quickly convicted of a crime." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Even Flow" [...] {{features}} lyrics {{written by}} vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "I {{know it was}} a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it." [...] Drummer Dave Krusen said, [...] "I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation." [...] He added that [...] "it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready stated, [...] "We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> We played that thing over and over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was just}} {{beginning}} to doze when she heard a voice quite close to her, which made her jump. 'O lovely princess, if you only knew what I have gone through to find you!' The princess jumped out of bed screaming, 'The lion! the lion!' but her friends thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare,</b> and did not trouble themselves to get up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Murrey," [...] said Cicely, [...] "after we've {{had dinner}} {{together}} to- night, I'm {{going to do}} a seemingly unwifely thing. I'm {{going to go out and}} leave you alone with an old friend. Doctor Holham is coming in to drink coffee and smoke with you. I arranged this because I knew it was what you would like. Men can talk these things over best by themselves, and Holham can tell you everything that happened--since you went away. It will be a dreary story, I'm afraid, but you will want to hear it all. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> time, but now one sees it in a calmer perspective." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Turnbull, violently. [...] "For I {{think the}} devil <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dream, {{and so are}} you. I don't believe in you or your flying ship or your last fight of the world. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> all <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> I say as a fact of dogma and faith that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> all <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> And I will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> martyr for my faith as much as St. Catherine, for I will jump out of this ship and risk waking up safe in bed." ...|$|R
50|$|Then came La Mer (1861), {{a return}} to the natural history class, which, {{considering}} the powers of the writer and the attraction of the subject, <b>is</b> perhaps <b>a</b> little disappointing.The next year (1862) the most striking of all Michelet's minor works, La Sorcière, made its appearance. Developed out of an episode of the history, it has all its author's peculiarities in the strongest degree. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> and nothing more, but <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> of the most extraordinary verisimilitude and poetical power.|$|R
6000|$|He went to {{the window}} and drew back the curtain. What was that? A gibbet in the air, a body hanging? Ah! Only the trees--the dark trees--the winter {{skeleton}} trees! Recoiling, he returned to his armchair and sat down before the fire. It had been shining like that, the lamp turned low, his chair drawn up, when Larry came in that afternoon two months ago. Bah! He had never come at all! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> He had been asleep. How his head burned! And leaping up, he looked at the calendar on his bureau. [...] "January the 28th!" [...] No dream! His face hardened and darkened. On! Not like Larry! On! 1914.|$|E
6000|$|... 'For {{the most}} part of that night I was persuaded <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> I bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads down {{in a kind of}} agony and rush into the flames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the {{streaming}} masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures, came the white light of the day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you {{realized}} {{what all this}} means?" [...] she continued. [...] "Are you prepared {{to give up your}} life here, your sports, your beautiful home, to feel that you have spies and enemies on every side, working always in the dark against you? The man who lies dead upstairs knew every move of the game--yet you see what has happened to him. How can you hope to succeed when he failed? Forget last night, my friend! I Believe that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare,</b> and I, too, will forget what you have told me. Come, it is not too late. We will say that he died suddenly in a stupor, and that, whatever his secrets were, he carried them with him. Is it agreed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Miss Clifford, do {{you think}} about various things that {{probably}} do not exist? Perhaps because you feel that here or elsewhere they do exist. Well, that is what I feel about the treasure, and what I have always felt. It exists, and I shall find it--now. I shall live to see more gold than you can even imagine, and that is why I still continue to breed horses on the Transvaal veld. Ah! you laugh; you think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> that I breed----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leon," [...] {{she said}} fiercely, [...] "how {{can you talk}} such wicked, infamous nonsense? To pass all night out-of-doors - <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like <b>a</b> <b>nightmare!</b> We shall die." ...|$|R
60|$|Only, you see, this mood is all bosh. I do {{not believe}} in it in the least. That one-eyed universe, with its one-eyed men and beasts, was only created with one {{universal}} wink. At the top of the tragic trees I should not find the Angel's Nest. I should only find the Mare's Nest; the dreamy and divine nest is not there. In the Mare's Nest I shall discover that dim, enormous opalescent egg from which is hatched the Nightmare. For there is nothing so delightful as a nightmare--when you know <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Beneath the adamant of his self-preserving {{instinct}} {{there was}} much real softness in James; a visit to Timothy's was like an hour spent {{in the lap of}} a mother; and the deep craving he himself had {{for the protection of the}} family wing reacted in turn on his feelings towards his own children; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> to him to think of them exposed to the treatment of the world, in money, health, or reputation. When his old friend John Street's son volunteered for special service, he shook his head querulously, and wondered what John Street was about to allow it; and when young Street was assagaied, he took it so much to heart that he made a point of calling everywhere with the special object of saying: He knew how it would be--he'd no patience with them! ...|$|E
60|$|Bruised {{and sore}} as he was--and {{he was very}} sore--within little over an hour Abbot Maldon {{was back at the}} ruin of Cranwell Towers. It seemed strange that he should go there, but in truth his uneasy heart would not let him rest. His plans had succeeded only far too well. Sir John Foterell was dead--a crime, no doubt, but necessary, for had the knight lived to reach London with that {{evidence}} in his pocket, his own life and those of many others might have paid the price of it, since who knows what truths may be twisted from a victim on the rack? Maldon had always feared the rack; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> that haunted his sleep, although the ambitious cunning of his nature and the cause he served with heart and soul prompted him to put himself in continual danger of that fate.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> climb. The mound, though but low, was awfully steep, {{and with}} each step I took the mass of dust and cinders tore down with me and gave way under my feet. The dust rose and choked me; it was sickening, foetid, awful; but my climb was, I felt, for life or death, and I {{struggled}} on. The seconds seemed hours; but the few moments I had in starting, combined with my youth and strength, gave me a great advantage, and, though several forms struggled after me in deadly silence which was more dreadful than any sound, I easily reached the top. Since then I have climbed the cone of Vesuvius, and as I struggled up that dreary steep amid the sulphurous fumes {{the memory of that}} awful night at Montrouge came back to me so vividly that I almost grew faint.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{hear that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> human," [...] he murmured. [...] "I thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Wells <b>nightmare</b> or that {{something}} from underground had been let loose." ...|$|R
5000|$|Siddique {{has said}} he has {{intentions}} of returning to boxing, stating;'...I've a lot to prove...I'll be back. I had a horrible back injury so <b>it</b> has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare...</b> I'm still training, I'm nowhere near done...' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> like <b>a</b> <b>nightmare,</b> {{that race}} through the thicket with the murderous fiends close on our trail, {{shooting}} {{now and then}} when in the gloom the waving branches told of our course.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> that followed. Stooping only a little, {{flashing}} his torch {{always in}} front, he half ran, half scrambled along a paved way, between paved walls which even the damp of centuries seemed scarcely to have entered. Soon the path descended steeply and then rose {{on the other}} side of the moat. Once a rat paused to look at him with eyes gleaming like diamonds, and bolted at the flash of the torch. More than once he fancied that he heard footsteps echoing behind him. He paused to listen. There was nothing. He lost sense of time or distance. He stole on, dreading the end--and the end came sooner even than he had feared. There was the door that yielded easily to his touch, the steep steps round and round the interior of the tower, the blank wall before him. The iron handle was there. His hands closed upon it. For a moment he stood in terrible silence. This was something worse than death! Then he set his teeth firmly, pressed the handle and stepped through the wall.|$|E
60|$|But Bassett's relapses {{grew more}} frequent, his brief convalescences {{less and less}} vigorous, his periods of coma longer, until he came to know, beyond the last promptings of the {{optimism}} inherent in so tremendous a constitution as his own, {{that he would never}} live to cross the grass lands, perforate the perilous coast jungle, and reach the sea. He faded as the Southern Cross rose higher in the sky, till even Balatta knew that he would be dead ere the nuptial date determined by his taboo. Ngurn made pilgrimage personally and gathered the smoke materials for the curing of Bassett's head, and to him made proud announcement and exhibition of the artistic perfectness of his intention when Bassett should be dead. As for himself, Bassett was not shocked. Too long and too deeply had life ebbed down in him to bite him with fear of its impending extinction. He continued to persist, alternating periods of unconsciousness with periods of semi-consciousness, dreamy and unreal, in which he idly wondered whether he had ever truly beheld the Red One or whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> fancy of delirium.|$|E
60|$|Only {{one other}} picture shall I give {{of the scenes}} which we carried back in our {{memories}} from the dead city. It is a glimpse which we had of {{the interior of the}} old church of St. Mary's, which is at the very point where our car was awaiting us. Picking our way among the prostrate figures upon the steps, we pushed open the swing door and entered. It was a wonderful sight. The church was crammed from end to end with kneeling figures in every posture of supplication and abasement. At the last dreadful moment, brought suddenly {{face to face with the}} realities of life, those terrific realities which hang over us even while we follow the shadows, the terrified people had rushed into those old city churches which for generations had hardly ever held a congregation. There they huddled as close as they could kneel, many of them in their agitation still wearing their hats, while above them in the pulpit a young man in lay dress had apparently been addressing them when he and they had been overwhelmed by the same fate. He lay now, like Punch in his booth, with his head and two limp arms hanging over the ledge of the pulpit. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare,</b> the grey, dusty church, the rows of agonized figures, the dimness and silence of it all. We moved about with hushed whispers, walking upon our tip-toes.|$|E
60|$|She {{began to}} tremble. She {{could not have}} called out or framed any intelligible {{sentence}} to save her life. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> like <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> The horror <b>was</b> there, without the power of movement or speech.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my boy, tell me {{all about}} it," [...] he said, and Godfrey told him, feebly {{suggesting}} that <b>it</b> might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b>|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> moment's silence. She had {{scarcely}} given herself {{credit for}} such capacity for emotion. He {{was on his}} feet. Surely the mask must go now! And then--she felt that <b>it</b> must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> incredible! He had struck <b>a</b> match and <b>was</b> calmly lighting <b>a</b> cigarette.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{my blood}} seemed to freeze in my veins, {{and my heart}} to stand still. Was it fancy, or were we moving? I turned my eyes {{to look for the}} other canoe which should be {{alongside}} of us. I could not see it, but instead I saw a lean and clutching black hand lifting itself above the gunwale of the little boat. Surely <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare!</b> At the same instant a dim but devilish-looking face appeared to rise out of the water, and then came a lurch of the canoe, the quick flash of a knife, and an awful yell from the Wakwafi who was sleeping by my side (the same poor fellow whose odour had been annoying me), and something warm spurted into my face. In an instant the spell was broken; I knew that it was no nightmare, but that we were attacked by swimming Masai. Snatching at the first weapon that came to hand, which happened to be Umslopogaas' battleaxe, I struck with all my force in the direction in which I had seen the flash of the knife. The blow fell upon a man's arm, and, catching it against the thick wooden gunwale of the canoe, completely severed it from the body just above the wrist. As for its owner, he uttered no sound or cry. Like a ghost he came, and like a ghost he went, leaving behind him a bloody hand still gripping a great knife, or rather a short sword, that was buried in the heart of our poor servant.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were things}} which I saw then, as I pressed through that dreadful crowd, which {{can never be}} banished from my mind. In evil dreams there comes back to me {{the memory of that}} flowing stream of livid, staring, {{screaming}} faces upon which I looked down. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> In victory one does not understand the horror of war. It is only in the cold chill of defeat that it is brought home to you. I remember an old Grenadier of the Guard lying {{at the side of the}} road with his broken leg doubled at a right angle. [...] "Comrades, comrades, keep off my leg!" [...] he cried, but they tripped and stumbled over him all the same. In front of me rode a Lancer officer without his coat. His arm had just been taken off in the ambulance. The bandages had fallen. It was horrible. Two gunners tried to drive through with their gun. A Chasseur raised his musket and shot one of them through the head. I saw a major of Cuirassiers draw his two holster pistols and shoot first his horse and then himself. Beside the road a man in a blue coat was raging and raving like a madman. His face was black with powder, his clothes were torn, one epaulette was gone, the other hung dangling over his breast. Only when I came close to him did I recognise that it was Marshal Ney. He howled at the flying troops and his voice was hardly human. Then he raised the stump of his sword--it was broken three inches from the hilt. [...] "Come and see how a Marshal of France can die!" [...] he cried. Gladly would I have gone with him, but my duty lay elsewhere.|$|E
