5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{episode was}} written by Al Septien and Turi Meyer, whereas the second half {{was written by}} Peterson and Souders.

Souders later explained that the script had been finalized when Rosenbaum agreed to return to the series. As such, this forced the writers to redo parts of the episode to make room for his character. The work was so stressful, Souders said, that she experienced heart palpitations due to exhaustion, excitement, and the emotion of the experience.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line, {{originally}} a light rail, was from Majorstuen to Smestad, and opened in 1912.

In 1928, the line received {{a connection to the}} city center when the <b>first</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Common Tunnel was completed. In 1935, the first extension of the Røa Line proper was made, when the line was extended to Røa. In 1942, the Kolsås Line became a branch. Additional extensions to the Røa Line were made in 1948 to Grini, in 1951 to Lijordet and in 1972 to Østerås. By then, the line had become an integrated part of the municipal Oslo Sporveier. The line was upgraded to rapid transit in 1995, became part of the metro and started running through the city center.|$|E

5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. The <b>first</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of}} the head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E

The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.|$|E

5|$|Because of delays from Stadler's subcontractors, five {{instead of}} eight trams were {{available}} when the line opened on 22 June 2010. Skyss {{had planned to}} operate with a ten-minute headway until August, but had a 15-minute headway until 16 August. To compensate, none of the parallel bus routes ceased until then. On 7 June, two trams collided at low speed at Byparken, causing a derailment and forced the two trams to be repaired. This caused the summer schedule to {{be reduced to a}} 30-minute headway. From 1 November, the line started running every six minutes during the rush hour. On 22 June, the <b>first</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway.|$|E
