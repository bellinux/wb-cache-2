25|$|After another SADC {{meeting on}} 26 January 2009, there were {{conflicting}} reports. The SADC and ZANU-PF claimed {{that it had}} been agreed that the Constitutional Amendment would be adopted on 5 February 2009 and the new government, including Tsvangirai, sworn in on 11 February 2009, while the MDC stated that there had been no agreement on key issues. However, on 29 January 2009 the MDC confirmed that it would join the <b>inclusive</b> <b>government</b> and that the MDC's national council would vote on the issue on 30 January 2009; it approved the deal. South African President Motlanthe pledged to assist Zimbabwe in the rebuilding process once the unity government was in place.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fourth}} day of {{negotiations}} Mbeki announced that Mugabe, Tsvangirai, and Mutambara had signed a power-sharing agreement – [...] "memorandum of understanding." [...] Mbeki stated: [...] "An agreement has been reached on all items on the agenda ... all of them [...] endorsed the document tonight, and signed it. The formal signing will be done on Monday 10am. The document will be released then. The ceremony will be attended by SADC and other African regional and continental leaders. The leaders will spend the next few days constituting the <b>inclusive</b> <b>government</b> to be announced on Monday. The leaders will work very hard to mobilise support for the people to recover. We hope the world will assist so that this political agreement succeeds." [...] The deal is also expected to result in a de facto amnesty for the military and Zanu-PF party leaders. Opposition sources said [...] "Tsvangirai will become prime minister {{at the head of a}} council of ministers, the principal organ of government, drawn from his Movement for Democratic Change and the president's Zanu-PF party; and Mugabe will remain president and continue to chair a cabinet that will be a largely consultative body, and the real power will lie with Tsvangirai." [...] South Africa's Business Day reported, however, that Mugabe was refusing to sign a deal which would curtail his presidential powers. According to The New York Times, MDC spokesman Chamisa announced: “This is an <b>inclusive</b> <b>government.</b> The executive power would be shared by the president, the prime minister and the cabinet. Mugabe, Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara have still not decided how to divide the ministries. But Jendayi E. Frazer, the American assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said: “We don’t know what’s on the table, and it’s hard to rally for an agreement when no one knows the details or even the broad outlines”.|$|E
2500|$|In remarks {{published}} in The Herald on 5 December, Mugabe told the ZANU-PF Politburo that [...] "if the arrangement fails {{to work in}} the next one-and-a-half to two years", there would be an early election. On 13 December, the draft constitutional amendment was {{published in}} the government gazette. According to Motlanthe, the amendment marked a [...] "major step towards the formation of an <b>inclusive</b> <b>government</b> in Zimbabwe", and he expressed his hope that Tsvangirai would be sworn in immediately; it was believed that Mugabe was empowered to swear in Tsvangirai as Prime Minister without waiting for parliamentary approval of the amendment. Chamisa stressed that the outstanding issues of cabinet portfolios and provincial governors still needed to be resolved, while Chinamasa echoed Mugabe's earlier warning that he would call a new election if power-sharing was not successful.|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} {{governance}} implies that democracies provide public goods at different levels than dictatorships. Systems of governance are characterized by inclusiveness—the degree to which public good decisions reflect the interests of all citizens versus an elite subset. The theory indicates that less <b>inclusive</b> (autocratic) <b>governments</b> will under-provide public consumption goods relative to more <b>inclusive</b> (democratic) <b>governments.</b> Governance indicators are formed from data on attributes of governments, e. g., the method of selecting the chief executive, {{the power of the}} legislature, and the openness of political competition. Autocratic governments are found to provide public schooling, roads, safe water, public sanitation, and pollution control at levels far below democracies. Public goods provision is strongly related to per capita income in democracies, but not in autocracies...|$|R

We are concerned that no more innocent victims should suffer due to rising tensions and call for calm, restraint and mutual respect. [...] The PES {{would like to see}} a role for OSCE Observers, and an increase in dialogue whereby all sides strive to find balanced solutions. We urge all parties involved to show full respect for international agreements, including the UN Charter, the 1997 military basing agreement with Ukraine, the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and the OSCE Final Act. The Government in Kyiv should do everything possible to be inclusive, and a dialogue with Eastern and Southern interlocutors must be a priority. We call for a balanced solution respecting Ukraine’s territorial integrity. All concerns Russia has with regards to the security and human rights situation in Ukraine can be addressed through negotiations or international monitoring. The EU should provide immediate financial and technical assistance to Ukraine’s Government, as this will contribute to the stabilization of the region." ...|$|E
