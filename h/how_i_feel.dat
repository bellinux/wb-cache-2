500|$|Moore has {{acknowledged}} the {{narrow range of}} his vocals. He considers his vocal style to [...] " [...] from <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> when I’m singing, when I'm in the zone of writing lyrics and recording which, a lot of times, comes as the same time. It's sort of an introspective time. A lot of the material lends itself {{to that kind of}} voice and that kind of spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|That {{is one of}} {{my biggest}} records ever, hype-wise, the music itself, I love it to the core. I don’t do songs {{thinking}} this has to be a hit. I do music based on <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> from my heart and that is typically New Guy. New Guy is like a heart fulfilling type of record and to me, I think it actually hit the major impact that I wanted it to hit and people are loving it [...] My fans love it.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Speechless" [...] deal with being lost for words because of love. The song opens with Jackson's singing acappella: [...] "Your love is magical, that's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel,</b> but I have not the words here to explain", which Rick de Yampert of The Daytona Beach News-Journal felt the singer [...] " [...] sweetly". The chorus {{includes}} the lines, [...] "Speechless, speechless, that's {{how you make}} me feel. Though I'm with you, I am far away and nothing is for real." [...] A second acappella verse bookends the track.|$|E

500|$|About the shoot, Victoria Beckham commented: [...] "It took such a {{long time}} to film the 'Mama' video, but it was nice that our mums were there and could see what we're doing. It's good, because they were {{actually}} knackered {{at the end of the}} day and I said to my mum: 'Ha! Now you know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> every day!" [...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till".|$|E

[...] Arcel described Walter as having [...] "a very interesting way of seeing the world. He sees it {{with a sort of}} delight, even though he is obviously {{on the wrong side of}} the light-and-dark spectrum. He’s someone I’ve been having a lot of fun with." [...] McConaughey described Walter with [...] "I enjoyed approaching my character as if I were the Devil having a good time, getting turned on by exposing human hypocrisies wherever he finds them." ...|$|E

500|$|Montoya {{admitted}} to feeling disappointed after the race, having been leading until his only pit stop on lap 22. He stated: [...] "I am so disappointed I cannot {{find the words}} to describe <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel.</b> Up to the pit stop the race was going perfectly for me." [...] Williams technical director Patrick Head was {{not happy with the}} refulling rigs supplied by the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). One of the rigs was sent back to manufacturer Intertechnique who said they could not find any issues with the system. Michael Schumacher, placed fourth before his retirement from a fuel pressure problem on lap 23, shared similar feelings to Montoya: [...] "I am not too disappointed as the situation in the championship remains the same and there is one less race to go. It was a shame not to finish the race and pick up a further six points." ...|$|E
500|$|West Ham manager Alan Pardew {{described}} the defeat {{as hard to}} take: [...] "It felt like a defeat when the third goal went in. We rallied and had a great chance in extra time. We had to dig in. This was a top team we were playing, but I felt {{we were going to}} win. Only a 35-yard Gerrard smasher was going to change that. The players have been magnificent – we are proud of the way we played." [...] Captain Nigel Reo-Coker found defeat hard to take as he felt they had done enough to win the final: [...] "I can't describe it <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> at the moment – gutted because I think we deserved to win this game. The players put in a fantastic effort, but it just wasn't to be for us. It was a marvellous FA Cup final and we gave all we could. I hope everyone was proud – it just wasn't our day." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone said Lohan [...] "makes a fatal {{mistake on}} her second album: She tries to, like, express herself", while a Los Angeles Times critic also gave the album a {{negative}} review, claiming that, [...] "for {{most of the}} album, [...] sounds like any other self-absorbed teen, yearning to be Alanis, Gwen and even Stevie Nicks." [...] Whitney Strub of PopMatters stated, [...] "what can one expect from an album that promises to get more personal but includes lyrics declaring, “no one knows <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> inside/And I’m keeping it that way” (from “Fastlane”)?", and commenting that [...] "with A Little More Personal, Lindsay Lohan reminds us that, despite such blossoms, pop still {{has the potential to}} climb the charts while combining blandness, banality and vapidity". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine considered A Little More Personal (Raw) [...] "more consistent than its predecessor, and it's not a bad listen by any means, but for all the so-called weighty subject matter, there's not much meat on these bones".|$|E

500|$|Weiland's lyrics were {{unique to}} {{previous}} albums, {{which had been}} solely focused on himself and his drug addictions. He studied lyricists {{to learn how to}} write differently. [...] " [...] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so {{a lot of the stuff}} was just from my point of view. Now, I tend to look at some of the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] I try to tell stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> on that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E
500|$|... "Cold Case Love" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by The Y's (Justin Timberlake, Robin Tadross and James Fauntleroy II). At the [...] "Justin Timberlake & Friends Concert in Las Vegas", Timberlake told MTV News that Rated R {{is a whole}} new sound and that the new songs are not just a rehash of what fans heard on her last album. [...] "She broke onto the scene so hard with the last record— to have that many songs on the charts is impressive. I think that the smartest thing she's doing is not trying to emulate what she did but move forward", Timberlake explained. In February 2010, Rihanna admitted that [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] was inspired by her difficult relationship with ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, [...] "It's a song that everybody wanted to hear, everything that I didn't say for the past eight months, exactly how I felt about that relationship and <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about it now– that song says it all." [...] When asked what the most important song from the album to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, Rihanna cited [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] together with [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] as her favorites.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{begins the}} first verse {{of the song}} in a near-whisper, [...] "I thought that things like this get better with time / But I still need you / Why is that?" [...] The latter rhetorical {{question}} reappears throughout the song. In the chorus lines, she questions herself, [...] "I miss you / But if I got with you, could it feel the same?" [...] From the second verse and onwards, the song finds Beyoncé [...] "vocalizing an internal battle, alternately desperate and calm", as stated by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle. She starts to sing in a double voice; her lower vocal notes are set as the song's base, while her voice in a heightened key is played over it. In the second verse, she sings, [...] "The words don’t ever seem to come out right / But I still mean em", pining for her ex-love interest and feeling self-conscious for doing so, [...] "It hurts my pride to tell you <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel,</b> but I still need to" [...] before asking again, [...] "Why is that?". The bridge features Beyoncé chanting, [...] "No matter who you are / It is so simple / A feeling / But it’s everything." ...|$|E

500|$|Jam and Lewis {{were the}} primary instrumentalists for the recording, {{including}} percussion, piano, drums, and also provided background vocals. Jackson accompanied Jam and Lewis on keyboard and took part in composing the arrangements. Stephen Holden of The New York Times observed the album was prominent example of the developing relationship with musicians and modern technology, stating [...] "...technology has altered the form, shape, scale and even the meaning of popular music... The album wasn't created by a studio band, as were most pop-rock albums in the 1960s and '70s, but by the producers and the singer programming mechanized drum and keyboard textures." [...] Jackson's father disapproved of the new material and image of Control, claiming it would never sell. In a cover story for Spin magazine titled [...] "Damn It, Janet: The Battle for Control of Janet Jackson," [...] Joseph was reported saying [...] "f Janet listens to me, she'll {{be as big as}} Michael." [...] She and McClain disregarded his objections. Commenting on the final product, Jackson stated: [...] "It's aggressive, cocky, very forward. It expresses exactly who I am and <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel.</b> I've taken control of my own life. This time I'm gonna do it my way." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 26, Kaina Martinez was {{the sole}} female athlete on the Belize Olympic team. She made her first {{appearance}} in the Olympic Games. Martinez qualified for the London Games because her quickest time of 11.74 seconds, set at the 2011 Central American Championships in Athletics, was 0.36 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for her contest, the women's 100 metres. Before the Games she stated that she felt satisfied and attempted not to get excessive anxiety by relaxing and mediating. Martinez was drawn in the second heat in the event's preliminary stage, finishing second out of eight runners, {{with a time of}} 11.81 seconds. Her time allowed her to qualify for the first round. She placed eighth (and last) in the contest's seventh heat with a time of 11.89 seconds. Martinez finished behind Delphine Atangana of Cameroon (11.82 seconds) in a heat led by the Ivory Coast's Murielle Ahouré (10.99 seconds). Overall Martinez ranked 51st out of 78 athletes and could not advance to the semifinal after finishing 0.81 seconds slower than the slowest runner who progressed to the later stages.

I just think it's an awesome experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Bosworth {{was cast}} as {{reporter}} Lois Lane in Bryan Singer's superhero film Superman Returns (2006). She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in your life when you feel you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and think, Now I get it? [...] That's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel.</b> I feel a little bit more complete." [...] The movie grossed $52million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $391million worldwide.|$|E

The clip was official released {{few hours after}} she posted a 2000-word thank you message to fans on her official website on August 28, 2013.
