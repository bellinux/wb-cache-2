5|$|Baxter {{was free}} of the sectarianism that marked the rivalry between Glasgow's two leading teams. His close friends {{included}} the Celtic players Billy McNeill, Pat Crerand and Mike Jackson, in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unwritten rule that rivals did not associate.|$|E
5|$|Hazareesingh (2004) explores how Napoleon's {{image and}} memory are best understood. They {{played a key}} role in {{collective}} political <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bourbon restoration monarchy in 1815–1830. People from different walks of life and areas of France, particularly Napoleonic veterans, drew on the Napoleonic legacy and its connections with the ideals of the 1789 revolution.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Zajc's 1876 opera Nikola Šubić Zrinski is {{his most}} famous and popular work in Croatia. This recounts the heroic <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croats towards the Turks, {{as a metaphor for}} their later {{nationalist}} impulses within the Habsburg monarchy.|$|E

5|$|The Tilhas Tizig Gesheften, a {{small group}} formed from the British Army's Jewish Brigade, {{obtained}} a supply of counterfeit pounds from Jaacov Levy, one of Schwend's money-laundering agents. The forged notes were used to buy equipment and to bring displaced persons to Palestine, in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British blockade of the territory.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius offered {{peace to}} Khosrow, presumably in 624, {{threatening}} otherwise to invade Persia, but Khosrow rejected the offer. On March 25, 624, Heraclius left Constantinople {{to attack the}} Persian heartland. He willingly abandoned any attempt to secure his rear or his communications with the sea, marching through Armenia and modern Azerbaijan to assault the core Persian lands directly. According to Walter Kaegi, Heraclius led an army {{of no more than}} 40,000, and most likely between 20,00024,000. Before journeying to the Caucasus, he recovered Caesarea, in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier letter that Khosrow had sent him.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{account of}} the incident indicated that police, using a megaphone, had ordered protesters to evacuate the area and that some had done so, whereas others remained in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. It added that police only intervened after exhausting all opportunities for dialogue and that lethal shots were fired only at armed protesters who attacked police officers. Security forces reported finding pistols, bullets, large quantities of knives, daggers, swords and other sharp objects, as well as Hezbollah flags at the site.|$|E

50|$|During the crisis, the dacha was {{draped in}} red and black flags, and armed workers came and went. Numerous {{meetings}} were held in the garden. Anarchist speakers urged that all orders and decrees, whether from the Provisional Government or the Soviet, be ignored. The anarchists remained entrenched in <b>the</b> dacha, in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet. After July 1917 the anarchists left Dacha Durnovo, while some other organizations remained for some time.|$|R
5|$|Although the Junta of Seville was defeated, {{a new one}} {{was created}} afterwards, the Regency Council. The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it, but the Royal Audiencia did so in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local authority. The Junta summoned them, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled them to Spain with the pretext {{that there was a}} threat to their lives. The Junta {{appointed}} new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno wrote in the Gazeta that the Audiencia attacked the good faith of the government, and that the Junta left their usual moderation {{for the safety of the}} people.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ordinances.|$|E
5|$|Four locals {{had been}} {{identified}} by the committee as witnessing Cornfoot being killed and being involved in her mistreatment although the three main perpetrators, who had by then left the area, were an Orcadian, a man from Burntisland and a Sea captain's son. A schoolboy, two Englishmen and another person were also implicated but had absconded. The committee determined that Bailie Cook, whose residence the mob had seized Cornfoot from, should carry {{a significant amount of}} the blame. Four males suspected of being present at the murder were held in custody but were released by Cowper in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Privy Council's instruction for them to be taken to Edinburgh for trial.|$|E

25|$|In March 1693/94, John Dryden {{dedicated}} his {{new play}} Love Triumphant to Salisbury. His intention was probably {{to make a}} gesture <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> to <b>the</b> new government, <b>of</b> which Dryden disapproved.|$|R
5|$|In 1467, {{as part of}} his brother's {{plan for}} a closer {{relationship}} with the French, John and Isabelle accompanied Warwick in escorting the French King's envoys to Canterbury. However, by this time, it was being rumoured that Warwick was moving towards supporting the House of Lancaster, as a result of dissatisfaction over the king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville and his pursuit of an anti-French foreign policy. In 1469, Warwick organised Robin of Redesdale's rebellion against Edward IV in Yorkshire and in July that year the king's brother George, Duke of Clarence married Warwick's daughter Isabelle whilst anchored off Calais; this was in direct <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king's own wishes. It seems that Montagu, however, reacted strongly against his brother's machinations, and, unlike him, was satisfied with his current position.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski sailed on {{her third}} and final French voyage on 6 June. The liner arrived at Dakar on 15 June, and sailed the next day for Freetown, where she arrived on 18 June. Likely because of the {{confusion}} surrounding the French surrender on 22 June, Pułaskis movements over the next days are unrecorded, but she was detained at Konakry on 8 July by Vichy authorities. That evening, Pułaskis crew raised steam and sailed the ship out of the harbor in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detainment. After taking fire from shore batteries at Konakry, the ship arrived back at Freetown on 9 July.|$|E
5|$|Since Alvarado's {{supporters}} {{had been}} confirmed {{in the town}} council of Gracias a Dios, and used obscure legalistic arguments to refuse Cáceres' authority, he withdrew to a nearby Indian village and plotted to overthrow the town council. The Spanish infighting encouraged the local Indians in their <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invaders. Cáceres launched a coup at dawn early in 1537, entered Gracias a Dios with twenty well-armed soldiers and imprisoned the town council, including Gonzalo de Alvarado. Cáceres declared Montejo as governor of Honduras-Higueras, and named himself as lieutenant governor and captain-general. He met little opposition from {{the majority of the}} Spanish citizens, and appointed a new town council.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Keon {{publicly}} whipped a {{man called}} George Nugent Reynolds {{and as a result}} was challenged to a duel.

Reynolds was not even armed. Keon was tried for murder at the Leitrim Spring Assizes in 1786, convicted and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered.

5|$|Eventually, Marie becomes {{smitten with}} her target. In <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> Corentin and <b>the</b> Chouans whom she detests, she devises {{a plan to}} marry the Chouan leader.

5|$|The British {{continued}} their policy of stalling Smith. At {{the end of}} August 1965, they did not consider a Rhodesian UDI an immediate threat, and therefore focussed on the colony's maintained <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mother country regarding Reedman and Lisbon. On 30 August, Johnston summarised Britain's stand on the issue for Bottomley's Commonwealth Relations Office. According to his understanding, he said, Rhodesia had been told just before Federal dissolution that it would retain the Federation's former powers regarding external affairs, but that this entrustment was subject to British discretion, {{and could not be}} exercised without extensive prior consultation and conformity to Britain's line.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of Anjouan (code-named Operation Democracy in Comoros), on March 25, 2008, was an amphibious assault {{led by the}} Comoros, backed by African Union (AU) forces, including troops from Sudan, Tanzania, Senegal, along with logistical support from Libya and France. The objective of the invasion was to topple Colonel Mohamed Bacar's leadership in Anjouan, an island part of the Union of Comoros, when he refused to step down after a disputed 2007 election, in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{federal government and the}} AU. The Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean has had a fractious history since independence from France in 1975, experiencing more than 20 coups or attempted coups.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} fell briefly under British rule {{during the}} British invasions of the Río de la Plata. There was looting after the failed resistance, and Alberti hid all the valuable {{things from the}} half-built parish. In <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new British rule, Alberti gave medical aid to the Spanish soldiers and Catholic burials to the deceased, and mailed the Spanish forces with details about the British troops located in the city. As a result, he was jailed. He was released by the British Juan Jaime Backhouse in order to restore religious practices (the invaders {{did not attempt to}} enforce Protestantism in the population), but under military escort. The British would be defeated by Santiago de Liniers, and driven away from the viceroyalty.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The ‘festival’, this {{customary}} {{and very}} Australian institution, has always embraced {{a multiplicity of}} rituals, forms and activities; for it is public in its presentation, participatory in its nature, an embodiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community, and also a carrier of its traditional/long accepted values and beliefs, notably those <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scurrilous and mocking. Recent classification would {{seem to indicate that}} social and class bases enable the (larger) festivals to be put in several categories. Alex Barlow opted to categorize these festivals into eight, seemingly progressively developing, clusters...|$|R
50|$|Hugh disliked {{dealing with}} the various factions in <b>the</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> Jerusalem, and left for Cyprus in 1276 in disgust at their <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> his authority. <b>The</b> next year, his bailiff, Balian of Ibelin, Lord of Arsuf, was ejected by Roger <b>of</b> Sanseverino, <b>the</b> bailiff <b>of</b> Charles of Anjou, who had {{purchased}} <b>the</b> claim <b>of</b> Mary <b>of</b> Antioch. <b>The</b> kingdom remained under Angevin control for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> Hugh's reign.|$|R
2500|$|Makiguchi, as did Nichiren, {{attributed}} the political troubles Japan was experiencing to supposedly false religious doctrines that held sway. His religious beliefs motivated {{him to take}} a stand against the government, earning him a reputation as a political dissident. He regarded Nichiren Buddhism as religious motivation for [...] "active engagement to promote social good, even if it led to <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> state authority". <b>The</b> organization soon attracted <b>the</b> attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authorities.|$|R
5|$|Vietnamese and French {{historians have}} {{fiercely}} debated Định's choice {{to disregard the}} treaty. The effectiveness of Định's insurgency led French officials to claim that Tự Đức was secretly assisting him, thereby violating the treaty, a pretext the French used to seize three more provinces in 1867. Vietnamese records dispute this, contending that Tự Đức attempted to ensure Định's compliance with the treaty. Định's <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor has led historians to debate whether his actions were motivated by {{a rejection of the}} monarch's authority or whether he disobeyed in an attempt to help Tự Đức. Định remains widely respected among Vietnamese of all political persuasions. During the Vietnam War, communist historians sought to portray the Việt Cộng as Định's modern successor.|$|E
5|$|Having {{seen the}} court through the Old Court-New Court controversy, Chief Justice Boyle {{resigned}} in 1826. In December 1828, Mills and Owsley also resigned. Their resignations were {{an attempt to}} silence criticism from the defeated New Court faction that they held their seats in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> will of the people. Old Court supporters hoped both men would be re-nominated and re-confirmed by the legislature, making the New Court's charge less credible. Accordingly, newly elected governor Thomas Metcalfe submitted both men to the legislature for confirmation, but the nominations were defeated in the state senate. Thus ended Owsley's tenure on the court. It was, at the time, the longest tenure of any Court of Appeals justice except John Boyle. Owsley returned to his legal practice, and his case load soon compelled him to move to Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|In 1613, {{his sister}} Elizabeth married Frederick V, Elector Palatine, {{and moved to}} Heidelberg. In 1617, the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, a Catholic, was elected king of Bohemia. The {{following}} year, the Bohemians rebelled, defenestrating the Catholic governors. In August 1619, the Bohemian diet chose as their monarch FrederickV, who was leader of the Protestant Union, while Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor in the imperial election. Frederick's acceptance of the Bohemian crown in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor {{marked the beginning of}} the turmoil that would develop into the Thirty Years' War. The conflict, originally confined to Bohemia, spiralled into a wider European war, which the English Parliament and public quickly grew to see as a polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants. In 1620, Charles's brother-in-law, Frederick V, was defeated at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague and his hereditary lands in the Electoral Palatinate were invaded by a Habsburg force from the Spanish Netherlands. James, however, had been seeking marriage between the new Prince of Wales and Ferdinand's niece, Habsburg princess Maria Anna of Spain, and began to see the Spanish match as a possible diplomatic means of achieving peace in Europe.|$|E
