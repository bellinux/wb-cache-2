60|$|How ungenerous, {{and even}} cruel, {{it is to}} reproach or ridicule a child for stupidity, is evident when we reflect that any {{supposed}} inferiority in his mental organization can not, by any possibility, be his fault. The question what degree of natural intelligence he shall be endowed with, in comparison with other children, is determined, not by himself, but by his Creator, and depends, probably, upon conditions of organization in his cerebral system as much beyond his control as any thing abnormal in the features of his face, or blindness, or deafness, or any other physical disadvantage. The child who shows any indications of inferiority to others {{in any of these}} respects should be the object of his parent's or his teacher's special tenderness and care. If he is near-sighted, give him, at school, a seat as convenient as possible to the blackboard or the map. If he is hard of hearing, place him near the teacher; and for reasons precisely analogous, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> him to be of inferior capacity, help him gently and tenderly in every possible way. Do every thing in your power to encourage him, and to conceal his deficiencies both from others and from himself, so far as these objects can be attained consistently with the general good of the family or of the school.|$|E
6000|$|A {{necessity}} is upon me now--as at most times--of wandering {{about in}} my old wild way, to think. I could no more resist this on Sunday or yesterday than a man can dispense with food, or a horse can help himself from being driven. I hold my inventive capacity on the stern condition that it must master my whole life, often have complete possession of me, make its own demands upon me, and sometimes, for months together, put everything else away from me. If I had not known long ago that my place could never be held, unless I were at any moment ready to devote myself to it entirely, I should have dropped out of it very soon. All this I can hardly expect you to understand--or the restlessness and waywardness of an author's mind. You have {{never seen it before}} you, or lived with it, or had occasion to think or care about it, and you cannot have the necessary consideration for it. [...] "It is only half-an-hour,"--"It is only an afternoon,"--"It is only an evening," [...] people say to me over and over again; but they don't know {{that it is impossible to}} command one's self sometimes to any stipulated and set disposal of five minutes,--or that the mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes worry a whole day. These are the penalties paid for writing books. Whoever is devoted to an art must be content to deliver himself wholly up to it, and to find his recompense in it. I am grieved <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> me of not wanting to see you, but I can't help it; I must go my way whether or no.|$|E

Think of your cold behaviour to me, sir, and you will hardly wonder at my unwillingness to destroy the only claim on your confidence and your gratitude which it was my fortune to possess.|$|R

50|$|The deadly webcap and the fool's webcap both {{contain the}} toxin orellanin and orellin, orellinin and Cortinarin A,B,C. A {{characteristic}} of orellanin poisoning is the long latency; the first symptoms usually don't appear until 2-3 days after ingestion and can {{in some cases}} {{take as long as}} 3 weeks. The first symptoms of orellanin poisoning are similar to the common flu (nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, headaches, etc.). These symptoms are followed by early stages of renal failure (immense thirst, frequent urination, pain on and around the kidneys), and eventually decreased or nonexistent urine output and other symptoms of renal failure occur. If left untreated, death will follow. There is no known antidote against orellanin poisoning, but early hospitalization and treatment can sometimes prevent serious injuries and usually prevent death. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>suspect</b> orellanin poisoning, seek emergency medical attention.|$|E
5000|$|... ‘Ayyāsh ibn Abī Rabī‘ah {{was one of}} the {{paternal}} cousins of ‘Amr ibn Hishām as well as his maternal brother. ‘Ayyāsh {{was among}} the early Muslim converts who emigrated to Madīnah before Muhammad. Abu Jahl devised a plan to bring him back to Makkah. Accordingly, he went to Madīnah with his brother Ḥārith and told ‘Ayyāsh a deceptive story about his mother’s illness as a decoy only to provoke his emotion. Abu Jahl also lied about his mother’s making an oath that she would neither sit in the shade nor comb her hair until she saw ‘Ayyāsh again. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb tried to warn him by saying [...] "This is nothing but an attempt of the people to seduce you from your religion so beware of them; for, by Allah, if lice were causing your mother trouble she would use her comb, and if the heat of Mecca oppressed her she would take shelter from it." [...] But ‘Ayyāsh said, [...] "I will clear my mother from her oath; also I have some money there which I can get." [...] ‘Umar told him that he {{was one of the}} richest of the Quraysh and he could have half his money if he refused to go with the two men. But when ‘Umar saw that he was determined to go he said, [...] "If you must go, then take this camel of mine. She is well bred and easy to ride.

40|$|Imagine {{living in}} a house {{where there is no}} food. This house has no pantry, no cupboards, indeed, no kitchen either. Three times a day a truck arrives to deliver {{ready-made}} food.

Imagine how frightened you’d be <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>suspected</b> someone had access to the system who did not have your health and well-being in mind (or worse, looked upon you as an enemy.) Think of how you would never have that cozy, secure feeling you get when someone is baking or cooking a nice stew. Crazy, right? For house substitute community, and for kitchen substitute farm. Imagine how it would be to live in a community with no farms. We’d be 100 % dependent on trucked-in food and we’d never see cows grazing, carrots growing, hay being mowed, or any number of farm scenes. Our children would not have the opportunity to visit the new lambs or discover the joys of digging potatoes from the earth, as if discovering gold.
