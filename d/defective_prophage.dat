40|$|Bacteriophages {{are major}} genetic factors {{promoting}} horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between bacteria. Their roles in dynamic bacterial genome evolution have been increasingly {{highlighted by the}} fact that many sequenced bacterial genomes contain multiple prophages carrying a wide range of genes. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O 157 is the most striking case. A sequenced strain (O 157 Sakai) possesses 18 prophages (Sp 1 –Sp 18) that encode numerous genes related to O 157 virulence, including those for two potent cytotoxins, Shiga toxins (Stx) 1 and 2. However, most of these prophages appeared to contain multiple genetic defects. To understand whether these <b>defective</b> <b>prophages</b> have the potential to act as mobile genetic elements to spread virulence determinants, we looked closely at the Sp 1 –Sp 18 sequences, defined the genetic defects of each Sp, and then systematically analyzed all Sps for their biological activities. We show that many of the <b>defective</b> <b>prophages,</b> including the Stx 1 phage, are inducible and released from O 157 cells as particulate DNA. In fact, some prophages can even be transferred to other E. coli strains. We also show that new Stx 1 phages are generated by recombination between the Stx 1 and Stx 2 phage genomes. The results indicate that these <b>defective</b> <b>prophages</b> are not simply genetic remnants generated in the course of O 157 evolution, but rather genetic elements with a high potential for disseminating virulence-related genes and other genetic traits to other bacteria.

40|$|Prophage Lrm 1 was induced with {{mitomycin}} C from {{an industrial}} Lactobacillus rhamnosus starter culture, M 1. Electron microscopy of the lysate revealed relatively few intact bacteriophage particles among empty heads and disassociated tails. The defective Siphoviridae phage had an isometric head of approximately 55 nm and noncontractile tail of about 275 nm {{with a small}} baseplate. In repeated attempts, the prophage could not be cured from L. rhamnosus M 1, nor could a sensitive host be identified. Sequencing of the phage Lrm 1 DNA revealed a genome of 39, 989 bp and a G+C content of 45. 5 %. A similar genomic organization and mosaic pattern of identities align Lrm 1 among the closely related Lactobacillus casei temperate phages A 2, ΦAT 3, and LcaI and with L. rhamnosus virulent phage Lu-Nu. Of the 54 open reading frames (ORFs) identified, all but 8 shared homology with other phages of this group.

DLP 12 (<b>Defective</b> Lambdoid <b>Prophage</b> inserted in the 12 th minute) is one of four defective lambdoid phages found in E. coli K 12 chromosome. The DLP 12 region encodes for putative holin (SDLP 12), a putative lysozyme (RDLP 12) and a putative endopeptidase (RzDLP 12), which are all highly homologous to their counterparts in phage 21. Lambdoid homologs of these three genes facilitate the degradation of peptidoglycan causing cell lysis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymer made up of sugars and peptides. It is the main structural component of the bacterial cell wall. Although sturdy and highly resistant to turgor pressure, peptidoglycan must be a dynamic structure in order to allow cell growth and division. Thus, the regulation of peptidoglycan metabolism is critical and the enzymes involved in the process of peptidoglycan turnover must be tightly regulated in order to prevent unwanted cell lysis. Although recent work has shown that RDLP 12 encodes an active lysozyme capable of degrading gram positive and gram negative peptidoglycan, its physiological role in E. coli K 12 is unclear. We therefore constructed mutants of rDLP 12 and the other DLP 12 lysis gene in PHL 628, an E. coli K 12 derivative that over expresses curli, and found that the mutants had altered peptidoglycan metabolism. The mutants incorporated less exogenous N-acetylglucosamine into their peptidoglycan and released little or no peptidoglycan degradation products to the supernatant (Chapter 2). We also found that the DLP 12 lysis genes play a main role in ?E mediated early stationary phase cell lysis. Consistent with effects on the cell wall, the mutants produced less curli which in turn affected cell-to-cell and cell-to-surface interactions and therefore biofilm formation (Chapter 3). We also found that normal transcription of the lysis genes appeared to be controlled by a putative antiterminator QDLP 12 (Chapter 4). Antiterminators are transcriptional regulators which act on RNA polymerase holoenzyme to allow it to read through terminator sequences. In lambdoid phages the antiterminator Q is required for {sigma}D mediated transcription of the late genes, including the lysis genes. Interestingly, we obtained preliminary evidence that QDLP 12 is required for {sigma}E mediated transcription of the lysis genes and that mutants of qDLP 12 showed a similar phenotype to that observed in mutants for the DLP 12 lysis genes (see above). In the following chapters we describe the implications of DLP 12 genes for the physiology of E. coli and conclude that E. coli has co-opted these otherwise lethal genes for its own benefit...|$|R

40|$|One {{hundred and}} ten amber mutants of {{coliphage}} P 1 were isolated and localized into groups {{with respect to}} the existing genetic map by use of nonpermissive Escherichia coli K- 12 strains lysogenic for P 1 with deletions. These lysogens contain one of three types of deletion prophages: P 1 cry and its derivatives, P 1 dlacs, and P 1 dpros. Fourteen such lysogens were tested for their ability to rescue the amber mutants which were then assigned to one of nine deletion segments of the P 1 genome defined by the termini of the various prophage deletions. The relationship of the nine deletion segments with the published P 1 map is described, two new segments having been added. The deletions of the 14 prophages overlapped sufficiently to indicate that the P 1 genetic prophage map should be represented in circular form, which is consistent with the fact that P 1 is normally a circular plasmid in the prophage state. The distribution of mutants into deletion segments is nonrandom for at least one segment.

Two portions of the 1030 (-) tox- chromosome, 35 and 30. 5 kilobases long which contain, respectively, the entire region homologous to corynephage omega tox+ and the attB 1 -attB 2 sites, were mapped with the restriction endonucleases BamHI and EcoRI. Chromosomal DNA from 1030 (-) tox- was shown to contain a 15. 5 -kilobase region that was homologous to ca. 42 % of the corynephage omega tox+ genome.

40|$|Earlier, we {{discovered}} that the global regulator, Hha, is related to cell death in biofilms and regulates cryptic prophage genes. Here, we show that Hha induces excision of prophages, CP 4 - 57 and DLP 12, by inducing excision genes and by reducing SsrA synthesis. SsrA is a tmRNA that is important for rescuing stalled ribosomes, contains an attachment site for CP 4 - 57 and is shown here to be required for CP 4 - 57 excision. These prophages impact biofilm development, as the deletion of 35 genes individually of prophages, CP 4 - 57 and DLP 12, increase biofilm formation up to 17 -fold, and five genes decrease biofilm formation up to sixfold. In addition, CP 4 - 57 excises during early biofilm development but not in planktonic cells, whereas DLP 12 excision was detected at all the developmental stages for both biofilm and planktonic cells. CP 4 - 57 excision leads to a chromosome region devoid of prophage and {{to the formation of}} a phage circle (which is lost). These results were corroborated by a whole-transcriptome analysis that showed that complete loss of CP 4 - 57 activated the expression of the flg, flh and flimotility operons and repressed expression of key enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and of enzymes for lactate utilization. Prophage excision also results in the expression of cell lysis genes that reduce cell viability (for example, alpA, intA and intD).

40|$|A {{recombination}} {{system has}} been developed for efficient chromosome engineering in Escherichia coli by using electroporated linear DNA. A defective λ prophage supplies functions that protect and recombine an electroporated linear DNA substrate in the bacterial cell. The use of recombination eliminates the requirement for standard cloning as all novel joints are engineered by chemical synthesis in vitro and the linear DNA is efficiently recombined into place in vivo. The technology and manipulations required are simple and straightforward. A temperature-dependent repressor tightly controls prophage expression, and, thus, recombination functions can be transiently supplied by shifting cultures to 42 °C for 15 min. The efficient prophage recombination system does not require host RecA function and depends primarily on Exo, Beta, and Gam functions expressed from the defective λ prophage. The <b>defective</b> <b>prophage</b> can be moved to other strains and can be easily removed from any strain.

40|$|Abstract Background Many sequenced {{bacterial}} genomes harbor phage-like elements or cryptic prophages. These elements {{have been}} implicated in pathogenesis, serotype conversion and phage immunity. The e 14 element is a <b>defective</b> lambdoid <b>prophage</b> element present at 25 min in the E. coli K- 12 genome. This prophage encodes important functional genes such as lit (T 4 exclusion), mcrA (modified cytosine restriction activity) and pin (recombinase). Results Bioinformatic analysis of the e 14 prophage sequence shows the modular nature of the e 14 element which shares {{a large part of}} its sequence with the Shigella flexneri phage SfV. Based on this similarity, the regulatory region including the repressor and Cro proteins and their binding sites were identified. The protein product of b 1149 was found to be a fusion of a replication protein and a terminase. The genes b 1143, b 1151 and b 1152 were identified as putative pseudogenes. A number of duplications of the stfE tail fibre gene of the e 14 are seen in plasmid p 15 B. A protein based comparative approach using the COG database as a starting point helped detect lambdoid prophage like elements in a representative set of completely sequenced genomes. Conclusions The e 14 element was characterized for the function of its encoded genes, the regulatory regions, replication origin and homology with other phage and bacterial sequences. Comparative analysis at nucleotide and protein levels suggest that a number of important phage related functions are missing in the e 14 genome including parts of the early left operon, early right operon and late operon. The loss of these genes is the result of at least three major deletions that have occurred on e 14 since its integration.

40|$|Excision of transposable genetic {{elements}} from host DNA {{is different from}} the classical prophage lambda type of excision in that it occurs at low frequency and is mostly imprecise; only a minority of excision events restores the wild-type host sequences. In bacteriophage Mu, a highly efficient transposon, imprecise excision is 10 – 100 times more frequent than precise excision. We have examined a large number of these excision events by starting with Mucts X mutants located in the Z gene of the lac operon of Escherichia coli. Mucts X mutants are <b>defective</b> <b>prophages</b> whose excision occurs at a measurable frequency. Imprecise excision was monitored by selecting for melibiose+ (Mel+) phenotype, which requires only a functioning lacY gene. Mel+ revertants exhibit an array of DNA rearrangements and fall in four main classes, the predominant one being comprised of revertants that have no detectable Mu DNA. Most of these revertants can further revert to Lac+. Perhaps 5 base-pair duplications, originally present at prophage-host junctions, are left in these lacZ-Y+ revertants, and they can be further repaired to lacZ+. Another class has, in addition to the loss of Mu DNA, deletions that extend generally, but not always, to only one side of the prophage. The other two classes of revertants, surprisingly, still have Mu DNA in the lacZ gene. One class has deletions in the Z gene, whereas, no deletions can be detected in the other. Many of the revertants in the last class can further revert to lacZ+, indicating that the lacY gene must have been turned on by a rearrangement within Mu DNA. Apparently, all of the detectable precise and most of the imprecise excision events require functioning of the Mu A gene. We suggest that a block in large-scale Mu replication allows the excision process to proceed...|$|R
40|$|Plasmid profiles, the {{location}} of cholera toxin subunit A genes, {{and the presence of}} the <b>defective</b> VcA 1 <b>prophage</b> genome in classical Vibrio cholerae isolated from patients in Bangladesh in 1982 were compared with those in older classical strains isolated during the sixth pandemic and with those in selected eltor and nontoxigenic O 1 isolates. Classical strains typically had two plasmids (21 and 3 megadaltons), eltor strains typically had no plasmids, and nontoxigenic O 1 strains had zero to three plasmids. The old and new isolates of classical V. cholerae had two HindIII chromosomal digest fragments containing cholera toxin subunit A genes, whereas the eltor strains from Eastern countries had one fragment. The eltor strains from areas surrounding the Gulf of Mexico also had two subunit A gene fragments, which were smaller and easily distinguished from the classical pattern. All classical strains had 8 to 10 HindIII fragments containing the <b>defective</b> VcA 1 <b>prophage</b> genome; none of the Eastern eltor strains had these genes, and the Gulf Coast eltor strains contained a different array of weakly hybridizing genes. These data suggest that the recent isolates of classical cholera in Bangladesh are closely related to the bacterial strain(s) which caused classical cholera during the sixth pandemic. These data do not support hypotheses that either the eltor or the nontoxigenic O 1 strains are precursors of the new classical strains...|$|R
40|$|Plasmids pNov 1 and pNov 1 s, coding for {{resistance}} {{and sensitivity to}} novobiocin, respectively, were readily lost from wild-type Haemophilus influenzae but retained in a strain lacking an inducible <b>defective</b> <b>prophage.</b> The plasmid loss could be partly or wholly eliminated by a low-copy-number mutation in the plasmid or {{by the presence of}} certain antibiotic resistance markers in the host chromosome. Release of both phage HP 1 c 1, measured by plaque assay, and defective phage, measured by electron microscopy, was increased when the plasmids were present. The frequency of recombination between pNov 1 and the chromosome, causing the plasmid to be converted to pNov 1 s, could under some circumstances be decreased from the normal 60 to 70 % to below 10 % by the presence of a kanamycin resistance marker in the chromosome. This suggested that a gene product coded for by the plasmid, the expression of which was affected by the kanamycin resistance marker, was responsible for the high recombination frequency. Evidence was obtained from in vitro experiments that the gene product was a gyrase...|$|E
40|$|Serratia entomophila and Serratia proteamaculans (Enterobacteriaceae) cause amber {{disease in}} the grass grub Costelytra zealandica (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), an {{important}} pasture pest in New Zealand. Larval disease symptoms include cessation of feeding, clearance of the gut, amber coloration, and eventual death. A 155 -kb plasmid, pADAP, carries the genes sepA, sepB, and sepC, which are essential for production of amber disease symptoms. Transposon insertions {{in any of the}} sep genes in pADAP abolish gut clearance but not cessation of feeding, indicating the presence of an antifeeding gene(s) elsewhere on pADAP. Based on deletion analysis of pADAP and subsequent sequence data, a 47 -kb clone was constructed, which when placed in either an Escherichia coli or a Serratia background exerted strong antifeeding activity and often led to rapid death of the infected grass grub larvae. Sequence data show that the antifeeding component is part of a large gene cluster that may form a <b>defective</b> <b>prophage</b> and that six potential members of this prophage are present in Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii TTO 1, a species which also has sep gene homologues...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTemperate {{bacteriophage}} lytic {{development is}} intrinsically {{related to the}} stress response in particular at the DNA replication and virion maturation steps. Alternatively, temperate phages become lysogenic and integrate their genome into the host chromosome. Under stressful conditions, the prophage resumes a lytic development program, and the phage DNA is excised before being replicated. The KplE 1 <b>defective</b> <b>prophage</b> of Escherichia coli K 12 constitutes a model system because it is fully competent for integrative as well as excisive recombination and presents an atypical recombination module, which is conserved in various phage genomes. In this work, we identified the host-encoded stress-responsive molecular chaperone DnaJ (Hsp 40) as {{an active participant in}} KplE 1 prophage excision. We first show that the recombination directionality factor TorI of KplE 1 specifically interacts with DnaJ. In addition, we found that DnaJ dramatically enhances both TorI binding to its DNA target and excisive recombination in vitro. Remarkably, such stimulatory effect by DnaJ was performed independently of its DnaK chaperone partner and did not requirea functional DnaJ J-domain. Taken together, our results underline a novel and unsuspected functional interaction between the generic host stress-regulated chaperone and temperate bacteriophage lysogenic development...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Comparison of two <b>defective</b> h <b>prophages</b> {{carried by}} strains of Eschm-ichia coli, {{with respect to}} their {{physiological}} properties following induction, has revealed that one defective mutant (A i 2) can multiply normally as vegetative phage but cannot mature into normal infectious phage, whereas the other defective phage (A i l) can undergo only limited multiplication since it is unstable in the vegetative state. Consideration of the properties of h i l has led to an hypothesis that radiation induction causes the prophage to produce a vegetative replica which becomes autonomous rather than conversion of the prophage into vegetative phage. Lysogenic strains of Escherichia coli containing defective forms of the bacterio-phage h have been investigated by Appleyard (1954, 1956) and by Jacob & Wollman (1956). They are distinguished by an almost total failure to liberate healthy phage following induction, and Appleyard (1956) showed that the defect may be transmitted by extracellular defective phage. The phage genes responsible for the defects resemble the recessive lethal genes of higher organisms; induction by ultraviolet irradiation of a doubly lysogenic strain...|$|R
40|$|The genomes {{of various}} {{eubacteria}} {{were analyzed by}} Southern blot hybridization to detect sequences related to the segment of the <b>defective</b> lambdoid <b>prophage</b> Kim which encodes DicF RNA, an antisense inhibitor of cell division gene ftsZ in Escherichia coli K- 12. Among the homologous sequences found, one fragment from E. coli B, similar {{to a piece of}} Rac prophage, and two fragments from Shigella flexneri were cloned and sequenced. dicF-like elements similar to transcriptional terminators were found in each sequence, but unlike dicF these had no effect on division in E. coli K- 12. Like dicF, these sequences are flanked by secondary structures which form potential sites for RNase III recognition. Coding sequences located upstream from the dicF-like feature in E. coli B are related to gene sieB of bacteriophage lambda, while sequences downstream of the S. flexneri elements are similar to the immunity region of satellite bacteriophage P 4. Under hybridization conditions in which only strong sequence homologies were detected in E. coli B and S. flexneri, the genomes of a large variety of microorganisms, including some gram-positive bacteria, hybridized to the dicF probe. Our results suggest that dicF and its flanking regions are markers of a widespread family of prophage-like elements of different origins...|$|R
40|$|Recombineering, in vivo genetic {{engineering}} with bacteriophage homologous recombination systems, {{is a powerful}} technique for making genetic modifications in bacteria. Two systems widely used in Escherichia coli are the Red system from phage λ and RecET from the <b>defective</b> Rac <b>prophage.</b> We investigated the in vivo dependence of recombineering on DNA replication of the recombining substrate using plasmid targets. For λ Red recombination, when DNA replication of a circular target plasmid is prevented, recombination with single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides is greatly reduced compared to that under replicating conditions. For RecET recombination, when DNA replication of the targeted plasmid is prevented, the recombination frequency is also reduced, to a level identical to that seen for the Red system {{in the absence of}} replication. The very low level of oligonucleotide recombination observed {{in the absence of any}} phage recombination functions is the same in the presence or absence of DNA replication. In contrast, both the Red and RecET systems recombine a nonreplicating linear dimer plasmid with high efficiency to yield a circular monomer. Therefore, the DNA replication requirement is substrate dependent. Our data are consistent with recombination by both the Red and RecET systems occurring predominately by single-strand annealing rather than by strand invasion...|$|R
