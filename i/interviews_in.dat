5|$|The Matty Johns Show was pitched as a family-friendly {{variety show}} {{based on the}} National Rugby League (NRL) competition. It is {{primarily}} aimed at New South Wales and Queensland audiences (in which NRL is the dominant football code). The show features many comedy sketches, recurring characters and celebrity <b>interviews</b> <b>in</b> a variety format. This mixture has resulted in criticism from some media observers for a perceived lack of serious football analysis. Sports website The Roar notes that the show appears {{to be made to}} slick (and expensive) production values.|$|E

5|$|The defense {{relied on}} the {{provision}} of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President {{had the right to}} test the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of <b>interviews</b> <b>in</b> April, he complied.|$|E

5|$|The show's {{official}} website released, {{just prior to}} the San Diego Comic-Con in 2010, a motion comic based on Issue No. 1 of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr.

5|$|Yousafzai {{was born}} in Mingora, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Her family came to run a chain of schools in the region. Considering Jinnah and Benazir Bhutto as her role models, she was {{particularly}} inspired by her father's thoughts and humanitarian work. In early 2009, when she was 11–12, she wrote a blog under a pseudonym for the BBC Urdu detailing her life during the Taliban occupation of Swat. The following summer, journalist Adam B. Ellick made a New York Times documentary about her life as the Pakistani military intervened in the region. She rose in prominence, giving <b>interviews</b> <b>in</b> print and on television, and she was nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize by activist Desmond Tutu.|$|E
5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style <b>interviews,</b> <b>in</b> which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E

5|$|Boycott's {{eight seasons}} of {{captaincy}} were among Yorkshire's least successful. The club {{failed to win}} any competitions and ranked low in the Championship table, in contrast to their one-time dominance of English cricket. The {{beginning of the end}} of his captaincy came after BBC Radio Leeds <b>interviews</b> <b>in</b> which two Yorkshire committee members and former players, Don Brennan and Mel Ryan, said that a change in leadership was needed. Boycott himself did not suffer a loss of form to mirror that of his county; in his first year as captain, he scored 2,503runs at an average of 100.12, included a century in his first match as captain. His success was cited by Trueman as evidence that his selfish nature was harming Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone {{agreed to}} meet Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin President and IRA-supporter, after Adams was invited to London by Labour members of the Troops Out {{campaign}} in December 1982. The same day as the invitation was made, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) bombed The Droppin Well bar in Ballykelly, County Londonderry, killing 11 soldiers and 6 civilians; in the aftermath, Livingstone was pressured to cancel the meeting. Expressing his horror at the bombing, Livingstone insisted that the meeting proceed, for Adams had no connection with the INLA, but Conservative Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw banned Adams' entry to Britain with the 1976 Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act. In February 1983, Livingstone visited Adams in his constituency of West Belfast, receiving a hero's welcome from local republicans. In July 1983, Adams finally came to London on the invite of Livingstone and MP Jeremy Corbyn, allowing him to present his views to a mainstream British audience through televised <b>interviews.</b> <b>In</b> August, Livingstone was interviewed on Irish state radio, proclaiming that Britain's 800-year occupation of Ireland was more destructive than the Holocaust; he was publicly criticised by Labour members and the press. He also controversially expressed solidarity with the Marxist–Leninist government of Fidel Castro in Cuba against the U.S. economic embargo, in turn receiving an annual Christmas gift of Cuban rum from the Cuban embassy.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{retired from}} public life after resigning as Secretary of State. Except for one day, Sherman {{had spent the}} {{previous}} forty-two years, four months, and twenty-two days in government service. He gave a few <b>interviews</b> <b>in</b> which he disagreed with the administration's policy of annexing Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Later that year, his wife, Margaret, had a stroke; she died two years later on June 5, 1900. Sherman continued to alternate between houses in Mansfield and Washington. He mostly remained out of politics, except for a letter he wrote endorsing George K. Nash for Governor of Ohio in 1899. Sherman died at his Washington home on October 22, 1900, {{in the company of}} his daughter, relatives and friends. After a funeral at St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, he was interred in Mansfield City Cemetery with his wife.|$|E

5|$|Terry-Thomas {{spent part}} of 1961 in America, filming the role of Professor Bruce Patterson in Bachelor Flat—his first Hollywood role—before flying to Gibraltar to film Operation Snatch, in which he teamed up with Lionel Jeffries. By the end of 1961 Terry-Thomas was {{appearing}} on radio, in guest spots on American television shows, such as the December broadcast of The Bing Crosby Show, and was frequently the subject of US newspaper <b>interviews.</b> <b>In</b> 1962 Bachelor Flat and Operation Snatch were both released, and were followed by two more films: a large-budget biopic from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer called The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm, in which Terry-Thomas shared his scenes with the American comedian Buddy Hackett, and Kill or Cure, in which he appeared with Sykes, a friend since they worked together in Large as Life.|$|E
5|$|The split and, due to {{the open}} letter's allegations, Turunen's {{character}} {{became the subject of}} close media coverage. Turunen responded through an open letter on her website and through some <b>interviews</b> <b>in</b> which she explained her view. She was upset that after nine years of working together, Holopainen announced the separation via an open letter. Because of the continuing media interest, Marcelo Cabuli posted a message addressing the situation on the website in February 2006. He asked that anyone who had questions should email him. In June 2006, Cabuli posted a lengthy reply to many of the questions he had received. He answered questions related to the greed accusation by explaining that the band had agreed on the distribution of earnings in a contract at the formation of Nightwish. Based on that contract, every band member got a fixed share of 20% of the band's income. Marcelo Cabuli stated that, unlike others, Turunen had never fought for additional songwriter royalties.|$|E
