5|$|Fleming made {{a number}} of revelations about Bond's {{character}} within the book, including showing an emotional side that was not present in the previous stories. In common with Fleming's other Bond stories, he used the names and places of people he knew or <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> and Blofeld's research station on Piz Gloria was based on Schloss Mittersill, which the Nazis had turned into a research establishment examining the Asiatic races.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did {{this because he}} <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated {{over what to do}} while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.|$|E
5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> {{an animal}} that they came to call the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi {{was some sort of}} rainforest zebra.|$|E

5|$|In 1875 no one {{living outside}} {{of two or}} three back streets of Lynn <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Christian Science. Now, the very name is a catch phrase. In those early days the leader and teacher paid out half of her ten dollars a week to hire a hall, {{patching}} out the rest of her living with precarious fees as an instructor in mental healing; now, {{she is one of the}} richest women in the United States. She is more than that—she is the most powerful American woman.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, Barrett {{instructed}} Colonel David Branson of the 34th Indiana Veteran Volunteer Infantry {{to attack}} the Confederate encampment at Brazos Santiago Depot near Fort Brown. Barrett commanded the 62nd United States Colored Infantry and the 2nd Texas Cavalry, and advanced towards Fort Brown {{with the intention of}} reoccupying Brownsville with Union forces thinking they would not encounter any problems, assuming all the Confederates surely <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Lee's surrender by this time. To their surprise they encountered Confederates that did not know of Lee's surrender.|$|E
5|$|Pitts and Tuck renamed {{their product}} from Spacewar to Galaxy Game due to anti-war {{sentiment}} and founded {{a company called}} Mini-Computer Applications in June 1971 to operate the game as it neared completion. The development of the prototype machine took around {{three and a half}} months. By August, they were well into development and had gotten permission to place the machine at the Tresidder student union building at Stanford as a test site. It was then that they received a call from Nolan Bushnell, who <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> their project and wanted to show them his similar project he was working on.|$|E

5|$|Some {{versions}} of the original Soulcalibur arcade game censored Ivy's default costume by covering her bare skin with a lavender catsuit. With Soulcalibur IV, Ivy's look on the promotional artwork was modified on the English website to hide her undercleavage, leading to suspicion of censorship in the American release of the game. When asked about the censoring, director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> {{nothing of the sort}} having taken place. When released in North America it was shown that no actual censorship had occurred within the game.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado {{arrived at}} Buena Esperanza {{in the middle}} of its abandonment. His sudden {{appearance}} halted the exodus, and many colonists who had already left returned. Cerezeda sent messages from Naco, imploring Alvarado to take over as governor of the province. The town council joined in session and installed Alvarado as justicia mayor (chief judge), and as captain-general of Honduras-Higueras until the Crown appointed someone else, or confirmed him in his post. Alvarado's presence turned Spanish morale around overnight. The factions that had plagued the colonial government dissipated, and the colonists rallied around the new governor. Alvarado, known to the natives by his Nahuatl nickname Tonatiuh, had a fearsome reputation amongst the indigenous population, who <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> his ruthless exploits elsewhere. Alvarado rapidly re-established firm Spanish control over the area around Buena Esperanza and founded a military encampment in Tencoa. He successfully established profitable gold and silver mines in Higueras.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of these}} Arab raids, an {{invasion}} under a certain Maimun al-Gurgunami ("Maimun the Mardaite") took place, which raided Cilicia and was defeated by a Byzantine army under a general named Marianus near Tyana. The dating of this expedition is unclear; although the primary account, by al-Baladhuri, places it under Abd al-Malik (who died in 705), it is commonly dated to 706 by modern scholars. According to Baladhuri, this Maimun had been a slave of Caliph Muawiyah's sister, who had fled to the Mardaites, a group of Christian rebels in northern Syria. After the Mardaites had been subdued, the general Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, who <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> his valour, liberated him and entrusted him with a military command, and later swore to avenge his death.|$|E

5|$|Only {{days after}} the breakup, Tweedy decided {{to form a new}} group. He was able to retain the lineup of Uncle Tupelo sans Farrar, and rechristened the band Wilco. In mid-May, the band began to rehearse songs in the office of band manager Tony Margherita, and hired {{producer}} Brian Paulson, who produced Anodyne. Wilco first recorded demo tracks for the album at Easley studio in Memphis, Tennessee, in June. Stirratt recommended the studio based on previous experience as a member of The Hilltops, and Tweedy <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the studio through a Jon Spencer Blues Explosion recording. Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, signed Jeff Tweedy after hearing the tapes, and recording for the album continued through August.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's fame {{reached its}} first peak in Austria and Germany before World War I, {{helped by the}} {{publication}} of his letters in three volumes in 1914. His letters are expressive and literate, and have been described as among the foremost 19th-century writings of their kind. These began a compelling mythology of Van Gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young. In 1934, the novelist Irving Stone wrote a biographical novel of Van Gogh's life titled Lust for Life, based on Van Gogh's letters to Theo. This novel and the 1956 film further enhanced his fame, especially in the United States where Stone surmised only a few hundred people <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> van Gogh prior to his surprise best-selling book.|$|E
5|$|Cerezeda finally set {{out with}} his {{expedition}} to the interior but was forced to return when Díaz de Herrera attempted to abandon Trujillo, taking all the colonists with him. Trujillo was now {{at the point of}} collapse; the Spanish lacked essential provisions, and although more Spanish soldiers had come to Honduras than were needed to overthrow Peru, the bitter Spanish infighting had resulted in the almost complete collapse of the colony. Trujillo was the only Spanish settlement left in the territory, and possessed less than 200 Spanish inhabitants. The Spanish assaults upon the native population had wreaked havoc upon them, but failed to successfully conquer any territory outside the immediate environs of Trujillo. The native population level collapsed, with many Indians being sold as slaves to supply the workforce on the plantations of the Caribbean islands. In 1533, an epidemic swept through the natives within the reduced Spanish area of control, killing half their number. The encomienda system was dysfunctional in the colony, with little tribute, and no rich mines of silver or gold. Many colonists <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the riches to be had in Peru, and threatened to leave. By 1534, the only richly inhabited native region left was the Naco valley; in desperation, Cerezeda once again planned to move the colony west to Naco.|$|E

5|$|In 112, Zhang {{was summoned}} {{to the court of}} Emperor An (r.106–125), who <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> his {{expertise}} in mathematics. When he was nominated to serve at the capital, Zhang was escorted by carriage—a symbol of his official status—to Luoyang, where he became a court gentleman working for the Imperial Secretariat. He was promoted to Chief Astronomer for the court, serving his first term from 115–120 under Emperor An and his second under the succeeding emperor from 126–132. As Chief Astronomer, Zhang was a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies, one of Nine Ministers ranked just below the Three Excellencies. In addition to recording heavenly observations and portents, preparing the calendar, and reporting which days were auspicious and which ill-omened, Zhang was also in charge of an advanced literacy test for all candidates to the Imperial Secretariat and the Censorate, both of whose members were required to know at least 9,000 characters and all major writing styles. Under Emperor An, Zhang also served as Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages under the Ministry of Guards, in charge of receiving memorials to the throne (formal essays on policy and administration) as well as nominees for official appointments.|$|E
5|$|The Prussian War Ministry was interested, {{but some}} initial {{skepticism}} {{could only be}} overcome {{through a series of}} successful demonstrations. The pigeons proved relatively indifferent to explosions, but during battle a dovecote may need to be moved, and pigeons can take some time to orient to their new position. The problem of making carrier pigeons accept a displaced dovecote with only a minimum of retraining had been tackled with some success by the Italian army around 1880; the French artillery captain Reynaud solved it by raising the pigeons in an itinerant dovecote. There is no indication that Neubronner was aware of this work, but he knew there must be a solution as he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> an itinerant fairground worker who was also a pigeon fancier with a dovecote in his trailer. At the 1909 exhibitions in Dresden and Frankfurt he presented a small carriage that combined a darkroom with a mobile dovecote in flashy colors. In months of laborious work he trained young pigeons to return to the dovecote even after it was displaced.|$|E
