The show {{may not be}} the best sitcom on TV now, but it's definitely the best work of NBC-criticism." [...] In regards to the main plot, he said it [...] "could have done even more with the premise of the Jaypocalypse re-enacted with janitors, but it <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> credit for the inspired idea." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10 rating, writing that the janitor plot [...] "came at a perfect time" [...] in regards to the Leno and O'Brien controversy. He, however, did not like the other two plots, noting they were [...] "less impressive". Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times said that the Khonani and Subhas plot was [...] "supremely clever and self-referential", and that the show's take on it was [...] "decidedly neutral, albeit very funny".|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} tended to be mixed. Noel Murray from The Onions The A.V. Club graded the episode with a D+, writing that [...] "Unlike the {{previous}} two weeks’ episodes, which juggled a number of storylines and locations and generated {{a real sense of}} Fringe’s expanding milieu, 'Fracture' is so curtailed that it almost feels like it was made for the Fox accountants. The cast is small, the sets are few, and not much happens. The plot’s practically twist-free, until the very end. Large chunks {{of the episode}} are given over to Peter talking to Walter about finding a new place for them to live, and Walter trying to learn more about Astrid—and really not discovering much, except that she doesn’t like it when he experiments on fruit. So Astrid’s underused yet again, even in an episode where she <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> lines... The story's too simple and the acting too broad, and yet the episode still felt choppy, as though the Fringe creative team had to scramble to fix 'Fracture' in post." ...|$|E

[...] Yehl also praised the art, saying it looked [...] "impressively good" [...] despite {{the fact that there were}} four artists on the book. Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources gave the first issue 2 stars out of 5, saying that the story is a [...] "protracted version of what readers have already learned in Phantom Stranger and elsewhere" [...] and criticizing the fact that Pandora's origin greatly differed from that of her Greek counterpart and the story had little to do with the [...] "Trinity War". Like Yehl, Johnson also praised the fluidity of the art from Zircher, Cannon, Sampere and Cifuentes. Newsarama's Aaron Duran gave the title a 5 out of 10, saying the comic is simply okay and would have worked better as a shorter installment within other books or as bonus digital content.|$|E

[...] OK! Magazine also noted that [...] "some are calling the 13-year-old signed singer the next Justin Bieber." [...] After watching the video, singer Chris Brown said: [...] "Honest opinion? It was great. I'll be jammin' to it on Friday, Friday." [...] Fellow teenage singer Miley Cyrus denied that she had criticized Black, saying [...] "I am a fan" [...] and that she sang [...] "Friday" [...] while driving. Simon Cowell praised Black, saying [...] "I love her [...] the fact that she's gotten so much publicity. People are so upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. [...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being deadly serious. Whatever she's done has worked. Whether you like her or not, she's the most talked-about artist in America right now. Nobody over the age of 18 should understand her or like her. So she should just do it her way." ...|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{director}} Chris Weitz {{wanted to}} recast {{the role of}} Jacob Black for Twilights sequel, , due to the major physical changes that occur in Black between the two novels, and have an actor that would accurately portray [...] "the new, larger Jacob Black." [...] Black's role in the novel also increases significantly, with him {{falling in love with}} Bella and becoming a werewolf, putting the actor in a starring role. Representatives for Weitz had stated that they were make a full effort to recast the [...] "high-profile gig," [...] and MTV News confirmed that Weitz was looking at Michael Copon to take on the role; however, Summit Entertainment said a decision had not been made. In an attempt to keep the role, Lautner weight-trained extensively and gained approximately 30 pounds of muscle. In January 2009, Weitz and Summit Entertainment announced that Lautner would continue {{to play the role of}} Jacob in the sequel. In an interview, fellow cast member Kristen Stewart talked about Lautner's transformation saying, [...] "He's an entirely different person physically." [...] Stewart later said, [...] "He <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> attention because he's buff, but I think as soon as the movie comes out, people are going to realize that's not why he got the job." [...] Co-star Robert Pattinson said after seeing Lautner's body, [...] "I saw him and thought 'Jesus, I'm going to get fired." [...] In an interview with The Wrap, Weitz said Lautner deserved a lot of credit for the movie's box office, stating, [...] "If you look at the movie, it should have been the weakest in the franchise, because Robert Pattinson doesn't play as big a role." [...] Weitz said Lautner had to [...] "pick up that slack, and if his character hadn't been emotionally, not just physically, appealing, the movie wouldn't have been as big a hit." [...] The commercial performance of the film outpaced the first film, setting several box office records including the biggest midnight opening in the United States and Canada and the biggest single-day opening. The opening weekend of New Moon is the third highest opening weekend in domestic history with $142,839,137. The Twilight Saga: New Moon also has the sixth highest worldwide opening weekend with $274.9 million total. Critical reception was less favorable, with the movie getting a 4.6/10 average from Rotten Tomatoes, and a 44 on Metacritic. Lautner won Favorite Breakout Movie Actor at the 35th People's Choice Awards.|$|E

Bunny Reuben in his book Dilip Kumar: Star Legend of Indian Cinema claimed that Dilip Kumar's role was instrumental behind this selection. Mughal-e-Azam gave Madhubala the opportunity of fulfilling herself totally as an actress, for it was a role that all actresses dreamt of playing, as Nimmi acknowledges that [...] "as an actress, one <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> roles, {{there is no shortage of}} them, but there isn’t always good scope for acting.

2500|$|Out of high school, Anderson was {{considered}} capable of playing any of four {{positions on the}} court, from point guard to power forward, drawing comparisons to basketball legends Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. Anderson's high school coach Bob Hurley said, [...] "I think he's a modern-day Magic Johnson. I think that let him play the point. He gets everybody shots. You don’t have him back defensively balancing the floor, you’re wasting him. But you let him {{do a lot of}} what the point guard stuff entails. But then also defensively you don’t bother guarding him on the little guy. Put him on maybe the three man or even sometimes the four man if he’s a step-out player. And now you have a guy like Larry Bird who anticipates. He <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> deflections and steals. He’s long, he blocks shots. And then when he gets a defensive rebound, you got a fast-break started already." [...] During his sophomore year in UCLA, CBSSports.com wrote that Anderson was [...] "starting to look more and more like the Magic Johnson of the 2013–14 season in college basketball." [...] ESPN analyst Dick Vitale warned against calling him the next Magic Johnson, but stated that [...] "he has the mini-version of that kind of skill.” USA Today commented that he was [...] "kind of a poor man's Magic Johnson".|$|E
