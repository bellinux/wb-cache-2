5000|$|Background {{compilation}} is {{a feature}} of the Visual Studio IDE whereby code is compiled as it is written by the programmer with the purpose of identifying compilation errors without requiring the solution to be built. This feature has been available for Visual Basic since [...]NET 1.1 and was present in early versions of Visual Studio for Visual Basic [...]NET. However, background compilation is a relatively new concept for Visual C# and is available with service pack 1 for Visual Studio 2008 Standard Edition and above. A distinct disadvantage for C# is that the <b>Error</b> <b>List</b> panel does not update until the solution is rebuilt. Refactoring large projects in C# is made more difficult by the need to frequently rebuild the solution in order to highlight compilation errors. Such is not the case with Visual Basic because the <b>Error</b> <b>List</b> panel is synchronized with the background compiler.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a general fingerprinting problem of digital data under which coalitions of users can alter or erase some bits in their copies {{in order to}} create an illegal copy. Each user is assigned a fingerprint which is a word in a fingerprinting code of size (the total number of users) and length. We present binary fingerprinting codes secure against size- coalitions which enable the distributor (decoder) to recover {{at least one of the}} users from the coalition with probability of error ��� @ @ AA for a ��� @ @ AA. This is an improvement over the best known schemes that provide the error probability no better than ��� @ @ I P AA and for this probability support at most ��� @ @ I P AA users. The construction complexity of codes is polynomial in. We also present versions of these constructions that afford identification algorithms of complexity @ A a @ A, improving over the best previously known complexity of @ A. For the case a P, we construct codes of exponential size with even stronger performance, namely, for which the distributor can either recover both users from the coalition with probability I ��� @ @ AA, or identify one traitor with probability I.
