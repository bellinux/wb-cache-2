40|$|With {{the rise}} of the {{environmental}} concerns from combustion of fossil fuels, the demand for the alternative clean energy sources has increased. One of the alternatives is rechargeable batteries. Among many types of rechargeable batteries, lithium-ion batteries have been the most promising due to the high energy density and long lifespan. The current lithium-ion batteries, however, hold a drawback as they utilize organic electrolytes. The use of organic electrolytes not only raises safety and environmental concerns, but also results in a higher manufacturing cost than would be with aqueous electrolytes. Therefore, these issues can be solved by replacing the organic electrolytes with aqueous electrolytes. Among the many types of lithium-ion batteries with aqueous electrolytes, Rechargeable Hybrid Aqueous Battery (ReHAB) was selected in this project. ReHAB utilizes lithium manganese oxide (LiMn 2 O 4) as the cathode and zinc as the anode. LiMn 2 O 4 is a good candidate because tightly bounded lithium ions make LiMn 2 O 4 stable in air and water. Also, it shows a small volume variation between lithiated and non-lithiated states. Zinc metal was chosen because of its low redox potential, good reversibility, high over-potential for hydrogen evolution in acidic environment, large specific capacity, good corrosion resistance, and cost effectiveness. While ReHAB is free of the problems posed by organic electrolytes in traditional Li-ion batteries, the current ReHAB technology must be improved to perform competitively in market. More specifically regarding the zinc anode, there are issues of corrosion, dendrite formation, and hydrogen evolution. Therefore, the goal of this project was to synthesize novel zinc anodes via electroplating with additives (organic and inorganic) reported in literature to mitigate issues of corrosion, dendrite formation, and hydrogen evolution (side reactions). The selected organic additives were cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecyle sulfate (SDS), polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG), and thiourea; and the <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives</b> were indium (II) sulfate, tin (IV) oxide, and boric acid. Each anode was characterized by the following measurements to rate its performance: float current, corrosion current, cyclability, x-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscope. All the anodes created with the inorganic and almost all with the organic additives performed better than the commercial zinc anode. Among the organic additives tested, Zn-SDS performed the best, with the lowest float current and corrosion current measurements and the highest retention of 79 % {{at the end of its}} 1000 th cycle. Among the <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives</b> tested, each fared very similarity, with similar float current and corrosion rate, and retaining in average 78 % of the initial discharge capacity at the end of 1000 th cycle. Between the organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives,</b> however, the XRD results suggested that in general the zinc deposition efficiencies may be lower for <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives</b> (and thus less favourable when scaling up for commercial production).

Equilibrium CO 2 loading of biogas slurry was adopted to assess the CO 2 absorption performance and germination index (GI) of Chinese cabbage seeds in CO 2 -rich biogas slurry was selected to evaluate its phytotoxicity directly related to the application of biogas slurry. Raw biogas slurry can be used to absorb CO 2 to reach the maximum CO 2 loading with 0. 13 molCO 2 /L. However, the highest equilibrium CO 2 loading and lowest phytotoxicity of CO 2 -rich biogas slurry can not be obtained simultaneously at the same temperature, which means that a compromise on absorption temperature should be made. In addition, effect of additives like potassium glycinate (PG), monoethanolamine (MEA), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and aqueous ammonia (AA) on improvement of CO 2 absorption and phytotoxicity of CO 2 -rich biogas slurry were also experimented.

The {{effect of all}} additives {{on the degree of}} crystallinity percentage (DOC%), isothermal crystallization kinetics parameters, and mechanical test results of PCL composites was studied. The PCL composite films were prepared by solvent casting by using dichloromethane as the solvent. The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and tensile tests. DSC of the first melting and X-ray diffraction DOC% results (for composites by solvent casting) are compatible. The values by DSC of the second melting (for composites by extrusion method) are lower. Organoclay gives the highest crystallinity among the other <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives</b> used.

40|$|The massiv {{usage of}} fossile fuels leads to high carbon dioxid {{emissions}} which cause global warming. To stop climate change {{we have to}} reduce the usage of fossile fuels and substitude them by renewable energie sources. Hydrogen {{is one of the}} most promising alternatives. Today steam reforming of natural gas is the most common production process of hydrogen. But there are also several renewable processes to produce hydrogen. One of them is the fermentative hydrogen production out of lignocellulosic biomas. The main focus should be on the usage of residual or waste materials. A competition between the energetic usage and the food industry is to be avoided. In this thesis the utilizability of grass silage is tested. Earlier experiments showed that monofermentation of grass silage lead to not acceptable conversion rates. Due to this results and to have a connection to practice a mixture of corn and grass silage was used. Moreover the effects of <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> and enzyme on the fermentative process, the decay rate and the quality of hydrolysis gas were tested. For the experiments a fermenter with a netto capacity of 20 liters was used. The fermentation conditions were a mesophilic temperature from about 39 °C and a pH range of 4, 5 to 5, 0. In anaerobic degradations organic acids are produced which lower the pH range. To stabilize the process natriumhydroxid is used. The retention time is 4 days. To gain the best results several inokula has been tested. Primary and tertiary sludge from a purification plant and digestate of biogas fermentation have been tested. There was just a small gas yield when primary sludge and digestate have been applied. Furthermore it was not possible to inhibit the methanogenesis. It was not possible to reach the goal of hydrolysis gas without methan. In the end tertiary sludge has been chosen to be the best inokula for conducting the following experiments, because there was a high gas yield with no methan in it. Three experiments were done: ► Experiment 1 : Mixture of corn and grass silage (50 : 50) ► Experiment 2 : Mixture of corn and grass silage (50 : 50) plus <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> ► Expermient 3 : Mixture of corn and grass silage (50 : 50) plus enzyme In Experiment 1 you gain a spezific hydrolysisgas yield of 78 l i. N/kgoTS and a hydrogen yield of 31 l i. N/kgoTS. You needed a lower amount of natriumhydroxid to stabilize the pH range because of the buffering effect of the grass silage. There was no methan in the hydrolysis gas. The addition of <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> in experiment 2 lead to an lower degradation rate of the organic substrate. In comparission to experiment 1 a lower hydrolysis gas and hydrogen yield was reached. It was 61, 5 l i. N/kgoTs and 19, 2 l i. N/kgoTS. The inorganic additve pushed the methanogenesis. It was impossible to produce hydrolysis gas without methan. After a few days only methan got produced. The adding of this <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> makes no sense for the hydrogenproduction. The best results had been reached with the addition of enzymes. The degradiation rate of the organic substrate was higher and the analyse of the gas quality showed an higher amount of hydrogen. In experiment 1 you got 37, 2 Vol. -% and in experiment 3 a hydrogen amount of 41 Vol. -% was reached. There was a specific hydrolysis gas yield of 89, 6 l i. N/kgoTS and a hydrogen yield of 36, 9 l i. N/kgoTS. The experiments demonstrate that the fermentative production of Hydrogen by lignocellulostic bio mass like corn and grass silage is possible. The next part was an economic efficiency calculation. The target was to calculate the production costs for the fermentative production of hydrogen and to compare them to the price of steam refoming. Bachelorarbeit von Danae Schmick – VII – The reactor for hydrolysation was considered as a pre-stage of a biogas reactor. The desulfurization and gas purification was realized by a pressure swing adoption plant. Two cases have been measured. In the first one only corn silage was used as substrate. In the second case a mixture of corn and grass silage were utilized. With corn sillage as substrate production costs of about 16 €/kg were generated. Because of lower substrat cost you reach a lower production cost with the usage of the mixture of grass and corn silage. It was ca. 13 €/kg. The calculation of the production cost of hydrogen come to the conclusion that the price for fermentative produced Hydrogen is 10 times higher than the process costs of hydrogen which was produced by steam reforming. The fermentative prosuction costs can be lowered by the selling of byproducts like for example carbon dioxid, but this wasn’t part of this thesis. To put it in a nutshell: There is still a high demand of research work and big technical progress in the sector of gas purification necessary to produce hydrogen by fermentation in an economic way...|$|R

Consequently, the optimal solution for these areas is to apply methods of remediation that create conditions {{for the restoration of}} plant cover and ensure the protection of groundwater against pollution. Remediation activities that are applied to large-scale areas contaminated with heavy metals should mainly focus on decreasing the degree of metal mobility in the soil profile and metal bioavailability to levels that are not phytotoxic. Chemophytostabilisation is a process in which soil amendments and plants are used to immobilise metals. The main objective of this research was to investigate the effects of different doses of organic amendments (after aerobic sewage sludge digestion in the food industry) and inorganic amendments (lime, superphosphate, and potassium phosphate) on changes in the metals fractions in soils contaminated with Cd, Pb and Zn during phytostabilisation. In this study, the contaminated soil was amended with sewage sludge and inorganic amendments and seeded with grass (tall fescue) to increase the degree of immobilisation of the studied metals. The contaminated soil was collected from the area surrounding a zinc smelter in the Silesia region of Poland (pH 5. 5, Cd 12 mg kg- 1, Pb 1100 mg kg- 1, Zn 700 mg kg- 1). A plant growth experiment was conducted in a growth chamber for 5 months. Before and after plant growth, soil subsamples were subjected to chemical and physical analyses. To determine the fractions of the elements, a sequential extraction method was used according to Zeien and Brümmer. Research confirmed that the most important impacts on the Zn, Cd and Pb fractions included the combined application of sewage sludge from the food industry and the addition of lime and potassium phosphate. Certain doses of <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives</b> decreased the easily exchangeable fraction from 50 % to 1 %. The addition of sewage sludge caused a decrease in fraction I for Cd and Pb. In combination with the use of <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives,</b> a mobile fraction was not detected and an easily mobilisable fraction was reduced by half. For certain combinations of metals, the concentrations were detected up to a few percent. The application of sewage sludge resulted in a slight decrease in a mobile (water soluble and easily exchangeable metals) fraction of Zn, but when <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives</b> were applied, this fraction was not detected. The highest degree of immobilisation of the tested heavy metals relative to the control was achieved when using both sewage sludge and <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives</b> at an experimentally determined dose. The sequential extraction results confirmed this result. In addition, the results proved that the use of the phytostabilisation process on contaminated soils should be supported...|$|E
40|$|In the {{production}} of ceramic tiles, during wet grinding, chemical additives are normally used to increase the solid loading of the suspensions. Commonly, mixtures of organic and <b>inorganic</b> chemical <b>additives</b> are used to reduce viscosity and costs. In literature, only few papers consider the combined effect {{of two or more}} deflocculants and a modest knowledge has developed on possible competitive or synergic interactions among them. The most common rheological additives show different behaviour depending on the clay. With mixture design it is possible to define mathematical models by means of which it is possible to engineer the rheological behaviour of a suspension. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} the DM 100 and DM 10 tests were to determine the impact of four different organics and one <b>inorganic</b> feed <b>additive</b> on sulfate volatilization and to determine the sulfur partitioning between the glass and the off-gas system. The tests provided information on melter processing characteristics and off-gas data including sulfur incorporation and partitioning. A series of DM 10 and DM 100 melter tests were conducted using a LAW Envelope A feed. The testing was divided into three parts. The first part involved a series of DM 10 melter tests with four different organic feed additives: sugar, polyethylene glycol (PEG), starch, and urea. The second part involved two confirmatory 50 -hour melter tests on the DM 100 using the best combination of reductants and conditions based on the DM 10 results. The third part {{was performed on the}} DM 100 with feeds containing vanadium oxide (V{sub 2 }O{sub 5 }) as an <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> to increase sulfur partitioning to the off-gas. Although vanadium oxide is not a reductant, previous testing has shown that vanadium shows promise for partitioning sulfur to the melter exhaust, presumably through its known catalytic effect on the SO{sub 2 }/SO{sub 3 } reaction. Crucible-scale tests were conducted prior to the melter tests to confirm that the glasses and feeds would be processable in the melter and that the glasses would meet the waste form (ILAW) performance requirements. Thus, the major {{objectives of the}}se tests were to: � Perform screening tests on the DM 10 followed by tests on the DM 100 -WV system using a LAW -Envelope A feed with four organic additives to assess their impact on sulfur volatilization. � Perform tests on the DM 100 -WV system using a LAW -Envelope A feed containing vanadium oxide to assess its impact on sulfur volatilization. � Determine feed processability and product quality with the above additives. � Collect melter emissions data to determine the effect of additives on sulfur partitioning and melter emissions. � Collect and analyze discharged glass to determine sulfur retention in the glass. � Prepare and characterize feeds and glasses with the additives to confirm that the feeds and the glass melts are suitable for processing in the DM 100 melter. � Prepare and characterize glasses with the additives to confirm that the glasses meet the waste form (ILAW) performance requirements...|$|R
