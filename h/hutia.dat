25|$|Capromys pilorides - Desmarest's <b>hutia</b> or Cuban <b>hutia,</b> {{the most}} common and largest extent <b>hutia,</b> {{widespread}} on Cuba and many nearby islands, including Isla de la Juventud. The previously recognized Geocapromys megas is a synonym of this species.|$|E
25|$|Desmarest's <b>hutia</b> (Capromys pilorides), {{also known}} as the Cuban <b>hutia,</b> is a species of rodent endemic to Cuba. Weighing up to , it is the largest of the extant species of <b>hutia</b> (the extinct giant hutias were far larger).|$|E
25|$|Several hystricognaths {{are known}} from Puerto Rico, the easternmost of the Greater Antilles, which is under United States sovereignty. <b>Hutias</b> are notably {{absent from the}} {{indigenous}} fauna, but giant <b>hutias</b> and heteropsomyines are present.|$|R
50|$|Caribbean rodents (order Rodentia), are diverse, {{including}} several families. The fauna of the Greater Antilles mainly consists of caviomorphans, including <b>hutias,</b> giant <b>hutias,</b> and a subfamily of spiny rats (Heteropsomyinae). Of these, only some <b>hutias</b> survive. Oryzomyines, {{part of a}} wholly distinct branch of the rodents, are known throughout the Lesser Antilles and on Jamaica, but are now also mostly extinct. Various other rodents have been introduced or are known only from {{the fringes of the}} Caribbean region.|$|R
50|$|Echimyidae (<b>hutias,</b> coypu, spiny-rats). 27 genera and 99 species.|$|R
25|$|Mesocapromys auritus - Large-eared <b>hutia,</b> a <b>hutia</b> from Cayo Fragoso in the Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Mesocapromys sanfelipensis - San Felipe <b>hutia,</b> a <b>hutia</b> from Cayo Juan Garcia in Pinar del Río Province.|$|E
25|$|Mesocapromys nanus - Dwarf <b>hutia,</b> a small <b>hutia</b> {{from the}} Zapata Swamp in Matanzas Province on {{mainland}} Cuba.|$|E
50|$|The giant <b>hutias</b> {{are divided}} into two subfamilies, five genera, and six species.|$|R
40|$|The Capromyidae (<b>hutias)</b> are endemic rodents of the Caribbean and {{represent}} {{a model of}} dispersal for non-flying mammals in the Greater Antilles. This family has experienced severe extinctions during the Holocene and its phylogenetic affinities with respect to other caviomorph relatives are still debated as morphological and molecular data disagree. We used target enrichment and next-generation sequencing of mitochondrial and nuclear genes to infer the phylogenetic relationships of <b>hutias,</b> estimate their divergence ages, and understand their mode of dispersal in the Greater Antilles. We found that Capromyidae are nested within Echimyidae (spiny rats) and {{should be considered a}} subfamily thereof. We estimated that the split between <b>hutias</b> and Atlantic Forest spiny rats occurred 16. 5 (14. 8 – 18. 2) million years ago (Ma), which is more recent than the GAARlandia land bridge hypothesis (34 – 35 Ma). This would suggest that during the Early Miocene, an echimyid-like ancestor colonized the Greater Antilles from an eastern South American source population via rafting. The basal divergence of the Hispaniolan Plagiodontia provides further support for a vicariant separation between Hispaniolan and western islands (Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica) <b>hutias.</b> Recent divergences among these western <b>hutias</b> suggest Plio-Pleistocene dispersal waves associated with glacial cycles.

25|$|The Caribbean rodent fauna is {{dominated}} by oryzomyines (rice rats), {{members of the family}} Cricetidae, and by three groups of hystricognaths: <b>hutias</b> (family Capromyidae), giant <b>hutias</b> (taxonomy unclear), and heteropsomyines (subfamily Heteropsomyinae), which are part of the spiny rat family (Echimyidae). Many other rodent groups are known from the Caribbean, but these are either introduced or limited to islands outside the limits of the West Indian faunal region as defined by Koopman.|$|R
25|$|Mysateles meridionalis - Isla De La Juventud tree <b>hutia,</b> a <b>hutia</b> {{from the}} southwestern {{part of the}} Isla de la Juventud.|$|E
25|$|Geocapromys brownii - Jamaican <b>hutia,</b> a <b>hutia</b> {{indigenous}} to Jamaica. It {{was found in}} an Amerindian archeological site, probably indicating transport by humans.|$|E
25|$|Mesocapromys angelcabrerai - Cabrera's <b>hutia,</b> a small <b>hutia</b> from Cayos de Ana Maria, Ciego de Ávila Province, and {{possibly}} the nearby mainland.|$|E
25|$|Giant <b>hutias</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} group of hystricognaths that {{include not only}} truly giant forms like Amblyrhiza, but also the small Xaymaca. All are now extinct. Some have previously been included in a family Heptaxodontidae, {{but there is little}} evidence that the group is truly natural. Giant <b>hutias</b> are known from Jamaica (Clidomys, Xaymaca, and possibly another, very large form), Hispaniola (Quemisia), Puerto Rico (Elasmodontomys, Tainotherium), and Anguilla and Saint Martin in the northern Lesser Antilles (Amblyrhiza).|$|R
25|$|Xaymaca fulvopulvis, a small hystricognath {{that may}} be most {{closely related to the}} giant <b>hutias</b> of Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Leeward Islands.|$|R
50|$|It {{is related}} to the <b>hutias</b> and more distantly to guinea pigs. It is the only extant native land mammal on Jamaica besides bats.|$|R
25|$|Mysateles garridoi, - Garrido's <b>hutia,</b> a <b>hutia</b> {{known only}} from a small island close to Cayo Largo del Sur in the Canarreos Archipelago off southwestern Cuba.|$|E
25|$|Geocapromys brownii, a <b>hutia</b> {{known only}} from the island.|$|E
25|$|Amblyrhiza inundata, a giant <b>hutia</b> {{also known}} from Anguilla (see there).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hutias</b> were {{traditionally}} {{hunted for}} food in Cuba as their flesh was agreeable and their size meant they provided a substantial meal. In {{a few places}} they were raised in barns and used as a minor stock animal [...] The Wild Animals Protection Act of 1968 made it illegal to hunt or kill <b>hutias</b> without a permit from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. In some areas they are so abundant that they cause damage to crops and are viewed as a pest.|$|R
50|$|Caviomorpha is the rodent infraorder or parvorder {{that unites}} all New World hystricognaths. It is {{supported}} by both fossil and molecular evidence. The Caviomorpha was for a time {{considered to be a}} separate order outside the Rodentia, but is now accepted as a genuine part of the rodents. Caviomorphs include the extinct Heptaxodontidae (giant <b>hutias)</b> and extant families of chinchilla rats, <b>hutias,</b> guinea pigs and the capybara, chinchillas and viscachas, tuco-tucos, agoutis, pacas, pacaranas, spiny rats, New World porcupines, coypu and octodonts (Vassallo and Antenucci, 2015).|$|R
2500|$|Taíno staples {{included}} vegetables, fruit, meat, and fish. There were no {{large animals}} {{native to the}} Caribbean, but they captured and ate small animals, such as <b>hutias</b> and other mammals, earthworms, lizards, turtles, and birds. Manatees were speared and fish were caught in nets, speared, [...] trapped in weirs, or caught with hook and line. Wild parrots were decoyed with domesticated birds, and iguanas were taken from trees and other vegetation. The Taíno stored live animals until {{they were ready to}} be consumed: fish and turtles were stored in weirs, and <b>hutias</b> and dogs were stored in corrals.|$|R
25|$|Plagiodontia ipnaeum, {{another large}} {{mainland}} Hispaniolan <b>hutia</b> {{that is now}} extinct.|$|E
25|$|Quemisia gravis, an extinct giant <b>hutia</b> {{known only}} from the main island.|$|E
25|$|Elasmodontomys obliquus, a giant <b>hutia</b> {{native to}} the island that is now extinct.|$|E
25|$|Hispaniola, {{the second}} largest of the Antilles, is {{politically}} divided into Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Various <b>hutias</b> and other hystricognaths are known from both the main island and several surrounding islands, including Gonâve Island.|$|R
50|$|The {{park has}} an interpretative centre, a walkway through a Bagá forest, a Taíno village and fauna {{exhibits}} (crocodiles, iguanas, flamingos and Cuban <b>hutias).</b> The archipelago {{is a natural}} habitat for Caribbean flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber).|$|R
50|$|The giant <b>hutias</b> are an extinct {{group of}} large rodents known from fossil and subfossil {{material}} in the West Indies. One species, Amblyrhiza inundata, is estimated to have weighed between 50 and 200 kg, big specimens being as large as an American black bear. This is much larger than capybara, the largest rodent living today, but still much smaller than Josephoartigasia monesi, the largest rodent known. These animals might have persisted into historic times and were probably used as a food source by aboriginal humans. All giant <b>hutias</b> are in a single family, Heptaxodontidae, which contains no living species; this grouping seems to be paraphyletic and artificial however.|$|R
25|$|Cuba, {{the largest}} of the Antilles, and its {{surrounding}} islands, of which the Isla de la Juventud is the most significant, harbor a diverse <b>hutia</b> fauna, including many species with very limited distributions. Various other hutias and an endemic genus of heteropsomyine became extinct during the Quaternary and the oldest known <b>hutia,</b> Zazamys, has been found in Miocene Cuban deposits.|$|E
25|$|Desmarest's <b>hutia</b> {{is found}} only in Cuba, but is {{widespread}} throughout its range. They are found on the main island, Isla de la Juventud, the Sabana archipelago, the Doce Laqunas archipelago {{and many of the}} other islands and cays of the Cuban archipelago. They are abundant in Guantánamo Province, particularly around the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. In the mountainous areas of eastern Cuba, numbers of Desmarest's <b>hutia</b> are decreasing.|$|E
25|$|Isolobodon portoricensis, a Hispaniolan <b>hutia</b> {{introduced}} on Saint Thomas and Saint Croix by Amerindians, but now extinct there.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the smaller}} species, Quemisia, might have survived {{as late as the}} days when the Spanish were {{beginning}} to conquer North America.Some of their smaller relatives from the family Capromyidae, known as <b>hutias,</b> survive in the Caribbean Islands.|$|R
50|$|Plana Cays, also {{northeast}} of Spring Point, is a protected reserve for endangered great iguanas {{and the very}} rare estimated <b>hutias</b> (guinea pig like rodents), the only native mammal of The Bahamas. Another site of interest is the remote Castle Island Lighthouse at the southernmost point of Acklins Island.|$|R
