5|$|Hela was {{the first}} German ship sunk by a British {{submarine}} in the war. As {{a result of her}} loss, all German ships conducting training exercises were moved to the Baltic Sea to prevent <b>further</b> <b>such</b> sinkings. One of her 8.8cm guns was retrieved from the wreck and is now preserved at Fort Kugelbake in Cuxhaven.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{did have}} some successes during this time. In the Middle East, Commonwealth forces first quashed an {{uprising}} in Iraq which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled Syria, then, {{with the assistance of}} the Free French, invaded Syria and Lebanon to prevent <b>further</b> <b>such</b> occurrences.|$|E
5|$|Coldrum Long Barrow is {{comparatively}} {{isolated from}} the other Medway Megaliths; in this it is unique, given that the other surviving examples are clustered into two groups. It is possible that another chambered tomb was located nearby; a razed, elongated earthen mound with an east–west orientation {{is located in a}} hollow {{at the foot of the}} downs just under a quarter of a mile north of the Coldrum Stones. It may be that this represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried. Several large sarsens south of the Coldrums might represent the remnants of a <b>further</b> <b>such</b> tomb, since destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In Thailand, however, {{substantial}} {{efforts to}} prevent <b>further</b> <b>such</b> occurrences had not materialized {{in the months following}} the accident. Labour activists, trade unions and workers were lobbying for the creation of an independent occupational health and safety institute. Social critics pointed out that the accident, along with several prior disasters such as the Kader toy factory fire, was part of a trend in which the country's rapid industrialization resulted in increasing health and environmental hazards due to poor regulations and lack of official willingness to tackle the issue.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances. During rains precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface <b>further</b> (<b>such</b> as acid rain), and sodium and chloride ions (salt) deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather {{plays a major role in}} erosion of the surface.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a gallant and daring act being {{performed}} by a squadron, ship's company or a detached body of men (such as marines) in which all men are deemed equally brave and deserving of the Victoria Cross then a ballot is drawn. The officers select one officer, the NCOs select one individual and the private soldiers or seamen select two individuals. In all 46 awards have been awarded by ballot with 29 of the awards during the Indian Mutiny. Four further awards were granted to Q Battery, Royal Horse Artillery at Korn Spruit on 31 March 1900 during the Second Boer War. The final ballot awards for the army were the six awards to the Lancashire Fusiliers at W Beach during the landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 although three of the awards were not gazetted until 1917. The final seven ballot awards were the only naval ballot awards with three awards to two Q-Ships in 1917 and four awards for the Zeebrugge Raid in 1918. The provision for awards by ballot is still included in the Victoria Cross warrant but there have been no <b>further</b> <b>such</b> awards since 1918.|$|E

All three nominations were seen as [...] "on track to be confirmed by the Senate".|$|R
5|$|The player embarks {{with the}} {{expedition}} team (seven dwarves, their livestock and supplies), {{and does not}} have direct control over them. In order to construct and operate the fortress, the player has to designate specific tasks to be performed and the dwarves will go about it. They can be assigned any labors, but their work still depends on their relative skill with it, which can increase as they perform the said task. Some task categories are stone-working, woodworking, metalworking, farming, and crafting; there are further combat-related skills. They are categorized <b>further,</b> <b>such</b> as are leatherworking, butchery, clothesmaking, gem-related, glassmaking, and clay-related industries. Activities take place in workshops which need to be constructed; for example, stills for brewing alcohol. The metal industry has {{a very important role}} because it produces weapons and armor for the military, trap components for defense, and high-value furniture and decorations.|$|E
5|$|Lark {{received}} missions from London (sometimes via Stockholm), and {{constituted the}} leadership of Milorg in Trøndelag where they in practice were the same entity. Gjems-Onstad started his operations in Trondheim by establishing radio connection with London and operating the radio transmitter, and he soon {{became one of the}} most important persons in {{the leadership of}} Milorg. His saboteur activity included to prepare the sinking of Tirpitz, but the plans were never realised as the ship had left the Trondheimsfjord in early 1943. Sørli commanded Gjems-Omstad to a spontaneous assassination of Nazi collaborator Ivar Grande after spotting him incidentally, but Gjems-Onstad aborted after noticing a division of Russian POWs, fearing for what in turn might happen to them if he went through with the assassination. Some days later he again plotted to assassinate Grande together with Sørli and Ingebrigt Gausland. They delivered a box booby trapped with an egg hand grenade to his home, but Grande foiled the attempt with advice Norwegian Gestapo agent Henry Rinnan (who was present at the time) had received on not to open such boxes. Following the attempted assassination, he was ordered to not get himself involved in any <b>further</b> <b>such</b> attempts, as it was considered too risky for him. Gjems-Onstad took over as leader of the group from Sørli in October 1943, and it was decided to pull him out of Norway and close the radio station following news that Pevik had been arrested. He left Trondheim for Stockholm later that month, and received training in psychological warfare.|$|E

Proposals for <b>further</b> <b>such</b> introductions remain controversial.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Menzel {{suggested}} that Arnold had seen clouds of snow blown {{from the mountains}} south of Mt. Rainier.

25|$|After Pluto's discovery, American {{astronomer}} Clyde Tombaugh continued {{searching for}} some years for similar objects, but found none. For a long time, no one searched for other TNOs as it was generally believed that Pluto, which up to August 2006 was classified a planet, was the only major object beyond Neptune. Only after the 1992 discovery of a second TNO, , did systematic searches for <b>further</b> <b>such</b> objects begin. A broad strip of the sky around the ecliptic was photographed and digitally evaluated for slowly moving objects. Hundreds of TNOs were found, with diameters {{in the range of}} 50 to 2,500 kilometers.|$|E

The clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary in order to participate in <b>further</b> <b>such</b> undervalued IPOs.

25|$|If {{there is}} such a rule for every logical {{connective}} then the procedure will eventually produce a set which consists only of atomic formulae and their negations, which cannot be broken down any <b>further.</b> <b>Such</b> a set is easily recognizable as satisfiable or unsatisfiable with respect to the semantics of the logic in question. To keep track of this process, the nodes of a tableau itself are set out {{in the form of a}} tree and the branches of this tree are created and assessed in a systematic way. Such a systematic method for searching this tree gives rise to an algorithm for performing deduction and automated reasoning. Note that this larger tree is present regardless of whether the nodes contain sets, multisets, lists or trees.|$|E
