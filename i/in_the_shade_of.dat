5|$|The two {{subspecies}} {{are similar}} in coloration, but differ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> the cap. The northern subspecies, living in Central Pacific Costa Rica, has a lighter cap than the southern subspecies, which lives in Panama and in parts of Costa Rica near Panama. The southern subspecies also has more yellowish limbs and underparts.|$|E
5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{geographic}} variation in size. The main differences are {{the presence or absence}} of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> the nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.|$|E

5|$|Springbok {{are mainly}} active around dawn and dusk. Activity is {{influenced}} by weather; springbok can feed at night in hot weather, and at midday in colder months. They rest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> trees or bushes, and often bed down in the open when weather is cooler. The social structure of the springbok {{is similar to that}} of Thomson's gazelle. Mixed-sex herds or harems have a roughly 3:1 sex ratio; bachelor individuals are also observed. In the mating season, males generally form herds and wander in search of mates. Females live with their offspring in herds, that very rarely include dominant males. Territorial males round up female herds that enter their territories and keep out the bachelors; mothers and juveniles may gather in nursery herds separate from harem and bachelor herds. After weaning, female juveniles stay with their mothers until the birth of their next calves, while males join bachelor groups.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} of the nominate subspecies T. m. merula is 23.5 to 29centimetres (9.25 to 11.4in) in length, {{has a long}} tail, {{and weighs}} 80–125grams (2.8 to 4.4oz). The adult male has glossy black plumage, blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow bill. The bill darkens somewhat in winter. The adult female is sooty-brown with a dull yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> brown, with darker birds presumably males. The first year male resembles the adult male, but has a dark bill and weaker eye ring, and its folded wing is brown, rather than black like the body plumage.|$|E

25|$|Qutb's written {{works are}} still widely {{available}} {{and have been}} translated into many Western languages. His best known work is Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq (Milestones), {{but the majority of}} Qutb's theory can be found in his Qur'anic commentary Fi zilal al-Qur'an (<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> the Quran). This 30-volume work is noteworthy for its innovative method of interpretation, borrowing heavily from the literary analysis of Amin al-Khuli, while retaining some structural features of classical commentaries (for example, the practice of progressing from the first sura to the last). For Qutb, the Qur'an was seen as the final arbiter in all matters relating to faith, while his main goal in writing the book, <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> the Qur’an, was to restore the centrality of faith in the consciousness and imagination of Muslims, and to kindle a cognitive revolution that would bring about a political and social process that will lead to the renewal of the Islamic tradition.|$|E

25|$|Originally, coffee farming {{was done}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> trees that {{provided}} a habitat for many animals and insects.

25|$|Qutb's {{career as}} a writer also heavily {{influenced}} his philosophy. In al-Taswiir al-Fanni fil-Quran (Artistic Representation in the Qur'an), Qutb developed a literary appreciation of the Qur'an and a complementary methodology for interpreting the text. His hermeneutics were applied in his extensive commentary on the Qur'an, Fi zilal al-Qur'an (<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> the Quran), which served {{as the foundation for}} the declarations of Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq.|$|E

25|$|This period saw the {{composition}} of his two most important works: a commentary of the Qur'an Fi Zilal al-Qur'an (<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> the Qur'an), and a manifesto of political Islam called Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq (Milestones). These works represent the final form of Qutb's thought, encompassing his radically anti-secular and anti-Western claims based on his interpretations of the Qur'an, Islamic history, and {{the social and political}} problems of Egypt. The school of thought he inspired has become known as Qutbism.|$|E

25|$|During {{a survey}} in the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, 32 {{species of plants}} were {{identified}} as food for gaur. They consume herbs, young shoots, flowers, fruits of elephant apple (Dillenia ssp.) with a high preference for leaves. Food preference varies by season. In winter and monsoon, they feed on preferably fine and fresh grasses and herb species of the legume family, such as tick clover (Desmodium triflorum), but also browse on leaves of shrub species such as karvy (Strobilanthes callosus), Indian boxwood (Gardenia latifolia), mallow-leaved crossberry (Grewia abutifolia), East-Indian screw tree (Helicteres ssp.) and the chaste tree (Vitex negundo). In summer, they also feed on bark of teak (Tectona grandis), on fruit of golden shower tree (Cassia fistula), and on the bark and fruit of cashew (Anacardium occidentale). Gaur {{spent most of their}} daily time feeding. Peak feeding activity was observed between 6:30 and 8:30am and between 5:30 and 6:45pm. During the hottest hours of the day, 1:30 to 3:30pm, they rest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> big trees.|$|E
25|$|After the Ghoris {{had assumed}} a {{position}} of Muslim supremacy over North India, Qutbuddin Aibak attempted to conquer Gujarat and annex it to his empire in 1197 but failed in his ambitions. An independent Muslim community continued to flourish in Gujarat for the next hundred years, championed by Arab merchants settling along the western coast belonging to the Shafi'ite madhhab. From 1297 to 1300, Allauddin Khilji, the Turkic Sultan of Delhi, destroyed the Hindu metropolis of Anhilwara and incorporated Gujarat into the Delhi Sultanate. After Timur's sacking of Delhi {{at the end of}} the 14th century weakened the Sultanate, Gujarat's Muslim Rajput governor Zafar Khan Muzaffar (Muzaffar Shah I) asserted his independence, and his son, Sultan Ahmed Shah (ruled 1411 to 1442), established Ahmedabad as the capital. Khambhat eclipsed Bharuch as Gujarat's most important trade port. Gujarat's relations with Egypt, which was then the premier Arab power in the Middle East remained friendly over the next century and the Egyptian scholar, Badruddin-ad-Damamimi, spent several years in Gujarat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> the Sultan before proceeding to the Bahmani Sultanate of the Deccan.|$|E
