Sustainable models for regional cities include {{the development of the}} central compact city and decentralised densening of suburban areas. One of the guiding principles of the <b>decentralised</b> <b>concentration</b> model is establishing connections between the development of regional structures with the development of public transport. Development is concentrated in strategic points along the regional public transport routes. Thus smaller centres (with higher density) are formed along public transport routes, joining various urban functions: work, residence, shopping and leisure...|$|E
40|$|Summary. A ‘model of <b>decentralised</b> <b>concentration</b> ’ {{has evolved}} {{in the region of}} Berlin– Brandenburg in {{response}} to the European principle of polycentric development for urban regions. The paper describes strategies which seek to implement this new regional planning guideline. The formation of an urban forum as a co-ordinating body has initiated a course of development which attempts to link aspects of both horizontal and vertical policy co-ordination within a framework of territorial integration (networking). The paper analyses this innovative instrument of urban and regional development. The authors focus on the process of co-operation, beginning with the looser form practised in the urban forum by the towns which participated and evolving towards de ned contractual and institutional relations {{in the form of a}} networked urban workgroup. Finally, they evaluate the objectives achieved and the nancial and legal instruments applied...|$|E
40|$|In the introduction, {{previous}} {{town planning}} practices in Ljubljana and recent spatial {{documents of the}} Municipality of Ljubljana (ML) are presented. In {{the central part of}} the paper, the basic chapters of the Strategic spatial plan of the ML are analysed and some important parts emphasised. The plan is based on contemporary principles of urban design and the sustainable development. We have stressed the importance of the qualitative upgrading of existing urbanised areas, the renewal of degraded areas and the amelioration of dispersed building. The new housing construction is planned only when that is necessary for the development of the municipality. The improvements of social and economic infrastructures are envisaged as well. The concept of spatial organisation has been developed in three characteristic areas of the ML: the compact city, the suburbia, and the hilly hinterland. In the compactly city a central radiocentric model has been preserved. New building is stimulated along radially city thoroughfares with green wedges between them. In the suburbia, the network of local centres is linked to the thoroughfares at traffic nodal points. A rational use of land is emphasized by <b>decentralised</b> <b>concentration</b> model. In the hilly hinterland new housing construction is mainly directed to existing settlements for preserving quality landscape features. As significant structural elements of the city we emphasise open public and green areas. In the chapter of land use, special attention is paid to housing construction, the central areas and industrial activities. We also give some basic guidelines for traffic development. The last chapter presents the guidelines for urban and architectural design. Characteristic areas, the connecting structures and large landscape structures are defined as basic elements of the city structure identity...|$|E
