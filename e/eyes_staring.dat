5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or self-defence. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the <b>eyes</b> <b>staring</b> threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E
5|$|In {{the various}} rooms, she meets men wearing vest tops with their faces painted white with black <b>eyes</b> <b>staring</b> {{at her as}} she passes down the corridor. Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being {{surrounded}} by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four mannequins in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a TV screen and Beyoncé is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyoncé performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several other female dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent. The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko. Her look is further complete with dark make-up around the eyes and red lipstick while her hair is marcelled and blonde.|$|E
500|$|In a 1954 article, {{sports writer}} Dave Lewis wrote that Penn {{assigned}} five players {{to the task}} of mowing down Schulz. [...] Lewis quoted Schulz as having said: [...] "I can still see those five pairs of <b>eyes</b> <b>staring</b> at me every time we lined up... ready to tear me apart". [...] According to Lewis, all five men piled on Schulz every play, and Schulz held Penn scoreless for 50minutes before they [...] "finally knocked him out". [...] Lewis concluded: [...] "Never before or since has there been such a one-man show of defensive football as Schulz displayed against Penn".|$|E
50|$|This {{painting}} depicts {{an almost}} photo-realistic table setting with {{a slice of}} ham in the center. The scene is made surreal by the presence of an <b>eye</b> <b>staring</b> back at the viewer {{from the center of the}} ham.|$|R
60|$|Stephen {{went down}} Bedford row, {{the handle of}} the ash clacking against his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his <b>eye.</b> <b>Staring</b> backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths {{proposed}} gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes' hearts.|$|R
60|$|The lips moved again, {{but this}} time feebly and vacantly; the <b>eyes</b> were <b>staring</b> vaguely around.|$|R
500|$|... "West Coast" [...] {{served as}} the lead single from Ultraviolence. The song's title was first {{announced}} by the singer on April 3, 2014, on Facebook and Twitter. On April 10, 2014, Del Rey posted the track's single art on Twitter with the lyric, [...] "Down on the West Coast, they got a sayin'...", as its caption. The same caption was used in a promotional billboard which was put up in Los Angeles the same day. The heavily yellow artwork, which makes use of an Instagram filter camera lens, features Del Rey donning soft makeup while standing on a Californian coastline afront crashing waves. [...] She has a forlorn facial expression in the cover, and is depicted with a subtle frown with her <b>eyes</b> <b>staring</b> straight into the camera. Del Rey sports a beach-inspired look with a wave-like hair style, denim jacket and white shirt. Some critics speculated that the artwork hinted that the sound of [...] "West Coast" [...] would continue in the laid-back style of Born to Die. [...] "West Coast" [...] was premiered by BBC Radio 1's Fearne Cotton on April 14, 2014, ...|$|E
2500|$|Müller {{was walking}} through the forest when he saw two <b>eyes</b> <b>staring</b> {{at him in the}} darkness: [...] "Must be an owl," [...] Müller thought. / [...] "Who's an owl? You're an owl yourself!" [...] Stierlitz thought.|$|E
2500|$|Trisha Ziff, {{the curator}} of Che! Revolution and Commerce {{describes}} Guerrillero Heroico as a [...] "statuesque image taken from below," [...] which [...] "derives from a visual language of mythologized heroes harking back to an era of socialist realism" [...] while referencing [...] "a classical Christ-like demeanor." [...] Jon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, in the photograph Che appears [...] "as the ultimate revolutionary icon" [...] with [...] "his <b>eyes</b> <b>staring</b> boldly into the future" [...] and [...] "his expression a virile embodiment of outrage at social injustice." ...|$|E

60|$|All at once Sage King shied, and Lucy {{looked down}} {{to see a man}} lying on the ground. He lay inert. But his <b>eyes</b> were open--dark, <b>staring</b> <b>eyes.</b> They moved. And he called. But Lucy could not {{understand}} him.|$|R
2500|$|Agents of the Dutch East India Company used a {{precursor}} to waterboarding during the Amboyna massacre of English prisoners, which {{took place on the}} island of Amboyna in the Molucca Islands in 1623. At that time, it consisted of wrapping cloth around the victim's head, after which the torturers [...] "poured the water softly upon his head until the cloth was full, up to the mouth and nostrils, and somewhat higher, so that he could not draw breath but he must suck in all the water". In one case, the torturer applied water three or four times successively until the victim's [...] "body was swollen twice or thrice as big as before, his cheeks like great bladders, and his <b>eyes</b> <b>staring</b> and strutting out beyond his forehead".|$|E
2500|$|Early in the evening, the {{disguised}} Loki and Thor {{meet with}} Þrymr and the assembled jötnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of mead. Þrymr finds the behaviour {{at odds with}} his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before Þrymr and appearing as a [...] "very shrewd maid", makes the excuse that [...] "Freyja's" [...] behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. Þrymr then lifts [...] "Freyja's" [...] veil and wants to kiss [...] "her" [...] until catching the terrifying <b>eyes</b> <b>staring</b> back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because [...] "Freyja" [...] had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{the term}} Erne or Alerion in early Heraldry {{referred}} to a regular Eagle. Later heralds used the term Alerion to depict baby Eagles. To differentiate them from mature Eagles, Alerions were shown as an Eagle Displayed Inverted without a beak or claws (disarmed). To difference it from a decapitate (headless) eagle, the Alerion has a bulb-shaped head with an <b>eye</b> <b>staring</b> towards the Dexter (right-hand side) of the field. This was later simplified in modern heraldry as an abstract winged oval.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} police leave, Althea notices {{one of the}} many {{peepholes}} Ronald has drilled. When she approaches it, she suddenly sees Ronald's <b>eye</b> <b>staring</b> back at her, and screams in terror as Ronald then breaks through the wall. The police, who have been watching the house, hear the girls' screams and rush back. Ronald is captured as he tries to flee, crying out for his mother. Soon afterwards, Duane and Babs are both discovered, shaken but not seriously harmed.|$|R
6000|$|In the {{background}} enter some light horse of the Russian army, [...] followed by KUTUZOF himself {{and a few}} of his staff. He presents [...] a terrible appearance now--bravely serving though slowly dying, [...] his face puffed with the intense cold, his one <b>eye</b> <b>staring</b> out as [...] he sits in a heap in the saddle, his head sunk into his shoulders. [...] The whole detachment pauses {{at the sight of the}} French asleep. [...] They shout; but the bivouackers give no sign.|$|R

She then lights a match and throws it in the fireplace when it then begins to grow lotuses. Next, she activates the ceiling fan which precedes to spin the room around as she begins to dance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Run, ye fools!" [...] he shouted. But {{we stood}} still, with yearning <b>eyes</b> <b>staring</b> {{back through the}} frantic forms for a sight of Tom's.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am," [...] {{answered}} Maggie firmly, as {{she laid}} Flora on the table, her black <b>eyes</b> <b>staring</b> as if rather alarmed at this sudden start.|$|E

60|$|She {{shook her}} head without replying. She had averted her face, and her <b>eyes</b> were <b>staring</b> down at the gently heaving water. After a moment she spoke, her voice steady and {{perfectly}} controlled.|$|R
