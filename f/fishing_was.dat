5|$|<b>Fishing</b> <b>was</b> an {{important}} source of food for the monks of Glastonbury Abbey. <b>Fishing</b> <b>was</b> carried out in artificial ponds, which were mentioned at Meare in the Domesday Book and from the River Brue and Meare Pool. The present rectangular stone building was constructed by the abbot between 1322 and 1335 for the storage and processing of the fish and as a residence for the chief fisherman. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the building fell into disrepair and it was seriously damaged by fire in the 1880s. Some restoration has been undertaken during the 20th century, including the replacement of the roof in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Villages {{were usually}} {{concentrated}} around irrigation reservoirs to enable {{easy access to}} water for agriculture. Houses stood immediately below the reservoir embankment, between {{the water and the}} paddy fields below. This facilitated easy control of the water supply to the fields and also supported maintenance of domestic gardens for fruit and vegetable production. A village typically consisted of a cluster of dwellings, paddy fields, a reservoir, a grazing ground, shift crop reserves and a village forest. In areas of high rainfall, a perennial watercourse often took the place of the reservoir. Inland <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> widespread during the Anuradhapura Kingdom period because of the numerous reservoirs. Although not entirely absent, sea <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> not common during this period mainly because of the rudimentary nature of transporting sea fish to cities which were located far inland.|$|E
5|$|Lobster <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> {{done on a}} {{small scale}} {{especially}} in Cardigan Bay, but was reserved almost exclusively for export. Welsh fisherman {{would be more likely to}} eat the less profitable crabs. Cockles have been harvested since Roman times and are still harvested in a traditional manner with a hand rake and scraper. Cockle picking still happens in the Gower peninsula, but due to the difficulty in getting licences and reduced yield, villages near the Carmarthen Bay no longer gather them.|$|E
50|$|Recreational <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> <b>fishing</b> for {{pleasure}} or competition. It can be contrasted with commercial <b>fishing,</b> which <b>is</b> <b>fishing</b> for economic profit, or subsistence <b>fishing,</b> which <b>is</b> <b>fishing</b> for survival.|$|R
50|$|Bait <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> {{contrasted with}} forage <b>fish.</b> Bait <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a term used {{particularly}} by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch fish to bait longlines and traps. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a fisheries term, {{and is used}} in that context. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> small <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> preyed on in the wild by larger predators for food. The predators can <b>be</b> other larger <b>fish,</b> seabirds and marine mammals. Bait <b>fish,</b> by contrast, <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> caught by humans to use as bait for other fish. The terms also overlap {{in the sense that}} most bait <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also forage <b>fish,</b> and most forage <b>fish</b> can also <b>be</b> used as bait fish.|$|R
50|$|Game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> {{pursued by}} {{recreational}} anglers. They can be freshwater or saltwater fish. Game <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> eaten after being caught. Some game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also targeted commercially, particularly salmon.|$|R
5|$|Members of this {{community}} also herd zebu and catch fish in Lake Alaotra. The work of <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> traditionally subdivided by gender: men were only allowed to fish for eels, while women were tasked to use nets to catch small fish, and children {{were the only ones}} allowed to fish using poles. Men and children would traditionally leave their catch on the shore for women to pick up and take back to the village.|$|E
5|$|After being remanded to {{determine}} if the regulations were not discriminatory, the case returned to the United States Supreme Court in Department of Game of Washington v. Puyallup Tribe (Puyallyp II). Again, Justice Douglas wrote the opinion for the Court, but this time he struck down the state restrictions as discriminatory. Douglas noted that the restrictions for catching steelhead trout with nets had remained, and was a method used only by the Indians, whereas hook and line <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> allowed but was used only by non-Indians. As such, the effect of the regulation allocated all of the steelhead trout fishing to sport anglers, and none to the tribes.|$|E
5|$|One {{hundred and}} fifty loom weights were found {{suggesting}} wool was {{an important aspect of}} Norse-era life. Line weights from the later Norse period and associated evidence from elsewhere in Shetland indicates that deep-water <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> also a regular undertaking. The Jarlshof site also produced ample evidence of the use of iron tools such as shears, scissors, sickles, and a fish-hook and knife. The ore was locally obtained bog iron. Hazel, birch and willow grew in the area at this time but the pine and oak must have been driftwood or imported timber.|$|E
50|$|Standard size of male <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> 3.2″ (8cm) {{and female}} <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> 4.8″ (12cm).|$|R
50|$|Hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>are</b> {{popular among}} the {{residents}} of the town. Hunters chiefly pursue white-tailed deer, pheasant, quail, and raccoon. Local <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> focused on catfish. Other game animals and <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also found in the area.|$|R
5000|$|Fishing - Catch {{some fish}} for points. Small <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> worth 100 points, medium <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> worth 200 points, and big <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> worth 300 points. Careful! Do not catch the shark, {{if you catch}} it, you'll lose 1000 points. 1 ...|$|R
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of English {{soldiers}} by ship, and naval battles on the seas, areas used for salt water fishing became perilous, and lay dormant {{for much of the}} war. In addition, many of the fishing vessels were converted into warships. Before the war, there was often talk about the excess of lobsters and cod off the shores of New England. This seemed to change during and after the war, due to the vast numbers of ships and artillery entering the ocean waters. Once lobster harvesting and cod <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> reestablished, most fishermen found that the lobster and cod had migrated away from the shores.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> a $6 billion industry, {{employing}} 60,000 {{jobs for}} sports and commercial purposes.|$|E
25|$|Fish bones, fishing hooks, barbed {{spears and}} {{harpoons}} show that <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> {{an important part}} of the economy.|$|E
5000|$|A game <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> any {{species of}} fish pursued for sport by recreationalists (anglers). The capture of game <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> usually tightly regulated. In comparison, nongame <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> all <b>fish</b> not {{considered}} game fish. Game <b>fish</b> may <b>be</b> eaten after being caught, though increasingly anglers are practicing catch-and-release tactics to improve fish populations.|$|R
50|$|Smoked <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> <b>fish</b> {{that has}} <b>been</b> cured by smoking. Foods have been smoked by humans {{throughout}} history. Originally {{this was done}} as a preservative. In more recent times <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> readily preserved by refrigeration and freezing and the smoking of <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> generally done for the unique taste and flavour imparted by the smoking process.|$|R
25|$|Forage <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as bait fish or feeder <b>fish.</b> Bait <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a term used particularly by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch fish to bait longlines and traps. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a fisheries term, and is used in the context of fisheries. Bait <b>fish,</b> by contrast, <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> caught by humans to use as bait for other fish. The terms overlap in the sense that most bait <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also forage <b>fish,</b> and vice versa. Feeder <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a term used particularly in the context of fish aquariums. It refers essentially to the same concept as forage fish, small <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> eaten by larger fish, but the term is adapted to the particular requirements of working with fish in aquariums.|$|R
25|$|The early {{evolution}} of fishing as recreation is not clear. For example, there is anecdotal evidence for fly fishing in Japan, however, fly <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> {{likely to have}} been a means of survival, rather than recreation. The earliest English essay on recreational <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> published in 1496, by Dame Juliana Berners, the prioress of the Benedictine Sopwell Nunnery. The essay was titled Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle, and included detailed information on fishing waters, the construction of rods and lines, and the use of natural baits and artificial flies.|$|E
25|$|No <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> {{allowed in}} the river Nojiri in the region Okuaizu in Fukushima after-mid March 2012. The fish caught in this river {{contained}} 119 to 139 becquerels of radioactive cesium per kilogram, although this river is located some 130kilometers from the damaged reactors. In 2011 at this place the fish measured about 50 becquerels per kilogram, and the fishing season was opened as usual. But <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> not popular in 2011. Local people {{hoped it would be}} better in 2012. After the new findings the fishing season was prosponed.|$|E
25|$|Important {{industries}} in the islands, some of the fishing boats had sailed away to England in June 1940. <b>Fishing</b> <b>was</b> banned in September 1940 following an escape. When permitted again, restrictions were put over them, including limiting their access to fuel.|$|E
5000|$|The jellynose fishes or tadpole <b>fishes</b> <b>are</b> {{the small}} order Ateleopodiformes. This group of ray-finned <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> monotypic, {{containing}} a single family Ateleopodidae. It has {{about a dozen}} species in four genera, but these enigmatic <b>fishes</b> <b>are</b> in need of taxonomic revision.|$|R
25|$|Like coastal {{demersal}} fish, {{deep sea}} demersal <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> divided into benthic fish and benthopelagic fish, where the benthic <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> negatively buoyant and benthopelagic <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> neutrally buoyant.|$|R
50|$|In Hinduism, The Rainbow <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> a <b>fish</b> that <b>was</b> {{as large}} as a whale. It ate Buddha, an {{incarnation}} of the deity Vishnu. The Rainbow <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> caught and killed by some fishermen who freed Buddha from its stomach. After The Rainbow <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> caught, it provided an entire nation with food for a year.|$|R
25|$|By 1975 {{the popular}} {{commercial}} fish blue pike had been declared extinct, although the declaration {{may have been}} premature. By the 1980s, there were about 130 fishing vessels with about 3,000 workers, but commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> declining rapidly, particularly from the American side.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} fishing, {{particularly}} herring <b>fishing,</b> <b>was</b> {{a very large}} part of the economy of Burghead. Langoustine fishing, mainly for the Continental market, now contributes very little to the overall economy; in 2001, fishing accounted for just 2.12% of employment in Burghead.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the use of}} spearguns and {{dynamite}} for <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> banned through {{efforts of}} local conservationists in the 1960s, the wildlife is unafraid of snorkelers and divers. Coral bleaching in 1998 has damaged most reefs, but some reefs show healthy recovery (e.g., Silhouette Island).|$|E
50|$|Oily <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> {{contrasted with}} white fish, which contain oil {{only in the}} liver, and much less overall than oily fish. Examples of white <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> cod, haddock and flatfish. White <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> usually {{demersal}} <b>fish</b> which live {{on or near the}} seafloor, whereas oily <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> pelagic, living in the water column away from the bottom.|$|R
50|$|Coarse <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> a {{term used}} in the United Kingdom and Ireland for angling for coarse <b>fish.</b> Coarse <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{freshwater}} <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> distinguished from game fish. Freshwater game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> all salmonids - most particularly salmon, trout and char - so generally coarse <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> freshwater <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> not salmonids. There is disagreement over whether grayling should be classified as a game fish or a coarse <b>fish.</b> Fly <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> the technique usually used for freshwater game fishing, while other angling techniques are usually used for coarse fishing. The sport of coarse fishing and the techniques it uses are particularly popular in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe, and {{as well as in}} some former British Commonwealth countries and among British expatriates.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> sold {{in local}} markets {{as a food}} source and small <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> used in {{preparation}} of prahok.|$|R
25|$|Until the mid1960s, <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> {{perceived}} as Lowestoft's main industry, although from the 1930s {{the percentage of}} those employed directly and in trades associated with <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> actually only about 10 per cent of the working population. Fleets of drifters and trawlers caught fish such as herring, cod and plaice. Catches have diminished since the 1960s and, although by the 1980s 100 boats remained, there are now only a few small boats operating out of Lowestoft, with no large trawlers. By 2011 just three traders remained at the town's fish market which is under threat of closure due to the redevelopment of the port. The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), a large fisheries research centre that {{is a part of}} Defra, is still located in Lowestoft.|$|E
25|$|Within a few days, {{trees in}} the {{vicinity}} became barren and bloated animal carcasses had to be disposed of. 170,000 people were treated at hospitals and temporary dispensaries; 2,000 buffalo, goats, and other animals were collected and buried. Supplies, including food, became scarce owing to suppliers' safety fears. <b>Fishing</b> <b>was</b> prohibited causing further supply shortages.|$|E
25|$|Shore {{gathering}} of limpets, winkles and ormers were permitted in certain places at certain times. Rod <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> also permitted on some beaches, care {{had to be}} taken of barbed wire and mines. Limpet pie was quite tasty but required two hours of boiling before being trimmed and then baked with swede in an oven.|$|E
50|$|Polypterus katangae <b>is</b> a <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> {{found in}} central African lakes and rivers. Another {{name for the}} <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> P. congicus.|$|R
50|$|The lake is poor in nutritients, and {{consequently}} <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> not very important. Nevertheless, in 2001 10,000 kg <b>fish</b> <b>were</b> caught.|$|R
50|$|Cironka (Циронка) is a {{traditional}} Macedonian dish. It originates from Prespa region. This dish is made from common bleak. The fresh <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> salted {{with a lot of}} salt until they become whitish. Then, the <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> left in a bowl for six to seven days. The bowl must be covered and except the fish, we can put some nettle. After that, the <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> threaded and they're left to dry on sunny weather, until they get hard. Then the <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> fried on both sides, and placed in hot water to become less salty. The <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> served with some peppermint, oil, vinegar and garlic.|$|R
