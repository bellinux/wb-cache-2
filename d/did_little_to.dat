5|$|From mid-1966 {{until the}} end of 1967, President Johnson {{continued}} to dole out sensitive targets one by one to the generals while simultaneously trying to placate the doves in Congress and within his own administration with periodic cutbacks and half-hearted peace initiatives. In the end, this erratic course satisfied no one and <b>did</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> alter the course of the war.|$|E
5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that <b>did</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> ensure prisoner welfare. The department was at the same time renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of his 1922 {{re-election}} bid, Barkley was the ranking Democrat on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. In the election, he carried every First District county, including the Republican strongholds of Caldwell and Crittenden counties. Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K. Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a desire to become governor, may have motivated him to announce his candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics charged that this was his intent, and he <b>did</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> deny it.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of the 2004–05 NHL season by the NHL lockout, Brashear signed with the Quebec Radio X of the semi-pro Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey league (LNAH). The deal was reportedly worth $300,000. He registered 18 goals and 50 points in 47 games, but was reluctant to fight and felt the League <b>did</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> protect him from players wanting {{to make a name}} for themselves against an established NHL enforcer. Brashear was suspended from the League following an incident where he continued punching a player in the face while he was lying on the ice.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius' {{accession}} as Emperor <b>did</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> {{reduce the}} Persian threat. Heraclius began his reign {{by attempting to}} make peace with the Persians, since Phocas, whose actions were the original casus belli, had been overthrown. The Persians rejected these overtures, however, since their armies were widely victorious. According to historian Walter Kaegi, it is conceivable that the Persians' goal was to restore or even surpass the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire by destroying the Byzantine empire, though because of the loss of Persian archives, no document survives to conclusively prove this.|$|E
5|$|In the 1908 presidential election, Bradley {{supported}} Charles W. Fairbanks for the Republican nomination, while Willson favored William Howard Taft. Disharmony marred {{the state}} nominating convention, and despite being a newly minted senator, Bradley was not chosen as a {{delegate to the}} Republican National Convention. This infuriated Bradley and ended his alliance with Willson. In the 1911 Republican nominating convention, Bradley did not support Edward C. O'Rear, the party's eventual gubernatorial nominee. He <b>did</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> support O'Rear in the general election, and former governor James B. McCreary was elected.|$|E
5|$|Killebrew was {{bothered by}} injury {{early in the}} 1960 season. In March, he had surgery for nasal irritation, and a {{recurring}} hamstring injury caused him to miss most of May. On his return, he remained in the lineup {{for the rest of}} the season, finishing the year with 31 home runs in 124 games. Killebrew's arrival and home runs <b>did</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> improve the Senators' record, as they finished in the second division of the American League every year he played for Washington, including four years in last place. Following the 1960 season, the Senators moved to Minnesota and became the Minnesota Twins.|$|E

5|$|Marshall did {{not believe}} in rule by the masses, {{frequently}} expressing his disdain for the common people. His sharp wit and lack of tact in writing <b>did</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> endear him to his neighbors. Like most of the members of his family, he subscribed to Federalist principles, although the majority of Kentuckians were affiliated with the Democratic-Republicans. He was also ostracized by many of his neighbors for being zealously antireligious. He wrote pamphlets denouncing religion of all kinds and published them at his own expense. His later descendants were so embarrassed of his anti-religious writings that they had his personal papers burned.|$|E
5|$|More {{recordings}} {{as leader}} ensued following Hope's return to New York, but they <b>did</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> gain him more public or critical attention. Further drug and health problems reduced {{the frequency of}} his public performances, which ended a year before his death, {{at the age of}} 43. He remains little known, despite, or because of, the individuality of his playing and composing, which were complex and stressed subtlety and variation rather than the virtuosity predominant in bebop.|$|E

5|$|Since Andros' {{commission}} included Connecticut, {{he asked}} Connecticut Governor Robert Treat to surrender the colonial charter {{not long after}} his arrival in Boston. Unlike Rhode Island, whose officials readily acceded to the dominion, Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros' authority, but <b>did</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> assist him. They continued to run their government according to the charter, holding quarterly meetings of the legislature and electing colony-wide officials, while Treat and Andros negotiated over the surrender of the charter.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{companies}} that he recorded for at this stage in his career reduced Hope's dignity, in the view of musician and critic Robert Palmer. One album was entitled High Hope! (1961), and another, released as Sounds from Rikers Island (1963) in reference to a New York City jail complex, featured performances exclusively by musicians who had at some point been imprisoned for drug-related crimes. Between these two sessions as leader, Hope was briefly in prison again for drug offenses. These and other album releases in the early 1960s <b>did</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> develop a wider awareness of Hope.|$|E

He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages.|$|E

5|$|Tyler {{declined}} to seek renomination in late 1820, citing ill health.
