40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} of the fly's movement detection system is analysed using the visually induced yaw torque generated uring tethered flight as a behavioural indicator. In earlier studies usually {{large parts of the}} visual field were exposed to the movement stimuli; the fly's response, therefore, represented the spatially pooled output signals {{of a large number of}} local <b>movement</b> <b>detectors.</b> Here we examined the responses of individual <b>movement</b> <b>detectors.</b> The stimulus pattern was presented to the fly via small vertical slits, thus, nearly avoiding spatial integration of local movement information along the horizontal axis of the eye. The stimulus consisted of a vertically oriented sine-wave grating which was moved with a constant velocity either clockwise or counterclockwise. In agreement with the theory of <b>movement</b> <b>detectors</b> of the correlation type, the time-course of the detector signal is modulated with the spatial phase of the stimulus pattern. It can even assume negative values for some time during the response cycle and thus signal the wrong direction of motion. By spatially integrating the response over sufficiently large arrays of <b>movement</b> <b>detectors</b> these response modulations disappear. Fi-nally, one obtains a signal of the movement detection system which is constant while the pattern moves in one direction and only changes its sign when the pattern reverses its direction of motion. Spatial in-tegration thus represents a simple means to obtain a meaningful representations of motion information...|$|R
40|$|The {{computations}} {{performed by}} individual <b>movement</b> <b>detectors</b> are analyzed by intracellularly recording from an identified direction-selective motion-sensitive interneuron in the fly's brain and by comparing these results with model predictions based on <b>movement</b> <b>detectors</b> of the correlation type. Three main conclusions were drawn {{with respect to}} the movement-detection system of the fly: (1) The essential nonlinear interaction between the two movement-detector input channels can be characterized formally by a mathematically almost perfect multiplication process. (2) Even at high contrasts no significant nonlinearities seem to distort the time course of the movement-detector input signals. (3) The <b>movement</b> <b>detectors</b> of the fly are not perfectly antisymmetrical; i. e., they respond with different time courses and amplitudes to motion in their preferred and null directions. As a consequence of this property, the motion detectors can respond to some degree to stationary patterns whose brightness is modulated in time. Moreover, the direction selectivity, i. e., the relative difference of the responses to motion in the preferred and null directions, depends on the contrast and on the spatial-frequency content of the stimulus pattern...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>movement</b> {{primitives}} {{for movement}} generation motivated by convergent force fields in frog <b>Dynamic</b> <b>movement</b> primitives (DMP) {{have been introduced}} to robotics as a general framework for motion generation [1, 2]. They represent a motion {{with a set of}} differential equations. These equations can be adapted to generate any movement trajectory. Among the favorable properties are a simple generalization of a represented movement to new targets (just be changing a goal parameter) and robustness against perturbations due to the attractor dynamics of the equations. Here, we demonstrate a link between DMP and neurophysiology: DMP can be motivated from convergent force fields that are observed in frog after spinal stimulation [3]. Moreover, this derivation provides us with a new form of DMP that generalize better towards new goals. In the following, we describe how DMP are used to generate motion, show the motivation and derivation from neurophysiology, and finally, demonstrate the utility of the new equations in a robot experiment with the Sarcos slave arm. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>movement</b> primitives A <b>dynamic</b> <b>movement</b> primitive generates a motion x(t) with a differential equation [1].

40|$|Abstract—The {{framework}} of <b>dynamic</b> <b>movement</b> primitives contains many favorable properties for {{the execution of}} robotic trajectories, such as indirect dependency on time, response to perturbations, {{and the ability to}} easily modulate the given trajectories, but the framework in its original form remains constrained to the kinematic aspect of the movement. In this paper we bridge the gap to dynamic behavior by extending the framework with force/torque feedback. We propose and evaluate a modulation approach that allows interaction with objects and the environment. Through the proposed coupling of originally independent robotic trajectories, the approach also enables the execution of bimanual and tightly coupled cooperative tasks. We apply an iterative learning control algorithm to learn a coupling term, which is applied to the original trajectory in a feed-forward fashion and thus modifies the trajectory in accordance to the desired positions or external forces. A stability analysis and results of simulated and real-world experiments using two KUKA LWR arms for bimanual tasks and interaction with the environment are presented. By expanding on the {{framework of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>movement</b> primitives, we keep all the favorable properties, which is demonstrated with temporal modulation and in a two-agent obstacle avoidance task.
