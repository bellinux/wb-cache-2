25|$|During {{their time}} in Britain, the ancient Romans {{encountered}} tribes in present-day Wales that they called the Ordovices, the Demetae, the Silures and the Deceangli. The people {{of what is now}} Wales were not distinguished {{from the rest of the}} peoples of southern Britain; all were called Britons and spoke the common British language, a Brythonic Celtic tongue. Celtic language and culture seems to have arrived in Britain during the Iron Age, though some archaeologists argue that there is no evidence for large-scale Iron Age migrations into Great Britain. The claim has also been made that Indo-European languages may have been introduced to the British Isles as early as the early Neolithic (or even earlier), with Goidelic and Brythonic languages developing indigenously. Others hold that the close similarity between the Goidelic and Brythonic branches, and their sharing of Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age terminology with their continental relatives, point to a more recent introduction of Indo-European languages (or close communication), with Proto-Celtic itself unlikely to have existed before the end of the 2nd millennium BC at the earliest. The genetic <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> would show that the change to Celtic languages in Britain may have occurred as a cultural shift rather than through migration as was previously supposed.|$|E

Another incriminating evidence used by the communist authorities was a clandestine translation of Eliade's own Noaptea de Sânziene novel, transported into Romania and made accessible to Cioculescu. According to Eliade, although Cioculescu [...] "didn't have to suffer the consequences", it was he who lent a copy to Pillat, Streinu and writer Nicolae Steinhardt, all of whom were arrested and sentenced to long prison terms. Slătineanu was also among those arrested, and died a mysterious death while being investigated. When confronted with news of his friend's death, Cioculescu wrote: [...] "a world is gone".|$|E

On 31 July 2003 the Trial Chamber found him not guilty of genocide, complicity in genocide, or forcible transfer (a crime against humanity). He was found guilty of: extermination, (a crime against humanity); murder, (a violation of the laws and customs of war); and persecutions (crimes against humanity, incorporating murder, and deportation both of which were also crimes against humanity). He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 20 years. The Appeals Chamber affirmed the Trial Chamber’s decision to convict Stakić for his responsibility in exterminating, murdering and persecuting the non-Serb population in Prijedor. The Appeals Chamber also found that the Trial Chamber incorrectly failed to convict him for deporting and forcibly transferring the non-Serb population. The Appeals Chamber agreed with the Trial Chamber’s decision to acquit Milomir Stakić of genocide and complicity in genocide. The Appeals Chamber indicated that [...] "ithout question, the Trial Chamber made factual findings which could, in principle, be taken as evidence that the Appellant intended to destroy the Bosnian Muslim group in part, including those identified by the Prosecution", but that it [...] "cannot conclude that the <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> is so unambiguous that a reasonable Trial Chamber was obliged to infer that intent was established beyond a reasonable doubt". The Appeals Chamber found that Stakić participated in a joint criminal enterprise whose purpose was to commit crimes against the Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat populations of Prijedor. These crimes were part of a campaign to persecute the non-Serb population of Prijedor, with the final goal of creating a Serbian municipality eventually to form part of an envisaged pure Serbian state. He was sentenced to 40 years’ imprisonment.|$|E
