25|$|During the {{previous}} {{editions of the}} Africa Cup of Nations, the ball used was not a ball especially made for the tournament. As the tournament was held on even years, the same years big tournaments such as the UEFA European Cup of Nations or the FIFA World Cup were held, the official ball for the tournament held this year {{was used for the}} African Cup of Nations: the Adidas Roteiro in 2004, or the Adidas Teamgeist in 2006. However, for the 2008 tournament, Adidas made a special ball, clearly different from the Adidas <b>Europass</b> going to be used five months later for the Euro. The ball was named Wawa Aba and was designed to include host nation Ghana’s red, yellow and green. The ball was later used for the other African competitions.|$|E
500|$|The match {{ball for}} the final was the Adidas Finale Moscow, the eighth in the Adidas Finale range.

500|$|The {{official}} match {{ball for}} the 2009 Champions League final was the adidas Finale Rome.

The colour scheme was a traditional Roman burgundy with a gold border around the stars. The ball used the same panel configuration as the Adidas <b>Europass</b> and the Adidas Teamgeist before it, and the same thermal bonding process was used to adhere the panels to each other, while the surface of the ball featured the same [...] "PSC-Texture" [...] as was debuted with the Europass; the surface of the ball was covered with thousands of tiny pimples, which was designed to improve the grip between boot and ball.|$|E
