In this paper, we aimed evaluate the performance of LiDAR data for individual tree detection in Eucalyptus sp plantation using filter of variable and <b>fixed</b> <b>windows</b> size applied by Local Maximum (LM) algorithm implemented in FUSION software. The results show that LiDAR has a good accuracy of tree individual tree detection, and that filter of <b>fixed</b> <b>windows</b> (FJF) size has a better performance than filter of variable windows size (FJV). The better accuracy to individual tree detection using <b>fixed</b> <b>windows</b> size was of the 98. 57 %, whereas in variable windows size was of the 17, 07 %.

40|$|Searching for protein {{sequence}} and structural motifs {{is one of}} the most important topics in Bioinformatics, because the motifs are able to determine the role of the proteins. A <b>fixed</b> <b>window</b> size is usually defined in advance for the most of motif searching algorithms. The <b>fixed</b> <b>window</b> size may result in generating a number of similar motifs shifted by one to several bases or including mismatches. In this study, to confront the mismatched motifs problem, we use the super-rule concept to construct a Super-Rule-Tree (SRT) which is generated by the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. This SRT recognizes the similar motifs. Analysis of the hierarchical DBSCAN generated Super-Rule-Tree shows a better quality in secondary structure similarity evaluation than the previous studies’. We believe that the combination of DBSCAN and SRT concept may provide a new point of view to similar researches which require predefined <b>fixed</b> <b>window</b> size.

40|$|The Viterbi {{algorithm}} is an efficient and optimal method for decoding linear-chain Markov Models. However, the entire input sequence must be observed before the labels for any time step can be generated, and therefore Viterbi cannot be directly applied to online/interactive/streaming scenarios without incurring significant (possibly unbounded) latency. A widely used {{approach is to}} break the input stream into fixed-size windows, and apply Viterbi to each window. Larger windows lead to higher accuracy, but result in higher latency. We propose several alternative algorithms to the fixed-sized window decoding approach. These approaches compute a certainty measure on predicted labels {{that allows us to}} trade off latency for expected accuracy dynamically, without having to choose a <b>fixed</b> <b>window</b> size up front. Not surprisingly, this more principled approach gives us a substantial improvement over choosing a <b>fixed</b> <b>window.</b> We show the effectiveness of the approach for the task of spotting semistructured information in large documents. When compared to full Viterbi, the approach suffers a 0. 1 percent error degradation with a average latency of 2. 6 time steps (versus the potentially infinite latency of Viterbi).

To confront the mismatched motifs problem, we use the super-rule concept to construct a Super-Rule-Tree (SRT) by a modified HHK clustering which requires no parameter setup to identify the similarities and dissimilarities between the motifs. By analyzing the motifs results generated by our approach, they are not only significant in sequence area but secondary structure similarity.

40|$|In this assignment, {{you will}} {{implement}} an algorithm for normalizing face image using SVD. Face normalization is a required preprocessing step for many face recognition algorithms {{to account for}} variations with respect to face location, orientation (in-plane), and scale. To address these issues, you will implement an iterative algorithm based on affine transformations. Figure 1. An example showing facial features of interest for normalization. The main idea is using an affine transformation to map certain facial features to predetermined locations in a <b>fixed</b> <b>window</b> (see Figure 1). Figure 2 shows examples of un-normalized and normalized faces; normalization was performed by mapping the left eye center, right eye center, and mouth center to predetermined locations in a fixed 20 x 20 window. Figure 2. Examples of face images before (top) and after (bottom) normalization. The face images {{to be used in}} your experiments are available from the course’s webpage. You will use the following five facial features for normalization: (1) left eye center, (2) right eye center, (3) tip of nose, (4) mouth center, and (5) tip of chin. The coordinates of these features have been extracted manually and are available from the course’s webpage. In practice, however, these features should be extracted automatically. <b>Fixed</b> <b>window</b> You will be using a <b>fixed</b> <b>window</b> of size 48 x 40. Note that the original images have size 112 x 92, so this choice maintains the aspect ratio of the face images.

Algorithm You need to implement the algorithm described below to compute the parameters of an affine transformation that maps the facial features of each image to the predetermined facial feature locations in the 48 x 40 window. This can be done in different ways.
