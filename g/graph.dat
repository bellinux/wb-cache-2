5|$|An st-planar <b>graph</b> is a {{connected}} planar <b>graph</b> {{together with}} a bipolar orientation of that <b>graph,</b> an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a <b>graph</b> may be made into a strongly connected <b>graph</b> by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar <b>graph</b> is itself the augmentation of another st-planar <b>graph.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern <b>graph</b> of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger <b>graph,</b> can be solved in linear time when the larger <b>graph</b> has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting whether the pattern <b>graph</b> is an induced subgraph of the larger <b>graph,</b> or whether it has a <b>graph</b> homomorphism to the larger <b>graph.</b> For the same reason, the problem of testing whether a <b>graph</b> of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E
5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest <b>graph</b> contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 <b>graph</b> may be contracted {{to form a}} butterfly <b>graph</b> (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta <b>graph</b> may be contracted to form a diamond <b>graph</b> (four-vertex theta <b>graph),</b> so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a <b>graph</b> is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger <b>graph</b> family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the dual}} <b>graph</b> {{depends on a}} {{particular}} embedding, the dual <b>graph</b> of a planar <b>graph</b> is not unique {{in the sense that}} the same planar <b>graph</b> can have non-isomorphic dual graphs. In the picture, the blue graphs are isomorphic but their dual red graphs are not. The upper red dual has a vertex with degree 6 (corresponding to the outer face of the blue <b>graph)</b> while in the lower red <b>graph</b> all degrees are less than 6.|$|E
5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the <b>graph</b> is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual <b>graph,</b> is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar <b>graph</b> is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual <b>graph</b> is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar <b>graph</b> has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar <b>graph</b> (a <b>graph</b> formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar <b>graph</b> by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite <b>graph</b> , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E

50|$|Penny <b>graphs</b> are {{a special}} case of the coin <b>graphs</b> (<b>graphs</b> that can be {{represented}} by tangencies of non-crossing circles of arbitrary radii). Because the coin <b>graphs</b> {{are the same as}} the planar <b>graphs,</b> all penny <b>graphs</b> are planar. The penny <b>graphs</b> are also unit disk <b>graphs</b> (the intersection <b>graphs</b> of unit circles), unit distance <b>graphs</b> (<b>graphs</b> that can be drawn with all edges having equal lengths, allowing crossings), and matchstick <b>graphs</b> (<b>graphs</b> that can be drawn in the plane with equal-length straight edges and no edge crossings).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{classical}} clique tree {{approach to}} chordal <b>graphs</b> (and, more recently, to strongly chordal <b>graphs)</b> can {{be generalized to}} show a common structure for other classes of <b>graphs,</b> including clique <b>graphs</b> of chordal <b>graphs,</b> outerplanar <b>graphs,</b> distance-hereditary <b>graphs,</b> and chordal bipartite <b>graphs...</b>|$|R
25|$|Special {{cases of}} the cographs include the {{complete}} <b>graphs,</b> complete bipartite <b>graphs,</b> cluster <b>graphs,</b> and threshold <b>graphs.</b> The cographs are, in turn, special {{cases of the}} distance-hereditary <b>graphs,</b> comparability <b>graphs,</b> and perfect <b>graphs.</b>|$|R
5|$|A classic {{result of}} <b>graph</b> theory states that a <b>graph</b> of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty <b>graph</b> has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order <b>graph</b> has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any <b>graph</b> has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E
5|$|A {{connected}} component of an undirected <b>graph</b> is the subgraph {{consisting of the}} vertices and edges that {{can be reached by}} following edges from a single given starting vertex. A <b>graph</b> is connected if every vertex or edge is reachable from every other vertex or edge. A cycle in an undirected <b>graph</b> is a connected subgraph in which each vertex is incident to exactly two edges, or is a loop.|$|E
5|$|A core is a <b>graph</b> with no {{homomorphism}} to any proper subgraph. Equivalently, a core can {{be defined}} as a <b>graph</b> that does not retract to any proper subgraph.|$|E
40|$|By {{applying}} the Tutte decomposition of 2 -connected <b>graphs</b> into 3 [...] block trees we provide unique structural characterizations of several classes of 2 -connected <b>graphs,</b> including minimally 2 -connected <b>graphs,</b> minimally 2 -edge-connected <b>graphs,</b> critically 2 -connected <b>graphs,</b> critically 2 -edge-connected <b>graphs,</b> 3 -edge-connected <b>graphs,</b> 2 -connected cubic <b>graphs</b> and 3 -connected cubic <b>graphs.</b> We also give a characterization of minimally 3 -connected <b>graphs...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The five basic {{classes of}} perfect <b>graphs</b> {{that form the}} base case of this {{structural}} decomposition are the bipartite <b>graphs,</b> line <b>graphs</b> of bipartite <b>graphs,</b> complementary <b>graphs</b> of bipartite <b>graphs,</b> complements of line <b>graphs</b> of bipartite <b>graphs,</b> and double split <b>graphs.</b> It {{is easy to see}} that bipartite <b>graphs</b> are perfect: in any nontrivial induced subgraph, the clique number and chromatic number are both two and therefore both equal. The perfection of complements of bipartite <b>graphs,</b> and of complements of line <b>graphs</b> of bipartite <b>graphs,</b> are both equivalent to König's theorem relating the sizes of maximum matchings, maximum independent sets, and minimum vertex covers in bipartite <b>graphs.</b> The perfection of line <b>graphs</b> of bipartite <b>graphs</b> can be stated equivalently as the fact that bipartite <b>graphs</b> have chromatic index equal to their maximum degree, proven by [...] Thus, all four of these basic classes are perfect.

5000|$|Chordal <b>graphs,</b> the <b>graphs</b> {{in which}} every cycle of four or more {{vertices}} has a chord, an edge between two vertices that are not consecutive in the cycle. These include the forests, k-trees (maximal <b>graphs</b> with a given treewidth), split <b>graphs</b> (<b>graphs</b> that can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set), block <b>graphs</b> (<b>graphs</b> {{in which every}} biconnected component is a clique), Ptolemaic <b>graphs</b> (<b>graphs</b> whose distances obey Ptolemy's inequality), interval <b>graphs</b> (<b>graphs</b> in which each vertex represents an interval of a line and each edge represents a nonempty intersection between two intervals), trivially perfect <b>graphs</b> (interval <b>graphs</b> for nested intervals), threshold <b>graphs</b> (<b>graphs</b> in which two vertices are adjacent when their total weight exceeds a numerical threshold), windmill <b>graphs</b> (formed by joining equal cliques at a common vertex), and strongly chordal <b>graphs</b> (chordal <b>graphs</b> in which every even cycle of length six or more has an odd chord).|$|R

5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication <b>graph.</b> An implication <b>graph</b> is a directed <b>graph</b> {{in which there}} is one vertex per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication <b>graph</b> must be a skew-symmetric <b>graph,</b> meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{direction}} that generalizes interval <b>graphs</b> and permutation <b>graphs</b> to trapezoid <b>graphs,</b> researchers {{are now trying to}} generalize the class known as trapezoid <b>graphs.</b> A circle trapezoid is the region in a circle that lies between two non-crossing chords; thus, circle trapezoid <b>graphs</b> are the intersecting <b>graphs</b> of circle trapezoids within a circle. It should be noted that circle trapezoid <b>graphs</b> properly contain trapezoid <b>graphs,</b> circle <b>graphs</b> and circular-arc <b>graphs</b> as subclasses. Circle trapezoid <b>graphs</b> {{should not be confused with}} circular trapezoid <b>graphs.</b> A circular trapezoid is the region within two parallel circles that lies between two non-crossing segments; circular trapezoid <b>graphs</b> are the intersecting <b>graphs</b> of circular trapezoids between two parallel circles. In this paper, the author presents results on two proper super classes of trapezoid <b>graphs,</b> including circle trapezoid <b>graphs</b> and circular trapezoid <b>graphs.</b> It is shown that circle trapezoid <b>graphs</b> and circular trapezoid <b>graphs</b> are two distinct classes of <b>graphs.</b> Furthermore, it is shown that the maximum weighted independent set on circular trapezoid <b>graphs</b> can be found in O(n 2 loglog n) time; whereas, the minimum weighted independent dominating set of circular trapezoid <b>graphs</b> can be found in O(n 2 log n) time...|$|R

5|$|Any {{directed}} <b>graph</b> may be {{made into}} a DAG by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set, a set of vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles. However, the smallest such set is NP-hard to find. An arbitrary directed <b>graph</b> may also be transformed into a DAG, called its condensation, by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single supervertex. When the <b>graph</b> is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is the <b>graph</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Every 3-colorable <b>graph</b> G that {{contains}} a triangle (that is, has the complete <b>graph</b> K3 as a subgraph) is homomorphically equivalent to K3. This is because, on one hand, a 3-coloring of G {{is the same as}} a homomorphism G → K3, as explained below. On the other hand, every subgraph of G trivially admits a homomorphism into G, implying K3 → G. This also means that K3 is the core of any such <b>graph</b> G. Similarly, every bipartite <b>graph</b> that has at least one edge is equivalent to K2.|$|E
