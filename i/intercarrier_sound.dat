50|$|The {{video carrier}} is {{demodulated}} {{to give a}} composite video signal; this contains luminance, chrominance and synchronization signals; this {{is identical to the}} video signal format used by analog video devices such as VCRs or CCTV cameras. Note that the RF signal modulation is inverted compared to the conventional AM: the minimum video signal level corresponds to maximum carrier amplitude, and vice versa. To ensure good linearity (fidelity), consistent with affordable manufacturing costs of transmitters and receivers, the video carrier is never shut off altogether. When <b>intercarrier</b> <b>sound</b> was invented later in 1948, not completely shutting off the carrier had the side effect of allowing <b>intercarrier</b> <b>sound</b> to be economically implemented.|$|E
50|$|At {{this point}} the IF signal {{consists}} of a video carrier signal at one frequency and the sound carrier at a fixed offset. A demodulator recovers the video signal. Also at {{the output of the}} same demodulator is a new frequency modulated sound carrier at the offset frequency. In some sets made before 1948, this was filtered out, and the sound IF of about 22 MHz was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. In newer sets, this new carrier at the offset frequency was allowed to remain as <b>intercarrier</b> <b>sound,</b> and it was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. One particular advantage of <b>intercarrier</b> <b>sound</b> is that when the front panel fine tuning knob is adjusted, the sound carrier frequency does not change with the tuning, but stays at the above-mentioned offset frequency. Consequently, it is easier to tune the picture without losing the sound.|$|E
50|$|Drop frame {{timecode}} originates from {{a compromise}} invented when color NTSC video was invented. The NTSC designers wanted to retain compatibility with existing monochrome televisions. To minimise subcarrier visibility on a monochrome receiver {{it was necessary}} to make the color subcarrier an odd multiple of half the line scan frequency; the multiple originally chosen was 495. With a 30 Hz frame rate the line scan frequency is (30 × 525) = 15750 Hz. So the subcarrier frequency would have been (495/2 × 15750) = 3.898125 MHz. This was the subcarrier frequency originally chosen, but tests showed that on some monochrome receivers an interference pattern caused by the beat between the color subcarrier and the 4.5 MHz <b>sound</b> <b>intercarrier</b> could be seen. The visibility of this pattern could be greatly reduced by lowering the subcarrier frequency multiple to 455 (thus increasing the beat frequency from approx 600 kHz to approx 920 kHz) and by making the beat frequency also equal to an odd multiple of half the line scan frequency. This latter change could have been achieved by raising the <b>sound</b> <b>intercarrier</b> by 0.1% to 4.5045 MHz, but the designers, concerned that this might cause problems with some existing receivers, decided instead to reduce the color subcarrier frequency, and thus both the line scan frequency and the frame rate, by 0.1% instead. Thus the NTSC color subcarrier ended up as 3.57954545 MHz (exactly 315/88 MHz), the line scan frequency as 15734.27 Hz (exactly 9/572 MHz) and the frame rate 29.97 Hz (exactly 30/1.001 Hz).|$|R
