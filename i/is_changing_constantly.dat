40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} is presented for markerless pose tracking in augmented reality. Using a tracking by detection approach, we estimate the 3 D camera pose by detecting natural feature points in each input frame and building correspondences between 2 D feature points. Instead of modeling the 3 D environment, which <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> <b>constantly</b> and dynamically, we use a virtual square to define a 3 D reference coordinate system. Camera pose can hence be estimated relative to it and the calculated 3 D pose parameters {{can be used to}} render virtual objects into the real world. We propose and implement several strategies for robust matching, pose estimation and refinement. Experimental evaluation has shown that the approach is capable of online pose tracking and augmentation. ...|$|E

The restriction of communication to neighboring hosts makes determining the global state especially difficult, if not impractical. This paper addresses the problem of coordinating the positions of an arbitrary number of services, encapsulated by mobile agents, in a dynamic peer-topeer network. The agents ’ collective goal is to minimize the distance between hosts and services, even if the topology <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> <b>constantly.</b> We propose a distributed algorithm to efficiently calculate the stationary distribution of the network. This {{can be used as}} a hill climbing heuristic for agents to find near-optimal locations at which to provide services. Finally, we show that the agent-based hill climbing approach is temporally-stable relative to the instantaneous optimum...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} {{domain of}} compiler techniques is changing. Whereas previously compiler techniques were primarily {{used for the}} construction of compilers for general purpose languages, now these techniques are increasingly often used {{for the construction of}} application domain languages and extensible language models. However, the traditional compiler techniques suffer from problems of complexity, maintainability, reusability and extensibility and new approaches are needed. In this paper, we describe the concept of delegating compiler objects (dcos), a novel approach to compiler construction that provides structural decomposition and reusability of compiler specifications. Our extensible language, the layered object model, is used to illustrate the advantages of the dco approach for compiler construction. 1 Introduction Although the way software systems are constructed <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> <b>constantly,</b> many underlying principles have remained constant.

This is a difficult problem because the network topology <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> <b>constantly</b> and the routing links are inherently unstable due to the high mobility of vehicles. This paper classified the existing routing protocols which are designed for vehicular network environment. Currently, there are five major types of routing protocols based on the metrics used for routing: 1) flooding based routing, 2) mobility based routing, 3) infrastructure based routing, 4) geographic location based routing, 5) probability model based routing. We give an introduction of each type of routing method. The motivation {{of this paper is to}} introduce the general design ideas and state of the art of each category of routing protocols.

The change of the posture results in the change of the loading direction and finally influences the grasping ability of multi-fingered hands. This paper focuses {{on the ability of}} the explosive disposal robot for grasping explosive in any posture so as to seek for the best one and analyze the relation between the different postures and the weight of the explosive. Meanwhile, it studies on the stability of the explosive grasped by the multi-fingered hands under the static and dynamic impact load and analyze the minimal normal force of the robot for steadily grasping under the dynamic impact load. Compared with the bearable maximal normal force of the explosive, it judges the stability and improves the safety and reliability of operation.

IoT and the intelligent systems it enables will change our world deeply. The benefits of Internet of Things regarding a wide variety of economic areas, specially for emerging economies, are significant, and strategies to realise these benefits need to be found. Those new intelligent systems are related to new schemes based on devices and data centric communication, they also need new distribution patterns, that is why many real-time publish-subscribe IoT protocols that can connect thousands of devices have emerged. One of these, Data Distribution Service (DDS), is really relevant because it targets devices that directly use device data, that is, it can distribute data to other devices in an effective way.

30|$|A {{system is}} {{considered}} stable {{if it is}} persistent, remains unchanged with time - that is an operational, phenomenological definition. Within chemical systems we recognize that a system's stability can arise for either thermodynamic or kinetic reasons and, accordingly, we speak of thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities. Importantly, both arise from lack of change. Paradoxically, however, there is another kind of stability in nature that is actually achieved through change, rather than through lack of change. This stability kind is a dynamic stability. Consider, as an example, a flowing river or a water fountain. The river or fountain, as an identifiable entity, would be classified as stable if it maintains its presence over time. That, as already mentioned, is the manifestation of stability - unchanging with time. But, of course, the water that makes up the river or fountain <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> <b>constantly</b> so the river's (fountain's) stability in this instance is of a dynamic kind, one that comes about through change. So though the river (fountain) as an entity is stable, its stability is of a distinctly different character to that associated with static entities.|$|E

Then an algorithm to solve the close form inverse dynamics is presented using Lagrangian formulation. Numerical simulation was carried out to examine the validity of the approach and accuracy of the technique employed. A trigonometric helical trajectory of 5 th order spline was developed in Cartesian space for each degree of freedom of the moving platform in order to verify and simulate the inverse dynamics; the motion of the platform is such that the tool centre point remains on this trajectory while its orientation <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> <b>constantly</b> in roll, pitch and yaw. © 2011 IEEE.

Both Gram positive and negative organisms are responsible for infection of the middle ear. Due to advent of newer and sophisticated antibiotics, the microbiological flora <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> <b>constantly.</b> This requires a reappraisal of the flora in CSOM and their in vitro antibiotic sensitivity pattern in cases of CSOM, which {{do not respond to}} local antibiotics. The frequent presence of CSOM in general practice and its poor response to the routine treatment are the factors responsible for undertaking this study. Materials and Methods : One hundred and twenty six patients with CSOM were prospectively studied. They had chronic ear discharge and had not received antibiotics for the previous five days. Swabs were taken and cultured for bacteria. The standard method of isolation and identification was followed. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates was performed by Kirby-Bauer′s disc diffusion method. Results: Analysis of bacterial flora of the present study showed predominance of Gram negative bacilli (69. 84 %). The highest incidence (45. 24 %) was that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa followed by Staphylococcus aureus (22. 22 %). Amikacin was found to be the most effective drug. Conclusion: This study suggests that the common etiological agents for CSOM were Pseudomonas aeruginosa followed by Staphylococcus aureus. Amikacin was found to be the drug of choice...|$|E

We identify three main components: information, algorithms, and agents, which we illustrate with current and future examples. The implications of adaptive cities are manifold, with direct impacts on mobility, sustainability, resilience, governance, and society. Still, the potential of adaptive cities will not depend so much on technology as on how we use it...|$|R

Perché ciò sia possibile, occorre creare le basi di un dialogo tra passato, presente e futuro, riuscendo a superare la rimozione della variabile tempo. Nel caso dell’innovazione di prodotto, tale dialogo deve mediare i vantaggi del nuovo con i rischi del futuro; nel caso dell’innovazione di processo, che pure non sortisce effetti tangibili, il contributo al ruolo di cerniera svolto dalla generazione presente è ancora più efficace, per perseguire l’obiettivo di una conservazione affidabile e sostenibile.

Sometimes, technological change {{is said to be the}} only constant in our life. Thus, applying modern IT solutions in teaching and learning has become a part and parcel of an increasing number of learning programmes. In language teaching, however, resorting to ICT solutions is sometimes considered to be controversial. This article explores some positive aspects of using ICT that have been acknowledged and stimulating both for students and the teacher. We share our experience in using the Blackboard e-learning environment for teaching genese language courses at different levels and different languages (English and Swedish), and English for Specific Purposes (ESP). We have experienced that the web-based environment can be successfully used for supporting student-centred learning and increasing student motivation. It is also a flexible environment for developing individualisation and enabling cooperation with the students. These topic areas will be the main focus of our paper. By way of introduction we shall analyse different past and current courses where the web-based environment has been used as a support for in-class teaching. We will view different ways of motivating students and engaging them in the learning process. We will then move on to discuss the experience of going 100 % on-line with the language courses and analyse the feedback from students questionnaires and self-analysis reports, as well as the results of our participant observation of the process, with a special focus on examining the possibilities for supporting and encouraging student-centred learning and increasing student responsibility in their learning process...|$|E
40|$|Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) {{explores the}} {{fundamental}} properties {{of matter and}} their origins resulting from the interactions {{of a large number}} of atoms and electrons. The intricate nature of these interactions results in properties and associated phenomena that often hint at a rich vein of underlying physics. Although the perspective <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> <b>constantly</b> with new discoveries, the basic challenges in CMP are to predict and observe new phenomena and elucidate novel properties of materials often pushing at the frontiers of quantum mechanics [1]. CMP is also a field which stimulates technological innovation that revolutionizes modern society. For more than five decades, the engine of CMP has largely been driven by semiconductor industry. Probably the most notable example is the invention of the transistor which was recognized by the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics given to William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain. The transistor-a basic building block of modern electronic devices-was a result of innovative research in the field of semiconductors. The transistor and the invention of the integrated circuit in 1958 was the starting point for exponential increase in the computational power known as Moore 2 ̆ 7 s law [2] There is a persistent interplay between the fundamental science and technological applications which provides breadth to CMP[3]. One cannot possibly give full justice to the entire range of CMP problems that now command the attention of the condensed matter and materials physics community. Therefore, rather than even try, in this short essay we point out a few fundamental problems of major importance whose solution would further expand our understanding and Knowledge, while also mentioning some emerging functional properties of materials where the associated potential applications could foster the technological Innovation...|$|E
