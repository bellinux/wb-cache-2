40|$|Background and {{objective}} Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are mainly {{used for the}} targeted therapy of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). Therefore, EGFR mutations should be detected to treat lung cancer. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the detection rate of NSCLC in patients with EGFR gene mutations by conducting <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> and ARMS assay. Methods A total of 451 patients who were diagnosed with NSCLC between April 2012 and June 2013 participated in this study. Gene mutation was detected in the exon of EGFR 18 to 21 by <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> and ARMS assay. Results All of the 451 cases of NSCLC were subjected to <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> and ARMS assay. Using both techniques, we detected the same EGFR mutation in 127 cases and different EGFR mutations in 5 cases, but no mutations were detected in 186 cases. In <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> alone, EGFR mutation was detected in 50 cases. In ARMS assay alone, EGFR mutation was detected in 83 cases. The mutation rates of <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> and ARMS assay were 40. 4 % and 47. 7 %, respectively. Therefore, the mutation detection rate of ARMS assay was significantly higher than that of <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> (P< 0. 001). In 204 paraffin tissue samples of NSCLC, the mutation detection rate of ARMS assay (59. 80 %) was significantly higher than that of <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> (41. 67 %; P< 0. 001). By comparison, the mutation detection rates of ARMS assay (39. 58 %) and <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> (38. 33 %) showed no significant difference (P= 0. 083) when 240 fresh tissue samples of NSCLC were used. Conclusion <b>Direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> and ARMS assay exhibited similar efficacy in detecting EGFR mutations. Despite its high operational costs, ARMS assay was more sensitive and more convenient than <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing,</b> particularly when a small number of tissues were used. By comparison, <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> could detect mutations that were not detected by ARMS assay. Therefore, the combination of <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> and ARMS assay could provide more reliable and comprehensive test results than the lone application of each technique...|$|R

Our objective was to evaluate SNaPshot and the KRAS StripAssay as alternatives to sequencing for KRAS mutation detection in daily practice. KRAS exon 2 –specific PCR followed by sequencing or by a SNaPshot reaction was performed. For the StripAssay, a mutant-enriched PCR was followed by hybridization to KRAS-specific probes bound to a nitrocellulose strip. To test sensitivities, dilution series of mutated DNA in wild-type DNA were made. Additionally, <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> and SNaPshot were evaluated in 296 colon cancer samples. Detection limits of <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing,</b> SNaPshot, and StripAssay were 20 %, 10 %, and 1 % tumor cells, respectively. <b>Direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> and SNaPshot can detect all 12 mutations in KRAS codons 12 and 13, whereas the StripAssay detects 10 of the most frequent ones. Workload and time to results are comparable for SNaPshot and <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing.</b> SNaPshot is flexible and easy to multiplex. The StripAssay is less time consuming for daily laboratory practice. SNaPshot is more flexible and slightly more sensitive than <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing.</b> The clinical evaluation showed comparable performances between <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> and SNaPshot. The StripAssay is rapid and an extremely sensitive assay that could be considered when few tumor cells are available.

60|$|On {{this subject}} of Persecution, Mr. Lecky writes his best: with {{clearness}} of conception, with calm justice, bent on appreciating the necessary tendency of ideas, {{and with an}} appropriateness of illustration that could be supplied only by extensive and intelligent reading. Persecution, he shows, is not in any sense peculiar to the Catholic Church; it is a <b>direct</b> <b>sequence</b> of the doctrines that salvation is to be had only within the Church, and that erroneous belief is damnatory—doctrines held as fully by Protestant sects as by the Catholics; and in proportion to its power, Protestantism has been as persecuting as Catholicism. He maintains, {{in opposition to the}} favorite modern notion of persecution defeating its own object, that the Church, holding the dogma of exclusive salvation, was perfectly consequent, and really achieved its end of spreading one belief and quenching another, by calling in the aid of the civil arm. Who will say that governments, by their power over institutions and patronage, as well as over punishment, have not power also over the interests and inclinations of men, and over most of those external conditions into which subjects are born, and which make them adopt the prevalent belief as a second nature? Hence, to a sincere believer in the doctrine of exclusive salvation, governments had it in their power to save men from perdition; and wherever the clergy were at the elbow of the civil arm, no matter whether they were Catholic or Protestant, persecution was the result. “Compel them to come in” was a rule that seemed sanctioned by mercy, and the horrible sufferings it led men to inflict seemed small to minds accustomed to contemplate, as a perpetual source of motive, the eternal unmitigated miseries of a hell that was the inevitable destination of a majority among mankind.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps {{that was}} a more cheerful time for {{observers}} and theorizers than the present; we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when America was beginning to be discovered, when a bold sailor, {{even if he were}} wrecked, might alight on a new kingdom; and about 1829 the dark territories of Pathology were a fine America for a spirited young adventurer. Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific, rational basis of his profession. The more he became interested in special questions of disease, such as the nature of fever or fevers, the more keenly he felt the need for that fundamental knowledge of structure which just {{at the beginning of the}} century had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of Bichat, who died when he was only one-and-thirty, but, like another Alexander, left a realm large enough for many heirs. That great Frenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies, fundamentally considered, are not associations of organs which can be understood by studying them first apart, and then as it were federally; but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues, out of which the various organs--brain, heart, lungs, and so on--are compacted, as the various accommodations of a house are built up in various proportions of wood, iron, stone, brick, zinc, and the rest, each material having its peculiar composition and proportions. No man, one sees, can understand and estimate the entire structure or its parts--what are its frailties and what its repairs, without knowing the nature of the materials. And the conception wrought out by Bichat, with his detailed study of the different tissues, acted necessarily on medical questions as the turning of gas-light would act on a dim, oil-lit street, showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of structure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms of maladies and the action of medicaments. But results which depend on human conscience and intelligence work slowly, and now at the end of 1829, most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the old paths, and there was still scientific work to be done which might have seemed to be a <b>direct</b> <b>sequence</b> of Bichat's. This great seer did not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the living organism, marking the limit of anatomical analysis; but it was open to another mind to say, have not these structures some common basis from which they have all started, as your sarsnet, gauze, net, satin, and velvet from the raw cocoon? Here would be another light, as of oxy-hydrogen, showing the very grain of things, and revising all former explanations. Of this sequence to Bichat's work, already vibrating along many currents of the European mind, Lydgate was enamoured; he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of living structure, and help to define men's thought more accurately after the true order. The work had not yet been done, but only prepared for those who knew how to use the preparation. What was the primitive tissue? In that way Lydgate put the question--not quite in the way required by the awaiting answer; but such missing of the right word befalls many seekers. And he counted on quiet intervals to be watchfully seized, for taking up the threads of investigation--on many hints to be won from diligent application, not only of the scalpel, but of the microscope, which research had begun to use again with new enthusiasm of reliance. Such was Lydgate's plan of his future: to do good small work for Middlemarch, and great work for the world.|$|E

Aim was {{to study the}} feasibility of an “in house” <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> method for the genotyping and subtyping of HCV strains compared with a commercially available genotyping assay (Inno-LiPA,VERSANT® HCV Genotype 2. 0 Assay, Bayer). Methods: 74 clinical plasma samples cross-representing HCV genotypes 1 to 5 typed with the line probe assay Inno-LiPA (LiPA) were subjected to a laboratory-developed 5 ’UTR <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> protocol (5 ’UTR Seq). A NS 5 B <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> protocol (NS 5 B Seq) was apply to 23 / 74 samples (17 negative by the 5 ’UTR). Two libraries of 5 ’UTR and NS 5 B HCV prototypes were constructed; BioEdit 7. 0. 0 and ClustalW were used for alignments and phylogenetic analysis. Results: 5 ’UTR Seq typed 47 / 74 LiPA positive samples (64 %). Concordance between the two assays was 91 % (43 / 47) and 72 % (31 / 43) for HCV genotyping and subtyping, respectively. LiPA and 5 ’UTR Seq discordant samples were typed by NS 5 B Seq. NS 5 B Seq typed 13 / 17 samples negative with 5 ’UTR Seq. All genotypes and subtypes detected with NS 5 B Seq were concordant with LiPA. 5 ’UTR and NS 5 B <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> pointed out a wider HCV subtype distribution than LiPA for genotype 1, 2 and 4.

The kit was able to detect the presence of a mutation in a 1 % dilution of the total DNA in 13. 5 % of the tumors and, in 84 %, KRAS mutation was identified at a dilution of 5 %. Sequencing was able to detect KRAS mutations when the mutant DNA represented 10 % of the total DNA in 20 / 74 (27 %) of the tumors. When the mutant DNA represented 30 % of the total DNA, sequencing could detect mutations in 56 / 74 (76 %) ...|$|R

In clinicalmicrobiology, directDNASanger sequencing based onbroad-range PCR {{has become an}} important supplementary tool for fast identification of fastidious or attenuated microorganisms that cannot be found using standard cultivation techniques (1 – 5). The combination of broad-range PCR and <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> is, however, incompatible with polymicrobial infections, resulting in uninterpretable mixed sequencing chromatograms. Conse-quently, polymicrobial infectionsmight be reported as negative or inconclusive. One way of resolving this is by separating the individual PCR products before sequencing by constructing clone libraries. This method is informative, but the laborious protocol makes it appli...|$|R
40|$|Fungi {{of roots}} of declining pine and spruce {{seedlings}} were assessed by pure culture isolations and <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing.</b> The isolation from 1440 roots of 480 seedlings (240 per each tree species) yielded 1110 isolates which, based on mycelial morphology and ITS rDNA sequences, {{were found to}} represent 87 distinct taxa. <b>Direct</b> ITS rDNA <b>sequencing</b> from decayed sections of 140 roots (70 per each tree species) yielded 160 sequences representing 58 taxa. In respect {{to the amount of}} examined roots, <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> revealed significantly larger fungal diversity (chi-squared test; p< 0. 0001). A total of 131 taxa were found, 92 of which (70. 2 %) were identified at least to a genus level. Only 14 of the total number (10. 7 %) were detected by both methods, while 73 (55. 7 %) were detected exclusively by isolation, and 44 (33. 6 %) exclusively by sequencing. Fungi most commonly isolated were the pat-hogens Fusarium oxysporum (25. 6 %) and Nectria radici-cola (14. 9 %). On the contrary, <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> most fre-quently revealed presence of the endophyte Phialocephala fortinii (33. 1 %) and the unidentified sp. NS 234 A 2 (10. 0 %). Our results demonstrate that a diverse fungal community inhabits roots of declining conifer seedlings, and that pure culture isolations combined with <b>direct</b> <b>sequencing</b> provides complementary data in studies of fungal communities...|$|R
