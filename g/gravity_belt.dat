40|$|As of today, several {{technologies}} {{are available for}} thickening waste activated sludge. Presently <b>gravity</b> <b>belt</b> thickeners (GBTs) {{tend to be the}} most commonly installed for waste activated sludge thickening applications (Water Environment Federation, 2012). However, new advancements in thickening centrifuges give {{reason to believe that the}} centrifuge may be economically competitive with GBTs and other thickening technologies moving forward, creating a need to compare the economic favorability of each process. In addition, little research has presently been completed in assessing the environmental impact of thickening technologies. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare GBTs with a novel centrifugal thickening technology and compare them on the basis of performance, economy, and environmental impact. GBTs were found to utilize less power than the centrifugal thickener however reduction in the amount of polymer consumed gave a large advantage to the centrifugal thickening technology over the GBT, specifically for larger sized plants...|$|E
40|$|Thickening is {{the process}} by which biosolids are {{condensed}} to produce a concentrated solids product and a relatively solids-free supernatant. Thickening wastewater solids reduces the volume of residuals, improves operation, and reduces costs for subsequent storage, processing, transfer, end use, or disposal. For example, thickening liquid-solids (slurry) from 3 to 6 percent will reduce the volume by 50 percent. There are several different methods for thickening biosolids, including dissolved air floatation (DAF), centrifugal thickening, <b>gravity</b> <b>belt</b> thickening, and gravity thickening. Gravity thickening uses the natural tendency of higher-density solids to settle out of liquid to concentrate the solids. Gravity thickeners consist of a circular tank (usually with a conical bottom) that is fitted with collectors or scrapers at the bottom. Primary and/or secondary solids are fed into the tank through a center well, which releases the solids at a low velocity near the surface of the tank. The solids settle {{to the bottom of the}} tank by gravity, and the scrapers slowly move the settled, thickened solids to a discharge pipe at the bottom of the tank. A v-notch weir located at the top of the tank allows the supernatant to return to a clarifier. In addition, many systems also use a skimmer to collect and remove any floatables and grease that have accumulated at the top of the tank. The biosolids concentration and thickening that occurs in the tank is achieved through three different settling processes, which include gravit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} {{calculation}} {{accuracy of the}} wrap angles, which are key parameters for the estimation of the maximum torque of the belt system, the steady configuration of the belt was researched. The governing equations and boundary conditions of the belt steady configuration were proposed and the following factors were considered in the model: the centrifugal force, the bending stiffness and the <b>gravity</b> of the <b>belt.</b> The belt steady configuration can be solved through a proposed iteration method based on the built model. The results show the <b>gravity</b> of the <b>belt</b> {{plays an important role}} on the belt steady configuration. The wrap angles calculated from the steady configuration are much less than that from the traditional geometric analysis. Thus the maximum torque of the belt system could be overestimated in the traditional belt design theory. It is necessary to calculate the wrap angles by solving the belt steady configuration, especially for the long center distance, high speed belt system...|$|R
30|$|Several seismic explorations {{have been}} {{conducted}} in the Ryukyu region, and they have yielded P-wave velocity (Vp) models of PHS plate subduction-related structures and backarc rifting-related structures (e.g., Hirata et al. 1991; Iwasaki et al. 1990; Kodaira et al. 1996; Nakahigashi et al. 2004; Klingelhoefer et al. 2012). However, the number of seismic surveys conducted {{in this area is}} very small compared to those made in the Nankai Trough and the Japan Trench, which are seismogenic plate subduction zones around Japan. This is because the interplate coupling in the Ryukyu subduction zone is considered to be weak, {{based on the fact that}} there are few records of large earthquakes in the region, although the 1771 Meiwa Tsunami (Yaeyama Earthquake: M~ 8) and 1911 Kikai-jima Earthquake (M 8) both occurred around the Ryukyu Trench. However, Goto (2013) proposed that the great Kikai-jima Earthquake is the interplate event and Ando et al. (2012) suggested that there are coupled regions within the accretionary prism or at the plate interface, based on the locations and the mechanisms of very low frequency earthquakes. Moreover, the double low <b>gravity</b> <b>belts</b> in the forearc region may reflect strong interplate coupling as suggested by Song and Simons (2003) and Tan et al. (2012). After the disastrous 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake (Mw 9.3), several studies (e.g., Hsu and Sibuet 2005; Lin et al. 2014) pointed out that the tectonic backgrounds between the source area of the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and the Ryukyu Trench are very similar. Besides, the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Mw 9.0) taught us the importance of there being very few geological records of giant earthquakes with a very long recurrence interval. Therefore, the seismic structure related to the PHS plate subduction is very important in estimating the potential for massive devastating earthquakes in the Ryukyu Trench region.|$|R
25|$|Belt press filters have 4 main zones: {{preconditioning}} zone, {{gravity drainage}} zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone. Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated {{depending on the}} feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined <b>belt</b> where <b>gravity</b> drainage of free water occurs The gravity drainage area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size {{can be used for}} solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent <b>gravity</b> drainage <b>belt</b> can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones. The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together, but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the belt filter a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions of the cake, belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.|$|R

Over the arc, gravity anomalies trend north-south and include a comples western gravity high, a median gravity low, and an eastern gravity high. Large variations in the crustal thickness of the arc are deducible from the velocity structure of the upper crust and from two-dimensional gravity calculations. Beneath the median gravity low, the 12 - to 13 -km-thick crust includes 4 to 5 km of s t ra ta within the North Aoba basin. In contrast, the western and eastern gravity highs are underlain by 20 -km-thick crust t ha t characterizes the islands of the Western and Eastern Belts. The thin basement of the basin may be either a piece of old trapped oceanic crust or attenuated island-arc crust. Because of the thin crust, collision-induced fractures developed that facilitated formation of the large Ambrym and Xoba volcanoes.

40|$|In the Variscan French Massif Central, the Sillon Houiller Fault (SHF) {{is a major}} sub {{meridian}} discontinuity which kinematics, {{timing and}} evolution remain poorly understood. The spatial relationship of this accident with the surrounding granitic plutons suggests a genetic link between the SHF activity and pluton emplacement. The SHF is classically interpreted as a Late Carboniferous left-lateral wrench fault that might have accommodated a NW-SE and NE-SW extensional tectonics to theWest and East, respectively. However, this model disagrees with structural and geochronologic data that clearly show two successive and distinct extensional strain fields. Thus, {{in order to better}} understand the faulting process, the Montmarault granitic pluton, located along the western side of the Sillon Houiller fault, has been chosen as target for a multidisciplinary study. Monazite yields a chemical U-Th/Pb age of 321 ± 2 Ma (i. e. Namurian) interpreted as the age of pluton emplacement. Thirty-seven sites of 214 drilling cores have been collected {{for the study of the}} Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS). The biotite is identified as the main magnetic susceptibility carrier with an average of 150 μSI. However, few sites show very high magnetic susceptibility carried by magnetite which is suspected to be secondary mineral because these sites are located along on the contact with three Late Carboniferous coal basins. More than 39 % sites show well defined principal anisotropic axes. To constrain the structure of the granitic massif at depth, aeromagnetic and gravity data were interpreted. A complete Bouguer anomaly map of the Montmarault granite including existing data, supplemented by 525 new gravity stations, provides an average coverage of the area with about 1 station per km 2. Based on rock density and magnetic susceptibility measurements, direct 2 D joint gravity and magnetic modelling has been performed along several cross-sections. These studies allow us to draw the following conclusions. The Montmarault pluton exhibits a magnetic foliation dipping at high angle towards to the fault for those sites close to the fault and flat lying or gently dipping for other sites. The majority of sampled sites shows a consistently NW-SE trending magnetic lineation which is perpendicular to the Sillon Houiller fault. The important negative gravity anomaly along the fault and a weak anomaly to the west suggest that the Montmarault pluton is rooted along the SHF and spreads out northwestwards. Therefore, for the Namurian, the SHF cannot be considered as a transfer fault during but rather as a normal fault. These geometry and kinematics comply well with the overall late-orogenic regional extensional pattern at the scale of the whole Variscan French Massif Central. A preliminary 3 D modelling of the pluton combining our new structural, AMS, gravity and aeromagnetic data, is also presented.
