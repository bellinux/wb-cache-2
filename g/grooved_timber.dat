50|$|The BISF is of a {{conventional}} design, with simple architectural devices of projecting window surrounds encasing Crittall Hope windows, and differing cladding to {{the upper and lower}} stories deal with the junction between components in an understated fashion. The main structure is of steel columns spaced to take standard metal windows between them. The central spine of the building which supports the first floor beams is carried on tubular steel columns. The framework is clad on the lower storey with rendering on metal lath. The outer cladding of the upper floor is of steel trussed sheeting fixed by angles to the steel columns. Traditional materials could be incorporated or simulated, for example a brick cladding to the lower storey, or steel sheet profiled to match timber weatherboarding to the upper. The inner cladding and the partitions are constructed of timber framing faced with plasterboard or hardboard. The upper floors are of tongue & <b>grooved</b> <b>timber</b> and the ceilings are finished with plasterboard or fibreboard. The outer walls and ceilings are insulated with glass quilting.|$|E

Sections of the internal railway and timber carts used on the internal railway are stored under one verandah of the Drying Kilns.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has a rear {{entry into the}} rear wing {{that has become the}} main entrance. The ground and first floor levels of the William Street wing are similar in design, with original joinery, iron columns, and exposed rafters and beams. Walls are rendered and painted. The William Street wing is partitioned on ground level into three rooms, each with a fireplace. The rooms retain finely detailed joinery and ceilings are beaded tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> board ceilings with timber mouldings. Generally, the building retains early and original door and window hardware.|$|R
50|$|Wall {{construction}} differs {{across the}} coach house complex. In the kitchen building {{the wall to}} the semi enclosed southern verandah is constructed from rough sawn vertical timber slabs spanning from the ground to the pitching point of the lean-to roof. In the boarding house {{the southern end of}} the east facing verandah has been enclosed with butt jointed pit sawn hardwood boards spanning vertically from floor level to the pitching point of the lean-to verandah roof. The eastern exterior wall to the boarding house is clad with dressed tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards.|$|R
50|$|The Church of St. James in Charlestown is {{a painted}} tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> building, now a grade II listed building.It {{was moved to}} Baildon from Great Warley, Essex in 1905.The Reverend N. R. Bailey, rector of Great Warley, had {{property}} in Baildon and hoped to retire there.However his obituary was published in November 1900 before he retired.In 2007/2008 the church was moved again, but only by a few yards.This allowed the surrounding land to be sold by the Diocese for development.Rotten timbers were replaced and underground heat pump system installed to make the building more eco-friendly.|$|R
50|$|The {{detached}} {{kitchen is}} located {{at the back of the}} house, connected by a raised, covered walkway that has been enclosed in horizontal, corrugated iron sheeting. On the western side this area is abutted by a bathroom also sheeted in corrugated iron. The kitchen is a simple rectilinear building with a pitched roof. It is clad in weatherboards and has been extended with a small open, lean-to at the back which is used for timber storage. The cottage is lined internally with beaded, tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boarding and has three bedrooms and a parlour. The kitchen is lined with fibro cement sheeting.|$|R
50|$|The {{opposite}} side of the house has rooms along what may have been a former verandah. A verandah at the rear has been extended into a timber deck. The interior of the building has walls of tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards and timber floors. The core rooms have high ceilings and the doors that open from the main room into the bedrooms and study have decorative transoms. The ceilings of all rooms on the perimeter of the house have raked ceilings, which suggests that the house has evolved from a four-room core and verandahs. The kitchen and bathroom are modern.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} is clad with tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards {{and is very}} intact, retaining the original colour schemes. The ground floor, which {{is used as a}} supper room, exhibits a brown dado with hand painted floral frieze. Above this are horizontal tongue and groove boards painted ochre yellow. The room has a series of shallow arched enclosed beams supporting the upper floor. At the rear of the ground floor there are ancillary rooms situated in either corner. Between them is a central entrance which has a section of hit and miss flooring, presumably for the clearing of mud from boots.|$|R
50|$|The {{foundations}} are {{a system}} of load bearing bed logs that support floor joists and tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> floors. Damage to the foundations has caused {{the western end of}} the house to subside. The wall construction is a timber frame with chamferboards to the external walls. The interior walls and ceilings are constructed from tongue and grooved boards which are finished in a dark stained varnish. Two of the main rooms have masonry fireplaces with brick and stone chimneys. Six sets of French doors open out from the main rooms onto the north side verandah. One of these has been altered to create a window.|$|R
5000|$|The {{auditorium}} remains remarkably {{intact and}} retains {{much of its}} early decorative finishes. It is a large space, with the roof supported by unboxed laminated timber arches, and has an early lattice ceiling with hessian or canvas backing which follows {{the curve of the}} arches. There are three decorative light panels in the centre of this ceiling. There is a raked timber floor, sloped more steeply at the northern end of the building. The side walls are lined internally with vertically-jointed tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards to dado height, and above this have early plasterboard panels with decorative [...] "classical" [...] mouldings between the timber arches.|$|R
50|$|On {{the west}} side the {{single-storey}} rear extension, an early service wing formerly detached from the main house, has walls and coved ceiling lined with <b>timber</b> tongue and <b>groove</b> boarding with a narrow beading. This wing {{is divided into two}} rooms by a wall of vertically jointed tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber.</b> Access to the southern room (possibly a former servant's room) is off the verandah. It has timber small-pane sash windows to the east and west side elevations. The rear room (early kitchen) has a corrugated iron stove recess in the rear north wall and a door to the rear yard area. A narrow enclosed corridor runs between the two extensions to the rear yard area.|$|R
50|$|At the {{southern}} end of the core building is another early 20th century timber extension. This has a pyramid roof clad in corrugated iron., and external chamferboards narrower than those of the 1870s section. Like the core and the northern wing, {{the southern}} extension also rests on timber stumps, but at a greater height than the core, and there are steps leading down to the foyer connecting this extension to the 1870s building. The southern extension comprises one large room - living room/ball room/billiard room - with a high, coved ceiling lined in narrow tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boarding. In the eastern wall is a bay window overlooking the garden, and glass doors opening onto the southern verandah of the house core.|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of the Rail Heritage Trust, the station floor boards have been {{completely}} renewed and the building repaired. The flooring job was a major task, as it was discovered that the station had been built with the floor lying straight on top of the dirt. There was no space for air circulation or drainage. Before the floor boards could be laid, the whole area had to be dug out, with large amounts of dirt being removed to allow for adequate space underneath the floor boards. The original wall, floors, and ceiling were beautifully constructed in native tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber.</b> All wiring, including underfloor, was completely renewed and new plumbing installed, with the addition of three new toilets.|$|R
5000|$|The former Lytton Post and Telegraph Office (1873) (LH-024), a {{weatherboard}} {{building on}} timber stumps (with some replacement concrete piers). It has a hipped roof with gabled transepts at each end. The roof is clad with corrugated iron, covering the original shingles, {{and there are}} two brick chimneys, which have sandstone bases. The front (north) has a small central verandah, which has been enclosed. The original kitchen house is extant, and has a skillion-roofed extension of later date. There is a timber-framed external bathroom shed clad with corrugated iron. The interior of the main building has been modified with the removal of one wall. The interior is lined with horizontally-jointed tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards, much of which is wide, centrally beaded.|$|R
50|$|Block E as {{moved to}} Bowen State School 1930-31 (former {{technical}} college/high top) {{and is not}} a standard type. Block E retains important fabric that identifies it as an individually-designed technical educational building from the 1910s. It is a rectangular high-set, timber-framed building with a gabled hip roof and a verandah on the eastern and southern sides. The external walls are clad with weatherboards and the roof with corrugated metal sheeting. The eastern verandah ceiling is lined with timber v-jointed boards. An area of more recent lining indicates the position of a now- removed entry gable. Timber verandah posts and scalloped timber valance are original. At {{the southern end of the}} verandah is an intact hat room from the 1930-31 conversion for High Top use. The verandah balustrade is a later bag rack form. The building does not retain original windows or doors. The interior retains its original technical college layout with internal partitions dividing the space into classrooms accessible from the verandah. The walls and coved ceilings are lined with v-jointed tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards. Timber roof framing beams are exposed within the classrooms.|$|R
50|$|Internally, round {{sandstone}} piers supporting pointed arches, form arcades which {{define the}} nave and aisles of the church. Slender engaged columns extend upward from the piers {{to support a}} variation of hammer-beam timber roof trusses, strengthened with brackets of decorative joinery. The ceiling is diagonally boarded, tongue and <b>groove,</b> v-jointed <b>timber.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{accommodates}} the entrance vestibule, manager's office and private quarters, {{dining room and}} former sitting room, and public bar. The ground floor plan works off the entrance vestibule from which a fine timber stair rises to the guest accommodation on the first floor. From the vestibule, the dining room is entered {{to the left and}} the manager's quarters/office to the right. The vestibule runs through to the rear verandah which accommodates toilets at each end. Partitions to the ground floor rooms are post and rail construction lined with vertical tongue and groove boards. All the public rooms, including the bay window space in the public bar, have decorative pressed metal ceilings, ceiling roses and cornices except the rear section of the public bar where the ceiling is lined with tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>timber</b> boards.|$|R
