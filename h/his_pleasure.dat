5|$|Mr. Finch's successes have aroused media {{attention}}— in particular, {{the attention}} of investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith. While at first the Doctor feigns ignorance (but is barely able to restrain <b>his</b> <b>pleasure</b> at seeing her again), when Sarah Jane discovers the TARDIS during the night, he reveals his identity to her. Sarah Jane meets Rose and Mickey, with an immediate rivalry sparking between the two women. As the group searches the school, they find thirteen bat-like creatures asleep in Finch's office. Returning to Sarah Jane's car, the journalist reveals a battered, inactive K9 Mark III, who—once repaired—identifies the chip oil as Krillitane oil. Rose, unaware that the Doctor had even had past companions, confronts him; he replies sadly that, while she can {{spend the rest of}} her life with him, he cannot spend the rest of his life with her, so he must remain aloof.|$|E

25|$|As far as presidential appointments, as with {{treaties}} {{a person}} is not officially and legally appointed to a position until their appointment is approved by the Senate. Prior to Senate approval and publication of that approval along with an official date and time for their swearing-in and assumption of duties and responsibilities, they are nominees rather than appointees. And again, the President nominates people for specific positions at <b>his</b> <b>pleasure</b> and can do so without or in spite of Senate advice. Senate consent occurs when a supermajority of senators votes to approve and therefore appoint a nominee.|$|E

In the preface to the Atlantic edition of the novel he wrote of <b>his</b> <b>pleasure</b> in riding a bicycle around the area, imagining the destruction of cottages and houses he saw, by the Martian heat-ray or their red weed. While writing the novel, Wells enjoyed shocking his friends by revealing details of the story, {{and how it was}} bringing total destruction to parts of the South London landscape that were familiar to them. The characters of the artilleryman, the curate, and the brother medical student were also based on acquaintances in Woking and Surrey.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 25 October, police cleared and closed an Occupy Oakland encampment in Frank Ogawa Plaza in Oakland, California. The raid was chaotic and violent, but Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan {{expressed}} <b>his</b> <b>pleasure</b> concerning the operation because neither the police nor the public suffered any injuries. A street march that afternoon protesting the closure culminated in a confrontation between police and protesters, who sought to re-establish the Ogawa Plaza encampment. During this confrontation, protester Scott Olsen, a former Marine and Iraq War veteran, suffered a skull fracture caused by a tear-gas projectile or smoke canister fired by police. By 29 October 2011, there were around 2,300 Occupy protest camps across around 2,000 cities worldwide. On 2 November, protesters in Oakland, California, shut down the Port of Oakland, the fifth busiest port in the nation. Police estimated that about 3,000 demonstrators were gathered at the port and 4,500 had marched across the city; however, a member of the Occupy movement was quoted by the BBC as estimating as many as 30,000 may have taken part.|$|E

25|$|Travelling {{north to}} Brisbane the {{tourists}} found a storm brewing {{and the weather}} cool, but heavy. Peter May won the toss and chose to bat on a green wicket, but only three overs were played before the rain came. When they resumed the opener Willie Watson was caught by Wally Grout off the Queensland captain Ray Lindwall, who swung the ball at <b>his</b> <b>pleasure</b> in the heavy atmosphere, taking 5/57 as England collapsed to 39/4. Raman Subba Row (51) and Trevor Bailey (33) rescued the innings, but the leg-spinner Wal Walmsley (2/34) bowled Subba Row and Ken Mackay (3/4) removed Roy Swetman and Frank Tyson and the MCC were out for 151. Queensland were 30/1 overnight and batted poorly the next day, making only 105 runs in a full day's play as John Mortimore took 21-8-26-0 in the day, Jim Laker 12-3-19-1 and Trevor Bailey 21-8-28-1. No wonder crowds flocked to see Norm O'Neill's attacking strokeplay. On the last day Queensland {{made an effort to}} make more runs, but still took 501 minutes to make 210 with Statham taking 3/43 and Laker 4/27, but Mortimore was hit for 38 runs off his last 8 overs without a wicket and Ron Archer top scored with 83. The ball broke Raman Subba Row's wrist when fielding, another injury that removed him from contention just after he had made three fifties in three games. The MCC collapsed again to 41/4 as Lindwall (2/16) removed both openers and Walmsley (2/25) the out of form Colin Cowdrey and Trevor Bailey. Peter May and Roy Swetman added 30 unbeaten runs when the rain returned to finish the game.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Yudhiṣṭhira and his brothers, having {{conquered the}} four {{directions}} and killed Jarasandha, wish {{to perform the}} Rajasuya yajña (ceremony) and Krishna has been invited. Unsure what to do (Canto II), Krishna takes the counsel of his brother Balarama and of Uddhava. While Balarama suggests attacking declaring war on Shishupala immediately, Uddhava points out that this would involve many kings and disrupt Yudhishthira's ceremony (where their presence is required). Instead, he suggests ensuring that Shishupala attends the ceremony as well. Pleased with this plan, Krishna sets out (Canto III) with his army to Indraprastha where the ceremony will be held. On the way, he sees Mount Raivataka (Canto IV), decides to camp there (Canto V), and all seasons simultaneously manifest themselves for <b>his</b> <b>pleasure</b> (Canto VI). His followers' enjoyment (Canto VII) and water sports (Canto VIII) are then described, as are nightfall (Canto IX), drinking and a general festival of love (Canto X) and dawn (Canto XI). These cantos, containing exquisite and detailed descriptions that are unrelated to the action, are usually the most popular with Sanskrit critics. The army resumes its march in Canto XII, and Krishna finally enters the city (Canto XIII). The ceremony takes place, and at the end, at Bhishma's advice, the highest honour (arghya) is bestowed on Krishna (Canto XIV). Shishupala is enraged at this (Canto XV), and makes a long speech on (what he considers) Krishna's bad qualities. He leaves the assembly. In Canto XVI, he sends a messenger to Krishna. Krishna declares war (Canto XVII), and the armies fight (Canto XVIII), with the various complex formations of the armies being matched by the complex forms Māgha adopts for his verses in Canto XIX. Finally, Krishna enters the fight (Canto XX), and after a long battle, strikes off Shishupala's head with Sudarshana Chakra, his discus.|$|E
