We address lim- ited awareness about multiple benefits of energy efficiency improvements and also emerging innovative {{financial instruments}} that are promoted by the European Com- mission as a way to multiply impacts of limited public budgets. Then we identify a suitable segment, Czech residential housing stock and public support of insulation, and compare several forms of possible public support in this field. As the main driver of space heating costs, we predict the future development of heat prices, and assess po- tential energy savings resulting from renovations. Finally, we assess and also simulate the potential of such an initiative and identify four suitable settings of the <b>innovative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> for a majority of stakeholders. Our findings support an idea that this <b>innovative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> offers a valuable alternative to traditional grants. It also suggests that such an initiative can be interesting for a private sector as well as a public sector, with benefits to public budgets, equity investors, households and many other stakeholders. Moreover, this initiative can be sustainable in the long run. JEL Classification G 23, [...] ...|$|E

These financial products are divided into two main categories: the hybrid securities (stock, warrants, convertible bonds, innovative preferred stocks) and the innovative derivatives (credit derivatives and energy derivatives). The second goal is the Greek capital market efficiency testing relative to the announcement of convertible loans issuance and FTSE/ASE - 20 futures contracts. Two basic methodologies are applied: the event studies and the cointegration and casuality relationships. There are two main conclusions: 1) The Greek stock market is inneficient in a semi strong level and 2) The Greek organized futures market is inneficient providing opportunities for consistent profits to be made through arbitrage. ...|$|R
40|$|The present paper aims {{to examine}} whether {{derivative}} contracts concluded by the Public Administration enable to assess the real financial commitment on the authority’s budget, due to their intrinsic features and the current legal framework. The author claims that, on the whole, they cannot be easily reconciled with the obligation to ensure balanced budgets and public debt sustainability, as provided for by the reformed Articles 81 and 97 of the Italian Constitution. Therefore, {{it is to be}} hoped that there be an intervention by the legislator to regulate the use of these financial contracts by all public authorities, as well as companies with public shareholding. In the author’s opinion, there are two possible regulatory options: either to introduce a ban on these <b>innovative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> for any public body, or to accurately regulate this issue, by ensuring the disclosure of necessary information to render derivatives thoroughly compatible with the constitutional principles aimed at protecting the stability of public finances...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{transition}} will require considerable increases in energy efficiency, particularly in residential buildings. Financial support mechanisms, information and adviceprograms and dedicated {{training and certification}} of craftsmen are already in place to stimulate energy efficiency investment. Nevertheless, the required annual rate of thermal building refurbishment of around two percent is so far not achieved. For some real estate owners this {{may be explained by}} a investment horizon that is shorter than lifetime and repayment period of energy efficiency investment projects. The reluctance may also be due to an inadequate risk assessment by investors. Alternative financing approaches that rely mainly on the principle of coupling the revenues of the investment to actual energy cost savings and the increased involvement of equity capital might in such instances contribute to increasing investment activity. Particularly, in the current phase of low interest rates, there is more investment pressure on institutional investors whose willingness to participate in energy efficiency projects is likely to have increased substantially. Experience in other countries has however moderated expectations of being able to trigger greater short-term stimuli with <b>innovative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> Nevertheless, given the challenges of the {{energy transition}}, further investigation of <b>innovative</b> <b>financial</b> concepts also based on equity funding seems warranted...|$|R
40|$|Economists often {{associate}} a country's {{dependence on}} primary commodities, for exports, income, and employment with underdevelopment and low income. The authors explore this commodity pessimism theoretically and empirically {{and suggest that}} it may be ill-founded. If it is, it could have adverse ramifications for many commodity-dependent developing countries. They examine successful commodity-exporting countries and show that commodity dependence does not necessarily lead to low income and export growth. Successful commodity-exporting countries achieve dynamic and viable commodity sectors by implementing appropriate policies that encourage private sector initiative and investment. Drawing on successful cases - including Uganda's coffee sector, Ghana's gold mines, Colombia's cut-flower industry - the authors identify government policies that encourage viable commodity sectors. These include: 1) eliminating price controls and state monopolies; 2) promoting research and extension; 3) developing sound infrastructure in transport and communications; 4) enticing foreign capital and technology transfers; and 5) establishing a legal system that encourages the use of <b>innovative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments,</b> especially risk management instruments and a sound warehouse receipt system.

40|$|A common dilemma facing governments {{around the}} world is how to meet the {{sizeable}} fiscal costs of providing and maintaining infrastructure networks. Over the past decade, developed and developing countries have looked to fiscal rules, budgetary reforms, tax policy and administration measures, public-private partnerships and other <b>innovative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> to raise additional finance for infrastructure investment.

40|$|Abstract * With the {{emergence}} of new technologies, <b>innovative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> and the integration of global market operations national accountants are confronted with a series of new challenges and complexities in determining the output of financial institutions. The SNA 93 recommended measure, the FISIM – financial intermediation services indirectly measured- which focused around the traditional deposits and loans business is currently under scrutiny as numerous views have been expressed questioning its validity in measuring the financial output. Critics have argued that the FISIM, as is defined, fails to capture the recent developments in financial markets and the technological advances and thus undermine the true economic contribution of these institutions. Several OECD task groups have examined this issue and currently considering changes to the existing methodologies. The goal of this study is two-fold. First, it explores a number of emerging areas in finance that are critically important for national accounting purposes. Second, by using the latest I-O tables the paper examines empirically how the recent technological advances and the global market environment have impacted the Canadian financial sector and provides some insights as to how the current SNA practices could be extended to account for such changes...|$|R
40|$|Historic {{inner city}} areas in India are {{characterized}} by a rich array of building typologies associated with traditional communities, socio-cultural practices and local commerce. Yet conservation in urban India has only marginally gone beyond protecting its monumental built heritage and restoring individual landmark buildings. This thesis studies the complex overlay of issues that impede urban conservation of historic neighborhoods within Indian cities today and in Kolkata, in particular. The work argues for effective heritage economics, bolstered by robust regulations and dynamic participatory frameworks to shield historic urban cores from demolition and irreversible change while being rehabilitated for contemporary use. It further identifies the Fort precinct in Mumbai, the Walled City in Ahmedabad, and the French and Tamil towns in Pondicherry as locations with effective urban conservation paradigms. Through these, a range of <b>innovative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments,</b> policy measures and heritage legislation at local and state levels are illustrated, that act as a fundamental toolkit for effective regeneration.

40|$|The {{study is}} based on an {{analysis}} of the opportunities provided by The Investment Plan for Europe. The Plan, launched in December 2014, aims at stimulating additional investment at least EUR 315 billion in real economy in the 2015 - 2017 period and making the most of every public euro mobilized through both new and existing instrument, in order to achieve the high multiplier effect.

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a simple {{mechanism}} aimed at implementing and supporting environmental protection policies in urban areas based on <b>innovative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> issued by a policy maker (PM), which can be buyed by two categories of involved agents, city users (CU) and agencies providing the city services. According to this mechanism, virtuous service providers choosing to offer high quality services can obtain cost abatement. CU, reciprocally, {{have to pay for}} entering into the city, but can protect themselves against a city low quality of life by a self-insurance device. The interaction of these two categories of economic agents is modelled by a two-population evolutionary game, where the population of CU strategically interacts with that of service providers. From the analysis of the model it emerges that such a dynamics may lead to a welfare-improving attracting Nash equilibrium at which all CU choose to use environmental-friendly means of transportation and all service providers choose to offer high quality services. However, the basin of attraction of that equilibrium may have a rather complex morphology. In particular more attractors and/or limit cycles can be present. In such a context we indicate sufficient conditions making the virtuous equilibrium a global attractor for all trajectories starting at a mixed-strategy point...|$|R
40|$|The wave of {{liberalisation}} and globalisation sweeping {{across the}} world has opened many national markets for international business.

40|$|Index options {{have been}} one of the most {{successful}} of the many <b>innovative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> introduced over the last few decades, as their high trading volume indicates. Given their prominence, the pricing efficiency of these markets is of great importance.; Detecting inefficient pricing, or mispricing, requires comparing a theoretically efficient price with prices of options traded in financial markets. One popular approach to deriving pricing relationships is based on a principle called no-arbitrage, which simply assumes that arbitrageurs enter the market and quickly eliminate mispricing if a profit opportunity without risk exists. However, in a well-functioning economy there is no such opportunity; arbitrage is critical for ensuring market efficiency.; The authors analyze earlier evidence that has been taken to indicate that options markets are inefficient and that casts doubt on whether options markets contribute to price discovery, hedging, and efficient capital allocation. The article presents new evidence on index option pricing, examining arbitrage strategies that do not involve trading a stock index and relationships that hold for any given value of the underlying asset. This approach avoids some of the difficulties that can arise from impediments to arbitrage. The article also examines the efficiency of the market for the popular Standard and Poor's 500 index options. While the results indicate that these options are frequently mispriced, the mispricing may not indicate market inefficiency because there are limits to arbitrage. Options (Finance) ...|$|R

The authors propose a model that adjusts the amount of high-yield agricultural inputs given to farmers to favorable or unfavorable rainfall conditions expected for the season. Simulation results - combining climatic, agricultural, and financial models - indicate that this approach substantially increases production in La Niña years (when droughts are very unlikely for the study area), and reduces losses in El Niño years (when insufficient rainfall often damages crops). Cumulative gross revenues are more than twice as large for the proposed scheme, given modeling assumptions. The resulting accumulation of wealth can reduce long-term vulnerability to drought for participating farmers. Conclusions highlight the potential of this approach for adaptation to climate variability and change in southern Africa.
