5|$|A Category1 {{hurricane}} {{was first}} observed about 585mi (940km) west-northwest of Corvo Island in the Azores on August5, based on reports from two ships, the Shelter and the A.Z.Greenland. Another ship that <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> storm, the Magistrate, was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Adonis {{originally}} was a Phoenician god of fertility representing {{the spirit of}} vegetation. It is further speculated {{that he was an}} avatar of the version of Ba'al, worshipped in Ugarit. It is likely that lack of clarity concerning whether Myrrha was called Smyrna, and who her father was, originated in Cyprus before the Greeks first <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> myth. However, {{it is clear that the}} Greeks added much to the Adonis-Myrrha story, before it was first recorded by classical scholars.|$|E

5|$|Although Fran passed {{near the}} Azores as a hurricane, winds {{on the islands}} only reached 45mph (75km/h) and no damage was recorded. On October12, a French ship <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> storm, {{recording}} sustained winds of 40mph (65km/h) and an air pressure of 981mbar (hPa; 28.97inHg). Ships near the English and French coastlines recorded winds up to 60mph (95km/h) as the extratropical remnants of Fran passed through the region.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez {{spent the}} summer of 1943 in England testing GCA, landing planes {{returning}} from battle in bad weather, and also training the British {{in the use of}} the system. While there he <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> young Arthur C. Clarke, who was an RAF radar technician. Clarke subsequently used his experiences at the radar research station as the basis for his novel Glide Path, which contains a thinly disguised version of Alvarez. Clarke and Alvarez developed a long-term friendship.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{adoption}} of Christianity in territory, which is today Poland, {{there were a number}} of different a pagan tribes. Svetovid was among the most widespread pagan gods worshiped in Poland. Christianity arrived around the late 9th century, most likely around the time when the Vistulan tribe <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> Christian rite in dealings with their neighbors, the Great Moravia (Bohemian) state.|$|E

5|$|By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, {{which was}} {{by that point}} {{pursuing}} the British battlecruisers, had not yet <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack. He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> {{main body of the}} Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gustav {{initially}} posed {{a significant}} {{threat to the}} Lesser Antilles which had already suffered severe damages from Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Several watches and warnings were issued for the islands between August26 and 27; however, due to the northward turn, Gustav did not directly impact the region. Only light rain and large swells were reported. Offshore, a ship <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> storm and sustained hull damage.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 Janáček {{retired from}} his post as {{director}} of the Brno Conservatory, but continued to teach until 1925. In 1921 he attended a lecture by the Indian philosopher-poet Rabindranath Tagore, and used a Tagore poem {{as the basis for the}} chorus The Wandering Madman (1922). At the same time he <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> microtonal works of Alois Hába. In the early 1920s Janáček completed his opera The Cunning Little Vixen, which had been inspired by a serialized novella in the newspaper Lidové noviny.|$|E

5|$|In June {{he joined}} No. 66 Squadron RFC at Aire, {{equipped}} with the Sopwith Pup. He undertook a refresher course but his tenure there was unremarkable. He was ordered to fly with the group rather than fly solo patrols. He flew 47 hours in 66 Squadron and 21 patrols. He <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> enemy six times but could not score. Finally on 21 and 26 July he shot down one Albatros D.V fighter for his 6–7th aerial victories.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, American prospectors began to spread into the area. Making deals with the Native Tlingit and Tagish tribes, the early prospectors opened the {{important}} routes of Chilkoot and White Pass, and reached the Yukon valley between 1870 and 1890. Here, they <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> Hän people, semi-nomadic hunters and fishermen who lived along the Yukon and Klondike Rivers. The Hän did not appear to know about the extent of the gold deposits in the region.|$|E

In the firefight that followed, one of the craft– Elevala– was forced to beach and its occupants forced to return {{to take to the}} jungle on foot, eventually reaching Gili Gili some time later; the other, Bronzewing, was holed and of its passengers, 11 were killed either in the engagement or by the Japanese following their capture.|$|E

5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, Final Fantasy X is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, {{around the world to}} interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is <b>encountered,</b> <b>the</b> environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.|$|E
5|$|Many Indians {{who joined}} the {{missions}} were looking for protection from Portuguese slave traders or the encomienda system of the Spanish conquistadores. In the reductions, the natives were free men. The land in the missions was common property. After a marriage, individual plots were assigned to newly founded families. For the Jesuits, the goal was always the same: to create cities {{in harmony with the}} paradise where they had <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> indigenous peoples.|$|E
5|$|Numerous ships <b>encountered</b> <b>the</b> {{hurricane}} {{along its}} course. On the President Harding, {{en route to}} New York, one crew member drowned due to the rough conditions and 73 crew and passengers suffered injury, of various severity, requiring a call for emergency medical supplies. The ship itself sustained a bit of damage. As the storm passed near the island of Bermuda, it generated strong winds—gusting to —and heavy precipitation. Damage was fairly significant; the winds uprooted trees, shattered windows, and disrupted public utilities.|$|E
