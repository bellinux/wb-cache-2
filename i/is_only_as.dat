5|$|Lloyd's Register <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>as</b> {{accurate}} as the information owners gave it, {{and there are}} discrepancies between the entries for vessels and information from other sources. That said, there is generally a strong correspondence between the information in Lloyd's Register, and other sources, at least with respect to Prince of Wales.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>as</b> {{a result}} of {{accurately}} maintaining {{the composition of the}} 3 litres alveolar air that, with each breath, some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, breathing will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3kPa (40mmHg). The opposite occurs after breath-holding.|$|E
5|$|A {{declaration}} <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>as</b> {{effective as}} {{the willingness of}} a public body {{to abide by the}} court's statement of the law in it, as it is not a contempt of court to ignore a declaration. In Webster v. Southwark London Borough Council (1982), Webster was a parliamentary candidate for the National Front, a far right racial nationalist political party, who wanted to hold an election meeting in a hall owned by Southwark London Borough Council. Despite being required by provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1949 to permit Webster to use the hall, the local council refused to do so as it did not agree with Webster's political views. The court made a declaration that Webster was legally entitled to use the hall at a certain time for the purpose of his election campaign, {{on the assumption that the}} local council would obey it. Nonetheless, the local council still refused to allow Webster use of the hall. It was held that a declaration is not a coercive order of the court and, accordingly, refusal to comply with it is not contempt.|$|E

J. Beverley (Bev) Oke, who died on 2 March 2004 {{at the age of}} 75, devoted most of his scientific career to devising and building a succession of such instruments — photometers, cameras and spectrographs that have helped, in particular, to keep the 50 -year-old Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory, California, at the forefront of astronomical research...|$|R

25|$|The usual source {{which is}} quoted in this instance, is Melis Stoke, a chronicler {{in the service}} of count Floris V of Holland, but {{although}} he tries to back up the Hollandic claims on the Frisian territories, he lacks sound arguments. He suspects the counts of Holland obtained their rights as heirs to one Gerolf, Count in Friesland (the operative word here being in), who had been count of Holland during the Franconian period, which was at that time a part of Greater Frisia, but even there he has to admit it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>as</b> suspicion.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{presents}} a temporary role reversal for Mulder and Scully. When discussing {{the lack of}} evidence at the crime scenes, Scully points out that [...] "a crime <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>as</b> perfect as the man [...] Even if he made not one mistake, there still is a motive. If you find his motive, you find the murderer". Kaner argues that this logic is {{more in line with}} what Mulder has subscribed to throughout the series. Furthermore, after Mulder discovers Padgett's manuscript, he arrests him [...] "without a second thought". By relying on empirical logic, Mulder is acting in the way Scully normally thinks.|$|E
