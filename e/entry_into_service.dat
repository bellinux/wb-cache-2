5|$|In 2009, the CRS {{proposed}} four options: Option 1 was {{to continue}} the VH-71 program with Increment I and II versions; the additional cost was estimated at $10billion and the <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> date was 2019. Option 2 was to restructure the program to provide 23 Increment I aircraft; at an additional cost of $6.4billion and would be operational by 2012. Option 3 was a restructure to provide 19 Increment I aircraft to replace the current fleet; the additional cost for this option was estimated at $5.6billion and the <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> by 2012. The last option was to upgrade and extend life of current fleet {{at a cost of}} $1.4billion; however this would not meet the standards required for future presidential helicopters, and would require replacement sooner.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, the British Government {{announced}} that it reached {{an agreement with the}} United States to allow the deployment of USMC F-35s from Queen Elizabeth upon the ship's <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>service,</b> with a reciprocal arrangement seeing RAF and FAA aircraft operating from ships of the US Navy.|$|E

5|$|The Bristol Type 175 Britannia was a British medium-to-long-range {{airliner}} {{built by}} the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1952 to fly across the British Empire. During development two prototypes were lost and the turboprop engines proved susceptible to inlet icing which delayed <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> while solutions were sought.|$|E
5|$|Prospective {{customers}} included ILFC, CIT Aerospace, Lufthansa, and Hapag-Lloyd. The latter two, however, were unimpressed {{with the}} long-range variant, preferring a shorter-range aircraft, which was {{better suited to}} their route structure. Singapore Airlines was also an expected customer because it {{was looking for a}} replacement for the A310. Airbus intended to freeze the design in late 2001, with the first flight scheduled for the third quarter of 2003 and <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> within a year. The programme was later abandoned, as interest from customers was lacking.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{scheduled date}} of <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> for the MRA4 was April 2003; however, development proved far more protracted than anticipated. Early on, an independent company, Flight Refuelling Ltd., had been contracted {{to undertake the}} conversions to MRA4 standard, however BAE discovered that the Nimrod airframes supplied by the RAF were not built to a common standard and this considerably complicated the refurbishment process. The task of converting the existing airframes was transferred in-house to BAE Systems Woodford. The BAE team at Woodford then found that the new wing was flawed, {{which resulted in the}} project being put on hold while another wing design was developed.|$|E

5|$|The DDL {{project was}} {{reviewed}} {{again when the}} Liberal Fraser Government came into office in late 1975. The review panel unanimously advised the new Minister for Defence James Killen that the DDL project was no longer viable as {{the total cost of}} the ships would be about $130 million higher than the Oliver Hazard Perry project, and it would take three years longer for the DDLs to be completed. Killen accepted this advice, and a firm order for two Oliver Hazard Perry frigates was placed in February 1976. A third ship was ordered in late 1977. Six of these frigates, which were designated the , were eventually ordered, and the final two were built in Australia at Williamstown. The expertise of the DDL project office and the preparations which had been undertaken to manage the process of ordering and building the ships contributed to the Navy's ability to rapidly evaluate alternative designs and oversee their <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> once an order was placed.|$|E
