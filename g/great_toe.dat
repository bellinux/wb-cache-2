40|$|Summary. A 5 -year-old boy and {{his father}} with Pfeiffer {{syndrome}} are de-scribed. They had acrocephaly, hypertelorism, antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures, protrusion of the eyes, large and broad nose, small mandible, irregularly placed teeth, additional upper canine, high-arched palate, partial syn-dactyly of fingers and toes, brachydactyly oftoes, valgus deformity ofhypertrophied triangular <b>great</b> <b>toes,</b> broad phalanges of the <b>great</b> <b>toes</b> and broad first metatarsals, accessory epiphyses lateral to the interphalangeal joint ofthe <b>great</b> <b>toes,</b> and normal intelligence. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} family in which the syndrome is almost totally confined to the head and feet-it spares the upper limbs except for partial skin syndactyly between the fingers-and the third family showing inheri-tance through three successive generations suggesting an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The published papers are reviewed and the clinical and x-ray signs are tabulated. A syndrome of acrocephaly associated with hy-pertelorism, antimongoloid slant, broad thumbs and <b>great</b> <b>toes,</b> and normal intelligence was first de-scribed by Pfeiffer (1964). He reported eight cases through three generations of a family, with two instances of male to male transmission, suggesting an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.

2500|$|The Torah {{mentions}} {{the combination of}} ear, thumb, and toe in three places. In [...] God instructed Moses how to initiate the priests, telling him to kill a ram, take some of its blood, {{and put it on}} the tip of the right ear of Aaron and his sons, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the <b>great</b> <b>toe</b> of their right foot, and dash the remaining blood against the altar round about. And then [...] reports that Moses followed God's instructions to initiate Aaron and his sons. Then, [...] , and [...] set forth a similar procedure for the cleansing of a person with skin disease ( [...] , tzara'at). In [...] God instructed the priest on the day of the person's cleansing to take some of the blood of a guilt-offering and put it upon the tip of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the <b>great</b> <b>toe</b> of the right foot of the one to be cleansed. And then in [...] God instructed the priest to put oil on the tip of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the <b>great</b> <b>toe</b> of the right foot of the one to be cleansed, on top of the blood of the guilt-offering. And finally, in [...] and , God instructed the priest to repeat the procedure on the eighth day to complete the person's cleansing.|$|E
2500|$|Philo {{taught that}} {{the command of}} [...] to apply ram's blood to the priests' right ear, right thumb, and right <b>great</b> <b>toe</b> {{signified}} that the perfect person must be pure in every word, every action, and the entirety of life. For the ear symbolized the hearing with which people judge one's words, the hand symbolized action, and the foot symbolized {{the way in which}} a person walks in life. And since each of these is an extremity of {{the right side of the}} body, Philo imagined that [...] teaches that one should labor to attain improvement in everything with dexterity and felicity, as an archer aims at a target.|$|E

60|$|The Orang's foot (Fig. 19) {{is still}} more aberrant; its very long toes and short tarsus, short <b>great</b> <b>toe,</b> short and raised heel, great {{obliquity}} of articulation in the leg, and absence of a long flexor tendon to the <b>great</b> <b>toe,</b> separating it far more widely from {{the foot of the}} Gorilla than the latter is separated from that of Man.|$|E
60|$|As to the muscles, {{there is}} a short flexor, a short extensor, and a 'peronaeus longus', while the tendons of the long flexors of the <b>great</b> <b>toe</b> and of the other toes are united {{together}} and with an accessory fleshy bundle.|$|E
60|$|The {{hind limb}} of the Gorilla, therefore, {{ends in a}} true foot, with a very {{moveable}} <b>great</b> <b>toe.</b> It is a prehensile foot, indeed, but is in no sense a hand: it is a foot which {{differs from that of}} man not in any fundamental character, but in mere proportions, in the degree of mobility, and in the secondary arrangement of its parts.|$|E
60|$|The Gibbons are the smallest, slenderest, and longest-limbed of the man-like apes: {{their arms}} are longer in {{proportion}} to their bodies than those {{of any of the}} other man-like Apes, so that they can touch the ground when erect; their hands are longer than their feet, and they are the only Anthropoids which possess callosities like the lower monkeys. They are variously coloured. The Orangs have arms which reach to the ankles in the erect position of the animal; their thumbs and <b>great</b> <b>toes</b> are very short, and their feet are longer than their hands. They are covered with reddish brown hair, and the sides of the face, in adult males, are commonly produced into two crescentic, flexible excrescences, like fatty tumours. The Chimpanzees have arms which reach below the knees; they have large thumbs and <b>great</b> <b>toes,</b> their hands are longer than their feet; and their hair is black, while the skin of the face is pale. The Gorilla, lastly, has arms which reach {{to the middle of the}} leg, large thumbs and <b>great</b> <b>toes,</b> feet longer than the hands, a black face, and dark-grey or dun hair.|$|R
60|$|The pithecanthropus ate in silence, cutting small strips {{from the}} deer's loin with his keen knife. From his crotch {{in the tree}} Tarzan watched his companion, noting the {{preponderance}} of human attributes which were doubtless accentuated by the paradoxical thumbs, <b>great</b> <b>toes,</b> and tail.|$|R
60|$|The ape-man {{realized}} that {{probably for the}} first time his companion had discovered that he was tailless by nature rather than by accident, and so he called attention to his own <b>great</b> <b>toes</b> and thumbs to further impress upon the creature that they were of different species.|$|R

60|$|Again, the tendons of {{the long}} flexor of the toes, and {{of the long}} flexor of the <b>great</b> <b>toe,</b> when they reach the sole of the foot, do not remain {{distinct}} from one another, as the flexors {{in the palm of}} the hand do, but they become united and commingled in a very curious manner--while their united tendons receive an accessory muscle connected with the heel-bone.|$|E

60|$|But {{perhaps the}} most {{absolutely}} distinctive character about {{the muscles of the}} foot is the existence of what is termed the 'peronaeus longus', a long muscle fixed to the outer bone of the leg, and sending its tendon to the outer ankle, behind and below which it passes, and then crosses the foot obliquely to be attached {{to the base of the}} <b>great</b> <b>toe.</b> No muscle in the hand exactly corresponds with this, which is eminently a foot muscle.|$|E
60|$|Now {{there was}} good reason for this command on Henchard's part. Poor Abel, as he was called, had an inveterate habit of over-sleeping himself and coming late to his work.
