First we demonstrate that a number of thermal plants can be substituted by a single one that behaves equivalently to the entire set. We then calculate the <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant</b> in the case where the cost functions are general (nonquadratic). We prove that the equivalent thermal plant is a second-order polynomial with piece-wise constant coefficients. Moreover, it belongs to the class C 1. Next we calculate the <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant</b> in the case of imposing constraints of minimum or maximum thermal power. Finally, we present an example and execute the proposed algorithm using Mathematica package...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} is described of an accurate and reliable prototype earth sensor head (ARPESH). The ARPESH employs a detection logic 'locator' concept and horizon sensor mechanization which {{should lead to}} high accuracy horizon sensing that is minimally degraded by spatial or temporal variations in sensing attitude from a satellite in orbit around the earth at altitudes in the 500 km environ 1, 2. An accuracy of horizon location to within 0. 7 km has been predicted, independent of meteorological conditions. This corresponds to an error of 0. 015 deg-at 500 km altitude. Laboratory evaluation of the sensor indicates that this accuracy is achieved. First, the basic operating principles of ARPESH are described; next, detailed design and construction data is presented and then performance of the sensor under laboratory conditions in which the sensor is installed in a simulator that permits it to scan over a blackbody source against background representing the earth space interface for various <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant</b> temperatures...|$|E
40|$|A {{decrease}} in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration during the mid-Palaeozoic is postulated {{to have been}} partially the consequence {{of the evolution of}} rooted land plants. Root development increased the amount of carbonic acid generated by root respiration within soils. This led to increased chemical weathering of silicates and subsequent formation of carbonates, resulting in lower atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. To test this assumption, analog (morphologically <b>equivalent)</b> <b>plant</b> species, ranging from those possessing no roots to those with complex rhizomatous rooting systems, were grown in trays within microcosms at ambient (360 ppm/ 0. 37 mbar) and highly elevated (3500 ppm/ 3. 55 mbar) atmospheric CO 2 concentrations in a controlled environment facility. Substrate CO 2 concentrations increased significantly under elevated atmospheric CO 2, and Equisetum hyemale (L.). The latter is postulated to result from the effects of deeply rooted plants, elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, or both. Plants with simple or no rooting systems or the addition of dead organic matter as a substrate for microorganisms did not enhance substrate CO 2 concentrations...|$|E

40|$|Considered in {{this thesis}} is multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems with non-minimum phase (NMP) zeros and {{unstable}} poles {{where some of the}} unstable poles are located {{to the right of the}} NMP zeros.

In spite of the added degrees of freedom the MIMO case also poses difficulties as has been shown in the stabilization of the X- 29 aircraft. When using the MIMO QFT technique the synthesis starts by considering a set of <b>equivalent</b> SISO <b>plants</b> derived from the plant transfer function matrix that are used to develop a controller.

40|$|A new {{deforestation}} and land-use change scenario generator model (FOREST-SAGE) {{is presented}} {{that is designed}} to interface directly with dynamic vegetation models used in lat-est generation earth system models. The model requires a regional-scale scenario for aggregate land-use change that may be time-dependent, provided by observational studies or by regional land-use change/economic models for future projections. These land-use cat-egories of the observations/economic model are first translated into <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant</b> func-tion types used by the particular vegetation model, and then FOREST-SAGE disaggregates the regional-scale scenario to the local grid-scale of the earth system model using a set of risk-rules based on factors such as proximity to transport networks, distance weighted pop-ulation density, forest fragmentation and presence of protected areas and logging conces-sions. These rules presently focus on the conversion of forest to agriculture and pasture use, but could be generalized to other land use change conversions.

A 0. 1 M citrate buffer (pH 3), containing 100 ppm citral and 200 ppm gallic acid <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant</b> extract, was incubated at 40 °C. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at days 0, 6, 10, 13, and 16 to monitor degradation of citral and formation of α, p-dimethylstyrene, p-cymene- 8 -ol, and p-methylacetophenone. The addition of plant phenolic extracts could not inhibit citral degradation, however, all four plant extracts significantly inhibited p-methylacetophenone formation. The samples, {{with the addition of}} plant extracts, exhibited higher concentrations of α, p-dimethylstyrene and p-cymene- 8 -ol than the control. This is presumed to be due to the oxygen-scavenging effect of plant extracts blocking the pathway from p-cymene- 8 -ol to p-methylacetophenone. Our results suggest that these plant extracts act as general antioxidants inhibiting the generation of p-methylacetophenone regardless of the types of water-soluble phenolic compounds existing in the plant extracts. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Several {{bacterial}} toxins either promote or {{inhibit the}} maturation of human monocyte-derived DC. Since the potent plant toxin ricin exploits the same cell entry pathway used by these bacterial toxins and shares identical catalytic activity {{with some of}} them, we have studied the capacity of ricin to induce DC maturation in vitro. Here, we show that {{in contrast to the}} bacterial proteins, ricin neither induces DC maturation nor interferes with LPS-induced DC maturation. There is no correlation between the absence of DC maturation and ricin dysfunction. Indeed, some of the ricin variants retain significant ribotoxicity and catalytic activity. We have extended these observations to ebulin- 1, suggesting that this may be a general characteristic of plant-derived cytotoxic ribosome-inactivating toxins. The human immune system may therefore have evolved to recognize and rapidly respond to the bacterial proteins, whilst being less responsive to the <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant</b> cytotoxins. Understanding the effect of ricin on professional APC may provide insights into the generation of an anti-ricin vaccine and into the use of inactivated ricin A chains as delivery vectors as part of a vaccination protocol...|$|E

40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the production of}} pulp is of economic interest to many kraft pulp mills. However, significant increases in production generally require the recovery boiler to be debottlenecked: it must either be rebuilt or replaced. Both options require costly investments that can be avoided by extracting lignin from the black liquor before it is burnt in the boiler. This, in turn, requires changes being made in the evaporation plant. In the present study, simulations have been carried out based on a 25 % {{increase in}} the production of pulp. The evaporation plants are simulated with and without an integrated lignin separation plant to investigate the consequences of extracting lignin from black liquor. The results show that the evaporation plants with lignin extraction have investment costs that are 5 - 30 % higher than an <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant</b> without lignin extraction. Furthermore, the evaporation plants with lignin extraction require an evaporation capacity that is 7 % higher, since filtrates from the lignin separation plant are also evaporated here. This increases the steam demand by 9 - 12 % compared with a plant without lignin extraction. The span in the investment cost and steam demand depends on where the filtrates are recirculated in the evaporation plant...|$|E

In an attempt to evaluate the response of mycorrhizal Lavandula angustifolia L. to Armillaria mellea (Vahl:Fr) P. Kumm in a greenhouse experiment, plants were previously inoculated with an isolate of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis (former Glomus intraradices BEG 72) and the influence of the pH growing medium on the plant-symbiont-pathogen interaction was tested in gnotobiotic autotrophic growth systems in which mycorrhizal inoculum was obtained from root organ cultures. After ten months growth dual-inoculated lavender plants grown in containers with a pasteurized substrate mixture produced a similar number of spikes than healthy plants and achieved <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant</b> diameter coverage. When the growing medium in the autotrophic systems was supplemented with calcium carbonate, the inoculation of lavender plantlets with R. irregularis at higher pH (7. 0 and 8. 5) media caused a significant decrease of A. mellea presence in plant roots, as detected by qPCR. Moreover, the observation of internal root mycorrhizal infection showed that the extent of mycorrhizal colonization increased in plant roots grown at higher pH, indicating that tolerance to white root rot in lavender plants inoculated with R. irregularis could be associated to mycorrhizal establishment.

40|$|The {{impact that}} power plants {{employing}} {{renewable energy sources}} have on power systems is no longer negligible due to the ever-increasing portion of the power share that these generation systems represent. Therefore, the static and dynamic effects of these power plants on the grid must be analyzed in at least {{the same degree of}} detail as conventional generating units. For this purpose, it is necessary to develop models that are accurate and able to capture the dynamics of interest for the analysis, but also taking into account that they should be manageable and have a good computational performance. In the case of power plants based on photovoltaic (PV) or wind energy, formed by many power converters, an <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant</b> model that reduces the number of devices offers a good tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.

The objectives of the project are to: •Enable knowledge transfer between Chinese and UK parties (academic, industrial and other) •Model the future energy requirements of China, taking CCS technology into account. •Produce case studies of potential carbon dioxide capture technologies. •Build capacity in China for evaluation of storage potential for CO 2 and perform first stage characterisations for selection of sites suitable for CO 2 storage. •Develop a technical and policy level roadmap for CCS. The capture and transport theme in the NZEC project has fourteen Chinese and overseas partners undertaking ten different capture plant case studies and an overview of CO 2 transport in China.

Crop density varied with seeding rate, cultivar, row spacing and year. Higher seeding rates were required to reach <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant</b> densities in cv. Dinkum (short, semi-leafless) compared with cv. Dundale (tall, conventional-leaf), and at 36 cm compared with 18 cm row spacing. Field pea grain yield was reduced more at low crop densities, in Dinkum, at 36 cm row spacing, and {{in the presence of}} weeds. Percentage yield losses from weed competition were similar in both cultivars (about 70 – 80 %) at a low density of 10 plants/m 2 in 2 seasons. At higher crop densities Dinkum had a larger loss than Dundale (i. e. at 30 plants/m 2 losses were 60 and 35 %, respectively, compared with 50 and 5 % at 60 plants/m 2). Seasonal {{variation in}}fluenced the effect of crop density on yield loss from weeds. The percentage yield loss from weeds in 1993 ranged from about 90 to 40 % at plant densities of 10 to 40 plants/m 2, in contrast to 1995 when 40 % yield loss occurred at all these densities. Ryegrass dry weight was reduced with increasing field pea density in both years, and in the tall more than the short cultivar in 1 year. Maintaining recommended field pea seeding rates has considerable financial benefits in both weed-free (around $ 100 /ha) and weed-affected crops (to $ 400 /ha).

40|$|The {{modulation}} of {{cell division}} {{is a fundamental}} feature of higher plant development. Control of plant cell division is exercised during the G 1 phase of the cell cycle as part of developmental programmes. Cyclin proteins {{play an important role}} in the mechanism which commits cells to the process of division during G 1 phase, and then-role has been conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. The work described in this thesis was carried out with the objective of identifying and characterising cyclins which serve this function in higher plants. Two approaches to the isolation of plant homologues were taken based on the conservation of structure and function of cyclins in eukaryotes. Low stringency hybridisations using DNA encoding fungal cyclins were used to identify similar plant sequences; and the complementation of a yeast mutant deficient in cyclin function with plant cDNAs was used to identify functionally <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant</b> genes. Plant genes so isolated have been characterised on the basis of DNA sequence and their expression during the cell cycle in synchronised cells of Arabidopsis thaliana. A system was developed for the synchronisation of A. thaliana cells in suspension culture, using cycloheximide.

The expression patterns of A. thaliana cyclins D 1, D 2, D 3, CYC 1, CYC 2, and CYC 3 were also examined within this system. The expression of D 2 and D 3 was suggestive of functional differences and supported the hypothesis that D-type cyclins function as part of the cellular machinery which integrates diverse signals impinging upon commitment to cell division.

40|$|The {{share of}} Non-Conventional Renewable Energy (NCRE) {{penetration}} in Sri Lanka has been increased {{to a significant}} level in the recent past. As at 3 1 s t of August 2010, around 215 MW of NCRE based power plants were connected to the Sri Lanka national grid. This accounts to 6 % of total energy and 7. 8 % percent of total capacity of the system. According to the Energy Policy - 2006, the government's Endeavor is to reach 10 % of total energy in the national grid from NCRE by 2015. As a result, modeling and studying of NCRE is vital especially in generation planning. Though the present practice of using lumped NCRE thermal equivalent model is simple, it can {{cause a lot of}} inaccuracies owing to the volatile nature of wind and hydro sectors. The issue of non-availability of suitable NCRE models was addressed by this research and separate NCRE models were prepared {{for each of the three}} major types of NCRE technologies; mini hydro, wind and biomass power plants, in Sri Lanka. Each NCRE technology was separately treated and modeled considering the seasonal variation of energy availability. Models were tested in generation planning software, Wien Automatic System Planning (WASP) to ascertain the accurate functioning of models. The mini hydro model prepared has five stage probabilistic distributions on a monthly basis. Past generation data of about 74 existing plants were used to validate the model. Predictability and adaptability of the model with WASP were tested and accurate dispatch of mini hydro power plants by the model was confirmed. Due to unavailability of reliable and continuous long term historic generation data, the wind model was prepared on measured wind speed data. After refinement of data, two modeling approaches were initially considered namely, a Run-of-River (ROR) type hydro equivalent wind model and the Modified Load Duration Curve method. Based on the results of error vs. commitment analysis, a five-stage probabilistic ROR type hydro equivalent wind model was selected as the best fitted model for the study. Biomass power plants were modeled as a conventional thermal <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant.</b> NCRE models prepared were then used for three scenario studies to examine their adaptability in both committed and least cost basis.

40|$|AbstractCurrently, Australia emits {{approximately}} 600 MT {{equivalent of}} CO 2 annually, of which approximately 30 % is {{directly linked to}} the electricity generation using both brown and black coals. To restrain the CO 2 emissions, coal based power generators are looking to retrofit the existing power plants with commercially available technology for the post combustion capture (PCC) of CO 2 as well as invest in the new power plants with high efficiency steam cycles. Since Australian coals are low in sulphur and the coal-fired power plants are well away from densely populated regions, the flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) and de- NOX regulations are currently not there for the coal based electricity generation in Australia. This is not an advantageous situation for straightforward retrofitting of the existing power plants with 30  wt% aqueous MEA based commercially available PCC technology that has very limited tolerance for SOX and NOX (less than 10  ppmv). In addition, Australia is a dry continent with very limited cooling water availability for the power plants. Hence, the Australian power generators are considering both {{the power and the}} post combustion CO 2 capture plants to be air cooled. This paper, therefore, assesses the impact of introducing post combustion capture of CO 2 on the existing and new Australian coal-fired power plants, both brown and black coal-fired, in terms of the cost of electricity generation, the cost of CO 2 avoidance, the cooling water demand and the overall plant efficiency. The existing power plants are considered to be conventional subcritical and supercritical single reheat steam cycle based whereas the new power plant designs have allowed for ultracritical steam conditions (35  MPa, 922  K) with double reheat. The CO 2 capture plants are considered to be either in service full time or in service on demand with 90 % capture efficiency and the product CO 2 ready for sequestration at 10  MPa and 313  K. The process and cost models for integrated power and capture plants have been obtained using ASPEN Rate-Sep, Steam-Pro, Steam-Master and PEACE software packages for process modelling and cost estimation. The results clearly show that an air cooled integrated power and capture plant has lower overall plant efficiency and slightly higher cost of electricity generation in comparison with a water cooled <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant.</b> An ultracritical single reheat power plant when integrated with capture plant that is in service full time has potential for lowest cost of electricity generation with minimum cost for CO 2 avoidance. These results further show that replacing an existing turbine with a new LP turbine optimised for continuous steam extraction for CO 2 plant duty minimises the adverse impact of PCC integration but the power generator looses the flexibility for electricity generation. The results also provide important insights into the major contributions to the increased cost of power generation. For both the existing and the new power plants, the amortised capital charge component dominates the cost of PCC integrated electricity generation. In spite of the large reduction in efficiency for Australian power plants when PCC is applied, it appears that reducing the capital costs of PCC will be at least equally important. This is an important outcome for the prioritization of research activities aimed at reducing the costs of capture. For example, the novel solvent development work for improved PCC technology should focus on increasing absorption rates at the same CO 2 carrying capacity of the solvent to reduce the capital cost component...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} {{networked}} systems composed of discrete-time systems interacting over discrete-time networks. These systems are emerging in {{many application areas}} and require new distributed control and estimation design methodologies. Most existing approaches represent networked system models by structured system models (systems with structured state-space or input-output representations) assuming a complete equivalence between the two models. In this thesis, we carefully analyze the connection between these two models and study {{the conditions under which}} networked systems can be viewed as structured systems, and vice versa. Although, networked systems are shown to be equivalent to structured systems in general, we show that modeling the networked systems as systems with structured transfer function matrices is inappropriate for problems which require stabilizability and detectability of the designed networked system. This is {{due to the lack of}} constructive proofs in literature to obtain a stabilizable and detectable networked system corresponding to an unstable structured transfer function matrix. This important observation shows that the theory developed for designing distributed controllers using transfer function approaches (where the designed transfer functions can in general be unstable) may not provide a stabilizing networked controller. We refer to the property of realizing a structured transfer function matrix as a stabilizable and detectable networked system by network realizability. Although this problem is mostly open and appears to be difficult, we partially answer this problem by providing a constructive proof to show that stable structured transfer function matrices are always network realizable. Based on this development, we consider the problem of designing stabilizing networked controllers for a given networked plant. As transfer function approaches are not suitable, we develop a state-space approach using classical Youla-Kucera parameterization techniques to parameterize all internally stabilizing networked controllers for the given networked plant. This formulation allows us to pose the problem of finding stabilizing networked controllers as an unconstrained convex optimization problem, which can be solved using standard techniques. This formulation allows us to solve the optimal networked H 2 and H∞ control problems while ensuring that the solution is a stabilizing networked controller that can be implemented as sub-systems interacting over the given network. It turns out that the optimal stabilizing networked controllers can have a large order as they trade off complexity for the lack of complete communication graph. The optimal solutions provide performance limitations of the controllers when constrained to be networked. In order to obtain networked controllers with order comparable to that of the networked plant, we provide a methodology to obtain full-order internally stabilizing networked controllers using linear matrix inequalities. This methodology being based on a sufficiency condition, assures only sub-optimal full-order stabilizing networked controllers. Next, we consider the problem of designing a networked estimator for a given networked plant. We express this problem as a networked control problem for an <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant</b> model and apply our networked controller design approach. We provide the parameterization of all stable networked estimators and the networked estimation problem is expressed as an unconstrained convex optimization problem that can be solved using standard techniques. Finally, we consider the networked systems over any general delay networks. The results previously developed for systems over zero-delay networks are extended to the case of systems over general delay networks. We conclude the thesis with a look at future research directions - the development of model reduction techniques for networked systems, the development of distributed design methods, and the extension of our design methodology to include network model uncertainties and other distributed performance objectives...|$|E

It is capable of fully autonomous flight {{with the aid of a}} variety of sensors like the GPS unit, heading sensor, 2 -axis magnetometer, 3 -axis accelerometer and 3 -axis gyros. The vehicle carrying the Kestrel autopilot hardware is capable of autonomous and semi-autonomous flights after installation and tuning of feedback loops. Sapthami, is a tailless flying wing with an inverse zimmermann profile. A flying wing is a preferred configuration for the MAV as it maximizes the lifting area for a given size constraint. For a maximum size constraint of 30 cm and aspect ratio around 1, the vehicle operates at Reynolds number between 100, 000 to 250, 000, at flight velocity 7 m/s to 15 m/s. The Inverse Zimmerman profile has a higher lift coefficient, CL, in comparison to the other planforms such as rectangular, elliptical and Zimmermann, for aspect ratio 1 to 1. 25 and tested at Reynolds number of 100, 000. The configuration of Sapthami is clean as there is no fuselage and all the components like autopilot hardware and battery are housed inside the wing. A thick reflex Martin Hepperle (MH) airfoil MH 18 is chosen which gives sufficient space to place the components. This airfoil is specially used for tailless configurations due to its negative camber at the trailing edge. This negative camber helps in reducing the negative pitching moment of the wing, since no separate horizontal tail is available on a tailless aircraft to compensate for it. The vehicle is fabricated using the blue foam, having a density of 30 kg/m 3. The wing is fabricated by CNC machining after which slots are cut manually to embed the electronics. The vehicle is found to have stable flying characteristics. Limited flight trials are done for Sapthami. It takes large time to fabricate the vehicle due to limited availability of CNC machining facility. Therefore, a new tailless, wing-fuselage configuration, which can be fabricated with balsa wood, is designed. Sapthami-flyer is the second vehicle designed in this thesis. Its wing span is slightly more than Sapthami. Since it is a wing-fuselage configuration, therefore there is no need for a thick airfoil. Mark drela’s AG airfoils are found to have better lift than MH airfoils for the inverse Zimmerman profile. The thickness of the airfoils is reduced to 1 % so that the wing can be made by a 1. 5 mm thick balsa sheet to reduce weight. The inverse Zimmermann profile wing with the AG 09 airfoil is found to have best lift-to-drag ratio when compared to AG 36, MH 45 and MH 18. The analysis is done using commercially available AVL software. AG 09 with 1 % thickness is used in the final configuration. This configuration has better short period damping than Sapthami. It also has slower modes of operation than Sapthami. The operating modes of most of the MAVs, including Sapthami and Sapthami-flyer, are lowly damped but fast. This makes it difficult for the pilot to fly the vehicle. To improve the flying qualities of the vehicle artificial stabilization is required. The feedback is implemented on the Kestrel autopilot hardware. It allows only PID based feedback structures to be implemented, hence gives no choice to the designer to implement higher order control. The digital integrator and differentiator implementation for feedback are non-ideal. This further reduces the effectiveness of control. The problem is dealt with by incorporating the additional dynamics introduced by these implementation while formulating the control problem. Further the modeling of the micro air vehicle is done by using vortex lattice simulation based softwares. The fidelity of the obtained dynamics is low. Therefore, there is high uncertainty in the plant model. The controller also needs to reject the wind gust disturbances which are of the order of the flight speed of the vehicle. All the above stated requirements from the control design can be best addressed by a robust control design. Sapthami-flyer uses aileron and elevator for control. There is no rudder in the configuration in order to reduce weight. In the longitudinal dynamics, pitch rate and pitch error feedback to elevator are used to increase the short period and phugoid damping respectively. In the lateral dynamics, a combination of roll rate, yaw rate and roll error feedback is given to aileron to improve the dutch roll damping and stabilize the spiral mode. The feedback loops for both longitudinal and lateral dynamics are multi-output single input design problems, therefore simultaneous tuning of loops is beneficial. The PID control is designed by first converting the actual plant to a static output feedback <b>equivalent</b> <b>plant.</b> The dynamics introduced by non-ideal differentiator and integrator implementation on the autopilot hardware are incorporated in the open loop static output feedback formulation. The robust pole placement for the SOF plant is done by using the modified iterative matrix inequality algorithm developed in this thesis. It is capable of multi-loop, multi-objective feedback design for SOF plants. The algorithm finds the optimal solution by simultaneously putting constraints on the H 2 performance, pole placement, gain and phase margin of the closed loop system. The pole placement is done to minimize the real part of largest eigenvalue. A single controller is designed at a suit-able operating point and constraints are put on the gain and phase margin of the closed loop plant at other operating points. The designed controller is tested in flight on board Sapthami-flyer. The vehicle is also capable of tracking commanded pitch and roll attitude with the help of pitch error, roller or feedbacks. This is shown in the flight when the pilot leaves the RC stick and the vehicle tracks the desired attitude. The vehicle has shown improved flying characteristics in the closed loop mode...|$|E
