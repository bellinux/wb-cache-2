5|$|Due to {{the closure}} of Dunston power station, along with the later {{closures}} of the power stations at Stella and Blyth, {{the northern part of}} North East England has become heavily dependent upon the National Grid for <b>electrical</b> <b>supply.</b> However, in the south of the region there are still two large power stations at Hartlepool and Teesside, meaning that the south of the region does not depend upon the National Grid for <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> as much as the north of the region.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the closure}} of Blyth Power Stations, along with the power {{stations}} at Dunston and Stella in the 1980s and 1990s respectively, {{the northern part of}} North East England has become heavily dependent upon the National Grid for <b>electrical</b> <b>supply.</b> However, there are still two large power stations at Hartlepool and Wilton in the south of the region.|$|E
5|$|During May 2009, {{the repairs}} were {{reported}} to be almost complete and new sea trials were planned for 15–20 June. By October 2009, the work had still not been completed due to the shipyard's <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> having been disconnected. Nikolay Povzyk, {{the head of the}} shipyard, complained they had not been paid the 1.9 billion roubles (63.8 million dollars) owed for the work carried out on Nerpa.|$|E

5|$|Lexington and Saratoga {{were used}} to develop and refine carrier tactics {{in a series of}} annual {{exercises}} before World War II. On more than one occasion these included successfully staged surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Lexingtons turbo-electric propulsion system allowed her to supplement the <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> of Tacoma, Washington, in a drought from late 1929 to early 1930. She also delivered medical personnel and relief supplies to Managua, Nicaragua, after an earthquake in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} {{introduction}} of S Stock trains, the track, <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme planned to increase peak-hour capacity on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines by 65 per cent by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface railway is to be established in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system will replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s. The cross-London Crossrail line, planned to open in 2018, is expected to reduce crowding between Paddington and Whitechapel.|$|E
5|$|During construction, {{the need}} for new water and <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> lines arose. Because these were not {{factored}} into the original $65million cost, another $5million was appropriated from existing capital funds. Another $5million was later required to pay for cleaning contaminated soil, increased sub-contractor pricing, additional labor costs incurred by delays caused by snow and ice, and upgrades including the guitar-shaped scoreboard. The Sounds ownership team contributed $2million toward the cost of the scoreboard. These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5million greenway, $5.6million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6million in flood prevention, brought the total construction cost of the stadium to $56million and the total cost of the project to $91million.|$|E
50|$|Automatic Electrical Appliances {{was thus}} born in 1948 in a 40-square-meter store at Avenida Rizal, post-war Manila’s main {{shopping}} street. It sold light bulbs, wires, sockets, and other <b>electrical</b> <b>supplies.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>electrical</b> <b>supplies</b> in {{the area}} are unable {{to keep up with the}} rapid {{development}} and so the utilities have asked IT firms to operate on generators for two hours each day.|$|R
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> {{to the line}} and stations would be provided by a dedicated generating station at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through the tunnels and out through exhausts placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn back down from the surface via the lift and staircase shafts, thus replenishing the air in the tunnels. To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built of concrete and iron and the sleepers were made from the fireproof Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or jarrah.|$|E
5|$|The Stella power {{stations}} were {{a pair of}} now-demolished coal-fired {{power stations}} in the North East of England that were a landmark in the Tyne valley for over 40years. The stations stood {{on either side of}} a bend of the River Tyne: Stella South power station, the larger, near Blaydon in Gateshead, and Stella North power station near Lemington in Newcastle. Their name originated from the nearby Stella Hall, a manor house close to Stella South that by the time of their construction had been demolished and replaced by a housing estate. They operated from shortly after the nationalisation of the British <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> industry until two years after the Electricity Act of 1989, when the industry passed into the private sector.|$|E
5|$|The main turbine and boiler {{building}} {{is now a}} locally listed building, standing today as {{a monument to the}} important role that Tyne and Wear played in the development of <b>electrical</b> <b>supply.</b> The building had been considered for the more protected Listed Building status, but the decision was taken in May 2004 not to promote it. Other early power stations in the area (such as those at Dunston and Wallsend) have all been entirely demolished. The Lemington station is partly still standing due to riverside sites becoming less important to industrial development, leading to the site never being redeveloped.|$|E

5|$|The Kalimpong municipality, {{which was}} {{established}} in 1945, {{is in charge of}} the infrastructure of the town such as potable water and roads. The municipal area is divided into twenty-three wards. Kalimpong municipality is constructing additional water storage tanks to meet the requirement of potable water, and it needs an increase of water supply from the 'Neora Khola Water Supply Scheme' for this purpose. Often, landslides occurring in monsoon season cause havoc to the roads in and around Kalimpong. The West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited (WBSEDCL) that provides electricity here, needs to resolve issues like voltage fluctuations, unstable <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> and faulty electrical meters etc. faced by people of Kalimpong. Renewable Energy Development Agency of the state has plans to promote usage of solar street lights in Kalimpong and proposed an energy park here to sell renewable energy gadgets. The Public Works Department is responsible for the road connecting the town to the National Highway–NH-31A. The Kalimpong municipality has a total of 10 health care units, with a total of 433 bed capacity.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} {{accidents}} concerned {{testing of the}} station's TORU manual docking system to manually dock Progress M-33 and Progress M-34. The tests were to gauge the performance of long-distance docking and the feasibility of removal of the expensive Kurs automatic docking system from Progress spacecraft. Due to malfunctioning equipment, both tests failed, with Progress M-33 narrowly missing the station and Progress M-34 striking Spektr and puncturing the module, causing the station to depressurise and leading to Spektr being permanently sealed off. This in turn led to a power crisis aboard Mir as the module's solar arrays produced {{a large proportion of}} the station's <b>electrical</b> <b>supply,</b> causing the station to power down and begin to drift, requiring weeks of work to rectify before work could continue as normal.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} weakness of these ships lay in {{their inability to}} generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent. Their DC <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> was only 115V, whereas larger cruisers with power-operated turrets had a 230V system. Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom turbo-generators rated at only 120kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44/52kW for use when the ship was alongside. The latter provided only for the ship's minimum lighting and electricity needs, and fires had to be lit {{in at least one}} of the boilers in order to train the turrets or elevate the guns for practice or maintenance. Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings (which were slow to train and elevate) and for the rudder which contributed to the ship's poor maneuverability. In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in the hull of a destroyer; the contre-torpilleur as a type had been pushed past the limits of its capabilities.|$|E

5|$|While the {{fighting}} related to Operation Corridor 92 {{was still in}} progress, the VRS prepared to attack and destroy a salient around the town of Jajce in central part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, held jointly by the HVO and the ARBiH. The salient threatened Bosnian Serb lines of communication south of VRS-held Banja Luka and contained two hydroelectric power plants critical for <b>electrical</b> <b>supply</b> of Banja Luka region. The salient was held by between 3,400 and 5,500 HVO and ARBiH troops manning strong fortifications in difficult terrain. The VRS committed 7,000–8,000 troops of the 30th Infantry Division of the 1st Krajina Corps to the offensive codenamed Operation Vrbas '92. The 30th Division was under command of Colonel Stanislav Galić, until he was replaced by Colonel Dragan Marčetić in early September. The VRS troops included the 1st, 11th and 17th Light Infantry Brigades and 1st Mixed Antitank Artillery Battalion. Besides the numerical superiority, the VRS held a clear advantage in armour, deploying 20–30 tanks and adding 30–50 heavy artillery pieces to the force. Defence of Jajce was organised at municipal crisis headquarters level by mayor Midhat Karadžić, while the HVO force in Jajce was commanded by Stjepan Blažević.|$|E
