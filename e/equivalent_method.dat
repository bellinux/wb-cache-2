40|$|The {{standard}} gamble has a firm {{basis in}} the theory of risk and, for this reason, is the preferred method of health state value elicitation for many researchers. However, it is widely recognised that the use of immediate death as the failure outcome in the standard gamble renders the method insufficiently sensitive for the direct valuation of minor and temporary health states. Consequently, the indirect valuation of minor and temporary health states through a process of 'chaining' has been recommended. Unfortunately, a number of researchers have observed internal inconsistency in the standard gamble. That is, for health states that are not thought to be subject to the above mentioned insufficient sensitivity, the values elicited from indirect chained questions quite often significantly and systematically exceed those elicited from the direct procedure. A potential explanation for this is the possible influence of loss aversion when people are asked to weigh certainty against risk. The lottery <b>equivalents</b> <b>method,</b> an alternative value elicitation instrument that also has a firm grounding {{in the theory of}} risk, modifies the standard gamble approach of certainty versus risk to one of risk versus risk. The absence of certainty offers reason to suspect that the influence of loss aversion will be diminished (or even removed), and that the lottery <b>equivalents</b> <b>method</b> will thus prove to be internally consistent. The study reported in this article tests {{the internal consistency of the}} lottery <b>equivalents</b> <b>method.</b> In a manner similar to that observed with the standard gamble, the results indicate that the internal consistency of the lottery <b>equivalents</b> <b>method</b> is also to some extent compromised.

40|$|Base {{isolation}} system, {{as one of}} {{the most}} popular means to mitigate the seismic risks, often exhibits strong nonlinearity. To simplify the procedure of structural design, bilinear force-deformation behavior is recommended for isolation systems in most modern structural codes. Although base isolation system can be analyzed through nonlinear time history method, solving of a system with a large number of degrees of freedom may require an exorbitant amount of time. As a substitute, the <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>method</b> is frequently used. Apparently, under given earthquake ground motions, the accuracy of <b>equivalent</b> linearization analysis <b>method</b> is significantly related to the estimation of equivalent linear properties. How to improve the estimation accuracy of this approximate method constitutes a subject of wide and deep interest among researchers around the world. In this research, the <b>equivalent</b> linearization analysis <b>method</b> for base-isolated buildings was investigated. The literature survey on related aspects of base-isolated buildings was carried out firstly. Then, the estimation accuracy of fifteen <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>methods</b> selected from the literatures was evaluated when subjected to twelve earthquake ground motions. After that, from simplicity to complexity, the base-isolated buildings were modeled using single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems and multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, respectively. For both considered systems, more comprehensive parametric analyses were performed with varying the parameters selected from the isolation system and the superstructure. Accordingly, improved <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>methods</b> were derived for SDOF and MDOF systems to improve the prediction accuracy of the maximum displacement of isolation systems. Based on the proposed <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>methods,</b> different analysis methods for base-isolated buildings were assessed, including equivalent static linear analysis, response spectral analysis, linear and nonlinear time history analyses. It was found that with the proposed <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>methods</b> <b>equivalent</b> linear analyses could yield more accurate results when compared with the <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>method</b> recommended by structural codes. As a result, the proposed <b>equivalent</b> linearization <b>method</b> could be potentially useful for the design and analysis of baseisolated buildings, as least in the preliminary stage of structural design...|$|R

30|$|With the {{proposed}} <b>equivalent</b> <b>method,</b> conformity with the detailed WPP {{of the active}} and reactive powers of the equivalent WPP is generally improved except a few cases. These cases {{are related to the}} following situations: (1) the group number of the equivalent model A is lower than that of the equivalent model B. This phenomenon occurs in the event that all of 30 PMSGs’ DC link voltages reach the chopper circuit threshold or fluctuate near the normal value.

However, the 30 PMSGs are clustered into two groups using the traditional <b>equivalent</b> <b>method</b> in which the clustering principle is dependent on the diversity in wind speeds. Simulation results reveal that both the equivalent model A and B can reflect the phenomenon that all of 30 PMSGs’ DC link voltages reach the chopper circuit threshold or fluctuate near the normal value, but equivalent model B also takes into account the diversity in wind speeds. On the basis of increasing the order of equivalent model, the equivalent model B improves its precision somewhat. (2) The equivalent model A and B have a same clustering result, as can be seen when wind energy and transfer coefficient are 0.8  MW, 0.9  pu, respectively.|$|E

If an effective mechanism for filtering out benign obfuscated methods were available, the number of methods that must be analyzed could be reduced, allowing analysts to be more productive.
