25|$|Stephen Tobolowsky {{was tapped}} {{to play the}} Tool Time co-host, Glen. However, he was still busy with a movie {{that was in the}} middle of {{production}} at the time the first pilot was to be shot. Therefore, the producers set out to cast an alternate character that would stand in as Tim's co-host for the pilot, or for however many episodes were required until Tobolowsky was available. The casting department auditioned Richard Karn, for what would be his first major appearance on a TV sitcom; the character of Al Borland was created from there. After the first few episodes completed with Patricia Richardson as Jill, Tobolowsky was still tied up with his other commitments, and Karn found himself in his role permanently when Tobolowsky decided he would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to do a series. Thus, the character of Glen never came into being.|$|E

She {{also seems to be}} traumatized from the death of Scott and began to actually believe her own lie that Black Bolt was the one who actually killed him. Emma wasted no time and began to prepare for a war with the Inhumans by making alliances with various teams of X-Men, with the last being Storm's X-Haven. She declares war on the Inhumans when Beast reports that the Terrigen cloud will soon saturate and render earth as completely uninhabitable for mutants, believing that they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to attempt negotiation. When Medusa learns the truth about why the X-Men went to war against the Inhumans, she willingly destroys the cloud and ends the possibility of future Inhuman manifestations so that the mutants can survive.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Pike Place Market in 1907, local Seattle area farmers sold their goods to the public in a three-square block area called The Lots, located at Sixth Avenue and King Street. Most produce sold at The Lots would then be brought to commercial wholesale houses on Western Avenue, which became known as Produce Row. Most farmers, due to the amount of time required to work their farms, were forced to sell their produce on consignment through the wholesalers on Western Avenue. The farmers typically received a percentage of the final sale price for their goods. They would sell to the middleman on commission, as most farmers would often <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to sell direct to the public, and their earnings would be on marked up prices and expected sales. In some cases, the farmers made a profit, but just as often found themselves breaking even, or getting no money at all due to the business practices of the wholesalers. During the existence of the wholesale houses, which far predated the Market, there were regular rumors as well as instances of corruption in denying payment to farmers.|$|E

500|$|The plot of Freelancers single-player {{campaign}} is illustrated with two hours worth of in-game cutscenes. [...] The story is linear in structurethe player {{is unable to}} effect a different storylineand broken down into stages. [...] Cutscenes inform players of background events and the goals in a stage. [...] Most stages <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> limits for their completion, and players can put the main story on hold while taking on missions (jobs) not crucial to it. [...] However, players can only proceed to {{other regions of the}} Sirius sector, where more advanced ships, weaponry, and equipment are obtained, after completing missions that advance the story. Some stages are not introduced until the character has achieved a certain level (based on total worth accumulated), and {{it is not possible to}} gain sufficient levels just through the story itself, so players must spend at least some time on side missions to gain money to advance to the level required for the next stage of the story. This is also necessary as some stages would be too tough with only the money and items collected in the story.|$|E

The following day, the song premiered on Fantasia’s Vevo channel, and explicit and clean versions were digitally released at the iTunes Store. It was Fantasia's first release after joining Primary Wave Music. According to the singer, [...] "No Time for It" [...] was chosen by her label as the album's first single. She was initially hesitant about releasing the song ("At first I was thinking, 'Is that a record to come back with?), but she later said that it [...] "set the atmosphere" [...] for her future singles. Fantasia was critical of the single, describing it as a [...] "very cute record", but felt connected to its message. She had favored [...] "Sleeping with the One I Love" [...] (2016) as the album's lead single. According to the singer, she would not record anything without feeling a personal connection and the album's recording process was all about [...] "artistic fulfillment". Jourdan Miller of BreatheHeavy called the single's release [...] "perfectly timed seeing how the singing reality competition {{is on its way}} out, cause we all <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for it".|$|E
