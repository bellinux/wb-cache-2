5|$|In 2009, Superior Court Judge Jack Panella won a $770 bid on {{the auction}} website eBay to <b>flip</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> {{and turn on}} the Peace Candle during the candle-lighting {{ceremony}} on November 27, 2009. In November 2010, Easton Holiday Committee Chairwoman Sandy O'Brien-Werner voiced doubts that the current candle structure would last until 2014 as previously projected and might need to be replaced sooner. She expressed concern at the cost of such a venture, claiming the Peace Candle cost $14,640 in 2010 alone for maintenance and operation and that an altogether new structure would cost at least $35,000. In response, six-year-old MaryElizabeth Soffera and eight-year-old Katie Dietrich, two cousins from Williams Township who loved the Peace Candle, opened a snow cone stand during a garage sale {{to raise money for the}} candle. They raised $23, which they presented to Mayor Sal Panto Jr. during a November city council meeting.|$|E
25|$|The only {{difference}} between this case and the original trolley problem is that an extra piece of track has been added, which seems a trivial difference (especially since the trolley won't travel down it anyway). So, if we originally decided that it is permissible or necessary to <b>flip</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch,</b> intuition may suggest that the answer should not have changed. However, in this case, {{the death of the}} one actually is part of the plan to save the five.|$|E
25|$|Calgary Power's {{first major}} project became the {{construction}} of the province's first large-scale hydroelectric plant, located at the Horseshoe Falls. The Horseshoe Falls Plant's opening on May 21, 1911, allowed Calgary Power {{to meet the needs of}} the city. According to the Morning Albertan, Calgary mayor J. W. Mitchell was aroused from a Sunday nap to <b>flip</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> which officially opened the plant and connected the city with its first large-scale source of electricity. In 1911, Calgary Power supplied 3,000 horsepower of electricity to the city at a cost of $30 per horsepower. The city had 44,000 people in 1911, and the emerging need for mass transportation was met by the booming streetcar industry, which accounted for a significant share of the city's electric usage. By 1913, Calgary Power had constructed the Kananaskis Falls Plant as an additional source of power.|$|E

50|$|Some critics use {{the example}} of the trolley problem to {{invalidate}} NAP. In case of the runaway trolley, headed for five victims tied to the track, NAP does not allow a trolley passenger to <b>flip</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> that diverts the trolley to a different track if there is a person tied to that track. That person would have been unharmed if nothing was done, therefore by flipping the switch NAP is violated. Another example often cited by critics is human shields.|$|E

5000|$|The {{decision}} {{to live a}} year without God was met by criticism from faith-based communities. Christianity Today published an article, in which they criticized Bell's idea: [...] "this notion that he can turn his faith off for one calendar year, then <b>flip</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> back should he so desire strikes me as strange," [...] wrote Laura Turner. In an interview on the CBC Radio Tapestry podcast, Bell responded {{to some of the}} criticism by saying that he understands the position of [...] "you either believe in God or not", but he also believes that people should be able to try things out, go wherever your questions lead you, pursue your own truth. On this podcast Bell also talks about how his life was affected by his {{decision to}} live without God.

50|$|He {{manages to}} grab a hold of a {{telephone}} receiver, but lets go when he is rebuked by the operator, and ends up holding onto the lower stair pillar. All of Tom's nine lives are sucked out and form a chain of cats holding on to each other. Life 9 bites Tom's tail, causing his host to yelp with pain and speed off, freeing all the other lives. Life 1 smiles at the camera as he is freed. Tom runs {{around the corner and}} bumps his head on the wall, whereupon 8 of the lives rejoin him, and the ninth swings his arms before following. Tom instantly recovers and hears the vacuum again, tries to find somewhere to run, and sees a shocking scene: Jerry operating the ghost-vacuum. Jerry continues to <b>flip</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> and invites Tom to laugh with him. It takes a few looks and a peek into the distance for the mouse to realize that the cat, instead of being scared, is standing behind him. Jerry gulps nervously after he notices this. He resignedly walks out, and then dashes behind the nightshirt and makes a neophyte attempt to scare Tom by making a ghostly noise and waving his arms. Tom's I-mean-business look finally catches on, and Jerry waves and narrowly escapes from the leap from Tom pouncing.|$|E
