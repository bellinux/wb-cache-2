5|$|Boycott <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> {{that he did}} {{not want}} such a large number of Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers were needed to save the root crops. He feared that a large number of Ulstermen would lead to sectarian violence. While local Land League leaders said that there would be no trouble from them if the aim was simply to harvest the crops, more extreme {{sections}} of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops.|$|E
25|$|What is now {{considered}} the Theme from The Exorcist, Tubular Bells by Mike Oldfield, became very popular after the film's release. Oldfield <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> he was not impressed with how his work {{was used in the}} film.|$|E
25|$|Angelo Dundee {{wrote that}} Norton's best punch was the left hook. Many others lauded his infamous {{overhand}} right. In a Ring Magazine article, Norton <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> that a right uppercut to Jerry Quarry {{was the hardest}} blow he recalled landing.|$|E
60|$|Arnulf pouted. He {{wanted to}} keep his Viking for <b>himself,</b> and <b>said</b> so.|$|R
60|$|Just {{as the big}} ship in tow {{gets the}} credit, with most spectators, of being the {{powerful}} object, so the Patriarch usually seemed to have <b>said</b> <b>himself</b> whatever Pancks <b>said</b> for him.|$|R
50|$|Hugh of Brienne <b>himself</b> is <b>said</b> to {{have tried}} to sell his rights to Alfonso III of Aragon in 1289.|$|R
25|$|Nonviolence advocates {{see some}} truth in this argument: Gandhi <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> often {{that he could}} teach nonviolence to a violent person but not to a coward and that true nonviolence came from renouncing violence, not by not having any to renounce.|$|E
25|$|Two roles {{mentioned}} above, Salome and the Marschallin, {{are relatively}} high dramatic sopranos and {{require that the}} soprano can endure long stretches of very high tessitura. Richard Strauss <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> that Salome should be sung by someone with the flexibility of a dramatic coloratura due to the high tessitura.|$|E
25|$|Whatever else {{may be said}} of the {{intricate}} alliance system evolved by the German Chancellor, it must be admitted that it worked and that it tided Europe {{over a period of several}} critical years without a rupture.... there was, as Bismarck <b>himself</b> <b>said,</b> a premium upon the maintenance of peace.|$|E
50|$|He <b>himself</b> has <b>said</b> that {{he would}} like his {{paintings}} to easily be remembered, without needing to understand their meaning.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I will, by--' But {{as there}} was a humorous {{expression}} in Wardle's face, Mr. Pickwick checked <b>himself,</b> and <b>said,</b> 'Why not?' ...|$|R
25|$|Gert Postel went to Hauptschule and {{finished}} his {{training as a}} mail carrier. Postel <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> that his mother died because of a maladministered depression treatment and that he himself had briefly been in a juvenile ward. From these events, {{he claimed to have}} gained the motivation to expose and embarrass psychiatry.|$|E
25|$|Some participants, {{including}} Dick Gregory {{criticized the}} choice of mostly white performers {{and the lack of}} group participation in the singing. Dylan <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> he felt uncomfortable as a white man serving as a public image for the Civil Rights Movement. After the March on Washington, he performed at few other immediately politicized events.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, Andy Kaufman made an Elvis {{impersonation}} {{part of his}} act. He {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} first notable Elvis impersonators and Elvis <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> that Kaufman was his favorite impersonator. In his act, Kaufman would precede with several failed impersonations before unexpectedly launching into a skilled impersonation of Elvis Presley. As Kaufman gained fame, the impersonation was used less and less.|$|E
50|$|Sanskrit and Telugu {{literature}} flourished {{during this}} period. The king <b>himself</b> is <b>said</b> to have composed a Telugu {{version of the}} Ramayana.|$|R

25|$|The {{majority}} of the You're Fired studio audience, combined {{with two of the}} panellists, disagreed with the decision, feeling that Claire should have been fired for her complete lack of respect, although Simon <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> that he deserved to be fired. Sir Alan would later go on to say that he kept Claire as she still had more potential, even if her attitude was lacking.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009, David Černý <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> that he {{expected}} completely different reactions than those described below. In his opinion, Bulgaria doesn't even {{make it to the}} top three of the most provocative countries caricatured by Entropa. The most provocative country is Poland, with the reference to gays. It is followed by the UK (missing) and Slovakia that, according to Mr Černý, is a bubble restricted by Hungary.|$|E
25|$|Another option {{available}} to the committee was to have allowed Collins to take his potential game-winning kick at a later date. Although the modern laws of the game allow a match to be abandoned after a delay of thirty minutes, this provision {{was not included in}} the laws of 1967. Collins <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> that he was surprised that he was not allowed to return to take his kick the following day.|$|E
50|$|António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, <b>himself</b> Portuguese, <b>said</b> he {{was shocked}} by the tragedy and pledged to offer all needed assistance.|$|R

25|$|Lankester appears, thinly disguised, {{in several}} novels. He {{is the model}} for Sir Roderick Dover in H.G. Wells' Marriage (Wells {{had been one of}} his students), and in Robert Briffault's Europa, which {{contains}} a brilliant portrait of Lankester, including his friendship with Karl Marx. He has also been suggested as the model for Professor Challenger in Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World, but Doyle <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> that Challenger was based on a professor of physiology at the University of Edinburgh named William Rutherford.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{emptiness}} {{as lack of}} inherent existence has {{very little to do}} with what the Buddha <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> about emptiness. His teachings on emptiness — as reported in the earliest Buddhist texts, the Pali Canon — deal directly with actions and their results, with issues of pleasure and pain. To understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication, but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they cause.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} 2012–13 Champions League with Bayern, Tymoshchuk {{returned}} to Zenit despite receiving offers from different clubs around Europe. Russian media claim Tymoshchuk {{was signed by}} Zenit {{not only because of}} his skills as player, but for his ability to integrate the Russians and the foreigners in the team and stop the rumored conflicts among groups in the squad. Tymoshchuk <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> the return to Zenit was the last transfer in his career, indicating he would finish his playing career with the club.|$|E
25|$|In any event, Bond <b>himself</b> has <b>said</b> {{that due}} {{to the risk of}} injury he no longer wants to play test cricket for NZ.|$|R

25|$|Having toured Australia in {{the winter}} of 1873–74, Grace arrived in England on 18 May 1874 and was quickly back into {{domestic}} cricket. The 1874 season was very successful for him as he completed a second successive double. Gloucestershire again had a strong claim to the Champion County title although some sources have awarded it to Derbyshire and Grace <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> that it should have gone to Yorkshire. Another good season followed in 1875 when he again completed the double with 1,498 runs and 191 wickets. This was his most successful season as a bowler.|$|E
25|$|He was an {{important}} representative of colour expressionism in the art scene of Yugoslavia during the 1930s. His landscapes of Dalmatia are reminiscent of the style of Van Gogh. He {{is best known for}} his series of paintings inspired by life on the island of Brač. Job <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> that “the beneficial influence of the Brač landscape can be felt, the hot sun, blue sea, and green branches of olive trees swayed by the breath of the maestral”. His paintings depicted the Mediterranean landscape, motifs of the town of Supetar, fishing themes, and more rarely portraits and nudes.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, {{the club}} {{announced}} their fourth summer addition of promising defender Calum Chambers from Southampton {{for an undisclosed}} fee thought to be around £11million, rising to a potential £16million with performance-related add ons. Although he was brought on promise due his age of 19, {{he is able to}} play in the right back, centre-back and defensive midfield positions which presented Wenger a risk he was willing to take. Chambers <b>himself</b> <b>said</b> that Arsenal's playing style is what attracted him to the club, as well as the chance to compete with the top sides in Europe.|$|E
50|$|One source has {{described}} him as being born in Bait Rima on the West Bank, although Barghouti <b>himself</b> has <b>said</b> that {{he was born in}} Jerusalem.|$|R
50|$|Wu <b>himself</b> has <b>said</b> {{that if he}} were to {{medal in}} the London 2012 Olympics, he would {{consider}} his career to have been full and satisfying.|$|R
