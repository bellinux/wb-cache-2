40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the effect of building design's inaccuracy against the cost of maintenance, by taking the research in Serayu Opak River Basin Organization, Water Resources Field and Water Resources Management Center in Yogyakarta Special Region. The first step is to analyze the inaccuracy of building design based on the result of interview and observation during field survey. The second step is to analyze the cost of building maintenance. The third step is to analyze the maintenance costs used to minimize the effects of the inaccurate design of the building. The result shows the inaccuracy of building design {{in the form of the}} use of clear glass without coated glass film and the absence of heat insulator on the roof of the building cause the room to become hot. The <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> rain <b>gutters</b> without vertical pipes, toilet facilities in the entire building is not yet complete, inadequate accessibility for persons with disabilities, and inadequate corridor design. There is a small portion of the maintenance budget used for reducing the impact of building design's inaccuracy, so it can be concluded that the design of the building is less meet the requirements of the Government regulations...|$|R
40|$|In {{the face}} of {{increasing}} urbanization, there is growing interest in application of microscale hydrologic solutions to minimize storm runoff and conserve water at the source. In this study, a physically based numerical model was developed to understand hydrologic processes better at the urban residential scale and the interaction of these processes among different best management practices (BMPs). This model simulates hydrologic processes using an hourly interval for over a full year or for specific storm events. The model was applied to treatment and control single-family residential parcels in Los Angeles, California. Data collected from the control and treatment sites over 2 years were used to calibrate and validate the model. Annual storm runoff to the street was eliminated by 97 % with <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> rain <b>gutters,</b> a driveway interceptor, and lawn retention basin. Evaluated individually, the driveway interceptor was the most effective BMP for storm runoff reduction (65 %), followed by the rain gutter installation (28 %), and lawn converted to retention basin (12 %). An 11 m 3 cistern did not substantially reduce runoff, but provided 9 % of annual landscape irrigation demand. Simulated landscape irrigation water use was reduced 53 % by increasing irrigation system efficiency, and adjusting application rates monthly based on plant water demand. The model showed that infiltration and surface runoff processes were particularly sensitive to the soil’s physical properties and its effective depth. Replacing the existing loam soil with clay soil increased annual runoff discharge to the street by 63 % when climate and landscape features remained unchanged.

40|$|Authentication of {{edible oils}} is a {{long-term}} issue in food safety, and becomes particularly important with the emergence and wide spread <b>of</b> <b>gutter</b> oils in recent years. Due to the very high analytical demand and diversity <b>of</b> <b>gutter</b> oils, a high throughput analytical method and a versatile strategy for authentication of mixed edible oils and gutter oils are highly desirable. In this study, an improved matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) method has been developed for direct analysis of edible oils. This method involved on-target sample loading, automatic data acquisition and simple data processing. MALDI-MS spectra with high quality and high reproducibility have been obtained using this method, and a preliminary spectral database of edible oils has been set up. The authenticity of an edible oil sample can be determined by comparing its MALDI-MS spectrum and principal component analysis (PCA) results with those of its labeled oil in the database. This method is simple and the whole process only takes several minutes for analysis of one oil sample. We demonstrated that the method was sensitive to change in oil compositions {{and can be used}} for measuring compositions of mixed oils. The capability of the method for determining mislabeling enables it for rapid screening <b>of</b> <b>gutter</b> oils since fraudulent mislabeling is a common feature <b>of</b> <b>gutter</b> oils.

40|$|Objective: Gutters can be {{described}} as the loss of continuous apposition between {{the main body of the}} endograft, the chimney stent graft, and the aortic wall. Gutters have been associated with increased risk of type IA endoleaks and are considered to be the Achilles' heel of chimney endovascular aneurysm repair (ch-EVAR). However, there is no classification yet to classify and quantify gutter types after ch-EVAR. Methods: Different gutter types can be distinguished by their morphologic appearance in two- and three-dimensional views and reconstructed slices perpendicular to the center lumen line. Results: Three main categories are defined by (1) the most proximal beginning <b>of</b> the <b>gutter,</b> (2) the length <b>of</b> <b>gutter</b> alongside the endograft, and (3) its distal end. Type A gutters originate at the proximal fabric of an endograft, type B gutters originate as loss of apposition of the chimney stent graft in the branch vessel, and type C gutters start below the fabric of the endograft. To determine eventual changes <b>of</b> <b>gutter</b> size during follow-up computed tomography angiograms (CTAs), measurements may be performed with dedicated software on the follow-up CTA scan to assess the extent <b>of</b> <b>gutters</b> over the aortic circumference, ranging from 0 ° to 360 ° of freedom, together with the maximum gap between the endograft material and the aortic wall as it appears on reconstructed axial CTA scan slices. Conclusions: The proposed gutter classification enables a uniform nomenclature in the current ch-EVAR literature and a more accurate risk assessment of gutter-associated endoleaks. Moreover, it allows monitoring of eventual progression <b>of</b> <b>gutter</b> size during follow-up...|$|R
5000|$|From late 1889 {{until about}} 1895, {{there was a}} {{depression}} in Queensland. North Queensland suffered especially, due to a significant downturn in sugar production, and a drought, which peaked in 1889. This had a severe impact on the regional mining industry because the crushing mills needed water. Charters Towers and Croydon were affected and this had a flow-on effect for Burns Philp. Robert Philp had speculated on mining and real estate and had to sell his company shares and resign from the Board in 1893. It suffered a substantial decline in profitability, which in 1893 James Burns blamed on [...] "insane overstocking of Normanton five years ago" [...] with mining supplies. This included 300 pairs of bellows which {{are used in the}} dry-processing of gold. Despite the downturn, approval was given for the addition of a strongroom to the Normanton building, in late 1892. In January 1893 Burns Philp wrote to the Normanton Municipal Council requesting kerb and gutter be installed adjoining their store on Landsborough and Caroline Streets. The tender of £24 from local contractors Copeland and Cant for stone and concrete kerbing was accepted in February. It was installed ten feet past the side entrance to the Burns Philp store in Landsborough Street and {{to the end of the}} veranda in Caroline Street. The Council then requested the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> spouting and <b>gutters</b> on the Burns Philp store. The cast iron gutter coves on the kerb were not tendered for at this time, and presumably were added later, reportedly manufactured at the Croydon foundry, operated by Messer's Stuart and Mackenzie between 1891 and 1912.|$|R
40|$|Guttering is {{the most}} common method for {{conveying}} rainwater from the capture surface (normally a roof) to storage. The cost <b>of</b> such <b>gutters</b> is a relatively small fraction of the total system cost (typically under 20 %) but guttering failure accounts for much loss in RWH system performance. The optimum gutter may be defined as that which minimises the system cost per litre of water captured. There are a series <b>of</b> <b>gutter</b> variables within the control of the installer, including: gutter shape, slope, width and position relative to the roof edge. This paper focuses on an analysis of the sizing and positioning <b>of</b> <b>gutters,</b> based on several sources, including rainfall data from the humid tropics and experiments undertaken by the DTU at the University of Warwick and in Sri Lanka. For domestic RWH applications, it was found that relatively small gutters (around 5 to 8 cm wide), if hung accurately, offer high performance. Typically an economically optimum gutter would intercept and convey only 90 - 95 % of roof run-off to the cistern. Indeed, it appears that gutters are often oversized in practice. The use of a dual slope can improve the performance <b>of</b> <b>guttering.</b> Having concluded the technical analysis, rules of thumb and tabulated recommendations are presented, suitable for application by rainwater harvesting practitioners...|$|R

40|$|A gutter {{design that}} optimises self {{flushing}} potential {{is crucial in}} rain water harvesting at the dwelling scale. Excluding and removing organic debris from a gutter {{is essential for the}} maintenance of water quality in water harvesting systems. There are existing debris exclusion products; however the function, performance and suitability of these products is not well understood and application is limited as they require ongoing maintenance. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the water harvesting gutter configuration that minimises the maintenance needs and optimises self flushing. Investigation into the conditions and processes that influence the performance of guarded and un-guarded roofs found that the failure mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>gutter</b> guard products was due to the entrapment of debris (above the guard) and infiltration of decomposed debris. A series of experiments was undertaken to test a set of three hypotheses, regarding the most efficient shape and slope and obstruction threshold. The results support the notion that the semi-circular gutter is the most efficient cross sectional shape for a gutter. Increasing the slope <b>of</b> a <b>gutter</b> increased the bed-load (sediment) transport facility <b>of</b> a <b>gutter,</b> but had a negative effect on the removal of buoyant debris from the <b>gutter.</b> The combination <b>of</b> <b>gutter</b> guard products with accessibility to the 'head' <b>of</b> the <b>gutter</b> and the semi-circular high slope design conditions is likely to provide an effective self flushing and low maintenance gutter...|$|R

More severe punishments will also be given out to government and public officials who fail to properly address matters related to gutter oil. The State Council said inspectors would target edible oil trade fairs and wholesale markets and called for inspections of oil being used at restaurants, school cafeterias, work canteens and kitchens at construction sites. The State Council also stated that businesses that use recycled oil would be forced to close temporarily or lose their business license while peddlers who sell the oil could be criminally prosecuted.
