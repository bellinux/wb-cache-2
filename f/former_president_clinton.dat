Paul's suit against the FEC was thrown out; his attempt to bring ethics charges against Clinton was rejected, and his fraud charges against Senator Clinton were tossed out in April 2006. [...] Paul continued to press civil charges against Senator Clinton and <b>former</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> for [...] "looting" [...] his business, but the courts refused to allow him to sue Senator Clinton, with the appellate court specifying that her behavior had been “perfectly legal”, and allowing her to recoup her legal fees from Paul.|$|E
