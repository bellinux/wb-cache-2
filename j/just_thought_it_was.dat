500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{contains}} a scene wherein Reyes serenades Scully with [...] "karaoke renditions" [...] of whale calls. Gish later noted that [...] " [...] gave me a tape of whale songs, which was hysterical to be playing in my trailer." [...] Carter was inspired to write the scene after a friend gave him a Paul Winter album that incorporated whale sounds into the music. Carter later explained that, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> kind of much like [...] character to appreciate that." ...|$|E

The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens {{the whole thing up}} ... Dylan put it into the mainstream that this could be done." ...|$|E

500|$|Lucas came up {{with ideas}} that {{involved}} a religious cult devoted to child slavery, black magic and ritual human sacrifice. Lawrence Kasdan of Raiders of the Lost Ark was asked to write the script. [...] "I didn't want {{to be associated with}} Temple of Doom," [...] he reflected. [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> horrible. It's so mean. There's nothing pleasant about it. I think Temple of Doom represents a chaotic period in both their [...] lives, and the movie is very ugly and mean-spirited." [...] Lucas hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz to write the script because of their knowledge of Indian culture. Gunga Din served as an influence for the film.|$|E
500|$|The dark, ironic {{lyrics of}} [...] "Today", {{describing}} {{a day when}} Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation. Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the song is [...] "downright pretty as rock ballads go" [...] but that [...] "Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks." [...] Corgan told Rolling Stone that [...] "I was really suicidal... I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> funny to write a song that said today is the greatest day of your life because it can't get any worse." [...] Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of [...] "Today" [...] and [...] "Disarm" [...] to [...] "ripping [...] guts out."

500|$|Morrison {{recalled}} his {{first encounter with}} Dylan's music {{in an interview in}} 2000: [...] "I think I heard [...] in a record shop in Smith Street.

The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up." [...] Morrison's record producer at the time, Bert Berns, encouraged him to find models for his songs, so he bought Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home album in March 1965. One of the songs on the album held a unique fascination for Morrison and he soon started performing [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in small clubs and pubs as a solo artist (without Them).|$|E

500|$|With {{the help}} of co-executive {{producer}} Frank Spotnitz, {{he came up with}} a new idea. Spotnitz was inspired by an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show, called [...] "The Night the Roof Fell In", in which the characters of Rob and Laura Petrie tell different versions of a fight they have had. Gilligan said of the idea, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a cool way to tell a story." [...] With two versions of the same story taking up much of the episode, Gilligan knew {{that he would have to}} keep the plot simple and settled on a vampire story, that everyone would easily understand. Both Mulder and Scully's version of the episode were filmed back to back, utilizing the [...] "exact same sets and camera angles". The RV park that was featured in the episode was formerly the site of a sawmill that had previously been used in the fourth season episode [...] "Gethsemane" [...] that had burned down.|$|E
500|$|Another {{idea from}} which the episode was crafted was the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre: initially, the episode would have found the genre enjoyed by all {{citizens}} {{of the town of}} South Park, not just a younger audience. By Sunday, completed animated shots were being edited together and set to the song [...] "Landslide" [...] by Fleetwood Mac. The song's use in the episode was unsure until Tuesday night, when they eventually received clearance to use it. Parker noted later that they had backup songs to use if necessary, but none fit as well as [...] "Landslide". They were very satisfied with the ending, feeling it provided a very emotional conclusion to the show. In addition, the episodes contains what Parker describes in the commentary as [...] "our favorite thing of any South Park ever": the Duck President, who communicates by spraying feces from his mouth. [...] "Every time in the retake room when Duck President was on, shitting, quacking and shitting, we <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the greatest thing ever," [...] he remarked.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Daniel Chun, his fourth writing credit of the series. It was directed by then-showrunner Paul Lieberstein, his sixth directing credit of the series. The episode marked the first appearance of Will Ferrell's four-episode arc on the series and {{is also one of}} series star, Carell's last episodes as a regular on the series. Ferrell signed on to appear in Steve Carell's final three episodes, and the first episode without Carell, [...] "The Inner Circle", to make Carell's transition easier. Carell had decided to leave the series, because [...] "I just think it's time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time for my character to go".

5000|$|The Cancellation Bear was {{mentioned}} in the Suburgatory season 2 episode [...] "Body Talk". Suburgatory showrunner Emily Kapnek subsequently did an interview with TV by the Numbers, explaining: [...] "we <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> really funny to have show's school TV station governed by the same panic and hysteria that everyone feels watching their shows live and die and get discussed online so we <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a really fun shout out because we’re all on your site all the time." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Partition" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava and was shot at the Parisian cabaret club, Crazy Horse. It was filmed quickly as Jay-Z had to travel to London for a concert after the shooting. In a video commentary to the album, Beyoncé said: [...] "The day that I got engaged was my husband's birthday and I took him to Crazy Horse. And I remember thinking, 'Damn, these girls are fly.' I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the ultimate sexy show I've ever seen. And I was like, 'I wish I was up there, I wish I could perform that for my man...' So that's what I did for the video." [...] Talking about the video, Nava noted that for the shooting Beyoncé {{was trying to be}} [...] "even more risque than she's been in the past". While filming, he further tried to [...] "create and capture a bit of genuine intimacy" [...] between the singer and her husband.

500|$|... "Goodbye, Michael" [...] {{was written}} by series {{developer}} and executive producer Greg Daniels, his 10th writing credit of the series. The episode was directed by Paul Feig, marking his 14th credit for the series. On June 28, 2010, {{it was confirmed that}} the seventh season of The Office would be Steve Carell's last. He had previously announced this while being interviewed on BBC Radio. [...] "I just think it's time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time for my character to go," [...] Carell was quoted as saying. In January 2011, it was announced that Carell would exit the show early, four episodes {{before the end of the}} season. A few weeks after this announcement came the news that Will Ferrell, who previously starred alongside Carell in , had signed on to appear in a four-episode arc as a Dunder Mifflin branch manager who temporarily takes Michael Scott's position in Scranton. To help ease the transition, Ferrell appeared in Carell's final episodes as well as one additional episode after he departs.|$|E
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} {{asked him to}} describe himself as a child, he replied that he was [...] "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids." [...] His passion for sea life {{can be traced to}} his childhood, when several films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. He has said that Cousteau [...] "provided a view into that world", which he did not know existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that [...] "should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad." [...] Also at a young age, Hillenburg developed his interest in art. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade depicting [...] "a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting" [...] marked the first praise that he received for his work after his teacher commended it. [...] "Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that {{was in the middle of}} [...] She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that,'" [...] Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew that he [...] "had some [...] skill". Hillenburg asserted that his artistry comes from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was [...] "really, really gifted" [...] and a [...] "great painter". In the 1970s, someone took him to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hillenburg was [...] "knocked out" [...] by the foreign animated films that were screened at the festival, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). [...] "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," [...] he recounted.|$|E
