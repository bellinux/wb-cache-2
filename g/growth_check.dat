40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether intermittent suckling (IS) combined with an extended lactation can reduce postweaning <b>growth</b> <b>check</b> in pigs. Three weaning regimens [conventional weaning (CW), IS with 6 -h separation intervals (IS 6), and IS with 12 -h separation intervals (IS 12) ] were compared. In CW (n = 17 litters), litters had continuous access to the sow until weaning (d 21, d 0 = farrowing). In IS 6 and IS 12, litters were separated from the sow for 12 h/d, beginning at d 14 and lasting until weaning (d 41 to 45). Litters were with the sow from 1400 to 2000 and from 0200 to 0800 (IS 6, n = 14) or between 2000 and 0800 (IS 12, n = 14). Litter size was standardized within 2 d after farrowing by crossfostering, resulting in an average litter size of 10. 9 +/- 1. 8 piglets. Piglets had ad libitum access to creep feed from d 7 onward. One week after the onset of IS (d 20), creep feed intake was increased in litters from both IS groups compared with CW litters (P < 0. 05). Both IS groups consumed considerable amounts of creep feed before weaning (d 41 to 45). Total feed intake before weaning was greater (P = 0. 004) in IS 12 (3, 808 +/- 469 g/ piglet) than in IS 6 (2, 717 +/- 404 g/ piglet). In comparison, CW litters consumed 18 +/- 9 g/ piglet before weaning (d 21). Irrespective of weaning regimen, total feed intake of litters before weaning was highly correlated with postweaning feed intake (P < 0. 001). Furthermore, in all treatment groups, total preweaning feed intake was correlated with postweaning growth (P < 0. 10). Irrespective of treatment, piglets suckling anterior teats grew faster than piglets suckling middle or posterior teats during the first 2 wk of lactation. Body weights at the end of the experiment (d 55) were similar among weaning regimens. Onset of IS induced a <b>growth</b> <b>check</b> in both IS groups (34 % for IS 12 and 22 % for IS 6). Only a mild <b>growth</b> <b>check</b> was observed after weaning of IS litters (14 % for both IS groups). However, a serious <b>growth</b> <b>check</b> (98 %) was observed after weaning of CW litters. Results of the current study indicate that IS stimulated feed intake during lactation, providing a more gradual transition to weaning.

The trial in Uganda consisted of two cultivars susceptible to nematodes, a plantain, Gonja manjaya and an East African Highland banana, Mbwazirume, plus a nematode resistant dessert banana, Yangambi km 5. A comparative approach included adding a mixed population of Radopholus similis, Helicotylenchus multicinctus and Meloidogyne spp. to the soil around half the plants of each cultivar prior to field planting. Measurements of LAI were made fortnightly from 106 days post-planting over two successive cropping cycles. The highest mean LAI during the first cycle for Gonja manjaya was suppressed to 74. 8 ± 3. 5 % by the addition of nematodes, while for Mbwazirume the values were reduced to 71. 1 ± 1. 9 %. During the second cycle these values were 69. 2 ± 2. 2 % and 72. 2 ± 2. 7 %, respectively. Reductions in LAI values were validated as due to the biotic stress by assessing nematode numbers in roots and the necrosis they caused at each of two harvests and the relationship is described. Yield losses, including a component due to toppled plants, were 35. 3 % and 55. 3 % for Gonja manjaya and 31. 4 % and 55. 8 % for Mbwazirume, at first and second harvests respectively. Yangambi km 5 showed no decrease in LAI and yield in the presence of nematodes at both harvests.

40|$|Daily {{separation}} of sows and piglets during lactation, intermittent suckling (IS), improves feed intake and postweaning adaptation in piglets. The {{aim of the}} current study was to determine how, in piglets that have been subjected to IS, age at weaning and the duration of the preceding IS period contribute to postweaning adaptation through effects on feed intake, growth, and gut characteristics. All piglets had ad libitum access to creep feed from d 7. Litters were subjected to conventional weaning (CW) or to 1 of 3 IS regimens. In CW, litters (n = 29) had continuous access to the sow until weaning (d 26, d 0 = farrowing). During IS, litters had access to the sow between 1600 and 0600 h. Litters in the IS treatments were subjected to IS 1) from d 19 onward and weaned at d 26 (IS 19 – 7 D, n = 33), 2) from d 19 onward and weaned at d 33 (IS 19 – 14 D, n = 28), or 3) from d 26 onward and weaned at d 33 (IS 26 – 7 D, n = 33). The IS 19 – 7 D regimen resulted in a relative <b>growth</b> <b>check</b> within the first 2 d after weaning similar to CW litters (72 ± 13 and 90 ± 7 %, respectively), but in a greater piglet growth (P = 0. 014) and feed intake (P = 0. 001) between d 2 and 7 postweaning. Moreover, IS 19 – 7 D was not associated with a (further) reduction in villus height as observed at d 2 postweaning in CW litters. In IS piglets weaned after an extended lactation (d 33), a markedly smaller weaning-associated relative <b>growth</b> <b>check</b> was observed shortly postweaning (11 ± 18 and 32 ± 19 % for IS 19 – 14 D and IS 26 – 7 D litters, respectively). In these litters, feed intake and growth within the first 2 d after weaning were slightly greater when piglets were subjected to IS for 2 wk (IS 19 – 14 D) rather than for 1 wk (IS 26 – 7 D; P = 0. 032 and P = 0. 037 for feed intake and growth, respectively). Irrespective of duration of IS, weaning at d 33 with IS was not associated with a reduction in villus height. Irrespective of treatment, plasma citrulline concentrations were reduced at d 2 and 8 postweaning compared with the values at weaning (P 0. 01). No correlation was observed between postweaning plasma citrulline concentrations and postweaning small intestinal villus height. This study indicates that 1 wk of IS before weaning at d 26 of lactation improves feed intake and growth between d 2 and 7 postweaning and does not result in a reduction of villus height as observed in CW piglets, although it did not prevent a profound <b>growth</b> <b>check</b> shortly after weaning. However, combining 1 wk of IS with an extended lactation improved postweaning adaptation markedly in terms of growth, feed intake, and gut characteristics.
