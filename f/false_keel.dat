25|$|In 1708, Charles Perry {{suggested}} copper sheathing explicitly as an anti-fouling device but {{the first}} experiments were not made until 1761 with the sheathing of HMS Alarm, after which the bottoms and sides of several ships' <b>keels</b> and <b>false</b> <b>keels</b> were sheathed with copper plates.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of copper}} {{sheathing}} was first suggested by Charles Perry in 1708, {{though it was}} rejected by the Navy Board on grounds of high cost and perceived maintenance difficulties.

50|$|Gunboat No. 5 left Hampton Roads on 15 May {{and sailed}} to the Mediterranean, in company with Gunboat No. 10. In 1805 the navy sent eight gunboats to the Mediterranean. For the voyage across the Atlantic, the gunboats {{received}} a dandy rig, <b>false</b> <b>keels,</b> and lee boards. They stowed their guns below, but carried light guns, possibly swivel guns, {{in order to}} have some means of defense.|$|R
500|$|The ship {{remained}} in very poor condition following her grounding on the Great Barrier Reef in June. The ship's carpenter, John Seetterly, observed {{that she was}} [...] "very leaky – makes from twelve to sixinches an hour, occasioned by her main keel being wounded in many places, <b>false</b> <b>keel</b> gone from beyond the [...] Wounded on her [...] side where the greatest leak is but I could not come at it for the water." [...] An inspection of the hull revealed that some unrepaired planks were cut through to within ⅛inch (3mm). Cook noted it was a [...] "surprise to every one who saw her bottom how we had kept her above water" [...] for the previous three-month voyage across open seas.|$|E
2500|$|At Halifax, Nova Scotia, Centaur {{was put on}} {{her side}} for repairs. At {{that time it was}} {{discovered}} that [...] "14 feet of <b>false</b> <b>keel</b> was found off from the fore foot aft, which occasioned the leak." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{vessels of}} the class were fast, most {{recording}} 13 kn large and 10 kn close-hauled. However, their French-style proportions made them unweatherly compared to frigates designed to British proportions (such as the [...] ). Many captains requested additions to the frigates' <b>false</b> <b>keels</b> to remedy this. The Leda class stood to their canvas well and liked a stiff gale, but were prone to excessive pitching in very heavy seas. All captains complained {{of the class}}'s poor stowage capacity, the result of their fine French underwater lines, but stowage improved after the introduction of iron fresh-water tanks. Lastly, captains considered the class to be [...] "wet", a result of lively rolling and pitching causing seams to loosen.|$|R
6000|$|Lionel Lukin, a coach-builder in London, was the {{inventor}} of the lifeboat. He took out a patent for it on the 2nd November, 1785, and wrote a pamphlet on lifeboats, entitled [...] "The Invention, Principles, and Construction of Insubmergible Boats." [...] His boat was rendered buoyant by means of a projecting gunwale of cork, and hollow air-cases within it; one of these being at the head, the other at the stern. It was ballasted by means of a <b>false</b> iron <b>keel.</b> In these respects this boat possessed, in rudimentary form, the essentials of the lifeboat of the present day. A coble was converted into a lifeboat on these principles by Lukin, and launched at Bamborough, where, {{in the course of the}} first year, it was the means of saving many lives. This was the first lifeboat ever brought into action.|$|R
50|$|The longship's narrow deep keel {{provided}} strength {{beneath the}} waterline. A typical size keel of a longer ship was 100 x 300 mm amidships, tapering in width at {{the bow and}} stern. Sometimes there was a <b>false</b> outer <b>keel</b> to take the wear while being dragged up a beach. These large timbers were shaped with both adze and broadaxe. At the bow the cut water was especially strong, as longboats sailed in ice strewn water in spring. Hulls up to 560 cm wide gave stability, making the longship less likely to tip when sailed. The greater beam provided more moment of leverage by placing the crew or any other mobile weight on the windward side. Oceangoing longships had higher topsides about a 1 m high to keep out water. Higher topsides were supported with knees with the long axis fastened {{to the top of}} the crossbeams. The hull was waterproofed with animal hair, wool, hemp or moss drenched in pine tar. The ships would be tarred in the autumn and then left in a boathouse over the winter to allow time for the tar to dry. To keep the sea out, wooden disks were put into the oar holes. These could be shut from the inside when the oars were not in use. A drain plug hole about 25 mm was drilled in the garboard plank on one side to allow rain water drainage.|$|R

The squadron arrived at Port Mahon, Spain on 1June. Doris was ordered to leave the squadron and proceed to Gibraltar under steam. Endymion was ordered to proceed to Devonport, She departed on 13 June, arriving at Plymouth on 4July. After a spell on guard off the Isle of Wight, where Queen Victoria was staying at Osborne House, she arrived at the Medway on 23July for paying off. Endymion left Cowes on 21 July, and was replaced by an ironclad. She sailed to Portsmouth for paying off. On 27July, an able seaman from Endymion was court-martialled on board [...] at The Nore. He was charged with being in contempt of an officer and conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. He was found guilty and sentenced to one year's hard labour and to be dismissed from the Navy.Endymion was sent to the Humber for coast guard duties.|$|E
6000|$|... "Her {{heart is}} the master. With a {{sufficient}} commander no stout ship is ever lost, {{so long as}} she has a foot of water beneath her <b>false</b> <b>keel,</b> or a ropeyarn left to turn to account." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. The {{wife said}} he had a strong sled with him, an' the best team o' dogs in the camp.--Do you think the boat will need a new <b>false</b> <b>keel?</b> I was lookin' at it, an' it seemed to me rather far gone for a long trup." ...|$|E
60|$|Columbus embraced this zealous follower, who {{immediately}} set about preparing for his expedition. Drawing his canoe on shore, {{he put on}} a <b>false</b> <b>keel,</b> nailed weather-boards along the bow and stern, to prevent the sea from breaking over it; payed it with a coat of tar; furnished it with a mast and sail; and put in provisions for himself, a Spanish comrade, and six Indians.|$|E
60|$|The damage {{sustained}} by the Red Eric during the storm {{was found to be}} more severe than was at first supposed. Part of her <b>false</b> <b>keel</b> had been torn away by a sunken rock, over which the vessel had passed, and scraped so lightly that no one on board was aware of the fact, yet with sufficient force to cause the damage to which we have referred. A slight leak was also discovered, and the injury {{to the top of the}} foremast was neither so easily nor so quickly repaired as had been anticipated.|$|E
6000|$|And to work we {{went right}} busily, {{so that in}} three days from that time we {{had set up a}} mast and sail, with the {{necessary}} rigging, in our little boat. The sail was not, indeed, very handsome to look at, as it was formed of a number of oblong patches of cloth; but we had sewed it well by means of our sail-needle, so that it was strong, which was the chief point.--Jack had also overcome the difficulty about the keel by pinning to it a <b>false</b> <b>keel.</b> This was a piece of tough wood, of the same length and width as the real keel, and about five inches deep. He made it of this depth because the boat would be thereby rendered not only much more safe, but more able to beat against the wind--which, in a sea where the trade-winds blow so long and so steadily in one direction, was a matter of great importance. This piece of wood was pegged very firmly to the keel; and we now launched our boat with the satisfaction of knowing that when the <b>false</b> <b>keel</b> should be scraped off we could easily put on another,--whereas, should the real keel have been scraped away, we could not have renewed it without taking our boat to pieces, which Peterkin said made his [...] "marrow quake to think upon." ...|$|E
60|$|The Ostjaks greatly {{admired the}} craft, which was entirely {{different}} from anything {{they had ever}} seen. The <b>false</b> <b>keel</b> puzzled them greatly, and Godfrey's explanations, even when aided by Luka, failed altogether in making them understand {{that it would have}} the effect of enabling the craft to sail near the wind without drifting to leeward. The additional draught of water was no inconvenience whatever in a craft designed for the sea, and it added materially to the strength of the canoe. On the 15th of May it was freezing hard. The natives going down to the water's edge in the morning reported a sudden rise of three feet in the river. It continued to rise all day, and by nightfall was fifteen feet above its former level.|$|E
60|$|When fully {{satisfied}} {{with it the}} work of putting on the cover commenced. This was made of very soft and well-tanned reindeer hide, stretched as tightly as possible, and then rubbed with seal oil. The keel of the boat had been made very strong, as the rigidity of the whole craft depended upon this. It had been made flat, and the skins had been taken over it. When it was finished a <b>false</b> <b>keel</b> six inches in depth in the centre, tapering away to nothing at the ends, was fixed underneath. This keel was also made of tough wood, {{a little more than}} a quarter of an inch thick, but widening suddenly to over an inch where it touched the boat, in order that it might be securely fixed with screws to the keel inside.|$|E
60|$|The {{vessel was}} nearly two hundred tons burden. She had {{originally}} been built very strongly, and might even have ventured on a voyage to the Polar seas just as she was. But Captain Harvey resolved to take every precaution to insure {{the success of his}} voyage, and the safety and comfort of his men. He, therefore, had the whole of the ship's bottom sheathed with thick hardwood planking, which was carried up above her water-line, as high as the ordinary floe-ice would be likely to reach. The hull inside was strengthened with stout cross-beams, as well as with beams running {{along the length of the}} vessel, and in every part that was likely to be subjected to pressure iron stanchions were fastened. But the bow of the vessel was the point where the utmost strength was aimed at. Inside, just behind the cutwater, the whole space was so traversed by cross-beams of oak that it almost became a solid mass, and outside the sharp stem was cased in iron so as to resemble a giant's chisel. The <b>false</b> <b>keel</b> was taken off, the whole vessel, in short, was rendered as strong, outside and in, as wood and iron and skill could make her. It need scarcely be said that all the other arrangements about her were made with the greatest care and without regard to expense, for although the owners of the brig did not wish to waste their money, they set too high a value on human life to risk it for the sake of saving a few pounds. She was provisioned for a cruise of two years and a half. But this was in case of accidents, for Captain Harvey did not intend to be absent much longer than one year.|$|E
60|$|Ever {{since the}} vessel left the docks, {{there had been}} six sets of spars of a form so singular, lying among the booms, that they had often {{been the subject of}} {{conversation}} between the mates and myself, neither of the former being able to tell their uses. These sticks were of no great length, some fifteen feet at the most, of sound English oak. Two or three pairs were alike, for they were in pairs, each pair having one of the sides of a shape resembling different parts of the ship's bottom, with the exception that they were chiefly concave, while the bottom of a vessel is mainly convex. At one extremity each pair was firmly connected by a short, massive, iron link, of about two feet in length; and, at its opposite end, a large eye-bolt was driven into each stick, where it was securely forelocked. When the Walrus was stationary, we learned, for the first time, the uses of these unusual preparations. A pair of the timbers, which were of great solidity and strength, were dropped over the stern, and, sinking beneath the keel, their upper extremities were separated by means of lanyards turned into the eye-bolts. The lanyards were then brought forward to the bilge of the vessel, where, by the help of tackles, the timbers were rowsed up in such a manner that the links came close to the <b>false</b> <b>keel,</b> and the timbers themselves were laid snug against each side of the ship. As great care had been taken, by means of marks on the vessel, as well as in forming the skids themselves, the fit was perfect. No less than five pairs were secured in and near the bilge, and as many more were distributed forwards and aft, according to the shape of the bottom. Fore-and-aft pieces, that reached from one skid to the other, were then placed between those about the bilge of the ship, each of them having a certain number of short ribs, extending upwards and downwards. These fore-and-aft pieces were laid along the waterline, their ends entering the skids by means of mortices and tenons, where they were snugly bolted. The result of the entire arrangement was, to give the vessel an exterior protection against the field-ice, by means of a sort of network of timber, the whole of which had been so accurately fitted in the dock, as to bear equally on her frame. These preparations were not fairly completed before ten o'clock on the following morning, when Noah stood directly for an opening in the ice before us, which just about that time began to be apparent.|$|E
6000|$|Camoens! White-Jacket, Camoens! Did {{you ever}} read him? The Lusiad, I mean? It's the {{man-of-war}} epic of the world, my lad. Give me Gama for a Commodore, say I--Noble Gama! And Mickle, White-Jacket, {{did you ever}} read of him? William Julius Mickle? Camoens's Translator? A disappointed man though, White-Jacket. Besides {{his version of the}} Lusiad, he wrote many forgotten things. Did you ever see his ballad of Cumnor Hall?--No?--Why, it gave Sir Walter Scott the hint of Kenilworth. My father knew Mickle when he went to sea on board the old Romney man-of-war. How many great men have been sailors, White-Jacket! They say Homer himself was once a tar, even as his hero, Ulysses, was both a sailor and a shipwright. I'll swear Shakspeare was once a captain of the forecastle. Do you mind the first scene in The Tempest, White-Jacket? And the world-finder, Christopher Columbus, was a sailor! and so was Camoens, who went to sea with Gama, else we had never had the Lusiad, White-Jacket. Yes, I've sailed over the very track that Camoens sailed--round the East Cape into the Indian Ocean. I've been in Don Jose's garden, too, in Macao, and bathed my feet in the blessed dew of the walks where Camoens wandered before me. Yes, White-Jacket, and I have seen and sat in the cave {{at the end of the}} flowery, winding way, where Camoens, according to tradition, composed certain parts of his Lusiad. Ay, Camoens was a sailor once! Then, there's Falconer, whose 'Ship-wreck' will never founder, though he himself, poor fellow, was lost at sea in the Aurora frigate. Old Noah was the first sailor. And St. Paul, too, knew how to box the compass, my lad! mind you that chapter in Acts? I couldn't spin the yarn better myself. Were you ever in Malta? They called it Melita in the Apostle's day. I have been in Paul's cave there, White-Jacket. They say a piece of it is good for a charm against shipwreck; but I never tried it. There's Shelley, he was quite a sailor. Shelley--poor lad! a Percy, too--but they ought to have let him sleep in his sailor's grave--he was drowned in the Mediterranean, you know, near Leghorn--and not burn his body, as they did, as if he had been a bloody Turk. But many people thought him so, White-Jacket, because he didn't go to mass, and because he wrote Queen Mab. Trelawney was by at the burning; and he was an ocean-rover, too! Ay, and Byron helped put a piece of a keel on the fire; for it was made of bits of a wreck, they say; one wreck burning another! And was not Byron a sailor? an amateur forecastle-man, White-Jacket, so he was; else how bid the ocean heave and fall in that grand, majestic way? I say, White-Jacket, d'ye mind me? there never was a very great man yet who spent all his life inland. A snuff of the sea, my boy, is inspiration; and having been once out of sight of land, has been the making of many a true poet and the blasting of many pretenders; for, d'ye see, there's no gammon about the ocean; it knocks the <b>false</b> <b>keel</b> right off a pretender's bows; it tells him just what he is, and makes him feel it, too. A sailor's life, I say, is the thing to bring us mortals out. What does the blessed Bible say? Don't it say that we main-top-men alone see the marvellous sights and wonders?
