5|$|Third, the {{curvature}} index k determines {{the sign of}} the mean spatial curvature of spacetime averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light years). If k=1, {{the curvature}} is positive and the Universe has a <b>finite</b> <b>volume.</b> Such universes are often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the Universe has infinite volume. It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with periodic boundary conditions.|$|E

40|$|An infinite-volume mixing or exponential-decay {{property}} in a spin system or percolation model reflects {{the inability of}} the influence of the conguration in one region to propagate to distant regions, but in some circumstances where such properties hold, propagation can nonetheless occur in <b>finite</b> <b>volumes</b> endowed with boundary conditions. We establish the absense of such propagation, particularly in two dimensions in <b>finite</b> <b>volumes</b> which are simply connected, under a variety of conditions, mainly for the Potts model and the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) random cluster model, allowing external fields. For example, for the FK model in two dimensions we show that exponential decay of connectivity in infinite volume implies exponential decay in simply connected <b>finite</b> <b>volumes,</b> uniformly over all such volumes and all boundary conditions, and implies a strong mixing property for such volumes with certain types of boundary conditions. For the Potts model in two dimensions we show that exponential decay of correlations in infinite volume implies a strong mixing {{property in}} simply connected <b>finite</b> <b>volumes,</b> which includes exponential decay of correlations in simply connected <b>finite</b> <b>volumes,</b> uniformly over all such volumes and all boundary conditions...|$|R

In both of those geometries, two polyhedra that can be cut and reassembled into each other must have the same Dehn invariant. However, as Jessen observed, the extension of Sydler's result to spherical or hyperbolic geometry remains open: {{it is not known}} whether two spherical or hyperbolic polyhedra with the same volume and the same Dehn invariant can always be cut and reassembled into each other.

25|$|Availability of {{high-resolution}} X-ray crystallographic {{measurements of}} complete molecular structures provides {{information about the}} type and location of all atoms that forms the protein. In BioMOCA the protein atoms are modeled as static point charges embedded in a <b>finite</b> <b>volume</b> inaccessible to the ions and associated with a user-defined dielectric coefficient. Moreover, a number of force-field parameters are available that provide information about the charge and radii of atoms in different amino-acid groups. The conjunction of the molecular structure and force fields provide the coordinates, radii, and charge of each atom in the protein channel. BioMOCA uses such information in the standard PQR (Position-Charge-Radius) format to map the protein system onto a rectangular grid.|$|E
25|$|If π1(M) has an {{infinite}} normal cyclic subgroup {{but is not}} virtually solvable then the geometric structure on M is either H2×R or the universal cover of SL(2, R). The manifold M may be either compact or non-compact. If it is compact, then the 2 geometries can be distinguished by whether or not π1(M) has a finite index subgroup that splits as a semidirect product of the normal cyclic subgroup and something else. If the manifold is non-compact, then the fundamental group cannot distinguish the two geometries, and there are examples (such as the complement of a trefoil knot) where a manifold may have a <b>finite</b> <b>volume</b> geometric structure of either type.|$|E

So is the lipid membrane, which is treated as a static dielectric region inaccessible to ions. In fact the only non-static particles in the system are ions. Their motion is assumed classical, interacting with other ions through electrostatic interactions and pairwise Lennard-Jones potential. They also interact with the water background media, which is modeled using a scattering mechanism.|$|E

25|$|The {{oscillating}} universe theory—that {{the universe}} {{will end in}} a collapse or 'big crunch' followed by another big bang, and so on—dates from 1930. Cosmologists such as professor Alexander Vilenkin from Tufts University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Max Tegmark suggest that if space is sufficiently large and uniform, or infinite as some theories suggest, and if quantum theory is true such {{that there is only}} a finite number of configurations within a <b>finite</b> <b>volume</b> possible, due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, then identical instances of the history of Earth's entire Hubble volume occur every so often, simply by chance. Tegmark calculates that our nearest so-called doppelgänger, is 1010115 meters away from us (a double exponential function larger than a googolplex). In principle, {{it would be impossible to}} scientifically verify an identical Hubble volume. However, it does follow as a fairly straightforward consequence from otherwise unrelated scientific observations and theories. Tegmark suggests that statistical analyses exploiting the anthropic principle provide an opportunity to test multiverse theories in some cases. Generally, science would consider a multiverse theory that posits neither a common point of causation, nor the possibility of interaction between universes, to be an ideal speculation. However, it is a fundamental assumption of cosmology that the universe continues to exist beyond the scope of the observable universe, and that the distribution of matter is everywhere the same at such a large scale (see cosmological principle).|$|E
