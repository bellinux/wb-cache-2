5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel,</b> the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
500|$|Six {{species have}} {{disappeared}} from the river since the mid-1980s. The Petitcodiac River was the only known Canadian habitat of the <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel,</b> and was later isolated to just nine American watersheds after its elimination from the Petitcodiac. The Atlantic salmon is no longer present in the watershed, and has since been listed as an endangered species in Canada. The American shad was a favourite with fishermen, and represented two-thirds of the entire Canadian shad landings from 1870 to 1900; catches peaked at million kilograms (two to sixmillion pounds) per year. Three other species have been eliminated from the river: the striped bass, the Atlantic sturgeon, and the Atlantic tomcod. However, a project of the Petitcodiac Riverkeeper, funded by the Government of Canada's Environmental Damage Fund in 2005, noted that {{the removal of the}} causeway would result in a [...] "good" [...] chance of bringing back the eliminated species, and an [...] "excellent" [...] chance of increasing the numbers of species deemed to have been reduced in numbers. No data has been released for the Atlantic salmon or the striped bass.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> is {{considered}} to be a long-term brooder. In general, <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> glochidia may be released between March and June, with peak release times varying from south to north. Michaelson and Neves (1995) documented the reproductive cycle of the <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> from North Carolina and observed that this species spawns in late summer, becomes gravid in September, and releases glochidia in April. Wicklow (in New Hampshire Wildlife Action Plan 2005) observed glochidia release beginning in March and continuing through June in the Ashuelot River in New Hampshire. In a study of <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> reproduction in the Mill River, Massachusetts, McLain and Ross (2005) observed that most glochidia were released in April and May.|$|E
50|$|Reproductive output {{appears to}} be {{correlated}} with local population abundance. McLain and Ross (2005) documented that sites with the highest abundance of adult <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussels</b> also demonstrated the highest proportion of gravid females, glochidial density, host infection, and density of juvenile mussels.|$|R
40|$|<b>Dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussels</b> {{generally}} live in {{creek and}} river bottoms where sand is {{a component of}} the substrate (e. g., muddy sand, sand, sand and gravel bottoms), the current is slow to moderate, and there is little silt deposition (USFWS 1993). This species is discontinuously distributed in the Atlantic coast drainages from Maine to North Carolina (NatureServe 2010) ...|$|R
25|$|The New Jersey Public Interest Research Group (NJPIRG) has {{ranked the}} Paulins Kill as the seventh in a {{collection}} of rivers and creeks in a Top 30 listing of New Jersey waterways to Save The Paulins Kill is home {{to a wide variety of}} amphibians, including the spotted salamander, red-spotted newt, American toad, Fowler's toad, American bullfrog and others. In 2000, a public sewer and water project in Branchville, New Jersey, was suspended out of concern for <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussels</b> (Alasmidonta heterodon), an endangered species, and restarted in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Wedgemussel</b> {{is one of}} 24 {{freshwater}} mussel from North America that has two lateral teeth on the right valve and only {{one on the left}} side. The <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> is a small mussel, whose shell size rarely exceeds 45 mm in length and 25 mm high. The trapezoidal-shaped shells are colored brown or yellowish-olive, with reddish brown or greenish rays in young or pale specimens. The nacre is bluish or silvery white, and is iridescent on the posterior.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel,</b> {{scientific}} name Alasmidonta heterodon, is {{an endangered species}} of freshwater mussel, an aquatic bivalve mollusk in the family Unionidae, the river mussels.|$|E
50|$|Agricultural run-off {{has been}} {{identified}} as a significant threat to <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> populations in Massachusetts, Maryland, and North Carolina. In 2001, more than 25 dwarf wedgemussels and hundreds of other mussels (including state-listed species) were killed in the Mill River, Massachusetts, by waste run-off from a small farm.|$|E
50|$|Little {{riverine}} habitat {{adjacent to}} extant populations is protected other than by state shoreline protection regulations or local land use regulations. Development of adjacent uplands {{continues to be}} a significant and pervasive threat to southern populations. In summary, it appears that the populations in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland are declining as evidenced by low densities, lack of reproduction, or inability to relocate any <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussels</b> in follow-up surveys. Populations in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut appear to be stable, while the status of populations in the Delaware River watershed affected by the recent floods of 2005 is uncertain at this time.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} species of {{anadromous}} and catadromous fish, including brook trout, winter flounder, blueback herring, alewife, rainbow trout, large brown trout, American shad (Alosa sapidissima), hickory shad, smallmouth bass, Atlantic sturgeon, striped bass (Morone saxatilis), carp, catfish, American eel, sea lamprey, and endangered shortnose sturgeon and <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussels.</b> Additionally, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has repopulated the river with another species of migratory fish, the Atlantic salmon, which for more than 200 years had been extinct from the river due to damming. Several fish ladders and fish elevators have been built to allow fish to resume their natural migration upriver each spring.|$|R
50|$|Its {{reproductive}} {{cycle is}} typical of other freshwater mussels, requiring a host fish on which its larvae (glochidia) parasitize and metamorphose into juvenile mussels. The <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> is not a long-lived species as compared to other freshwater mussels; life expectancy is estimated at 10 to 12 years (Michaelson and Neves 1995).|$|E
50|$|Recently, severe {{flooding}} in the Baltimore and Neversink Rivers in Pennsylvania and New York, respectively, {{resulted in the}} destruction of occupied habitat and loss of dwarf wedgemussels. Surveys conducted at two sites on the Neversink River below a dam in Cuddebackville, New York, derived abundance estimates ranging from 60 to 500 dwarf wedgemussels per site (Cole et al. 2004) prior to 2005. Severe {{flooding in}} the spring of 2005 scoured the river channel and deposited cobble in {{at least one of the}} sites previously surveyed. Resurveys in 2005 of the two sites conducted after the flood event detected one fresh dead <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> and no live mussels (Cole and White 2006). Surveys in 2006 indicated that the <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> population in the Neversink River was adversely affected by flood events, although some live mussels were detected.|$|E
50|$|Strayer et al. (1996) {{speculated that}} many <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> populations, {{particularly}} in the southern portion of the range, may be threatened by low densities, small ranges. and linear structure (i.e., an entire population in one stream with no possibility of refuge from catastrophes or stochastic events). Low-density populations {{may lead to a}} loss of productivity due to reproductive impediments (e.g., the distance between mussels being too great) or loss of genetic variability. The Mill River in Hatfield and Whately, Massachusetts {{is an example of a}} river with a <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> population patchily distributed over an approximate 16-mile stretch. The most reproductively robust patch is limited to a small stretch (< 1 mile) making it extremely vulnerable to a catastrophic event. The remainder dwarf wedgemussels are sparsely scattered and may demonstrate a reduced capability to reproduce as indicated by McLain and Ross (2005).|$|E
50|$|The Neversink River {{contains}} {{a large population}} of sea mussels and the richest diversity of freshwater mussels in the upper Delaware River Basin. However, {{one of the seven}} species of mussels found in the Neversink River, the <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel,</b> is on the federal list of endangered species. This situation was not being aided by the mussels being collected by the abandoned Cuddebackville Dam. The collection of mussel species near the dam was resulting in the Neversink River’s mussel population being primarily concentrated in one area, instead being well distributed throughout the river. Before the removal of the dam, not one <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> could be found beyond the dam. This was making the mussels highly susceptible to extinction. A catastrophic flood, oil spill, chemical spill, or epidemic could have resulted in local extinction of the mussel populations in the Neversink River. The threat that the dam posed on the mussel life, particularly the Dwarf Wedge Mussel was one of the primary reasons for its removal.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} fish species have been {{positively}} identified as hosts for the <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel.</b> Michaelson and Neves (1995) confirmed the tessellated darter (Etheostoma olmstedi), Johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum), and mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi) as host fish for dwarf wedgemussels {{in the southern part}} of its range. Wicklow (in New Hampshire Wildlife Action Plan 2005) confirmed the slimy sculpin (. congatus) and juvenile and parr of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) as host fish for dwarf wedgemussels in New Hampshire.|$|E
50|$|The {{aquatic life}} in the Atlantic Northeast is quite {{extensive}} but the more common animals that {{are found in the}} area tend to be American eel (Anguilla rostrata), Appalachian Monkeyface (Pearlymussel) (Quadrula sparsa), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), Diamond darter (Crystallaria cincotta), <b>Dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> (Alasmidonta heterodon), Horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus), Kenk's amphipod (Stygobromus kenki), Lee County cave isopod (Lirceus usdagalun), Madison cave isopod (Antrolana lira), Maryland darter (Etheostoma Sellare), Northern red-bellied cooter (Pseudemys rubriventris), Purple bean (Villosa perpurpurea), Roanoke logperch (Percina rex).|$|E
50|$|The mainstem of the Connecticut River in New Hampshire and Vermont is {{considered}} to have the largest remaining <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> population, consisting of three distinct stretches of sporadically occupied habitat segmented by hydroelectric dams. It is estimated that {{there are hundreds of}} thousands of dwarf wedgemussels scattered within an approximate 75-mile stretch of the Connecticut River. The Ashuelot River in New Hampshire, the Farmington River in Connecticut, and the Neversink River in New York harbor large populations, but these number in the thousands only. The remaining populations from New Jersey south to North Carolina are estimated at a few individuals to a few hundred individuals.|$|E
50|$|At one time, {{this species}} was {{recorded}} from 70 localities in 15 major drainages ranging from North Carolina to New Brunswick, Canada. Since the species was first listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1990 (55 FR 9447 9451), {{a number of}} new locations have been discovered and a number of known locations are possibly no longer extant. Based on preliminary information, the <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> is currently found in 15 major drainages, comprising approximately 70 “sites” (one site may have multiple occurrences). At least 45 of these sites are based on less than five individuals or solely on spent shells. The only known occurrence in New Brunswick, Canada (Petticodiac River) appears to be historic; no live mussels or spent shells were found during a 1997 survey (Hanson 1998).|$|E

50|$|On June 9, 2008, the Clayton Bypass opened, redirecting US 70 onto I-40 between exits 306 to 309 {{and then}} on a new 10.7 mi four-lane freeway bypass south of Clayton. Planning for the bypass began in 1991, but {{construction}} did not start until 2005 because of several delays regarding the <b>Dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel,</b> an endangered species, habitat in the area. Originally scheduled for completion in June 2009, a severe drought in 2007-2008 allowed construction to proceed more rapidly than anticipated. NCDOT was given the approval by AASHTO to officially designate US 70 along the bypass on May6, 2008, with the former alignment becoming an extension of US70Bus. Compared to the former alignment through Clayton, the bypass is estimated to cut fifteen minutes of travel time for drivers traveling between Raleigh and eastern North Carolina. In 2010 US 70 was placed on a new 3.81 mi four-lane expressway east of Statesville; the former alignment was downgraded to a secondary road.|$|E

40|$|Our {{testimony}} {{addresses the}} question of whether natural gas exploratory wells have the potential for a substantial effect on the quality of waters classified by the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC or “Commission”) as Special Protection Waters (SPW), for which the Commission has established a policy of “no measurable change except towards natural conditions [...] ” DRBC Water Quality Regulations § 3. 10. 3 A. 2. We focus on the water quality value and susceptibility to impairment of freshwater mussel populations, which both depend upon and contribute to the exceptional water quality of the main stem upper and middle Delaware River. We also highlight characteristics of the <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel,</b> a federally listed endangered species found in portions of the main stem upper Delaware River and its tributaries underlain by the Marcellus shale. The <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> is particularly susceptible to siltation, hydrologic changes, exposure to contaminants, and losses of population caused by invasive species, all of which are likely to accompany the development of natural gas in the region, including the construction of exploratory wells. We contend that in light of the potential for adverse effects on water quality and aquatic resources as a result of natural gas exploratory well development, regulation by the Delaware River Basin Commission is warranted.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} a multiplex habitat model for flow management criteria development compliant with the natural flow paradigm using the Upper Delaware River (NY/PA—USA) as an example. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify strategies to protect and support the recovery of the <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> populations in the mainstem Delaware River. We quantified potential habitat, developed instreamflow recovery scenarios and modelled the scenario outcomes. Mesohabitat simulation model and River 2 D have been used to allow the transfer of suitability criteria between scales. Habitat time series were investigated with the help of the uniform continuous under threshold technique to establish natural habitat stressor thresholds. Exceedance of persistent and catastrophic durations results in habitat stress days (HSD). HSD served as a metric for the comparison of four flow and two habitat management scenarios. The greatest habitat improvements were accomplished through increasing the boundary Reynolds number, hence increasing the river bed diversity. The introduction of naturalized flows into the model did not cause any significant reduction of HSD, demonstrating that optimizing suitable habitat for <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> may not be achieved without including morphological improvements. Both minimum and pulsed flow augmentation strategies were found to nullify rare stress days in our models. Our study found that, at a minimum, a pulsed flow regime would need to be created to promote the development of populations beyond the current mussel beds. To accomplish protection and enhancement of habitat fully, channel improvements that reduce boundary Reynolds number appear necessary. These recommendations are intended to create a starting point in the adaptive flow management process for the Upper Delaware River. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Construction of the Petitcodiac River Causeway in 1968 {{converted}} 21 km of macrotidal (tidal amplitude 3 ̆e 8 m) brackish-water estuary into {{a shallow}} impoundment. The ecological {{value of the}} freshwater impoundment was low, when judged by criteria of temporal stability, uniqueness, conservation of native species, and level of disturbance. By interfering with migrations, the causeway dam eliminated or greatly reduced the populations of most diadromous fishes, including a large population of the now-endangered Inner Bay of Fundy stock of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Loss of the host fish for the parasitic glochidial stage resulted in extirpation of the <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> (Alasmidonta heterodon) from Canada. Benthic and planktonic communities of the impoundment were depauperate, and typical of a disturbed ecosystem.

40|$|Habitat {{identification}} {{is an important}} step in the conservation of at-risk species, but difficult due to the small, fragmented populations of rare species. In particular, fine-scale habitat features that constrain species occurrence may not be captured by landscape models. Thus, I used both modeling and field-based approaches to identify habitat characteristics for the endangered <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel,</b> Alasmidonta heterodon. Community analyses and modeling were combined to identify characteristics of suitable habitat for A. heterodon in the Maryland Coastal Plain. Community analyses suggested that landscape, rather than biological, surrogates would be preferable for predictive habitat modeling. Subsequent MaxEnt modeling associated A. heterodon habitat in the Maryland Coastal Plain with the following variables: depth to the water table, pasture/hay land cover, woody wetlands, low intensity development, Tertiary-aged sediments, and minimum elevation.

40|$|The {{remaining}} {{populations of}} the endangered <b>dwarf</b> <b>wedgemussel</b> (DWM) (Alasmidonta heterodon) in the upper Delaware River, northeastern USA, were hypothesized to be located in areas of greater-than-normal groundwater discharge to the river. We combined physical (seepage meters, monitoring wells and piezometers), thermal (fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing, infrared, vertical bed-temperature profiling), and geophysical (electromagnetic-induction) methods at several spatial scales to characterize known DWM habitat and explore this hypothesis. Numerous springs were observed using visible and infrared imaging along the river banks at all three known DWM-populated areas, but not in adjacent areas where DWM were absent. Vertical and lateral groundwater gradients were toward the river along all three DWM-populated reaches, with median upward gradients 3 to 9 times larger than in adjacent reaches. Point-scale seepage-meter measurements indicated that upward seepage across the riverbed was faster and more consistently upward at DWM-populated areas. Discrete and areally distributed riverbed-temperature measurements indicated numerous cold areas of groundwater discharge during warm summer months; all were within areas populated by DWM. Electromagnetic-induction measurements, which may indicate riverbed geology, showed patterning but little correlation between bulk streambed electromagnetic conductivity and areal distribution of DWM. In spite of complexity introduced by hyporheic exchange, multiple lines of research provide strong evidence that DWM are located within or directly downstream of areas of substantial focused groundwater discharge to the river.

Paired air-water temperature sensors placed in A. heterodon reaches suggested a potential thermal threshold of 29 °C. Southern sites had higher maximum water temperatures but exhibited less diurnal variation and lower rates of temperature change than northern sites; characteristics that suggest intermediate to deep groundwater sources. Physical and chemical characteristics were measured along the length of Flat Brook, a stream with A. heterodon in the Delaware River basin. Data indicated that the mussel occurred in reaches that were stable during bankfull and lower discharges and water chemistry data indicated saturation with respect to aragonite during summer base flow. Field studies suggest several potential essential habitats for A. heterodon : (1) habitats with stable streambeds at bankfull and lower discharges; (2) stream waters in equilibrium with aragonite precipitation during baseflow conditions; and (3) habitats with maximum temperatures < 29 °C and stable thermal regimes. The different thermal regimes and contributing groundwater sources between northern and southern populations suggest that geographic region be a consideration in species' reintroductions.
