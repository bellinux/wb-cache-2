5|$|After enrolling him, Smith signed Burdell {{up for all}} {{the same}} classes he had. Smith would do all {{schoolwork}} twice, changing it slightly to avoid professors catching his sham.

By 1930, the school had awarded Burdell a bachelor's degree, {{and a few years}} later awarded the fictitious student a master's degree.

5|$|Despite {{reclaiming}} the Drivers' Championship lead at {{the preceding}} Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton {{said that he}} was not relieved because of the closeness of the race.

Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the championship was out of their reach, although he hoped further reliability problems with the Mercedes cars would prolong the battle. Horner ruled out team orders favouring one driver over the other. Rosberg said he was looking forward to the race, and his car's speed gave him hope for a good result.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player.

5|$|Each {{candidate}} {{aimed to}} discredit the other by pointing out his opponent's flaws or mistakes. Republicans called attention to Murphy's failure {{to pay taxes on}} a start-up computer software company he had founded in the 1990s, drawing comparison to three high-profile Obama administration nominees who failed to pay all of their taxes. Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed to vote in the 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, then Florida lawyer Jack Thompson, who had {{previously}} campaigned against other games from Rockstar, stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> measures to prevent the sale of Grand Theft Auto IV to minors. On 14 March 2007, Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive {{filed a lawsuit against}} Thompson in an attempt to preemptively restrict him from his attempts to declare Rockstar's games as a nuisance. Games declared to be a nuisance are effectively banned for sale, which Take-Two believed would be a violation of First Amendment rights. Thompson responded by filing a countersuit, accusing Take-Two of violating federal RICO statues, committing perjury, obstruction of justice, and conspiring against him with third parties to deprive him of his civil rights.|$|E
