40|$|Transcription of the {{majority}} of the ribosomal protein (rp) genes in yeast is activated through common cis-acting elements, designated RPG-boxes. These elements have been shown to act as specific binding sites for the protein factor TUF/RAP 1 /GRF 1 in vitro. Two such elements occur in the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> separating the divergently transcribed genes encoding L 46 and S 24. To investigate whether the two RPG-boxes mediate transcription activation of both the L 46 and S 24 gene, two experimental strategies were followed: cloning of the respective genes on multicopy vectors and construction of fusion genes. Cloning of the L 46 + S 24 gene including the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> in a multicopy yeast vector indicated that both genes are transcriptionally active. Using constructs in which only the S 24 or the L 46 gene is present, with or without the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region,</b> we obtained evidence that the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> is indispensable for transcription activation of either gene. To demarcate the element(s) responsible for this activation, fusions of the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> in either orientation to the galK reporter gene were made. Northern analysis of the levels of hybrid mRNA demonstrated that the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> can serve as an heterologous promoter when it is in the 'S 24 -orientation'. Surprisingly, however, when fused in the reverse orientation the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> did hardly confer transcription activity on the fusion gene. Furthermore, a 274 bp FnuDII-FnuDII fragment from the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> that contains the RPG-boxes, could replace the naturally occurring upstream activation site (UASrpg) of the L 25 rp-gene only when inserted in the 'S 24 -orientation'. Removal of 15 bp from the FnuDII fragment appeared to be sufficient to obtain transcription activation in the 'L 46 orientation' as well. Analysis of a construct in which the RPG-boxes were selectively deleted from the promoter region of the L 46 gene indicated that the RPG-boxes are needed for efficient transcriptional activation of the L 46 gene. We conclude that all promoter elements for the S 24 gene are located within the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region,</b> where the RPG-boxes are the most likely UAS-elements. However, the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> (including the RPG-boxes) is required but not sufficient to confer transcription activity on the L 46 gene...|$|R

40|$|Proteus mirabilis, a {{cause of}} catheter-associated urinary tract infection, relies on several {{virulence}} factors to colonize the urinary tract. Among these, urease contributes {{to the development of}} urinary stones resulting from the increase in local pH due to urease-mediated hydrolysis of urea to NH 3 and CO 2. UreR, an AraC-like transcriptional activator, activates transcription of the genes encoding the urease subunits and accessory proteins (ureDABCEFG) in the presence of urea. UreR also initiates transcription of its own gene in a urea-inducible manner by binding to the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> between ureR and ureD. The <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> contains poly(A) tracts that appear to be the target of H-NS. It has been shown that Escherichia coli and P. mirabilis H-NS acts to repress transcription of ureR in an E. coli model system. It was hypothesized that H-NS represses urease gene expression in the absence of UreR and urea by binding to the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region.</b> To demonstrate this the P. mirabilis hns gene was cloned and the 15 ? 6 kDa H-NS was overexpressed and purified as amyc-His tail fusion. Using a gel shift assay, purified H-NS-myc-His bound preferentially to a 609 bp DNA fragment containing the entire ureR-ureD <b>intergenic</b> <b>region.</b> H-NS and UreR were able to displace each other from the ureR-ureD <b>intergenic</b> <b>region.</b> Circular permutation analysis revealed that the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> is bent. Moreover, H-NS recognizes this curvature, binds the DNA fragment and induces further bending of the DNA as shown by a circular ligation assay. The effects of H-NS, urea and temperature (25 vs 37 6 C) on urease expression were shown in E. coli containing an hns knockout and P. mirabilis where expression was increased at 37 6 C. Increased transcription from pureR was seen in the E. coli hns knockout when temperature was increased from 25 to 37 6 C. These findings suggest H-NS and UreR differentially regulate urease in a negative and positive manner, respectively...|$|R

The entire 1, 221 -bp region was studied in 118 isolates, and 111 other isolates were sequenced for oxyR, ahpC, or the 105 -bp oxyR-ahpC <b>intergenic</b> <b>region.</b> The sample included isoniazid (INH) -susceptible and -resistant organisms in which the katG gene and inhA locus had previously been sequenced in their entirety to identify polymorphisms. A total of 16 polymorphic sites was identified, including 5 located in oxyR, 2 in ahpC, and 9 in the 105 -bp <b>intergenic</b> <b>region.</b> All polymorphic sites located in the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region,</b> and the two missense substitutions identified in ahpC, occurred in INH-resistant organisms. In contrast, there was no preferential association of polymorphisms in oxyR, a pseudogene, with INH-resistant organisms. Surprisingly, most INH-resistant strains with KatG codon 315 substitutions that substantially reduce catalase-peroxidase activity and confer high MICs of INH lacked alterations in the ahpC gene or oxyR-ahpC intervening region. Taken together, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that some polymorphisms located in the ahpC-oxyR <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> are selected for after reduction in catalase or peroxidase activity attributable to katG alterations arising with INH therapy. These mutations are uncommon in recently recovered clinically significant organisms, and hence, there is no strict association with INH-resistant patient isolates. The ahpC compensatory mutations are apparently uncommon because strains with a KatG null phenotype are relatively rare among epidemiologically independent INH-resistant organisms...|$|R

One of the early developmental genes, dia 1, is adjacent to a vegetative gene, impA, on chromosome 4. An <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> of 654 bp separates the coding regions of these divergently transcribed genes. Constructs carrying the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> expressed a reporter gene (green fluorescent protein gene) that replaced impA in growing cells and a reporter gene that replaced dia 1 (DsRed) during development. Deletion of a 112 -bp region proximal to the transcriptional start site of impA resulted in complete lack of expression of both reporter genes during growth or development. At {{the other end of}} the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> there are two copies of a motif that is also found in the carA regulatory region.

This DNA binding activity is lost within the first 4 h of development. Different nuclear proteins were found to recognize the repeated sequence proximal to dia 1.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to design a PCR-generated DNA probe and determine the specificity of the probe for the identification of clinical isolates of Streptococcus sanguinis. To do this, we examined over 200 arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) amplicon patterns obtained with DNA from clinical isolates of S. sanguinis. A 1. 6 -kb DNA amplicon that was common to all AP-PCR profiles was extracted from agarose gels and then cloned and sequenced. A search for a similar sequence in the GenBank database with the BLASTN program revealed that the 1. 6 -kb DNA fragment comprised an <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> between two housekeeping genes, uncC (proton-translocating ATPase) and murA (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase). Three digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes were synthesized on the basis of the sequence of the 1. 6 -kb fragment: the sequence of probe SSA- 1 contained the proton-translocating ATPase (uncC) and the entire <b>intergenic</b> <b>region,</b> the sequence of probe SSA- 2 contained only the <b>intergenic</b> <b>region,</b> and the sequence of probe SSA- 3 contained an internal region of the murA gene.

The commonest mutation in the oxyR-ahpC <b>intergenic</b> <b>region,</b> ahpC − 46 A, was present in 23. 7 % of isoniazid-resistant isolates and 7. 5 % of susceptible isolates.
