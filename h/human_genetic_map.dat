Compared to the <b>human</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>map,</b> broad-scale recombination rates tend to be conserved, but with exceptions, particularly in regions of chromosomal rearrangements and around the site of ancestral fusion in human chromosome 2. At fine scales, chimpanzee recombination is dominated by hotspots, which show no overlap with those of humans even though rates are similarly elevated around CpG islands and decreased within genes. The hotspot-specifying protein PRDM 9 shows extensive variation among Western chimpanzees, {{and there is little}} evidence that any sequence motifs are enriched in hotspots. The contrasting locations of hotspots provide a natural experiment, which demonstrates the impact of recombination on base composition.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of DNA polymorphisms characterized in humans will soon allow the construction of fine genetic maps of human chromosomes. This advance calls for a reexamination of current methodologies for linkage analysis by the family method. We have investigated the relative efficiency of two-point and three-point linkage tests {{for the detection of}} linkage and the estimation of recombination in a variety of situations. This led us to develop the computer program LINKAGE to perform multilocus linkage analysis. The investigation also enables us to propose a method of location scores for the efficient detection of linkage between a disease locus, or a new genetic marker, and a linkage group previously established from a reference panel of families. The method is illustrated by an application to simulated pedigree data in a situation akin to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. These results show that considerable economy and efficiency can be brought to the mapping endeavor by resorting to appropriate strategies of detecting linkage and by constructing the <b>human</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> on a common reference panel of families...|$|E
40|$|Although {{a number}} of human genes that cause disease have been traced through the {{defective}} product, most genetic defects are recognized only by phenotype. When the biochemical defect is unknown, a gene can be located only through molecular approaches based on coinheritance (genetic linkage) of the disease phenotype with a particular allele of a polymorphic DNA marker {{that has already been}} mapped to a specific chromosomal region. Linkage studies in affected families have already localized genes for several important diseases, including cystic fibrosis. Finding a genetic linkage in families in which a disease segregates requires that the <b>human</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> have a large number of polymorphic markers; when the map is dense enough, any disease gene can be located by linkage to a known marker.

40|$|A {{combination}} of technical advances (most notably heterologous cell fusion, high resolution G-banding, and molecular cloning) {{has contributed to}} an accelerated advance in genetic analysis in mammals. The present <b>human</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> contains over 400 gene assignments and the map is growing rapidly as each new molecular clone or immunological reagent is developed. In our laboratory, we have developed a panel of rodent X human somatic cell hybrids that have been utilized in chromosome assignment of several classes of genes including oncogenes (ras, raf) and endogenous human retroviral sequences (ERVL, 2, etc). Using similar techniques, a biochemical genetic map of the domestic cat has been derived. The cat has 19 chromosome pairs and, to date, 40 genes have been mapped to 16 linkage or syntenic groups. Comparison of linkage relationships between homologous enzymes has revealed a striking conversation of chromosomal linkage association between cat and man. A comparison of syntenically homologous, highly extended high resoultion G-banded chromosomes between the two mammalian families revealed that 20 – 25 %, by length, of the human karyotype can be precisely aligned (chromomere to chromomere) between cats and man despite the evolutionary divergence of the species nearly 80 million years ago. Moderately repetitive families of retrovirus-related DNAs exist within the feline and the human genomes. We have isolated molecular clones of {{several members of the}} feline RD- 114 retrovirus family from a genomic library of normal cat cellular DNA. The endogenous sequences analyzed were similar to each other in that they were colinear with RD- 114 proviral DNA, were bounded by long terminal redundancies, and conserved many restriction sites in the gag and pol regions. Several sequences were apparently deleted, relative to the previously characterized inducible RD- 114 genome. The env regions of a number of endogenous RD- 114 sequences examined were substantially deleted or diverged; a subset of these sequences contained information at the position of the env region that was not homologous to inducible RD- 114.

40|$|We {{have seen}} in the last lecture the problem of <b>genetic</b> <b>mapping</b> which is to find the order of genes on the {{chromosome}} (not their exact location). In this lecture, we review the problem and look at more advanced techniques for locating genes in the genome. <b>Genetic</b> <b>Mapping</b> Specific genes, or specific gene mutations, are frequently the cause of diseases. In order to help us identify when a disease is associated with the presence of a particular gene, it is useful to have a map of the genome. <b>Genetic</b> <b>mapping</b> is the process of determining the relative location of genes in a particular genome. By mapping the relative location of several genes, we can develop a map of the entire genome of a particular species e. g. <b>humans.</b> <b>Genetic</b> <b>mapping</b> relies on externally observable genetic traits, or phenotypes, of a particular genome. By selectively breeding specific phenotypes together and examining the phenotypes of several generations of children, we can determine the frequency of the occurrence of particular phenotypes. After a large number of observations, we have a reasonable approximation of the probability of the occurrence of those particular phenotypes. Based on these probabilities, we can get an estimate of the distance between specific genes. As an example, let’s take a genome that has n genes on a single chromosome and that recombination occurs randomly at only one point on the chromosome.

40|$|Innovative medical {{technology}} {{has made it}} possible to test whether you are at increased risk for certain types of cancer. The mere processing of a vial of blood can reveal whether you have a genetic predisposition to develop breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer, or other life-threatening conditions. The Human Genome Project, an international endeavor seeking to map our genetic structures, has facilitated this increasing ability to test for genetic flaws. It is expected that as the <b>human</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>map</b> is filled in, and as flaws in our fundamental building blocks are identified, there will be a concomitant drive to test for these genetic differences outside of the research setting. Indeed, genetic tests already are being commercially marketed, particularly for genetic flaws linked to breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. This marketing is occurring despite a dearth of guidance regarding the meaning of these tests, the situations in which they should be offered, the nature or availability of potential treatment, and the type of consent that should be obtained prior to their administration. This Article seeks to establish the contours of informed consent in this new arena of genetic testing for life-threatening conditions by setting forth the basic elements of what must be discussed with a patient to ensure that her consent to testing is, indeed, informed. Specifically, this Article proposes a set of basic statutory requirements for pre-test genetic counseling and suggests that these requirements can be adapted, in significant part, from the essential principles of HIV- related counseling. These basic elements are shaped, in part, by lessons learned from a critical assessment of current informed consent legal doctrine and by precautions to guard against the significant pressures posed by managed care reimbursement programs. This proposed regimen of genetic counseling represents a conscious approach to ensuring that each time a person consents to or refuses such testing, the decision is one that is voluntary and informed. Part I of the Article begins with a discussion of how blood tests generally are conducted and describes the presently available technology to detect flaws in genetic characteristics and reports on predictions of advancements in this area. It continues with an exploration {{of the ways in which}} genetic testing for life-threatening conditions is different from other kinds of blood testing. Part II contains both a review of the existing legal doctrine of informed consent, based in constitutional theory, statutes, and common law, and a critique of this doctrine based on pragmatic applications of these laws and on critical legal theories. Part III examines the development of statutory pre-test counseling in the context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and assesses its strengths, weaknesses, and relevance to genetic pre-test counseling. Part IV presents a model for genetic pre-test counseling that is drawn from the HJV/AIDS statutory format, the critique of current informed consent doctrine, and a review of existing genetic testing statutes. The Article concludes with a recommendation to adopt the model statute introduced in Part IV to remedy the identified weaknesses in existing informed consent doctrine, particularly its failure to incorporate disclosure and discussion of social risks attendant to genetic testing...|$|E

These new <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> open new avenues for disease gene research, including large-scale genotyping for both simple and complex disease loci. However, the allele patterns of many dinucleotide repeat loci can be complex and difficult to interpret, with genotyping errors a recognized problem. Furthermore, the possibility of genotyping individuals at hundreds or thousands of polymorphic loci requires improvements in data handling and analysis. The automation of genotyping and analysis of computer-derived haplotypes would remove many of the barriers preventing optimal use of dense and informative dinucleotide <b>genetic</b> <b>maps.</b> Toward this end, we have automated the allele identification, genotyping, phase determinations, and inheritance consistency checks generated by four CA repeats within the 2. 5 -Mbp, 10 -cM X-linked dystrophin gene, using fluorescein-labeled multiplexed PCR products analyzed on automated sequencers. The described algorithms can deconvolute and resolve closely spaced alleles, despite interfering stutter noise; set phase in females; propagate the phase through the family; and identify recombination events. We show the implementation of these algorithms for the completely automated interpretation of allele data and risk assessment for five Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy families.

40|$|We {{present the}} use of our {{recently}} described multiple-loci polymorphic DNA markers ("alumorphs") for linkage mapping of the human genome. By using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with an Alu-specific primer we could reveal, in a single experiment, up to 20 genomic polymorphisms seen as {{the presence or absence}} of amplified DNA fragments originating from genomic segments flanked by Alu repeats. Using this approach we examined genomic DNA samples from two families with a history of pseudovitamin D-deficiency rickets (PDDR), an autosomal recessive disorder. An indication of linkage with the PDDR phenotype was found for one of the polymorphic bands, denoted 30 A. A significant linkage [logarithm-of-odds (lod) score greater than 3. 0] was obtained between this polymorphism and a number of chromosome 12 q markers tightly linked to PDDR. The 30 A band specifically hybridized to DNA digests from hybrid cell lines carrying a human chromosome 12, thus independently assigning the 30 A marker to this chromosome.

40|$|Because of the {{availability}} of efficient, user-friendly computer analysis programs, the construction of multilocus <b>human</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> has become commonplace. At the level of resolution at which most of these maps have been developed, the methods have proved to be robust. This may not be true in the construction of high-resolution linkage maps (3 -cM interlocus resolution or less). High-resolution meiotic maps, by definition, have a low probability of recombination occurring in an interval. As such, even low frequencies of errors in typing (1. 5 % or less) may influence mapping outcomes. To investigate the influence of aberrant observations on high-resolution maps, a Monte Carlo simulation analysis of multipoint linkage data was performed. Introduction of error was observed to reduce power to discriminate orders, dramatically inflate map length, and provide significant support for incorrect over correct orders. These results appear to be due to the misclassification of nonrecombinant gametes as multiple recombinants. Chi 2 -Like goodness-of-fit analysis appears to be quite sensitive to the appearance of misclassified gametes, providing a simple test for aberrant data sets. Multiple pairwise likelihood analysis appears to be less sensitive than does multipoint analysis and may serve as a check for map validity...|$|R

We have examined—for the first time, to our knowledge—racial/ethnic differences in <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> of <b>humans.</b> We constructed <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> based on 353 microsatellite markers in four racial/ethnic groups: whites, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and East Asians (Chinese and Japanese). These maps were generated using 9, 291 subjects from 2, 900 nuclear families who participated in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–funded Family Blood Pressure Program, the largest sample used for map construction to date. Although the maps for the different groups are generally similar, we did find regional and genomewide differences across ethnic groups, including a longer genomewide map for African Americans than for other populations. Some of this variation was explained by genotyping artifacts—namely, null alleles (i. e., alleles with null phenotypes) at a number of loci—and by ethnic differences in null-allele frequencies. In particular, null alleles appear to be the likely explanation for the excess map length in African Americans. We also found that nonrandom missing data biases map results. However, we found regions on chromosome 8 p and telomeric segments with significant ethnic differences and a suggestive interval on chromosome 12 q that were not due to genotype artifacts. The difference on chromosome 8 p is likely due to a polymorphic inversion in the region.

Initially, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, in combination with rare-cutting restriction enzymes, was used to try and establish physical linkage of 11 polymorphic and non-polymorphic DNA markers. This approach resulted {{in the construction of}} three long-range restriction maps around groups of physically linked Xq 22 markers that spanned over 5. 0 Mb of DNA. Yeast artificial chromosome clones were used to organize the three long-range maps onto a contiguous 5. 2 -Mb stretch of Xq 22. The order of markers in this region was shown to be cen-GLA-DXS 178 -DXS 101 -DXS 83 -DXS 24 -DXS 101 -DXS 54 -PLP-DXS 94 -DXS 147 -DXS 17 -DXS 87 -tel. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the proximal part of Xq 22 may be rich in genes. Construction of a physical map for this region will, therefore, facilitate the localization and subsequent isolation of novel genes...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} network {{properties of}} genetic covariance between average cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) within genetically-identified cortical parcellations that we previously derived from <b>human</b> cortical <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> using vertex-wise fuzzy clustering analysis with high spatial resolution. There were 24 hierarchical parcellations based on vertex-wise CT and 24 based on vertex-wise SA expansion/contraction; {{in both cases}} the 12 parcellations per hemisphere were largely symmetrical. We utilized three techniques—biometrical genetic modeling, cluster analysis, and graph theory—to examine genetic relationships and network properties within and between the 48 parcellation measures. Biometrical modeling indicated significant shared genetic covariance between size of several of the genetic parcellations. Cluster analysis suggested small distinct groupings of genetic covariance; networks highlighted several significant negative and positive genetic correlations between bilateral parcellations. Graph theoretical analysis suggested that small world, but not rich club, network properties may characterize the genetic relationships between these regional size measures. These findings suggest that cortical genetic parcellations exhibit short characteristic path lengths across a broad network of connections. This property may be protective against network failure. In contrast, previous research with structural data has observed strong rich club properties with tightly interconnected hub networks. Future studies of these genetic networks might provide powerful phenotypes for genetic studies of normal and pathological brain development, aging, and function...|$|R
40|$|Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterized by hypopigmentation or oculocutaneous albinism and severe immunologic deficiency with neutropenia {{and lack of}} natural killer (NK) cell function. Most patients die in childhood from pyogenic infections or an unusual lymphoma-like condition. A hallmark of the disorder is giant inclusion bodies seen in all granule-containing cells, including granulocytes, lymphocytes, melanocytes, mast cells, and neurons. Similar ultrastructural abnormalities occur in the beige mouse, which thus has been suggested to be homologous to <b>human</b> CHS. High-resolution <b>genetic</b> <b>mapping</b> has indicated that the bg gene region of mouse chromosome 13 is likely homologous to the distal portion of human chromosome 1 q. Accordingly, we carried out homozygosity mapping using markers derived from distal human chromosome 1 q in four inbred families or probands with CHS. Our {{results indicate that the}} human CHS gene maps to an 18. 8 -cM interval in chromosome segment 1 q 42 -q 44 and that human CHS therefore is very likely homologous to mouse bg...|$|R
40|$|The spontaneously {{hypertensive}} rat and the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat {{are useful}} models for human hypertension. In these strains hypertension is a polygenic trait, {{in which both}} autosomal and sex-linked genes can influence blood pressure. Linkage studies in crosses between the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat and the normotensive control strain Wistar-Kyoto {{have led to the}} localization of two genes, BP/SP- 1 and BP/SP- 2, that contribute significantly to blood pressure variation in the F 2 population. BP/SP- 1 and BP/SP- 2 were assigned to rat chromosomes 10 and X, respectively. Comparison of the <b>human</b> and rat <b>genetic</b> <b>maps</b> indicates that BP/SP- 1 could reside on human chromosome 17 q in a region that also contains the angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene (ACE). This encodes a key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system, and is therefore a candidate gene in primary hypertension. A rat microsatellite marker of ACE was mapped to rat chromosome 10 within the region containing BP/SP- 1...|$|R
40|$|Within the <b>human</b> genome, <b>genetic</b> <b>mapping</b> {{studies have}} {{identified}} 10 regions of different chromosomes, known as DYX loci, in genetic linkage with dyslexia, and two, known as SLI loci, in genetic linkage with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). Further genetic studies have identified four dyslexia genes within the DYX loci: DYX 1 C 1 on 15 q, KIAA 0319 and DCDC 2 on 6 p 22, and ROBO 1 on 13 q. FOXP 2 on 7 q has {{been implicated in}} the development of Speech-Language Disorder. No genes for Specific Language Impairment have yet been identified within the two SLI loci. Functional studies have shown that all four dyslexia genes play roles in brain development, and ongoing molecular studies are attempting to elucidate how these genes exert their effects at a subcellular level. Taken together, these genes and loci likely represent {{only a fraction of the}} human lexinome, a term we introduce here to refer to the collection of all the genetic and protein elements involved {{in the development of}} human language, expression, and reading. Learning outcomes: The reader will become familiar with (i) methods for identifying genes for complex diseases, (ii) the application of these methods in the elucidation of genes underlying disorders of language and reading, and (iii) the cellular pathways through which polymorphisms in these genes may contribute to the development of the disorders...|$|R
5000|$|Because whole genome {{sequencing}} of individuals is still cost prohibitive, the international HapMap Project was constructed {{with a goal}} to map the human genome to haplotype groupings (haplotype blocks) that can describe common patterns of <b>human</b> <b>genetic</b> variation. By <b>mapping</b> the entire genome to haplotypes, tag SNPs can be identified to represent the haplotype blocks examined by genetic studies. An important factor to consider when planning a genetic study is the frequency and risk incurred by specific alleles. These factors can vary in different populations so the HapMap project {{used a variety of}} sequencing techniques to discover and catalog SNPs from different sets of populations. Initially he project sequenced individuals from Yoruba population of African origin (YRI), residents of Utah with western European ancestry (CEU), unrelated individuals from Tokyo, Japan (JPT) and unrelated Han Chinese individuals from Beijing, China (CHB). Recently their datasets have been expanded to include other populations (11 groups) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{methodology}} which jointly infers haplotypes and the causal alleles at a gene influencing a given trait. Often in <b>human</b> <b>genetic</b> studies, {{the available data}} consists of genotypes (series of genetic markers along the chromosomes) and a phenotype. However, for many genetic analyses, one needs haplotypes instead of genotypes. Our methodology is not only able to estimate haplotypes conditionally on the disease status, but is also able to infer the alleles at the unknown disease locus. Some applications of our methodology are in <b>genetic</b> <b>mapping</b> and in <b>genetic</b> counselling...|$|R
40|$|Compelling {{evidence}} for the inherited nature of essential hypertension has led to extensive research in rats and humans. Rats have served as the primary model for research on the genetics of hypertension resulting in identification of genomic regions that are causally associated with hypertension. In more recent times, genome-wide studies in humans have also begun to improve {{our understanding of the}} inheritance of polygenic forms of hypertension. Based on the chronological progression of research into the genetics of hypertension as the "structural backbone," this review catalogs and discusses the rat and <b>human</b> <b>genetic</b> elements <b>mapped</b> and implicated in blood pressure regulation. Furthermore, the knowledge gained from these genetic studies that provide evidence to suggest that much of the genetic influence on hypertension residing within noncoding elements of our DNA and operating through pervasive epistasis or gene-gene interactions is highlighted. Lastly, perspectives on current thinking that the more complex "triad" of the genome, epigenome, and the microbiome operating to influence the inheritance of hypertension, is documented. Overall, the collective knowledge gained from rats and humans is disappointing in the sense that major hypertension-causing genes as targets for clinical management of essential hypertension may not be a clinical reality. On the other hand, the realization that the polygenic nature of hypertension prevents any single locus from being a relevant clinical target for all humans directs future studies on the genetics of hypertension towards an individualized genomic approach...|$|R
