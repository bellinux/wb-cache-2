5|$|Siwiec' {{funeral in}} Przemyśl was well attended, {{but did not}} turn into a {{political}} manifestation; it was guarded by police, and secret agents spread rumors aimed at damaging Siwiec's reputation. His family reported that while some acquaintances were supportive and aware of Siwiec's true purpose, many turned away from them, either intimidated by the authorities or believing the stories that Siwiec had been <b>drunk</b> <b>or</b> mentally ill.|$|E
5|$|In some stories, kitsune have {{difficulty}} hiding their tails {{when they take}} human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets <b>drunk</b> <b>or</b> careless, is a common method of discerning the creature's true nature. A particularly devout individual may in some cases {{even be able to}} see through a fox's disguise merely by perceiving them. Kitsune may also be exposed while in human form by their fear and hatred of dogs, and some become so rattled by their presence that they revert to the form of a fox and flee.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be <b>drunk</b> <b>or</b> drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E

50|$|The film {{involves}} a hazardous health clinic, the archetype villain's secret, console-crowded headquarters, as Agent 000 (Saarelainen) attempts {{to stop the}} masked villain's organisation (a spoof of SPECTRE) from turning the members of Finnish establishment into nudists, <b>drunks</b> <b>or</b> suicide candidates with a mind-control device. The parody content {{of the film is}} similar to that of Casino Royale (1967 film) starring David Niven and Peter Sellers.|$|R
5|$|At {{the age of}} 18 he {{was given}} a {{separate}} establishment, and in dramatic contrast with his prosaic, scandal-free father, threw himself with zest into a life of dissipation and wild extravagance involving heavy drinking and numerous mistresses and escapades. He was a witty conversationalist, <b>drunk</b> <b>or</b> sober, and showed good, but grossly expensive, taste in decorating his palace. The Prince of Wales turned 21 in 1783, and obtained a grant of £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) from Parliament and an annual income of £50,000 (equivalent to £ today) from his father. It was far too little for his needs – the stables alone cost £31,000 a year. He then established his residence in Carlton House, where he lived a profligate life. Animosity developed between the prince and his father, who desired more frugal behaviour {{on the part of the}} heir apparent. The King, a political conservative, was also alienated by the prince's adherence to Charles James Fox and other radically inclined politicians.|$|E

25|$|Newspapers, {{including}} The New York Times, covered numerous {{cases of}} police brutality during {{the latter part of}} the 19th century. Cases often involved officers using clubs to beat suspects and persons who were <b>drunk</b> <b>or</b> rowdy, posed a challenge to officers' authority, or refused to move along down the street. Most cases {{of police brutality}} occurred in poor immigrant neighborhoods, including Five Points, the Lower East Side, and Tenderloin.|$|E

Huts were built and food served to care for the miners encamped on Bull Hill and throughout the region.|$|E
25|$|Many mythologies ascribe {{homosexuality}} and gender variance in humans {{to the action}} of gods or other supernatural interventions. This include myths in which gods teach people about same-sex sexual practices by example, as in Aztec or Hawaiian mythology or myths that explain the cause for transgenderism or homosexuality, such as the story in which Prometheus accidentally creates some people with the wrong genitalia while <b>drunk,</b> <b>or</b> instances of reincarnation or possession by a spirit of the opposite gender in Voodoo.|$|E
25|$|The {{main cause}} of death among {{adolescents}} {{as a result of}} binge drinking is road traffic accidents; a third of all fatal road traffic accidents among 15- to 20-year-olds are associated with drinking alcohol. Cyclists and pedestrians are likely to have less spatial awareness and concentration while travelling after binge drinking and, also, it is more common that adolescents that binge-drink drive <b>drunk</b> <b>or</b> are the passenger of a drunk driver. It has been found that 50 percent of all head injuries in adolescents in the USA are associated with alcohol consumption. Violence and suicide combine to become the third-most-common cause of death associated with binge drinking among adolescents. The suicide risk in adolescents is more than 4 times higher among binge drinkers than non-binge drinking adolescents.|$|E

25|$|In 1836, the Indian {{village of}} Yaanga was {{relocated}} near the future corner of Commercial and Alameda Streets. In 1845, it was relocated again to present-day Boyle Heights. With {{the coming of}} the Americans, disease took a great toll among Indians. Between 1848 and 1880, the total population of Los Angeles went from 75,050 to 12,500. Self-employed Indians were not allowed to sleep over in the city. They faced increasing competition for jobs as more Mexicans moved into the area and took over the labor force. Those who loitered or were <b>drunk</b> <b>or</b> unemployed were arrested and auctioned off as laborers to those who paid their fines. They were often paid for work with liquor, which only increased their problems.|$|E
25|$|With Dumouriez absent, the French {{only had}} 6,000 troops under René Joseph Lanoue to defend Maubeuge. There were 4,000 {{soldiers}} led by Jacques Henri Moreton Chabrillant spread between Bruille-Saint-Amand, Saint-Amand-les-Eaux and Orchies {{as well as}} 4,000–5,000 men in the Camp of Maulde. Duke Albert of Saxe-Teschen decided to divert French strength away from Brunswick's invasion by launching attacks on the enemies before him. Saxe-Teschen counted 51 infantry battalions and 40 cavalry squadrons of which 14 battalions were in garrisons. On 3 September Anton Sztáray threatened Philippeville while Johann Peter Beaulieu menaced Quiévrain. When Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour advanced from Tournai toward Lille on 5 September, Moreton abandoned the Camp of Maulde and fell back behind the Scarpe River. Latour pursued and pounced on the French at Mortagne-du-Nord, routing them. The defeated soldiers tried to lynch Moreton {{but he managed to}} talk them out of it. Moreton later complained that many of his troops were uncontrollable and became <b>drunk</b> <b>or</b> looted houses in Saint-Amand. Radical journalist Louis-Marie Prudhomme accused Moreton of either incompetence or treason.|$|E

25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was <b>drunk</b> <b>or</b> asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man {{from the top of the}} steps that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from those}} within his circle, Heseltine drew {{inspiration}} from other composers whose work he respected: Franz Liszt, Gabriel Fauré, and Claude Debussy. He had, however, a particular dislike for the works of his fellow song-writer Hugo Wolf. Heseltine's songs demonstrate moods of both darkness and warm good humour, a dichotomy that helped to fuel {{the idea of a}} split Warlock/Heseltine personality. This theory was rejected by the composer's friends and associates, who tended to see the division in terms of [...] "Philip <b>drunk</b> <b>or</b> Philip sober".|$|E

500|$|A {{woman who}} lost four {{family members in}} the {{incident}} said, [...] "We don't know why this foreign soldier came and killed our innocent family members. Either he was <b>drunk</b> <b>or</b> he enjoyed killing civilians." [...] Abdul Samad, a 60-year-old farmer who lost eleven family members, eight of whom were children, spoke about the incident: [...] "I don't know why they killed them. Our government told us {{to come back to}} the village, and then they let the Americans kill us."

40|$|When {{stereotypes}} of modern Native Americans are brought forward, these usually manifest themselves in visions of poor Indians living on reservations, which are on lands {{no one else}} wanted. Modern Native Americans are often stereotyped as <b>drunks</b> <b>or</b> succumbing to the pressure of gamblers to open their reservations to casinos. One place to start in order to disprove these stereotypes is the statistical data.
