5|$|Kesselring {{resumed his}} work on {{a history of the}} war that he was writing for the US Army's <b>Historical</b> <b>Division.</b> This effort, working under the {{direction}} of Generaloberst Franz Halder in 1946, brought together a number of German generals for the purpose of producing historical studies of the war, including Gotthard Heinrici, Heinz Guderian, Lothar Rendulic, Hasso von Manteuffel and Georg von Küchler. Kesselring contributed studies of the war in Italy and North Africa and the problems faced by the German high command. Kesselring also worked secretly on his memoirs. The manuscript was smuggled out by Irmgard Horn-Kesselring, Rainer's mother, who typed it at her home.|$|E
5|$|Within the Quichean sub-branch K'iche' (Quiché), the Mayan {{language}} {{with the largest}} number of speakers, is spoken by around 1,000,000 K'iche' Maya in the Guatemalan highlands, around the towns of Chichicastenango and Quetzaltenango and in the Cuchumatán mountains, as well as by urban emigrants in Guatemala City. The famous Maya mythological document, Popol Vuh, is written in an antiquated K'iche' often called Classical K'iche' (or Quiché). The K'iche' culture was at its pinnacle {{at the time of the}} Spanish conquest. Q'umarkaj, near the present-day city of Santa Cruz del Quiché, was its economic and ceremonial center. Achi is spoken by 85,000 people in Cubulco and Rabinal, two municipios of Baja Verapaz. In some classifications, e.g. the one by Campbell, Achi is counted as a form of K'iche'. However, owing to a <b>historical</b> <b>division</b> between the two ethnic groups, the Achi Maya do not regard themselves as K'iche'. The Kaqchikel language is spoken by about 400,000 people in an area stretching from Guatemala City westward to the northern shore of Lake Atitlán. Tz'utujil has about 90,000 speakers in the vicinity of Lake Atitlán. Other members of the K'ichean branch are Sakapultek, spoken by about 15,000 people mostly in El Quiché department, and Sipakapense, which is spoken by 8,000 people in Sipacapa, San Marcos.|$|E
5|$|The Allies' {{failure to}} secure a bridge over the Lower Rhine spelled the end of Market Garden. While all other {{objectives}} had been achieved, the failure to secure the Arnhem road bridge over the Rhine meant that the operation failed in its ultimate objective. Field Marshal Montgomery claimed that the operation was 90% successful and the Allies did possess a deep salient into German occupied territory that was quickly reinforced. Milton Shulman observed that the operation had driven a wedge into the German positions, isolating the 15th Army north of Antwerp from the First Parachute Army {{on the eastern side}} of the bulge. This complicated the supply problem of the 15th Army and removed the chance of the Germans being able to assemble enough troops for a serious counterattack to retake Antwerp. Chester Wilmot agreed with this, claiming that the salient was of immense tactical value for the purpose of driving the Germans from the area south of the Maas and removing the threat of an immediate counterattack against Antwerp. Kershaw views the situation differently, observing that the north flank of the west wall was not turned and the 15th Army was able to escape. Dr. John Warren of the American <b>Historical</b> <b>Division</b> of the United States Air Force believed that the Allies now controlled a salient leading nowhere. John Waddy is of the belief that the strategic and tactical debate of Market Garden will never be resolved.|$|E

25|$|Hinduism {{as it is}} {{commonly}} known can be subdivided {{into a number of}} major currents. Of the <b>historical</b> <b>division</b> into six darsanas (philosophies), two schools, Vedanta and Yoga, are currently the most prominent. Classified by primary deity or deities, four major Hinduism modern currents are Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva), Shaktism (Devi) and Smartism (five deities treated as same). Hinduism also accepts numerous divine beings, with many Hindus considering the deities to be aspects or manifestations of a single impersonal absolute or ultimate reality or God, while some Hindus maintain that a specific deity represents the supreme and various deities are lower manifestations of this supreme. Other notable characteristics include a belief in existence of ātman (soul, self), reincarnation of one's ātman, and karma as well as a belief in dharma (duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and right way of living).|$|E

2500|$|Throughout its history, {{the library}} was moved not only physically, but also administratively. In 1833, for example, a Bureau of Pardons and Remissions and of Copyrights was created and charged with various duties {{including}} the [...] "arrangement and preservation of books, maps, and other documents and of keeping an accurate catalog." [...] In 1834 the bureau was abolished and its library functions were transferred to the Office of the Translator and Librarian {{and then to the}} Home Bureau in 1836. Throughout most of the nineteenth century, {{the library was}} administratively located in the Bureau of Rolls and Library, which managed the library, books, documents, orders, laws, and treaties. In 1872, a Division of Indexes and Archives was created to distribute, file and index the Department's correspondence, open the mail, preserve the archives, and retrieve requested papers. An Act of 1874 placed the library administratively {{side by side with the}} Department's Archives under the Chief of the Bureau of Rolls and Library. In the 1920s, the library became a branch of the <b>Historical</b> <b>Division,</b> and in 1948 it gained independent status as a Division in the Office of Libraries and Intelligence-Acquisition. In 1973, the library became one of the divisions in the Foreign Affairs Document and Research Center, which brought the library and document activities back together.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to England, he {{was head}} of the history {{department}} at Kelly College in Tavistock for five years, followed by fourteen years at Culham College of Education as principal lecturer and head of the history department. He was able to combine his love of cricket with his college duties by instituting the biannual cricket matches between the History Department and his village cricket team of North Moreton for whom he was wicketkeeper and captain. One regularly told story was that he conducted an interview out on the cricket square when one potential teaching student applied who was already on the books of Yorkshire Cricket Club! Unfortunately for Howat, the student did not take up the place which was presumably offered to him, but did go on to have a reasonably successful cricket career. He had an abrupt tutoring technique and once (at least) locked the door when the time of his tutor group was due to start which left only one student in the room (at the magnificent mansion of Nuneham) to enjoy his didactic and engaging teaching style. Meanwhile, he undertook a research degree on [...] "the place of history in education" [...] for Exeter College, Oxford.
