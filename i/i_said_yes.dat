25|$|Indie {{asked me}} if I would keep the Barely Legal Radio program on Indie but stop doing mornings. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> I loved doing the morning show for 2½ years but I am also looking forward to not getting up at 4 am any more. If you've ever had a morning job like this, you {{probably}} know the relief I feel, but I will still miss seeing Liz and Jose every day, having David Lynch as my weatherman, and talking to Timothy Olyphant about sports each morning. These will always rank with the coolest things I’ve ever been fortunate enough to do in my entire life.|$|E
500|$|Former Major League Baseball player Wes Parker almost {{literally}} {{walked into}} his role. He was doing play-by-play reporting for a Los Angeles television station owned by Lear's partner, Jerry Perenchio. [...] "Lear casually asked if I'd {{be interested in the}} part. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> but knew it was out of the question, because in real life things don't happen that way. Nobody walks in and gets on a Norman Lear show. I read for the part, got it and didn't sleep at all that night." [...] Linda Gray was somewhat non-plussed upon being offered the role of transgender Linda Murkland. [...] "I remember meeting Norman and him saying, 'You'll be perfect for the role.' I didn't know whether to take that as a compliment or what." [...] To prepare for her role, Linda Gray asked Lear to arrange for her to meet with a transgender woman. Gray met with her for several hours prior to the beginning of filming and on a couple of occasions during production. Lois Nettleton reportedly based her characterization of Christina Stockwood on Clark Gable. Production started in early March 1977 with director Herbert Kenwith.|$|E
2500|$|Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin said, [...] "What {{attracted}} me to [...] {{had nothing}} to do with Facebook. The invention itself is as modern as it gets, but the story is as old as storytelling; the themes of friendship, loyalty, jealousy, class and power. [...] I got a 14-page book proposal that Ben Mezrich had written for his publisher for a book he was going to call The Accidental Billionaires. The publisher was simultaneously shopping it around for a film sale. That's how it wound up in my hands. I was reading it and somewhere on page three <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> It was the fastest <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> to anything. But Ben hadn't written the book yet, and I assumed that Sony was going to want me to wait for Ben to write the book, and I would start a year from now. They wanted me to start right away. Ben and I were kind of doing our research at the same time, sort of along parallel lines." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Titmarsh," [...] said Lady Fanny, {{laughing}} to me, [...] "who is {{that great}} fat curious man, {{the master of}} the house? Do you know he asked me if you were not related to us? and <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Oh, <b>yes,</b> you were.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she did. <b>I</b> only <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> but he {{was going}} to be a clergyman, and when she heard his age, she said he was not the one she had known; I did not speak of cousin Henry because you said we were not to mention him. What was it, if I may know, mamma?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "When {{they asked}} me to do it a second time, I said, 'Certainly,' and {{everybody}} thought I was out of my mind," [...] Burr told Tom Shales of The Washington Post. [...] "But it wasn't the large sum of money. It was the fact that, first of all, I kind of liked 'Godzilla,' and where do you get the opportunity to play yourself 30 years later? So <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> to both of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Hodgman, {{who plays}} {{opposite}} Justin Long in one sketch, {{signed on with}} {{no knowledge of the}} project. Long, Hodgman's co-star in the long-running series of Apple's commercials, asked him what the project was, and he then signed on, without still knowing too much. Hodgman said, [...] "I got an e-mail from Justin that said, 'I'm going to be dressing up as Robin again. Do you want to dress up as the Penguin?' And <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> Without even realizing cameras would be involved, or {{that it would be a}} movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee's {{first film}} for Hammer was The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), {{in which he}} played Frankenstein's monster, with Peter Cushing as Baron Victor Frankenstein. It was the first film to co-star Lee and Cushing, who {{ultimately}} appeared together in over twenty films and became close friends. When he arrived at a casting session for the film, [...] "they asked me if I wanted the part, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> and that was that". A little later, Lee co-starred with Boris Karloff in the film Corridors of Blood (1958), but Lee's own appearance as Frankenstein's monster led to his first appearance as the Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula in the film Dracula (1958, known as Horror of Dracula in the United States). A critically acclaimed film that saw Lee fix {{the image of the}} fanged vampire in popular culture, Dracula has been ranked among the best British films. Lee accepted a similar role in an Italian-French horror picture called Uncle Was a Vampire (1959).|$|E
6000|$|... "You ask me {{rather a}} hard question," [...] she said. [...] "A {{few months ago}} I think that <b>I</b> should have <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> To-day--I am not sure. What has happened? Is {{anything}} wrong with him?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{hesitated a}} moment; {{and then the}} thought, that I might never see her again, came over me, and <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Oh, <b>yes!</b> thanks.' That was the last earthly word of love between us. But, thank God, those who love worthily never meet for the last time: {{there is always a}} future.|$|R
6000|$|An Apparition! Madam, <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> <b>yes,</b> to be sure; why you know, you {{are nothing}} else but an Apparition; {{and what else}} would you be, when it is so {{infinitely}} to your Advantage? ...|$|R
2500|$|In May 2004, the Washington Post {{reported}} evidence given by Ameen Saeed Al-Sheik, detainee No. 151362. It quoted him as saying; [...] "They said {{we will make}} you wish to die {{and it will not}} happen [...] They stripped me naked. One of them told me he would rape me. He drew a picture of a woman to my back and made me stand in shameful position holding my buttocks." [...] "'Do you pray to Allah?' one asked. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> They said, ' you. And [...] him.' One of them said, 'You are not getting out of here health, you are getting out of here handicapped. And he said to me, 'Are you married?' I said, 'Yes.' They said, 'If your wife saw you like this, she will be disappointed.' One of them said, 'But if I saw her now she would not be disappointed now because I would rape her.' [...] " [...] "They ordered me to thank Jesus that I'm alive." [...] "I said to him, 'I believe in Allah.' So he said, 'But I believe in torture and I will torture you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Tony Blair {{called the}} [...] "Who's Calling Christian?" [...] hotline, after charity campaigner Graham Marsh {{contacted}} Blair. If {{he were to}} win, Marsh, who received a heart transplant in 1999, {{said he planned to}} donate his £10,000 to the two charities he supports - the Freemans Heart and Lung Transplant Association and the Tyne Youth and Community Centre, both in Newcastle upon Tyne. Blair began by telling the programme: [...] "Probably nothing in my career has prepared me for this." [...] When O'Connell asked if he should be referred to as The Right Honourable Tony Blair, the Prime Minister replied: [...] "Refer to me any way you like as long as it's reasonably polite! Tony will do fine... Someone from my constituency phoned me and said 'Why don't we do this?' and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> because they are really, really good causes." [...] The exchange ended with O'Connell asking Blair to choose his favourite song from the 1980s. He chose [...] "Street With No Name" [...] by U2 - actually called [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". Marsh and Blair resoundingly won the contest on 7 November 2006.|$|E

60|$|MABEL CHILTERN. I {{make it a}} rule {{never to}} accept Tommy. That is why he goes on proposing. Of course, as you didn’t turn up this morning, <b>I</b> very nearly <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> It {{would have been an}} {{excellent}} lesson both for him and for you if I had. It would have taught you both better manners.|$|R
5000|$|In 1920, Paul Robeson and Eslanda {{attended}} {{summer school}} at Columbia. They married {{one year later}} in August 1921. Eslanda gave up her intentions to study medicine and supported her husband as his business manager. Indeed, Paul credited her as the catalyst for his acting career, saying [...] "Even then, I never meant to an actor. <b>I</b> just <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> {{to get her to}} quit pestering me." [...] Eslanda worked at the hospital until 1925, when the career of her husband took more and more of her time. She spent time between Harlem, London and France in the following years.|$|R
60|$|It {{certainly}} {{had not occurred}} to me before, but <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>Yes,</b> I should like that.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{was only}} that {{that kept me}} from being {{altogether}} wretched. I think that I was ashamed {{to tell you the}} truth when I had once refused to do as you would have me. I had given you so much trouble all for nothing. I think that if you had asked me on that first day at the ball in London <b>I</b> should have <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> if <b>I</b> had told the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{not angry}} with me for {{cracking}} a few respectable old jokes?" [...] said Zack. [...] "Have <b>I</b> <b>said</b> anything?--Stop! <b>yes,</b> <b>I</b> have, though I didn't mean it. You {{looked up at me}} in that savage manner, when I warned you not to give her a Hair Bracelet. Surely you don't think me brute enough to make fun of your not having any hair on your own head to give anybody? Surely you have a better opinion of me than that? I give you my word of honor, I never thought of you, or your head, or that infernal scalping business, when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> what <b>I</b> did. It was true--it happened to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Upon release, Geyer said “I’ve avoided {{doing this}} album {{for a long}} time {{for the simple reason that}} I’ve already done these songs. <b>I</b> finally <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> ’cause we agreed to do it live at my {{keyboard}} player’s house: just set up like an acoustic gig and play. People tend to like the intimacy of that. It has a certain energy and I think it works.” adding “A lot of these songs were not necessarily that easy to put into an acoustic form, some of them are there because I do them every night and I love them forever, some are on there because they’re important songs in my career. I’m just hoping I did justice to them all.” ...|$|R
60|$|Bun. <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>yes,</b> {{and that}} I was {{to submit to}} the king as supreme, also to the governors, as to them that are sent by him.|$|E

5000|$|To which Yves Michaud replied: [...] "Well, I {{will tell}} you an anecdote. I was... I went to get my hair cut about a month ago. There was a Liberal senator who I will not name who doesn't speak French... even though he {{represents}} a French-speaking riding and who asked me: 'Are you still a separatist, Yves?' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> 'Yes, <b>yes</b> <b>I</b> am separatist just as you are Jewish. It took 2000 years for your people to have its homeland in Israel.' I said: 'Me, whether it takes 10, 50, or 100 more years it can wait.' So he told me: 'It's not the same.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2014, Pierce Brosnan {{stated that}} he had agreed with Avi Lerner to star in an Expendables film, but added {{that he was not}} sure which one he would appear in, saying [...] "I have no idea which one it would be, <b>I</b> just <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> It could be Expendables 7". Stallone {{revealed}} his first choice for the villain was Jack Nicholson. The Expendables 4 might receive an R rating. In December 2016, Stallone announced in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the fourth film will be the last film in the series and is set for a 2018 release date. In March 2017, it was announced Stallone would be leaving the franchise due to disagreements over the script and direction of the franchise.|$|R
5000|$|People {{had told}} me about him Orelsan. I knew that he hosted a roller skating program on the radio, that he was passionate about hip hop and I saw him hanging out in town with his Cambodian {{military}} uniforms. ... He {{came to see me}} and asked me if I wanted to start a group with him, and <b>I</b> immediately <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> We began writing songs without any ambition. We were rapping on the B-sides of The Roots even when I hate The Roots. We composed songs with the sound card of a comp we stole at my UIT. Initially, we wrote for our friends, that's it. And then Orel professionalised his thing. In the meantime, I met a girl and I went back to studying a bit. Gringe ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> except Jone's rheumatism, we felt splendid; for my aches hadn't come on then, and I {{was going}} on to gush about the lovely country she had sent us to, but she didn't {{seem to want to}} listen.|$|E

500|$|During {{the filming}} of Jackson's 1996 film The Frighteners, Universal Pictures was {{impressed}} with Jackson's dailies and early visual effects footage. The studio was adamant to work with Jackson on his next project and, in late 1995, offered him the chance to direct a remake of the 1954 film Creature from the Black Lagoon. He turned down the offer, but Universal became aware of Jackson's obsession with King Kong and subsequently offered {{him the opportunity to}} direct that remake. The studio did not have to worry of lawsuits concerning the film rights from RKO Pictures (the studio behind the 1933 film) because the King Kong character is held in the public domain. Jackson initially turned down the King Kong offer, but he [...] "quickly became disturbed by the fact that someone else would take it over," [...] Jackson continued, [...] "and make it into a terrible film; that haunted me and <b>I</b> eventually <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> to Universal." ...|$|R
5000|$|Another cited {{influence}} {{for this}} piece {{came from the}} field of the visual arts. Cage's friend and sometimes colleague Robert Rauschenberg had produced, in 1951, a series of white paintings, seemingly [...] "blank" [...] canvases (though painted with white house paint) that in fact change according to varying light conditions in the rooms in which they were hung, the shadows of people in the room and so on. This inspired Cage to use a similar idea, as he later stated, [...] "Actually what pushed me into it was not guts but the example of Robert Rauschenberg. His white paintings ... when I saw those, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Oh <b>yes,</b> <b>I</b> must. Otherwise I'm lagging, otherwise music is lagging'." [...] In an introduction to an article called On Robert Rauschenberg, Artist, and His Works, John Cage writes [...] "To Whom It May Concern: The white paintings came first; my silent piece came later." ...|$|R
