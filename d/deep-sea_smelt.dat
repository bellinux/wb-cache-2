40|$|A {{research}} cruise {{was made}} in the Irminger Sea west and southwest of Iceland and adjacent waters on the Icelandic vessel Árni Friðriksson, from 03 Jun- 04 Jul 2003. The main purpose was to study distribution and abundance of deepwater redfishes, Sebastes mentella et sp., other pelagic fishes, zooplankton, phytoplankton and the hydrography of the area. Part of the cruise was devoted to a special study on community structure at transect over {{the northern part of the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Reykjanes Ridge). In this paper, an overview is given on the composition of the pelagic fish community, both vertically and horizontally, over the northern part of the Reykjanes Ridge. In total, nine trawl hauls were made with a “GLORIA” midwater trawl outfitted with a small mesh size (9 -mm) cod-end. Three hauls were made at three different depths west of the Ridge, three above it and three East of the Ridge. A total of 230 nautical miles separated hauls taken west of the Ridge and east of it. A minimum total of 44 species were identified from 23 families. Lanternfishes (Myctophidae), pearlsides (Sternoptychidae), barracudinas (Paralepididae), dragonfishes (Stomiidae) and <b>deep-sea</b> <b>smelts</b> (Microstomatidae) dominated fish catches. Results show that the total number of fishes caught was lowest east of the Ridge, coinciding with warmer deep waters. At all positions both number of species and families increased with depth as the number of individuals decreased with depth...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Fisheries, 2008 As a {{first step}} towards {{evaluating}} the influence of oceanographic structure on the survival of larval fishes during the fall, winter and spring months off northern California, I examined the distribution of larval fishes, including larval rockfishes (Sebastes) and zooplankton, in relation to hydrographic structure along a transect extending due west of Trinidad Head, California from April 2006 to April 2007. Dominant taxa included the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>smelts</b> (Bathylagidae), northern lampfish (Stenobrachius leucopsarus), righteye flounders (Pleuronectidae), rockfishes (Sebastes), and slipskin snailfish (Liparis fucensis). Cross-shelf ichthyoplankton diversity patterns reflected adult spawning seasons and locations, {{and the distribution of}} coastal and offshore species agreed with ichthyoplankton assemblages identified in previous studies off California and Oregon. Liparids, some pleuronectids, most cottids, and the osmerids were consistently in the coastal assemblage. Sebastes, bathylagids, and myctophids were consistently in the offshore assemblage. These assemblages were relatively persistent across seasons. Although cross-shelf distributions differed among taxa, hydrographic structure appeared to affect distributions of larval fishes. Larval Sebastes were commonly observed at their greatest densities in the vicinity of fronts, while larvae of inshore taxa, including some flatfish, were rarely encountered offshore of fronts. Cross-shelf advection associated with upwelling conditions appeared to drive a general offshore displacement of larval fishes, while cross-shelf advection associated with downwelling caused a nearshore displacement of larvae. Hydrographic structure appeared to affect distributions of potential zooplankton prey throughout the winter and spring, and ichthyoplankton and zooplankton distributions were correlated in April 2007. These results suggest that fronts and related structures might affect larval survival and recruitment success in fishes for which the early life history stages exist in the plankton during the winter and spring, when coastal upwelling is at a seasonal minimum...|$|R
40|$|Trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) {{is common}} to most marine fishes; however, the role TMAO plays in the {{physiology}} of marine fish is not well understood. I have used two distinct TMAO accumulating fish 'types', <b>deep-sea</b> fish and <b>smelt</b> (Osmerus mordax), to compare differences in the levels, intertissue distribution and capacity for synthesis of TMAO in fish with high {{and low levels of}} TMAO. Several consistencies were found. The intertissue distribution of TMAO showed a trend of locomotory muscle > heart > liverliver ≅ kidney ≅ brain. Levels of trimethylamine oxidase, the enzyme required for TMAO synthesis, did not correlate with higher tissue TMAO content indicating that enhanced endogenous synthetic capacity is not responsible for elevated TMAO content. Finally, evidence for the active uptake of TMAO into striated muscle and the regulation of TMAO concentration in white muscle is presented, possibly due to some role TMAO plays in muscle function...|$|R

40|$|The <b>deep-sea</b> <b>smelt</b> Bathylagus euryops, {{caught in}} July 2004 at the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ) of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (North Atlantic), was studied for {{metazoan}} parasites and diet composition. A total of 86 specimens with standard lengths between 6. 4 and 22. 1 cm (mean 13. 6 cm) were examined. The parasite fauna consisted of five species: three Digenea, one Cestoda and one Nematoda. The predominant parasites were Lecithaster sp. (Digenea) and an unidentified bothriocephalidean cestode. The only nematode, Anisakis sp., occurred {{with a low}} prevalence. Bathylagus euryops at CGFZ serves as final host for the three digeneans, and as intermediate host for the cestodes and Anisakis sp.

40|$|The {{assemblage}} {{structure and}} ecology of meso- and bathypelagic fishes are poorly known in general, particularly over mid-ocean ridges. In June 2004, the month-long MAR-ECO (Census of Marine Life) research expedition aboard the R/V G. O. Sars sampled the deep-pelagic fauna over the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge {{with the objective}} of quantitatively assessing the nekton associated with the ridge from Iceland to the Azores. A total of 115 discrete-depth trawl samples were taken from the surface to depths of 3000 + meters using two different double-warp midwater trawls, one of commercial fishing size (a large ‘Akra 2 ̆ 7 trawl) and one of oceanographic research size (‘Macroplankton 2 ̆ 7 or ‘Krill 2 ̆ 7 trawl). Catch data revealed the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>smelt</b> Bathylagus euryops to be the biomass dominant species, accounting for over 28...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance of larval and postlarval fishes {{was investigated in}} the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean, in March and April 2004. The upper 200 m of the water column were sampled with an 8 m 2 rectangular midwater trawl at 93 stations. The larval species community clustered in a diverse coastal community with high densities of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum larvae and a less diverse offshore community dominated by Antarctic jonasfish Notolepis coatsi and the lanternfish Electrona antarctica. No postlarval fish were caught in coastal areas. The offshore community of postlarval fishes consisted of the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>smelt</b> Bathylagus antarcticus, and the lanternfishes Gymnoscopelus braueri, G. nicholsi and E. antarctica. The latter species clearly dominated, occurring at mean individual and wet mass densities of 0. 17 individuals m – 2 and 0. 26 g m – 2, respectively. A generalized additive model significantly related the density of postlarval E. antarctica to the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, ocean depth and sea surface temperature. The diet of E. antarctica was dominated by copepods and euphausiid larvae. Mean energy density of E. antarctica in the upper 200 m was 2. 8 kJ m – 2, which is equivalent to 36 % of the energy stored in Antarctic krill stocks and probably would be considerably higher if a greater depth range were considered. This suggests that E. antarctica is a major energy transmitter in the food web of the Lazarev Sea, challenging the classical krill-dominated food web paradigm of the Southern Ocean...|$|E
40|$|The mesopelagic {{community}} of fishes and squids are fundamental {{in the diet}} of apex predators, {{but in most cases}} their life histories and habitat requirements are poorly understood. In May 1999, a pilot study was conducted to identify mesopelagic nekton, describe dominant physical characteristics of their habitat, and compare their relative abundances over several study sites in the southeastern Bering Sea. Biological samples were collected at 250, 500, and 1000 m depths with an open pelagic rope trawl lined with 1. 2 -cm mesh in the codend. Net type, mesh size, and trawling techniques were designed to parallel those of extensive Russian research surveys in the western Bering Sea, permitting direct comparisons between study results. Forty-three species of fish and 15 species of cephalopods were identified, including a new species of gonatid squid and a range extension for Paraliparis paucidens, a snailfish never before observed in Alaskan waters. Faunal biomass was high with over 25, 000 (1400 kg) fish and squid collected in only 13 trawls. Concentrations of fish in this area surpass published records from the western Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean by an order of magnitude, driven primarily by Leuroglossus schmidti, a <b>deep-sea</b> <b>smelt.</b> Generally, specimens were of high quality, and new size records were established for several species of fish and squid. The physical environment as determined from altimetry, satellite-tracked drifters, and water properties (temperature and salinity) was typical of the last decade for this area. Spatial patterns in species distribution were observed, but {{further research is needed to}} determine whether these are a factor of mesoscale variability or of habitat characteristics.
