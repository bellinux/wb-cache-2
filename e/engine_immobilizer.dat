5000|$|Consumer Reports has {{expressed}} {{skepticism about the}} proposed bill, noting that its analysis showed the problem affects a [...] "minuscule 0.2 percent of auto-repair customers." [...] Consumer Reports {{also noted that the}} ASA said the NASTF had [...] "mostly filled the information gap." [...] Consumer Reports also argued that releasing [...] "understandably secret details about vehicle security, smart-key codes, and <b>engine</b> <b>immobilizer</b> drives" [...] would be a mistake. The Highway Loss Data Institute also {{wrote in a letter to}} Rep. Bart Stupak an expansion of access to information regarding passive antitheft devices, it [...] "would be naive to expect the security of the information to remain uncompromised." ...|$|E
50|$|In October 1996, the Maximas {{exterior}} was refreshed for 1997, {{with new}} five-spoke alloy wheels, plastic (clear-lens) headlights vs. the previous glass headlights, {{a slightly different}} front and rear fascia with new redesigned tail-lights, the rear-facing part of the trunk was smoothed out to match the tail-lights, re-designed fog-lights and badge designs, and a chrome grille insert for GLEs (body color for SE models) was added. Among interior changes were a different steering wheel and CD player. Front seat-mounted side impact airbags were added as an option for 1998 and 1999 SE and GLE models. There were also structural modifications to improve crash worthiness for the 1997 to 1999 models. The 1999 Nissan Maxima also saw some minor changes: an Anti-Theft <b>Engine</b> <b>Immobilizer</b> was standard using a chip in the ignition key, {{as well as some}} minor body trims.|$|E
50|$|The SmartKey's {{electronics}} {{are embedded}} in a hollow, triangular piece of plastic, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, squared-off at the tip with a half-inch-long insert piece. The side of the SmartKey also hides a traditional Mercedes-Benz key that can be pulled out from a release at top. The metal key is used for valet purposes such as locking the glovebox and/or trunk before the SmartKey is turned over to a parking attendant. Once locked manually, the trunk cannot be opened with the SmartKey or interior buttons. The key fob utilizes a radio-frequency transponder {{to communicate with the}} door locks, but it uses infrared to communicate with the <b>engine</b> <b>immobilizer</b> system. Original SmartKeys had a limited frequency and could have only been used in line-of-sight for safety purposes. The driver can also point the smart key at the front driver side door while pushing and holding the unlock button on the SmartKey and the windows and the sunroof will open in order to ventilate the cabin. Similarly, if the same procedure is completed while holding the lock button, the windows and sunroof will close. In cars equipped with the Active Ventilated Seats, the summer opening feature will activate the seat ventilation in addition to opening the windows and sunroof.|$|E
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} for a beneficial welfare impact of a crime policy that is targeted at strenghtening victim precaution. Regulation made application of the electronic <b>engine</b> <b>immobilizer,</b> a simple and low-cost anti-theft device, mandatory for all new cars sold within the European Union as of 1998. We exploit the regulation as source of exogenous variation in use of the device by year of manufacture of cars. Based on detailed data {{at the level of}} car models, we find that uniform application of the security device reduced the probability of car theft by an estimated 50 percent on average in the Netherlands during 1995 - 2008, accounting for both the protective effect on cars with the device and the displacement effect on cars without the device. The costs per prevented theft equal some 1, 500 Euro; a fraction of the social benefits of a prevented car theft. ...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle {{security}} {{system has been}} a topic of great interest over the years due to the increasing vehicle theft cases reported all over the world. Most of the advanced vehicle {{security system}}s best suit the four wheelers. As of the security system for two wheelers is concerned, the systems available in market are of no match to the well equipped thieves. When under attack, these systems can only immobilize the engine and sound a loud alarm. It is a serious limitation. In this {{paper we propose a}} reliable and robust design of Two Wheeler Vehicle Security System (TWVSS) with features enhancing the security of the vehicle and ensuring the safety of the rider. In our proposed security system various new features are included in addition to the <b>engine</b> <b>immobilizer</b> and alarm. Few of the important features supported by our system are alerting owner by SMS about the theft attempt, allowing user to control the system remotely by SMS, tracking the location of vehicle using GPS technology, Remote Keyless System, servo motor operated locking system (handle lock, fuel lock and rear wheel lock) and side stand indicator. Redundancy is maintained to make the system reliable even in the worst case scenario, but due to cost constraints a tradeoff between cost and redundancy was necessary. Our system is designed to be compatible with almost all the brands of vehicle...|$|E
