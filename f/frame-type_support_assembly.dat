40|$|A {{system for}} {{supporting}} and selectively positioning an ion thruster {{relative to a}} surface of a spacecraft includes three angularly spaced thruster <b>support</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Each thruster <b>support</b> <b>assembly</b> includes a frame which has a rotary actuator mounted thereon. The rotary actuator is connected to an actuator member which is rotatably connected to a thruster attachment member connected to a body of the thruster. A stabilizer member is rotatably mounted to the frame and to the thruster attachment member. The thruster is selectively movable in the pitch and yaw directions responsive to movement of the actuator members by the actuators on the thruster <b>support</b> <b>assemblies.</b> A failure of any one actuator on a thruster <b>support</b> <b>assembly</b> will generally still enable limited thruster positioning capability in two directions. In a retracted position the thruster attachment members are held in nested relation in saddles supported on the frames of the thruster <b>support</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The thruster is securely held in the retracted position during periods of high loading such as during launch of the spacecraft...|$|R

We report on the first successful application of photogrammetric analysis of the ISS imagery for the prompt computation of the jettisoned object s position and velocity vectors. As post-EVA analyses examples, we present the Floating Potential Probe (FPP) and the Russian "Orlan" Space Suit jettisons, {{as well as the}} near-real-time (provided in several hours after the separation) computations of the Video Stanchion <b>Support</b> <b>Assembly</b> Flight <b>Support</b> <b>Assembly</b> (VSSA-FSA) and Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS) jettisons during the US astronauts space-walk. Standard close-range photogrammetry analysis was used during this EVA to analyze two on-board camera image sequences down-linked from the ISS. In this approach the ISS camera orientations were computed from known coordinates of several reference points on the ISS hardware. Then the position of the jettisoned object for each time-frame was computed from its image in each frame of the video-clips. In another, "quick-look" approach used in near-real time, orientation of the cameras was computed from their position (from the ISS CAD model) and operational data (pan and tilt) then location of the jettisoned object was calculated only for several frames of the two synchronized movies.
