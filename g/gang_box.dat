5000|$|Gangbox (also <b>gang</b> <b>box)</b> is a colloquial term {{utilized}} {{in the construction}} industry, referring to a toolbox or workbox that can be accessed by multiple workers. Gangbox is also a term in the electrical industry used to indicate a box, usually metal, which houses installed electrical componentry. [...] A 1-gang box hosts a single component such as a switch or receptacle, a 2-gang box hosts two components side-by-side, and so on.|$|E
5000|$|Choke. This {{style of}} switch takes varying {{physical}} forms. The wall control, which contains a motor speed regulator of some sort, determines {{how much power}} is delivered to the fan and therefore how fast it spins. Older such controls employed a choke—a large iron-cored coil—as their regulator; these controls were typically large, boxy, and surface-mounted on the wall. They had anywhere from four to eight speeds, typically four or five. Newer versions {{of this type of}} control do not use a choke as such, but much smaller capacitors or electronic circuitry; the switch is typically mounted in a standard in-wall <b>gang</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The word gangbox {{may have}} been derived for several reasons. Firstly, [...] "gang" [...] {{can be used to}} refer to the group of tools {{utilized}} for a particular project, thus making the receptacle in which they are stored the [...] "gang box". Secondly, a gang can refer to a group of workmen or tradesmen, hence the name for where their materials or tools are kept is the <b>gang's</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R

50|$|Unfortunately, Bob and Chang are blacklisted {{from the}} bustling San Francisco Chinese {{restaurant}} community by the gang. They accidentally land {{a job at}} a shipyard after narrowly averting being run over by the owner's daughter's car. She tells them to get back to work, assuming they already work there unloading speaker cabinet boxes. The shipyard is attacked by members of the <b>boxing</b> <b>gang</b> that Bob beat up {{in the beginning of the}} film. At first, Bob and Chang refuse to fight to prevent losing their jobs again.

50|$|The story {{comes back}} to the present, where Martin was {{explaining}} his story to the priest. He explained that the gang had searched for Krishnanunni, but they were surprised to see another person with the same name (Indrajith). After some days, each of them from the <b>gang</b> got a <b>box</b> with solar panels on the top. When they opened it, they found the money given as share by Krishnanunni for the heist, later crying in joy. Then it is revealed that the Krishnanunni who helped them in the heist was actually a con-man. Then he was shown working on a new heist disguised as a business man dealing solar panels. The character in the climax scene is well distinguished {{from the rest of the}} movie by the lack of Thrissur Malayalam accent.|$|R
25|$|ValeWatch {{also allowed}} the HAT {{to tackle the}} source of crime in the estate and, in 1998, evicted the ringleaders of the Green <b>Box</b> <b>Gang,</b> which was small, notorious gang {{consisting}} mainly of teenage troublemakers. These were the first evictees from the estate. In Autumn 2000, CVHAT sought the eviction of five families who were accused of persistently breaking their tenancy conditions. This {{was considered to be}} a landmark case as it used a multi-trial approach where all five families could be tried at once, saving the HAT time and money. A further 20 families were given Notices of Seeking Possession during 2000, and the HAT collated evidence and built cases against the families. During this time, some of the families improved their behaviour whilst others left the estate. Those that were taken to court saw cases that involved 112 witness statements, supported by covert surveillance footage in some instances.|$|R
5000|$|Later, Wilkerson {{organised}} an evangelistic {{meeting in}} the neighborhood {{with the intent of}} converting the Mau Maus. When Cruz heard about it, he headed with some of the members of his <b>gang</b> for the <b>boxing</b> arena where the meeting was being held, on a bus sent specially by Wilkerson. According to Cruz, {{when he arrived at the}} arena, he [...] "felt guilty about the things that he had done" [...] and began to pray. After preaching, Wilkerson asked the Mau Maus to take up a collection. Cruz volunteered and led a group of the gang through the crowd, insisting on people giving money. Going backstage, he saw an exit, but convinced the group to give the money to Wilkerson on stage. Later, Wilkerson gave an altar call, and a large number of gang members responded. Wilkerson prayed with Cruz, and Cruz asked God to forgive him.|$|R
500|$|In 2012, Parker {{appeared}} as a World War II squadron commander in Red Tails, a film portraying Tuskegee Airmen. Parker's character drinks {{to cope with the}} stress of the fighter pilot lifestyle. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post praised then-unknown actors Parker and David Oyelowo. In the movie, Parker plays Marty [...] "Easy" [...] Julian who commanded the escorts for the World War II bombers in the face of Nazi fighter planes. While Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted that Parker shined in his role, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe felt Oyelowo stood out. Although the story is a fictionalization, Bilge Ebiri of New York and Holden note that {{the relationship between the two}} is the story's central one. Holden compared Parker's presence to that of Denzel Washington. In Arbitrage, Parker's talents were underutilized as the son of a chauffeur who gets caught in a murder coverup, according to David Denby of The New Yorker. Nonetheless, Ty Burr of The Boston Globe notes that Parker's portrayal of the Harlem native is the only sympathetic character of the film. Travers notes the role provides Richard Gere's elitist character with his only interactions with a diverse character in the film. Parker's third and final film of 2012 was in Spike Lee's Red Hook Summer. Parker played a <b>gang</b> member named <b>Box,</b> whose role was not central to the film progression according to Phillips, although convincingly menacing according to Smith.|$|R
