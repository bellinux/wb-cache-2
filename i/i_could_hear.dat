However, before walking out onto the pitch Johanneson {{suffered}} racial abuse: “When we walked out, all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> was a cacophony of Zulu-like noises coming from the terraces. It was dreadful, I could barely hear myself think for those screams. I wanted to run back down the tunnel." ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{of those}} Hope met in Morris' band were also {{interested}} in jazz. One, saxophonist Johnny Griffin, recalled a group of musicians, including Hope, who practiced and learned together in New York {{in the days of}} late-1940s bebop: [...] "We'd go to Monk's house in Harlem or to Elmo's house in the Bronx, we just did a lot of playing. I played piano a bit, too, so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> what they were all doing harmonically. But if something stumped me, I'd ask and Elmo would spell out harmonies. We'd play Dizzy 's tunes or Charlie Parker's." ...|$|E

They recalled the ground fire beginning with a mortar round landing among the refugee families, followed by what Levine called a [...] "frenzy" [...] of small-arms fire. Some battalion veterans recalled front-line company officers ordering them to open fire. [...] "It was assumed there were enemy in these people," [...] said ex-rifleman Herman Patterson. [...] "They were dying down there. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the people screaming," [...] recalled Thomas H. Hacha of the sister 1st Battalion, observing nearby.

500|$|McAdams took a {{break from}} her film career from 2006 to 2007.

[...] "Truthfully, I never really wanted to be a big movie star. I never even wanted to work outside of Canada, or outside of the theatre."

500|$|Celine Dion {{performed}} the song {{as part of}} her A New Day... concert at Caesars Palace.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that the decision to include [...] "Nature Boy" [...] in A New Day Has Come was inspired by the song's appearance in Baz Luhrmann's musical, Moulin Rouge!

With Billboard, Dion expressed her feelings while recording the track: [...] "This is the one I had the most kick out of in the studio. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the pedal of the piano and the touch of the keys while I was singing. We were following each other, this is the real thing. This was such my pleasure." [...] Initially strings and other instrumentation were added in post-production, but were later removed to maintain the simplicity of Cole's version.|$|E
500|$|Elisabeth's {{body was}} placed in a silver casket, a gift from Nicholas II, for the journey back to Darmstadt.

The Hessian people came out by the thousands to view the funeral procession and [...] "sobbed in unison so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> it," [...] Ernst wrote. A cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II, expressed shock at the child's death in a letter to Tsar Nicholas II on 7 November 1903. [...] "How joyous and merry she was that day at Wolfsgarten, when I was there, so full of life and fun and health ... What a terrible heartrending blow for poor Ernie, who doted and adored that little enchantress!" [...] Elisabeth was buried in the Rosenhöhe {{with other members of the}} Hessian grand ducal family.
