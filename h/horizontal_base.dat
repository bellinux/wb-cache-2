25|$|A Halin graph is a {{planar graph}} formed from a planar-embedded tree (with no degree-two vertices) by {{connecting}} {{the leaves of}} the tree into a cycle. Every Halin graph can be realized by a polyhedron in which this cycle forms a <b>horizontal</b> <b>base</b> face, every other face lies directly above the base face (as in the polyhedra realized through lifting), and every face has the same slope. Equivalently, the straight skeleton of the base face is combinatorially equivalent to the tree from which the Halin graph was formed. The proof of this result uses induction: any rooted tree may reduced to a smaller tree by removing the leaves from an internal node whose children are all leaves, the Halin graph formed from the smaller tree has a realization by the induction hypothesis, and it is possible to modify this realization in order to add any number of leaf children to the tree node whose children were removed.|$|E
60|$|A {{species may}} {{be defined as a}} group of objects whose {{individual}} differences are wholly due to different combinations of the same set of minute causes, no one of which is so powerful as to be able by itself to make any sensible difference in the result. A well-known mathematical consequence flows from this, which is also universally observed as a fact, namely, that in all species the number of individuals who differ from the average value, up to any given amount, is much greater than the number who differ more than that amount, and up to the double of it. In short, if an assorted series be represented by upright lines arranged side by side along a <b>horizontal</b> <b>base</b> at equal distances apart, and of lengths proportionate to the magnitude of the quality in the corresponding objects, then their shape will always resemble that shown in Fig. 1.|$|E

60|$|For {{this simple}} reason, that, while in {{architecture}} you are continually {{called upon to}} do what may be unnecessary {{for the sake of}} beauty, you are never called upon to do what is inconvenient for the sake of beauty. You want the level window sill to lean upon, or to allow the window to open on a balcony: the eye and the common sense of the beholder require this necessity to be met before any laws of beauty are thought of. And besides this, there is in the sill no necessity for the pointed arch as a bearing form; on the contrary, it would give an idea of weak support for the sides of the window, and therefore is at once rejected. Only I beg of you particularly to observe that the level sill, although useful, and therefore admitted, does not therefore become beautiful; the eye does not like it so well as the top of the window, nor does the sculptor like to attract the eye to it; his richest moldings, traceries, and sculptures are all reserved for the top of the window; they are sparingly granted to its <b>horizontal</b> <b>base.</b> And farther, observe, that when neither the convenience of the sill, nor the support of the structure, are any more of moment, as in small windows and traceries, you instantly have the point given {{to the bottom of the}} window. Do you recollect the west window of your own Dunblane Abbey? If you look in any common guide-book, you will find it pointed out as peculiarly beautiful,--it is acknowledged to be beautiful by the most careless observer. And why beautiful? Look at it (fig. 7). Simply because in its great contours it has the form of a forest leaf, and because in its decoration it has used nothing but forest leaves. The sharp and expressive molding which surrounds it is a very interesting example of one used to an enormous extent by the builders of the early English Gothic, usually in the form seen in fig. 2, Plate II., composed of clusters of four sharp leaves each, originally produced by sculpturing the sides of a four-sided pyramid, and afterwards brought more or less into a true image of leaves, but deriving all its beauty from the botanical form. In the present instance only two leaves are set in each cluster; and the architect has been determined that the naturalism should be perfect. For he was no common man who designed that cathedral of Dunblane. I know not anything so perfect in its simplicity, and so beautiful, as far as it reaches, in all the Gothic with which I am acquainted. And just in proportion to his power of mind, that man was content to work under Nature's teaching; and instead of putting a merely formal dogtooth, as everybody else did at the time, he went down to the woody bank of the sweet river beneath the rocks on which he was building, and he took up a few of the fallen leaves that lay by it, and he set them in his arch, side by side, forever. And, look--that he might show you he had done this,--he has made them all of different sizes, just as they lay; and that you might not by any chance miss noticing the variety, he has put a great broad one at the top, and then a little one turned the wrong way, next to it, so that you must be blind indeed if you do not understand his meaning. And the healthy change and playfulness of this just does in the stone-work what it does on the tree boughs, and is a perpetual refreshment and invigoration; so that, however long you gaze at this simple ornament--and none can be simpler, a village mason could carve it all round the window in a few hours--you are never weary of it, it seems always new.|$|E

This hypothesis was tested with three adult dairy bulls using an operant conditioning technique. The bulls had to discriminate a solid white line from broken white lines with decreasing interspaces. They solved this task better when the stimuli were presented vertically rather than horizontally. This result is discussed in terms of visual acuity and related to the topographical anatomy of the eye, particularly the pupil...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Detecting {{tampered}} {{image is}} a challenging work due to the high volume of image database and the accurate definition of tampering. We propose a novel algorithm based on standard deviation which could detect the tampered automatically, furthermore, localization and extraction process is conducted to optimize the proposed method. Color reduction technique, intensity based method for edge detection and <b>horizontal</b> <b>based</b> localization approach are applied here to fulfill the algorithm. The core idea of the paper is that normally tampered regions process high standard deviation while compared with non-tampered areas. As the result, the output of our algorithm are tampered regions. By presenting promising experience, the performance of proposed method is analyzed. Further application and possible optimization are discussed...|$|R
