One particular T206 Honus Wagner owned by John Cobb and Ray Edwards has attracted media controversy over its authenticity, with many leading hobby experts regarding it as a fake.|$|E
5|$|The National Alliance and Resistance Records {{released}} a similar game, White Law, in June 2003. It starred an Irish-American police officer taking up arms {{to protect his}} territory from racial minorities. It {{has been compared to}} Freedom Fighters, though it was based on the events of Pierce's novel The Turner Diaries. The National Alliance intended to create an entire line of racist games, but no more <b>have</b> <b>surfaced.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1814, Ferdinand VII {{refused to}} renew the Spanish Constitution of 1812, {{returning}} the Empire to an absolutist method of government. Consequently, Ramírez contacted some of his allies in Philadelphia and commissioned the production of banknotes in denominations of 3 and 5 reales. The issues were printed by Murray, Draper, Fairman & Company and featured the signatures of treasurer José Bacener and Ramírez. The designs featured the Spanish Crown and Ferdinand VII's profile in the two varieties and were numbered manually. No official documentation, letter or decree from the Spanish Crown related {{to the creation of}} these notes <b>have</b> <b>surfaced.</b> These issues were collected and destroyed with extreme efficacy in 1866, leaving only a few dozen intact.|$|E

5|$|These {{features}} make Archaeopteryx a clear {{candidate for}} a transitional fossil between non-avian dinosaurs and birds. Thus, Archaeopteryx plays an important role, {{not only in the}} study of the origin of birds, but in the study of dinosaurs. It was named from a single feather in 1861. That same year, the first complete specimen of Archaeopteryx was announced. Over the years, ten more fossils of Archaeopteryx <b>have</b> <b>surfaced.</b> Despite variation among these fossils, most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, although this is still debated.|$|E
5|$|Two {{additional}} realignments {{occurred at}} the north end of the Green Line, but with less acrimony. North of Fort Totten, the line was to <b>have</b> <b>surfaced</b> in the median of the planned North Central Freeway, I-95, and proceeded to a point just west of Prince George's Plaza, with an intermediate station at Chillum. I-95 and Metro would have run through the Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park; the cancellation of I-95 through the District and out to the Beltway in 1974 meant that it was no longer necessary or appropriate to condemn an I-95-sized swath of parkland just for Metro (as well as a Metro station and its parking lot). WMATA eventually selected a new route that skirted most of the park, and it was federally approved by the mid-1980s. The planned Chillum station was relocated and named West Hyattsville. The other alignment dispute occurred in the Petworth section of Washington, and involved whether the tunnel would go under or skirt Rock Creek Cemetery and how to go through this soft-soil burial ground (it was skirted using the New Austrian Tunnelling method), and the least disruptive way under New Hampshire Avenue from Georgia Avenue – Petworth to Columbia Heights (the tunnels were stacked).|$|E
