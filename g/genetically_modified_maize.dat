50|$|Another recent {{controversy}} in Mexico {{has to do}} with the type of maize being grown and consumed.

40|$|The use of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms (GMOs) as {{food and}} in food {{products}} {{is becoming more}} and more widespread. The European Union has implemented a set of very strict procedures for the approval to grow, import and/or utilize GMOs as food or food ingredients.

In the past few years, different PCR-based methods for the specific detection of the most economically important GMOs have been proposed.

40|$|Background There is an {{increasing}} need for quantitative technologies suitable for molecular detection {{in a variety of}} settings for applications including food traceability and monitoring of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> (GM) crops and their products through the food processing chain.
