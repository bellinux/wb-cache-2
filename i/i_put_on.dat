On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E

I turn the amp up so loud that I literally have to play harder than the feedback, because if I stop playing even for an instant, the whole thing explodes." ...|$|E

[...] At the first 50, Hardy came in first in 30.92, but faded badly at the end. Hardy did not blame her poor performances on her physical condition but rather her mental state. [...] On her final chance of making the team, on August 7, Hardy finished in second place in the 100-meter freestyle in 54.14, a personal best for her. [...] After the competition, Hardy said, [...] "I've been struggling so much with the pressure <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> myself, especially in the 100 [...] breaststroke." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} {{a photograph of}} Dylan with Suze Rotolo. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein {{at the corner of}} Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat." [...] In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: ...|$|E

500|$|In November 1924, Fitzgerald {{wrote to}} Perkins that [...] "I have now decided {{to stick to}} the title <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the book... Trimalchio in West Egg" [...] but was {{eventually}} persuaded that the reference was too obscure and that people {{would not be able to}} pronounce it. His wife, Zelda, and Perkins both expressed their preference for The Great Gatsby and the next month Fitzgerald agreed. A month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, he asked if it would be possible to re-title it Trimalchio or Gold-Hatted Gatsby but Perkins advised against it. On March 19, 1925, on March 19: 'CRAZY ABOUT TITLE UNDER THE RED WHITE AND BLUE STOP [...] WOULD DELAY BE'}} Fitzgerald expressed intense enthusiasm for the title Under the Red, White and Blue, but it was at that stage too late to change. The Great Gatsby was published on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald remarked that [...] "the title is only fair, rather bad than good." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{working at}} Wanamaker's Department Store in 1919, Cagney learned, from a {{colleague}} {{who had seen}} him dance, of {{a role in the}} upcoming production Every Sailor. A wartime play in which the chorus was made up of servicemen dressed as women, it was originally titled Every Woman. Cagney auditioned for the role of a chorus girl, despite considering it a waste of time; he knew only one dance step, the complicated Peabody, but he knew it perfectly. This was enough to convince the producers that he could dance, and he copied the other dancers' moves while waiting to go on. He did not find it odd to play a woman, nor was he embarrassed. He later recalled how he was able to shed his own natural shy persona when he stepped onto the stage: [...] "For there I am not myself. I am not that fellow, Jim Cagney, at all. I certainly lost all consciousness of him when <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> skirts, wig, paint, powder, feathers and spangles." ...|$|E
500|$|Cudi also {{incorporated}} {{quotes from}} his favorite movies into the album, wherever he saw fit.

From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt when I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E

Kisses, handshakes, hugs, and caresses usually followed. A critic summed up his appeal {{near the end of}} Liberace's life: [...] "Mr. Showmanship has another more potent, drawing power to his show: the warm and wonderful way he works his audience. Surprisingly enough, behind all the glitz glitter, the corny false modesty, and the shy smile, Liberace exudes a love that is returned to him a thousand-fold." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{releasing}} three successful singles from Revival, Gomez {{announced that}} she had begun recording a follow-up to the album, stating that {{she was ready to}} move on from the era. However, in an interview for 97.5 Now FM, Gomez revealed that [...] "Kill Em with Kindness" [...] was going to be released as the album's fourth and final single, saying: [...] "‘Kill Em with Kindness’ is lyrically my favorite song <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the record and I definitely can’t wait to be able for that to have a story."

2500|$|Sheehan is {{best remembered}} as a novelist; in his novel My New Curate, he recounts an {{incident}} of a clerical appointment {{that may well be}} autobiographical and refer to his arrival in Doneraile: [...] "The Bishop sent for me and said, with what I would call a tone of pity or contempt, but he was incapable of either, for he was the essence of charity and sincerity: 'Father Dan, you are a bit of a literateur, I understand. Kilronan is vacant. You'll have plenty of time for poetising and dreaming there. [...] What do you say to it?' <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a little dignity, and though my heart was beating with delight, I quietly thanked his Lordship.

2500|$|After [...] "I'm Yours" [...] {{remained}} at the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a record 76 weeks ending in October 2009 (peaking at number 6), Mraz headed to the Gulf of Mexico {{during the summer of}} 2010 to help with efforts to clean the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Later, he went to a trip to Ghana to fight child slavery alongside the nonprofit organization Free the Slaves. Later, Mraz was in Antarctica, spending time with Al Gore and learning about climate change aboard the National Geographic Explorer. During his activist outings, Mraz wrote and recorded his fourth album, Love Is a Four Letter Word, with producer Joe Chiccarelli. In an interview for Billboard, he confessed that he was less interested in following up his biggest hit than using the power that [...] "I'm Yours" [...] gave him to fuel positive change. He further elaborated: [...] "The pressure <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> myself, or what I hope my 'I Won't Give Up' does, is {{to make a difference in}} people's lives [...] [...] [...] With 'I'm Yours,' I got to go out and set my feet on different continents, and expose myself to different cultures and causes.

2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{accepted}} the Lord Lieutenancy on 10 August. The Duke of Portland wrote to Fitzwilliam {{four days later}} to say he had told Ponsonby, an Irish Whig, of the appointment.

He said he could only do this if Grattan and the Ponsonbys assisted him. On 8 October Fitzwilliam wrote to the Duke of Portland to inform him of rumours in Ireland that Lord Westmorland was to continue as Lord Lieutenant and that if he was not announced soon as Lord Lieutenant he would resign from the government. The Duke of Portland replied that Pitt [...] "harped" [...] on needing to find Lord Westmorland another office and {{that he did not want}} the Irish Chancellor Lord FitzGibbon removed, as some Whigs were calling for. Fitzwilliam in turn responded that he would accept the office unless given a free hand in both men and measures; he would not [...] "step into Lord Westmorland's old shoes—that <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the old trappings, and submit to the old chains" [...] and declared he would resign.|$|E
