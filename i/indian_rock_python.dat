2500|$|The reptile {{house or}} the serpentarium is built, {{at the cost of}} [...] 0.4 million, in a twining snake-like model with {{entrance}} and exit points in the snake's mouth and tail, respectively. The house was opened to public in the year 1989 and has 24 enclosures exhibiting 4 species of poisonous and 10 species of non-poisonous snakes. It contains a total of 104 snakes, including 41 Indian pythons, 21 Burmese pythons and four cobras. The park has initiated controlled breeding programme for <b>Indian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>python.</b> Each vivarium has been renovated by changing substratum and providing perch and hide outs. The top of the opening in RCC roof is closed with transparent acrylic sheet to avoid rain and the walled enclosure enables the snake to exhibit all natural behaviours. The king cobra is scientifically kept and maintained in constant temperature by providing air conditioning and hot spot.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{parasitic}} fauna on serpentines under captive condition in zoological park of Tamilnadu, India. Methods: Fecal {{samples were collected}} from (n = 247) serpentines, Arignar Anna Zoological Park (n = 22), Vandalur, Tamilnadu, India and Snake Park (n = 27), Guindy, Tamilnadu, India and screened for endoparasites using sedimentation techniques. Ectoparasites were also reported in this study. Results: Coprological examination (n = 247) from captive snakes (n = 49) on random analysis revealed strongyles were predominant in Arignar Anna Zoological Park, Vandalur and Snake Park, Guindy, however the parasites were absent in king cobras (Ophiophagus hannah). Eggs of Capillaria sp. showed less predominance in Vandalur and Gunidy. Rat snakes [Ptyas mucosus (P. mucosus) ] showed higher prevalence of strongyle infection in Vandalur, and Russell’s viper (Daboia russelii) showed higher prevalence in Guindy. Study on ectoparasites revealed Aponomma gerviasii ticks in P. mucosus, Indian cobras (Naja naja), king cobras (Ophiophagus hannah), reticulated pythons (<b>Python</b> reticulates) and <b>Indian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>pythons</b> (Python molurus), among them, the most heavy infestation was documented in P. mucosus (n = 9). Conclusions: Confinement favour stress and dysecdysis in captive condition affect the health status of snakes in zoological park...|$|R

40|$|Objective-To {{determine}} the ultrasonographic {{features of the}} coelomic organs of healthy snakes belonging to the Boidae and Pythonidae families. Animals- 16 ball pythons (Python regius; 7 males, 8 females, and 1 sexually immature), 10 <b>Indian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>pythons</b> (Python molurus molurus; 5 males, 4 females, and 1 sexually immature), 12 Python curtus (5 males and 7 females), and 8 boa constrictors (Boa constrictor imperator; 4 males and 4 females). Procedures-All snakes underwent complete ultrasonographic evaluation of the coelomic cavity; chemical restraint was not necessary. A dorsolateral approach to probe placement was chosen to increase image quality and to avoid injury to the snakes and operators. Qualitative and quantitative observations were recorded. Results-The liver, stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, small and large intestines, kidneys, cloaca, and scent glands were identified in all snakes. The hemipenes were identified in 10 of the 21 (48 %) male snakes. The spleen was identified in 5 of the 46 (11 %) snakes, and ureters were identified in 6 (13 %). In 2 sexually immature snakes, the gonads were not visible. One (2 %) snake was gravid, and 7 (15 %) had small amounts of free fluid in the coelomic cavity. A significant positive correlation was identified between several measurements (diameter and thickness of scent glands, gastric and pyloric walls, and colonic wall) and body length (snout to vent) and body weight. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The study findings {{can be used as}} an atlas of the ultrasonographic anatomy of the coelomic cavity in healthy boid snakes. Ultrasonography was reasonably fast to perform and was well tolerated in conscious snakes...|$|R
2500|$|A gregarious animal, the chital forms matriarchal herds {{comprising}} {{an adult}} female and her offspring {{of the previous}} and the present year, which {{may be associated with}} individuals of any age and either sex, male herds and herds of juveniles and mothers. Small herds are common, though aggregations of as many as 100 individuals have been observed. Groups are loose and disband frequently, save for the juvenile-mother herd. Herd membership in Texas is typically up to 15; herds can have five to 40 members in India. Studies in the Nallamala Hills (Andhra Pradesh, India) and the Western Ghats (western coast of India) showed seasonal variation in the sex ratio of herds; this was attributed to the tendency of females to isolate themselves ahead of parturition. Similarly, rutting males leave their herds during the mating season, hence altering the herd composition. Large herds were most common in monsoon, observed foraging in the grasslands. Predators of the chital include wolves, Bengal tigers, [...] Asiatic lions, leopards, <b>Indian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>pythons,</b> dholes, <b>Indian</b> pariah dogs and mugger crocodiles.

25|$|The generic name, Python, is a Greek word {{referring}} to the enormous serpent at Delphi slain by Apollo in Greek mythology.

Red foxes and golden jackals target juveniles. Males are less vulnerable than females and juveniles.A vocal animal, the chital, akin to the North American elk, gives out bellows and alarm barks. Its calls are, however, not as strong as those of elk or red deer; they are mainly coarse bellows or loud growls. [...] Bellowing coincides with rutting. Dominant males guarding females in oestrus make high-pitched growls at less powerful males. Males may moan during aggressive displays or while resting. The chital, mainly females and juveniles, will bark persistently when alarmed or if they encounter a predator. Fawns in search of their mother often squeal. The chital can respond to the alarm calls of several animals such as the common myna and langurs.Marking behaviour is pronounced in males. Males have well-developed preorbital glands (near the eyes). They stand on their hindlegs to reach tall branches and rub the open preorbital glands to deposit their scent there. This posture is also used while foraging. Urine-marking is also observed; the smell of urine is typically stronger than that of the deposited scent. Sparring between males begins with the larger male displaying his dominance before the other-this display consists of hissing heading away from the other male with the tail facing him, the nose pointing to the ground, the ears down, the antlers upright and the upper lip raised. The fur often bristles during the display. The male approaches the other in a slow gait. Males with velvet antlers may hunch over instead of standing erect as the males with hard antlers. The opponents then interlock their horns and push against each other, with the smaller male producing a sound at times which is louder than that produced by sambar deer {{but not as much as}} the barasinga's. The fight terminates with the males stepping backward, or simply leaving and foraging. Fights are not generally serious. Individuals may occasionally bite one another. Common myna are often attracted to the chital. An interesting relationship has been observed between herds of chital and troops of the northern plains gray langurs, a widespread South Asian monkey. Chital benefit from the langurs' eyesight and ability to post a lookout from trees, while the langur benefit from the chital's strong sense of smell-both of which help keep a check on potential danger. The chital also benefit from fruits dropped by langurs from trees such as Terminalia bellerica and Phyllanthus emblica. The chital has been observed foraging with sambar deer in the Western Ghats.|$|R
