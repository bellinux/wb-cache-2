5|$|At first Nansen and Johansen {{made good}} {{progress}} south, but on 13 April suffered a serious setback when {{both of their}} chronometers stopped. Without knowing the correct time, it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> calculate their longitude and thus navigate their way accurately to Franz Josef Land. They restarted the watches {{on the basis of}} Nansen's guess that they were at longitude 86°E, but from then on were uncertain of their true position.|$|E
5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was {{to ensure that}} all party leaders were made aware of these plans and actions. Thus, it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> later deny knowledge of the killings. Because the Allies had indicated {{that they were going to}} pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the planned genocide.|$|E

[...] "With all the telegraph and telephone wires down the authorities won't {{be able to}} send out any alarm.

5|$|STS-125 {{was further}} pushed back to October 2008 due to {{manufacturing}} delays on external tanks for future space shuttle missions. Lockheed Martin experienced delays during the production changes {{to make new}} external tanks with all the enhancements recommended by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> produce two tanks for the STS-125 mission–one for Atlantis, and one for Endeavour for an emergency rescue mission, if necessary–in time for the original August launch date.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} on 5 January 1922, while Quest was {{anchored}} at South Georgia. After his death the original programme, which had included an exploration of Enderby Land, was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island. They anchored off Cape Wild, and were able to see the old landmarks, but sea conditions made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> land.|$|E
5|$|The couple then {{journeyed to}} Claremont in Surrey for the honeymoon, but the {{presence}} of attendants on the journey, and at meal times, made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> talk privately. The short four-day visit did not pass without an interruption from the Queen, who was curious about her daughter's thoughts on married life. Among their wedding gifts was a maplewood desk from Queen Victoria, now at Inveraray Castle.|$|E
60|$|Over {{and over}} again the clinking noise was repeated. Cautious as the Indians were, it was <b>impossible</b> even <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> get over that strange and {{difficult}} obstacle without touching the wires with their arms. Occasionally Mr. Hardy and the boys fancied that they could see dark objects stealing toward the house through the gloom; otherwise all was still.|$|R
60|$|The young Princes {{were not}} in the least concerned, not knowing what they had to do; but the whole Court was amazed at her demand, knowing very well that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> ever <b>to</b> get the steed, as all that ever sought him perished in the attempt. However, they could not retract the bargain, and the {{youngest}} Prince was desired to tell what demand he had on the Queen, as he had won his game.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{me bring}} you some ear-rings, Gwen," [...] said Mrs. Davilow, when the hair was adjusted, and they were both looking at the {{reflection}} in the glass. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> not <b>to</b> notice that the eyes looked brighter than they had done of late, that {{there seemed to be}} a shadow lifted from the face, leaving all the lines once more in their placid youthfulness. The mother drew some inference that made her voice rather cheerful. [...] "You do want your earrings?" ...|$|R
5|$|The {{situation}} changed radically {{during the}} early morning hours of 7 February. The Americans had forewarning of NVA armor in the area from Laotian refugees from camp BV-33. SOG Reconnaissance teams also reported finding tank tracks in the area surrounding Co Roc mountain. Although the NVA was known to possess two armored regiments, it had not yet fielded an armored unit in South Vietnam, and besides, the Americans considered it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> get one down to Khe Sanh without it being spotted by aerial reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|Operation Banner {{ended at}} midnight on 31 July 2007 after about 38 years of {{continuous}} deployment, the longest in British Army history. According {{to an internal}} document released in 2007, the British Army had failed to defeat the IRA but made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> win by violence. Operation Helvetic replaced Operation Banner in 2007, maintaining fewer service personnel in a more-benign environment. From 1971 to 1997, a total of 763 British military personnel were killed during the Troubles. About 300 deaths during the conflict were attributed to the British Army, including paramilitary troops and civilians.|$|E
5|$|Skaði also {{included}} in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something she thought <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied {{one end of a}} cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.|$|E
60|$|If, then, {{it be the}} tradesman's {{interest}} to accept of the offer made, there needs no stronger argument {{to be used with}} him for the doing it; and nothing is more surprising to me than to see tradesmen, the hardest to come into such compositions, and to push on severities against other tradesmen, as if they were {{out of the reach of}} the shocks of fortune themselves, or that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> ever <b>to</b> stand in need of the same mercy--the contrary to which I have often seen.|$|R
60|$|The {{two boys}} had been hustled on {{board of the}} {{schooner}} with scant ceremony, and now they found themselves bound and handcuffed, {{so that it was}} next <b>to</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> either of <b>them</b> <b>to</b> move. Hour after hour had passed, yet nobody had come near them.|$|R
60|$|What to do {{next the}} Rover boys did not know. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> any of <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{calculate}} how far they were from the spot where they had landed or {{to determine the best}} way of getting back to Foreshow Bay, as they had named the locality.|$|R
5|$|By early 1645 the war {{had turned}} decisively against the King, and in February, Parliamentary forces seized the county town of Shrewsbury. This exposed {{the rest of the}} region to attack, and in June a force of 800 Parliamentary {{soldiers}} pushed south towards Ludlow, attacking Stokesay en route. The Royalist garrison, led by Captain Daurett, was heavily outnumbered {{and it would have been}} <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> effectively defend the new gatehouse, which was essentially ornamental. Nonetheless, both sides complied with the protocols of warfare at the time, resulting in a bloodless victory for the Parliamentary force: the besiegers demanded that the garrison surrender, the garrison refused, the attackers demanded a surrender for a second time, and this time the garrison were able to give up the castle with dignity.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been delayed}} several times by poor weather, Operation Cobra {{commenced}} on 25 July, with a concentrated aerial bombardment {{from thousands of}} Allied aircraft. Supporting offensives had drawn the bulk of German armored reserves toward the British and Canadian sector and coupled with the general lack of men and materiel available to the Germans, it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> form successive lines of defense. Units of the U. S. VII Corps led the initial two-division assault, while other First Army corps mounted supporting attacks designed to pin German units in place. Progress was slow {{on the first day}} but opposition started to crumble once the defensive crust had been broken. By 27 July, most organized resistance had been overcome and the VII and VIII Corps advanced rapidly, isolating the Cotentin peninsula.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fly so far west and not reach Florida. He {{believed}} that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E

5000|$|A February 2009 {{article in}} Government Executive {{magazine}} described the Coalition as “An unfunded organization with no professional staff, {{the coalition is}} run through the volunteer efforts of good government group leaders. Early in the Bush administration, the coalition received some funding for a joint book project on performance management advice, but it now operates primarily as a clearinghouse for its member organizations' efforts.” The article continues: “The loose structure isn't just a vehicle for agreement at the coalition. It's a requirement. Because {{of the variety of}} governance structures among the member groups, it's <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> all <b>to</b> commit to a concerted lobbying campaign or even formally endorse a program.” ...|$|R
60|$|And then Turan {{came to a}} {{point where}} the avenue turned to the right, to skirt a {{building}} that jutted from the inside of the city wall, and as he rounded the corner he came full upon two warriors standing upon either side of the entrance to a building upon his right. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> not <b>to</b> be aware of his presence, yet neither moved, nor gave other evidence that they had seen him. He stood there waiting, his hand upon the hilt of his long-sword, but they neither challenged nor halted him. Could it be that these also thought him one of their own kind? Indeed upon no other grounds could he explain their inaction.|$|R

25|$|The Virginia Colony {{continued}} to grow and encroach on Powhatan land, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> sustain traditional practices. Many Pamunkey were forced {{to work for the}} English or were enslaved. As the colonial settlement grew, so did settlers with their resistance to Native American attacks.|$|E
25|$|Each Jewish etrog {{merchant}} committed {{himself to}} his local rabbi {{that he would not}} buy any etrog from the Greek farmers, since this would result in a record breaking expense for the Jewish community, which was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> pay. This was a great sacrifice from the local Jewry in Corfu, who went without income for the year.|$|E
60|$|When {{they found}} out {{what they had to}} do, each man went to work to try, if possible, to raise the twelve pounds; but Rogers soon saw that it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> some of <b>them</b> <b>to</b> do this, as specie money was so hard to get, and he reduced the sum, in some cases, to six or four pounds. He was a good {{business}} manager, and would not try {{to get out of a}} man more than that man could pay.|$|R
500|$|The android {{head nurse}} ANI (Julia Pennington) and the alien surgeon Dr. Batung (Jordan Lund) {{also help to}} combat the {{frequent}} medical emergencies at the hospital. ANI (Android Nursing Interface) is represented as [...] "extremely efficient and attractive", the facility's other nurses disliking her as they feel that she sets an <b>impossible</b> standard <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> match. Throughout the series, ANI develops more emotions, such as crying and laughing, and tries {{to learn more about}} them. Batung, who is part of the slug-like species the Shenn, is portrayed as lacking bedside manners by acting insensitively toward his patients. His negative behavior is attributed to his lack of experience working with human co-workers and patients. The hospital is run by the Chief of Staff Harris DeMilla (Joe Spano), who is often tasked to handle its ethical issues.|$|R
60|$|Everybody there present knew {{as well as}} {{does the}} reader, what was the {{connexion}} between Tregear and Lady Mary Palliser. And each knew that the other knew it. It was therefore <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> not <b>to</b> feel themselves guilty among themselves. The two lovers had not seen each other since they had been together in Italy. Now they were brought face to face in this unexpected manner! And nobody except Tregear was at first quite sure whether somebody had not done something to arrange the meeting. Mary might naturally suspect that Lady Mabel had done this {{in the interest of}} her friend Tregear, and Silverbridge could not but suspect that it was so. Lady Mabel, who had never before met the other girl, could hardly refrain from thinking that there had been some underhand communication,--and Miss Cassewary was clearly of opinion that there had been some understanding.|$|R
25|$|On 27 October 1947 Razakars and Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen {{staged a}} {{demonstration}} at {{the houses of}} the members of delegation, Monckton, the Nawab, and Sir Sultan Ahmed, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> leave for Delhi as intended. The discussions that followed bore no fruit, and on 1 November the Nawab of Chhatari, finding his position intolerable, resigned as President of the Executive Council. Monckton also insisted on resigning.|$|E
25|$|The fairies wonder why, if {{the mortal}} world is so miserable, its {{inhabitants}} {{do not take}} their own lives. Selene explains that mortals have one great gift that makes life worth living – the gift of Love. The fairies are in wonder at Selene's description, as they have never experienced Love. Selene explains that Love is unnecessary. Moreover, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> experience it, as only a mortal can inspire love, and mortals cannot set foot in Fairyland.|$|E
25|$|For 17 months, {{the fort}} {{was able to}} harass French {{shipping}} trying to enter Fort-de-France. The guns on the rock completely dominated the channel {{between it and the}} main island, and because of their elevation, were able to fire far out to sea and forced vessels to give it a wide berth, with the result that the currents and strong winds would make it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fetch in Port Royal. During this time the French troops on Martinique made several unsuccessful attempts to retake the rock.|$|E

Such contention leads to disorder. Disorder leads to poverty. The Ancient Kings abhorred such disorder; so they established the regulations contained within ritual and moral principles in order to apportion things, to nurture the desires of men, and to supply the means for their satisfaction. They so fashioned their regulations that desires should not want for the things which satisfy them and goods would not be exhausted by the desires. In this way the two of them, desires and goods, sustained each other over the course of time. This is the origin of ritual principles.” [...]...|$|R
