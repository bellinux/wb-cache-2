5|$|Market Street is {{a unique}} set in the Modular Buildings series in that it <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> than 2000 pieces and is {{recommended}} for builders 10 years and up rather than the usual 16. One of the reasons this set was smaller than the others {{was to provide a}} lower cost entry point into the Modular Houses series.|$|E
5|$|Python is {{intended}} to be a highly readable language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, often using English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Python does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional, in contrast to many other programming languages. Further, Python <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.|$|E
5|$|The {{system has}} been in place since 2007 when {{graduate}} endowments were abolished. Labour's education spokesperson Rhona Brankin criticised the Scottish system for failing to address student poverty. Scotland <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> disadvantaged students than England, Wales or Northern Ireland and disadvantaged students receive around £560 a year less in financial support than their counterparts in England do.|$|E

5000|$|... 1. Frequency—How often {{a person}} has IIs ranging from rarely to quite frequently. For example, lonely people <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> IIs because they <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> {{interaction}} scenes to access compared to nonlonely people (Honeycutt, 2003).|$|R
5|$|As {{a largely}} rural county, Dorset <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> major {{cultural}} institutions than larger or more densely populated areas. Major venues for concerts and theatre include Poole's Lighthouse arts centre, Bournemouth's BIC, Pavilion Theatre and O2 Academy, and the Pavilion theatre in Weymouth. One of Dorset's most noted cultural institutions is the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra {{which was founded}} in 1893. Based in Poole, the orchestra performs over 130 concerts across southern England each year.|$|E
5|$|Ports use Makefile to {{automatically}} fetch the desired application's source code, either {{from a local}} or remote repository, unpack it on the system, apply patches to it and compile it. Depending {{on the size of}} the source code, compiling can take a long time, but it gives the user more control over the process and its result. Most ports also have package counterparts (i.e. pre-compiled binaries), giving the user a choice. Although this method is faster, the user <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> customisation options.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the previous installments, with a focus on combo-based combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and secondary weapons acquired throughout the game. It features quick time events that require the player to complete game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up to three magical attacks as alternative combat options. The game also features puzzles and platforming elements. The control setup was reconfigured for the PSP, as it <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> buttons than the PlayStation 2's controller. Ready at Dawn's solution for the controls received praise from critics.|$|E
50|$|Having more {{checkers}} {{is usually}} an advantage, {{because they can}} limit the opponent's options as they mass together.On the other hand, material considerations are not all-important, because <b>having</b> <b>fewer</b> checkers also means <b>having</b> <b>fewer</b> to unite.|$|R

5|$|The pigeye shark can be most {{reliably}} {{distinguished from}} the bull shark {{by the number of}} precaudal (before the caudal fin) vertebrae (89–95 in C. amboinensis versus 101–123 in C. leucas). Externally, it has a greater size difference between its dorsal fins (first-to-second height ratio >3.1:1 versus ≤3.1:1 in C. leucas) and the notch in its anal fin margin forms an acute angle (versus a right angle in C. leucas). This species also usually <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> tooth rows in the lower jaw (10–12 on each side versus 12–13 in C. leucas).|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the rhinarium {{does not have any}} {{olfactory}} receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums are tightly connected by a fold of mucous membrane called the philtrum, which runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The upper lip is constrained by this connection and <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.|$|E
5|$|The two kingdoms within Kent were {{east and}} west Kent. Western Kent <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> archaeological finds from the {{earliest}} periods than east Kent, and the eastern finds are somewhat distinct in character, showing Jutish and Frankish influence. The archaeological evidence, combined with the known political division into two kingdoms, makes it likely that {{the origin of the}} subkingdoms was the conquest of the western half by the eastern, which would have been the first area settled by the invaders.|$|E

5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the five}} {{counties}} in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Rhode Island is tied with Hawaii for having the second-lowest number of counties of any U.S. state (only Delaware <b>has</b> <b>fewer,</b> with three counties). Although Rhode Island is divided into counties, it does not have any local government at the county level. Instead, local governance is provided by the eight cities and thirty-one towns. Counties in Rhode Island have had no governmental functions since 1846 other than as court administrative and sheriff corrections boundaries which are part of state government.|$|E
5|$|Because Ireland became {{isolated}} from mainland Europe by rising sea levels {{before the last}} ice age had completely finished, it <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> land animal and plant species than Great Britain, which separated later, or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland. Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow.|$|E
5|$|Ceredigion had {{the largest}} {{population}} growth of any county in Wales, with a 19.5% increase from 1991 to 2003. Tourism and agriculture, chiefly hill farming, {{are the most important}} industries. In addition, two universities are within the county boundaries: Aberystwyth University and the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David. The Welsh Plant Breeding Station is near Aberystwyth and linked to the University. The National Library of Wales, founded in 1907, is also in Aberystwyth. Ceredigion is an extremely rural county; the largest town, Aberystwyth, <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> than 15,000 permanent residents and the remainder {{of the population of the}} county is scattered over 150 small towns, villages and hamlets.|$|E

50|$|Injectable {{cladribine}} suppresses the body's {{ability to}} make new blood cells (called Myelosuppression); data from HCL studies showed that about 70% of people taking the drug <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> white blood cells and about 30% developed infections {{and some of those}} progressed to septic shock; about 40% of people taking the drug <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> red blood cells and became severely anemic; and about 10% of people <b>had</b> too <b>few</b> platelets.|$|R

5|$|From {{the data}} he {{collected}} and documented, Aristotle inferred {{quite a number}} of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.|$|E
5|$|Plasmapheresis and {{intravenous}} immunoglobulins (IVIG) are the {{two main}} immunotherapy treatments for GBS. Plasmapheresis attempts to reduce the body's attack on the nervous system by filtering antibodies out of the bloodstream. Similarly, administration of IVIG neutralizes harmful antibodies and inflammation. These two treatments are equally effective, but {{a combination of the}} two is not significantly better than either alone. Plasmapheresis speeds recovery when used within four weeks of the onset of symptoms. IVIG works as well as plasmapheresis when started within two weeks of the onset of symptoms, and <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> complications. IVIG is usually used first because of its ease of administration and safety. Its use is not without risk; occasionally it causes liver inflammation, or in rare cases, kidney failure. Glucocorticoids alone have not been found to be effective in speeding recovery and could potentially delay recovery.|$|E
5|$|The dump {{months are}} what the film {{community}} calls the two periods {{of the year}} when there are lowered commercial and critical expectations for most new releases. Audiences during these periods are smaller {{than the rest of the}} year, so no tentpole movies are released. January and February are usually most commonly described this way, with August and September sometimes included. Releases during those times primarily include films that would have been released at other times of year had they done better at test screenings, films with less prominent stars, genre films (particularly horror), movies that cannot be easily marketed and films intended for a teenage audience, which <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> entertainment options outside the home.|$|E

5|$|The second {{presentation}} {{was given by}} a representative of Scout Moor Wind Farm, who argued the need for Britain to produce clean green power without harmful emissions, to counter the increasing dangers of global warming. He {{went on to say}} that the UK <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> wind farms than other major industrial countries in Europe, even though it is a windier country, and that North West England has a particularly poor record, with only 1.3% of electricity generated from renewable energy. Following this meeting the campaign to oppose the proposal gathered momentum, and in November 2003 a protest was held on the moor, led by environmental campaigner Professor David Bellamy.|$|E
5|$|As in Red Dead Redemption, {{the player}} can diverge {{from the main}} story on side quests: {{requests}} from strangers, checklist challenges, and other digressions. These missions are similar in format {{to those of the}} original but their objectives are replaced to fit the zombie horror theme. For example, the player hunts for family members instead of fugitives or empties graveyards instead of gang hideouts. Marston is called to liberate towns overrun by the undead, which unlocks ammo, new places to stay, quests, and the assistance of the living townspeople. After Marston's assistance, the towns remain free of zombies for several in-game days, but will eventually require the player's assistance when zombies return once again. The player decides whether to share ammunition with the townsfolk: ammunition serves as a currency in the game since the shops have closed. The player <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> correctives for immorality, such as helping or killing other survivors, given the dire circumstances. The game puts a greater emphasis on hyperbolic fun.|$|E
5|$|Banquo is in a {{third of}} the play's scenes, as both a human and a ghost. As {{significant}} as he is to the plot, he <b>has</b> <b>fewer</b> lines than the relatively insignificant Ross, a Scottish nobleman who survives the play. In the second scene of the play, King Duncan describes the manner in which Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, and Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, bravely led his army against invaders, fighting side by side. In the next scene, Banquo and Macbeth, returning from the battle together, encounter the Three Witches, who predict that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor, and then king. Banquo, sceptical of the witches, challenges them to predict his own future, and they foretell that Banquo will never himself take the throne, but will beget a line of kings. Banquo remains sceptical after the encounter, wondering aloud if evil can ever speak the truth. He warns Macbeth that evil will offer men a small, hopeful truth only to catch them in a deadly trap.|$|E
