The company, founded {{as a result of}} action by FIBOIS Ardèche Drôme (the wood sector inter-professional organisation in these two French départements), presently supplies 40, 000 T of wood for energy composed {{of a wide range of}} biomass, typed by particle size and moisture levels, with a potential output of 100, 000 T within five years. ABSRA is made up of family companies, some working in the region for several generations, and already supplies various projects (industries, heating utilities, paper producers [...] .). ABSRA has acquired expertise, unique in the region, in the production and supply of ready-to-use biomass. Furthermore, the geographical spread of the partner companies enables ABSRA to diversify its sources of supply and optimise the stream of biomass. The certainty of a reliable supply for a project depends on “ensuring uninterrupted supply”. This is made possible by ABSRA’s shareholder make-up...|$|E

40|$|This study {{develops}} a new strategic and operational supplier selection approach {{for a company}} in a supply chain to select suppliers for meeting its strategic and operational needs. The strategic needs involve the strategic goals and long-term expectations that the company wants to achieve for ensuring its long-term growth and survival, while the operational needs reflect the short-term requirements of an individual customer order of the company. An optimal <b>group</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>suppliers</b> is first determined by the strategic supplier selection approach for meeting the strategic needs of the company. For meeting the operational needs of a specific customer order, the best supplier is then selected from the optimal <b>group</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>suppliers</b> by the operational supplier selection approach. An empirical study on an auto parts manufacturing company in South Korea (referred to as the KAP company) is conducted to present the strategic and operational supplier selection approach in this study. Based on KAP’s strategic plan of developing long-term strategic suppliers from the existing suppliers and new suppliers, the strategic and operational supplier selection approach is developed for both cases. To meet the strategic needs of KAP, an optimal <b>group</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>suppliers</b> that best meets both strategic goals and operational requirements of KAP {{is determined by the}} strategic supplier selection approach. The approach is developed by integrating multicriteria decision making (MCDM) models and an optimisation model. For developing strategic suppliers from the existing suppliers, the potential contribution <b>of</b> available <b>suppliers</b> to the strategic goals with regard to the long-term benefit-based criteria is evaluated. For developing strategic suppliers from the new suppliers, the potential contribution <b>of</b> available <b>suppliers</b> to the strategic goals with regard to the long-term benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR) dimensions and their associated criteria is evaluated. An MCDM model with a new strategic goal dependent weighting method is developed to evaluate the contribution <b>of</b> the <b>suppliers.</b> After evaluating the contribution <b>of</b> the available <b>suppliers</b> to the goals, a set <b>of</b> feasible <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>suppliers</b> among the available suppliers is determined to meet KAP’s strategic needs and operational requirements by developing an optimisation model. The strategic needs contain a specified number <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> required by KAP and required for each product, and operational requirements contain required production capacities <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> for meeting the demand of products and required minimum total turnover <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> to be selected. An optimal <b>group</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>suppliers</b> among the feasible groups is then determined by considering management costs, competition benefits, and a triadic buyer-supplier-supplier relationship <b>of</b> the <b>groups,</b> and the relative importance values of products, using pairwise comparisons in the analytic hierarchy process. To meet the operational needs <b>of</b> KAP, the <b>supplier</b> that best meets a specific customer order of KAP is determined from the optimal <b>group</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>suppliers</b> by the operational supplier selection approach. MCDM models with a new customer order dependent weighting methods are developed in the approach. To determine the best supplier for meeting the customer order, a feasible <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> that best meets the requirements of the customer order with regard to the information security dimensions and their associated criteria is first determined. Then, the supplier that best meets the requirements of the customer order with regard to the short-term benefit-based criteria is determined from the feasible <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers.</b> With the development of the strategic and operational supplier selection approach using MCDM and optimisation models, this study makes significant conceptual and methodological contributions. Instead of managing and selecting from a large number <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> for specific customer orders, the strategic supplier selection approach represents an original contribution to the methodological development for determining an optimal and manageable <b>group</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>suppliers</b> that best meets both strategic goals and operational requirements of a company. The new strategic goal dependent weighting method in the approach provides a novel methodology for determining the criteria weights by considering how the long-term benefit-based criteria and long-term BOCR dimensions contribute to the strategic goals of a company. A new optimisation model together with pairwise comparisons enables a company to determine an optimal <b>group</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>suppliers</b> that meets resource constraints and performs best as a group by considering both qualitative and quantitative criteria reflecting the strategic needs and operational requirements. The operational supplier selection approach represents a novel conceptual and methodological framework for determining the supplier that best meets a specific customer order of a company. In the approach, a new customer order dependent weighting method is developed for measuring weights of the information security dimensions and short-term benefit-based criteria by considering the impact of a specific customer order on the dimensions and criteria. The weighting method provides a formal methodology for consistently weighting the dimensions and criteria, depending on the requirements of a specific customer order. The strategic supplier selection approach has general application in determining an optimal <b>group</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>suppliers</b> for companies that have different strategic goals with regard to different long-term benefit-based criteria, long-term BOCR criteria, and strategic needs and operational requirements. The operational supplier selection approach is applicable to select the best supplier for companies that have the requirements of various customer orders with regard to different information security dimensions and their associated criteria, and short-term benefit-based criteria...|$|R
