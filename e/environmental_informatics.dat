40|$|The current {{development}} {{in the field of}} sustainability reporting and the rise of environmental information systems in organizations require a redevelopment of sustainability standards. Nowadays, companies are sharing information in increasingly higher amounts than in the 1990 s. This leads to a demand for harmonization and support for automated information processing. Financial reporting faces this development e. g by analyzing information demands of networks, analyzing requirements and interests for a network publicity. Network publicity in financial reporting provides the idea of adapting such developments for sustainability reporting as well. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe and integrate approaches from different fields of research e. g. financial reporting, sustainability reporting, business <b>informatics,</b> <b>environmental</b> business <b>informatics,</b> which will serve as the basis for a later case study of the Eco-industrial park Bremen to be adapted for developing sustainability reporting in networks. In this case study, <b>environmental</b> business <b>informatics</b> with <b>environmental</b> information management and material flow management are used as environmental information sources. Research will finally lead to a reference architecture which will be evaluated in the case study Eco-industrial Park Bremen.

Up to now, there are no clear regulations regarding useful parameters {{which can be used}} for evaluating the efficiency of surface treatments for the consolidation and protection of stone. The main goal of this work is to identify possible important "chemical-physical parameters" and their threshold limit values. In this context, the determination of the surface water absorption and colour variation may be important tools for the control and the monitoring over time of the state of conservation of the architecture stone surfaces. These parameters are strongly related not only to the surface conservation state but also to products efficiency. Moreover, they can be easily measured at low cost by specifically trained personnel.

40|$|This paper reports {{data from}} a case study project aimed at {{examining}} the effect of an <b>environmental</b> education-based <b>Informatics</b> module on the attitudes of students in grades 5 and 6 towards a series of environmental issues. Firstly, the two major innovations currently under way in Greece are briefly described and the resulting challenges for educators are discussed: (a) primary schools are being equipped with computers and (b) a new cross-disciplinary curriculum has been issued. Secondly, a module developed {{to meet these challenges}} is presented and the rationale for its design is analyzed drawing on educational technology, learning psychology, and environmental education. Environmental education served as the overall context for making computer literacy meaningful and coherent since the starting point was an authentic task to the realization of which technology was essentially instrumental. Thirdly, a module outline is presented which included three main activities: (a) writing a letter to the city mayor describing environmental problems of the neighborhood, (b) conducting a neighborhood survey to inquire the attitudes of adult residents towards the problems identified by the students, and (c) presenting both the letters and the survey results to the mayor in an one hour special event. One hundred and four students participated in the study which took place at a public elementary school in the city of Rethimno during the school year 2001 - 02.

Recently, several studies [2] have highlighted that the presence of methoxyphenols in polar areas are attributable not only to biomass burning but also to local marine sources. The purpose of the present work was to determine free phenolic compounds in both dissolved and particulate fractions in Arctic seawater samples. We analyzed 67 samples of coastal seawater collected near the coast line of Kongsfjord during the Arctic sampling campaign 2015. The quantitative determination has been performed using a HPLC-MS/MS method developed by Zangrando et al. [3]. Vanillic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, syringic acid, isovanillic acid, homovanillic acid, syringaldehyde, acetosyringone and acetovanillone were determined. In dissolved phase there was a higher concentration of methoxyphenols than in the particulate fraction. The most abundant compounds in our samples were vanillic acid, vanillin, acetovanillone and p-coumaric acid.

Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to optimize an in vitro model for characterizing the transport of nanoparticles across human placental trophoblast cells. Methods: The growth of BeWo (clone b 30) human placental choriocarcinoma cells for nanoparticle transport studies was characterized in terms of optimized Transwell&reg; insert type and pore size, the investigation of barrier properties by transmission electron microscopy, tight junction staining, transepithelial electrical resistance, and fluorescein sodium transport. Following the determination of nontoxic concentrations of fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles, the cellular uptake and transport of 50 nm and 100 nm diameter particles was measured using the in vitro BeWo cell model. Results: Particle size measurements, fluorescence readings, and confocal microscopy indicated both cellular uptake of the fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles and the transcellular transport of these particles from the apical (maternal) to the basolateral (fetal) compartment. Over the course of 24 hours, the apparent permeability across BeWo cells grown on polycarbonate membranes (3. 0 &micro;m pore size) was four times higher for the 50 nm particles compared with the 100 nm particles. Conclusion: The BeWo cell line has been optimized and shown to be a valid in vitro model for studying the transplacental transport of nanoparticles. Fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticle transport was size-dependent, as smaller particles reached the basal (fetal) compartment at a higher rate.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{on the topic of}} {{informatics}} and its relations to scientific research and data - rich, multi-faceted data that represent the earth and environmental systems. Data travel from field and laboratory into collections, repositories and archives. Just as data are a scientific resource, so too the work carried out with data and their organization is a resource for the <b>environmental</b> sciences. <b>Informatics</b> is concerned with the stewardship of data, that is, with the tending of data and its flow, the design of information systems and their interfaces, and the growth of infrastructure given a distributed variety of data arenas. Enacted at the intersection of information science, environmental science and social science, informatics is evolving as we learn more about information environments and arrangements of human and technical systems. Five informatics ‘good practices’ are identified in this report: Informatics Good Practices 1. Incorporate data problem formulation and data scoping early in the scientific planning process. 2. Recognize articulation, translation, negotiation and mediation as central to work with data. 3. Partner with appropriate information professionals for data work. 4. Create collaboration opportunities as well as coordination mechanisms for community work. 5. Recognize informatics as conducting research while carrying out information management. The realm of informatics ranges across spatial, temporal, and organizational scales, weaving together diverse configurations, stretching over physical, digital and conceptual spaces. Many salient topics about data care remain to be discovered or investigated: data classification and provenance; data organization and modeling; data migration and data exchange; data assurance and quality control; data mediation and integration. Along with the development of roles for information professionals, we are learning about the dynamics of information environments, communities, and networks. Informatics is happening. As we transition from use of ‘my data’ to ‘our data’, changes occur in data, collaborative, and scientific practices. Informatics provides new approaches and tools of interest to environmental scientists, information professionals, and social scientists alike. I am an information manager privileged to work with several long-term, interdisciplinary projects within the Integrative Oceanography Division (IOD) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and as an affiliate of the Science Studies Program at UCSD with its dynamic mix of communication, sociology, history and philosophy. Regarding my agenda with informatics, it is twofold: to be a responsible data steward and to partner with environmental science researchers by creating a contemporary information environment that supports concurrently the practice of information management and the inquiry of informatics research...|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} industry, {{one of the}} top {{consumers of}} natural resources, produces extensive carbon emissions that create the need for a sustainable manufacturing process, a topic of significant research interest. In the recent decades, the advancement of environmental technology and introduction of comprehensive environmental management systems have highlighted the intangible benefits of environmental management practices and their potential to drive organizational competitiveness. Accumulating evidence on the potential benefits of environmental protectionism has given rise to a series of environmental management practices and systems, such as energy <b>informatics,</b> <b>environmental</b> management standardization frameworks, and green supplier management and collaboration. However, existing literature lacks a clear conceptualization and a coherent theoretical framework of environmental management. In addition, no systematic framework exists for the design and implementation of environmental management practices that guide organizations in deciding on the practices or systems that they should implement given their organizational situations. Thus, this study aims to develop an energy and utility maturity framework for systematic measurement and management of natural resource consumption. Specifically, the proposed framework, energy and utility management maturity model (EUMMM), was designed based on the capability maturity model integration (CMMI). EUMMM has two major functions. First, it provides an assessment framework for analyzing the maturity level of energy and utility management in organizations. Second, it provides a progressive framework to guide organizational advancement in energy and utility management. A collaborative pilot study was conducted to validate the effectiveness, practicability, and convenience of the EUMMM. The results indicated that EUMMM successfully led the participating companies to move along the environmental management maturity path. Theoretically, this study extends the application of CMMI to the context of natural resource management and develops a progressive framework for energy and utility management maturation. Practically, this study provides a robust guideline for practitioners in analyzing and advancing energy and utility maturity levels to achieve a sustainable manufacturing process.

40|$|NASA is {{currently}} the leader, in conjunction with our Russian counterpart co-leads, of the Multilateral Medical Policy Board (MMPB), the Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP), which coordinates medical system support for International Space Station (ISS) crews, and the Multilateral Space Medicine Board (MSMB), which medically certifies all crewmembers for space flight on-board the ISS. These three organizations have representatives from NASA, RSA-IMBP (Russian Space Agency- Institute for Biomedical Problems), GCTC (Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center), ESA (European Space Agency), JAXA (Japanese Space Agency), and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). The policy and strategic coordination of ISS medical operations occurs at this level, and includes interactions with MMOP working groups in Radiation Health, Countermeasures, Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA), <b>Informatics,</b> <b>Environmental</b> Health, Behavioral Health and Performance, Nutrition, Clinical Medicine, Standards, Post-flight Activities and Rehabilitation, and Training. Each ISS Expedition has a lead Crew Surgeon from NASA and a Russian Crew Surgeon from GCTC assigned to the mission. Day-to-day issues are worked real-time by the flight surgeons and biomedical engineers (also called the Integrated Medical Group) on consoles at the MCC (Mission Control Center) in Houston and the TsUP (Center for Flight Control) in Moscow/Korolev. In the future, this may also include mission control centers in Europe and Japan, when their modules are added onto the ISS. Private medical conferences (PMCs) are conducted regularly and upon crew request with the ISS crew via private audio and video communication links from the biomedical MPSR (multipurpose support room) at MCC Houston. When issues arise in the day-to-day medical support of ISS crews, they are discussed and resolved at the SMOT (space medical operations team) meetings, which occur weekly among the International Partners. Any medical or life science issue that is not resolved at the SMOT {{can be taken to}} the Mission Management Team meeting, which occurs biweekly from MCC-Houston. This meeting includes the other International Partners and all flight support and console position representatives via teleconference. ISS Crew Surgeons have handled many medical conditions on orbit; including skin rashes, dental abscesses, lacerations, and STT segment EKG changes. Fortunately to date, there have not been any forced medical evacuations from the ISS. This speaks well for the implementation of the primary, secondary and even tertiary prevention strategies invoked by the Integrated Medical Group, as there were several medical evacuations during the previous Russian space stations...|$|R
40|$|Environmental Community Organisations (ECOs) play an {{important}} role in the ongoing stewardship of the natural environment in Australia. This ranges from managing urban nature reserves to the mounting of public campaigns in order to curtail further environmental degradation. Many of these organisations, however, operate in challenging circumstances in which access to human and financial resources are scarce. The utility of social capital to overcome resource scarcities coupled with the potential of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for fostering social capital have been increasingly acknowledged. Yet little research exists on the appraisal of social capital in ECOs and the implications of the association between social capital and ICT. It is the contention of this thesis that by providing additional means to harness social capital, ICT uptake in ECOs can benefit environmental stewardship strategies. The aim of this thesis is twofold. Firstly, it aims to assess social capital in ECOs in the Perth region of Western Australia. Secondly, it aims to investigate the extent to which ECOs are making use of ICTs to enhance social capital. I propose a research framework that recognises intra-organisational and inter-organisational interactions as a basis to conceptualise and ascertain social capital in ECOs. Then, I use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data (including a survey of 81 organisational leaders, interviews, and website content analysis) in order to explore the level of social capital, the trend of ICT uptake, and the implications of the interplay between ICT and social capital. The results show that having a higher level of social capital (greater intensity of organisational interactions) places ECOs in a better position to acquire funding and volunteers. Moreover, in spite of ICT uptake being mostly limited to email and websites, findings indicate that not only ICT supplements social capital, but also that social capital influences ICT uptake. The research also demonstrates the usefulness of the adopted framework to empirically ascertain social capital and gauge an association between ICT and social capital in the context of community organisations. These findings are consistent with the view that social capital is a necessary ingredient of community organisations that often have to do ‘more with less’. While it might be the case that not every ECO requires high level of social capital or needs to adopt ICT, as ICTs become increasingly ubiquitous in an organisational context, ECOs that are either unable or unwilling to adopt ICTs can be disadvantaged because of reduced opportunities to harness social capital. Although my focus is on ECOs in Perth, the implications of findings of this thesis are equally pertinent to similar community organisations across Australia and abroad.
