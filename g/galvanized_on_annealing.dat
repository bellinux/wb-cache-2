40|$|The {{behaviour}} of FeAl during disordering on milling and re-ordering <b>on</b> <b>annealing</b> {{has been}} extensively studied and characterised. The mechanisms by which changes occur are not, however, well established. The role of defects created during milling on bringing about disorder is not clear; neither {{is the importance of}} their movement and annihilation during re-ordering. The structures of FeAl samples given a variety of thermal and mechanical pre-treatments have been examined here, as well as their behaviour <b>on</b> <b>annealing.</b> Three material preparations have been examined to distinguish the separate roles of vacancies and dislocations, with their associated APB faults, on disordering and re-ordering. Samples quenched from high temperature have large numbers of thermal vacancies: they show low temperature recovery as local atomic movement and re-ordering takes place, but full recovery by long range point defect movement is only possible at high temperatures. Heavily deformed samples recover at very low temperatures by easy dislocation glide and APB annihilation, with higher temperature recovery occurring by dislocation cross slip, reactions and decompositions. Deformation-induced disordering, and reordering <b>on</b> <b>annealing,</b> can largely be described through the large density of APBs, with each fault representing a thin plane of disorder. Lightly milled powder samples behave similarly to the deformed samples, with simultaneous dislocation recovery and re-ordering occurring <b>on</b> <b>annealing,</b> but after large amounts of milling dislocation movement is difficult and recovery is delayed to higher temperatures where diffusional mechanisms can assist.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{galvanized}} piping replaced previously-used cast iron and lead in cold-water plumbing. Typically, galvanized piping rusts {{from the inside}} out, building up layers of plaque {{on the inside of}} the piping, causing both water pressure problems and eventual pipe failure. These plaques can flake off, leading to visible impurities in water and a slight metallic taste. The life expectancy of galvanized piping is about 70 years, but it may vary by region due to impurities in the water supply and the proximity of electrical grids for which interior piping acts as a pathway (the flow of electricity can accelerate chemical corrosion). Pipe longevity also depends on the thickness of zinc in the original <b>galvanizing,</b> which ranges <b>on</b> a scale from G40 to G210, and whether the pipe was <b>galvanized</b> <b>on</b> both the inside and outside, or just the outside.|$|R
