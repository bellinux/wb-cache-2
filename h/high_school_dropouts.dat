40|$|There {{has been}} a growing amount of {{attention}} being paid {{to the area of}} <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> because a student's decision to leave school does not solely affect him or her; it has far reaching affects on society as well. The {{purpose of this study was}} to look at the available research associated with <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> and specifically the relationship between athletic participation and <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout.</b> A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine several aspects associated with <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> and its relationship with athletic participation. The study focused on the following areas: current theories pertaining to <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout,</b> the prevalence rates of <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> in the United States, the antecedents associated with the decision to withdraw from <b>high</b> <b>school,</b> the consequences ofdropping out ofhigh school, and the effects of athletic participation on <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout.</b> A review of the existing research found that athletic participation has a positive intervening effect that addresses the <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> issue. Participation in athletics provides a student with a positive and voluntary connection to the school and also offers access to an established social group within the school. The research indicated that this decreases the likelihood a student will withdraw from school. This study was conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of the <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> problem facing <b>schools</b> today. As a result, recommendations are provided to assist educators and parents who work with students that are likely to withdraw from school. i...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To study {{associations}} between pain, {{the use of}} analgesics, reduction in spare time activities and school absence because of pain among 15 - 16 -year-olds in Norway and <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> five years later. Background: Most Norwegian 15 - 16 -year-olds report that they have good health, but pain among adolescents is common and identified as an important health problem. The use of over-the-counter analgesics has increased, also among adolescents. <b>High</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> is a challenge for the society and put young people at risk for later work marginalization and social exclusion. The etiology is multifactorial and dependent of variables like gender, grades, ethnicity and the parents socioeconomic status. The role of pain and its associations with <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> have not been studied before. Method: 14063 Norwegian 15 - 16 -year-olds from six different counties completed a questionnaire and were followed up for five years. Logistic regression was used to compute ORs for <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout.</b> Results: 15 - 16 -year-olds who reported pain, frequent use of analgesics, experienced reduced spare time activities and had school absence because of pain, had higher odds of <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> five years later. Moderate use of over-the counter analgesics implied lower odds of <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout.</b> Conclusion: Pain, loss of function related to pain and pain-related school absence during adolescence may affect the ability to complete <b>high</b> <b>school.</b> Frequent use of analgesics may be a separate risk factor for <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout,</b> possibly indicating underlying factors which affects <b>high</b> <b>school</b> completion...|$|R

We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and risk differences of <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout,</b> both in the whole population and among siblings within families differentially exposed to health problems. Results All explored health dimensions were strongly associated with <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>dropout.</b> In models adjusted for parental socioeconomic status, the risk differences of <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> according to health exposures varied between 3. 6 % (95 % CI 1. 7 to 5. 5) for having ≥ 1 somatic disease versus none and 11. 7 % (6. 3 to 17. 0) for being obese versus normal weight.
