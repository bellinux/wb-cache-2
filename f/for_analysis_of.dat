Drosophila melanogaster and the Galleria mellonella waxworm have been particularly important <b>for</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> virulence traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput.|$|E

25|$|The {{first step}} of all {{molecular}} genetic analyses is the preparation and/or preservation of a sample. In the case of AM fungi, samples typically {{come in the form}} of soil or roots that will contain AM spores, hyphae and/or various AM colonization structures. Sample preservation will vary depending on the desired analysis (DNA or RNA). <b>For</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> DNA, samples should either be processed immediately or kept frozen prior to nucleic acid extraction. <b>For</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> RNA, samples should be cryogenically frozen (−196°C) almost immediately upon collection, or stored in an RNA stabilization and preservation reagent (e.g. RNAlater). The next step is to extract the desired nucleic acids from the sample, which can be performed manually using various published extraction methods or by using one of the many commercially available DNA/RNA extraction kits. Due to the labile nature of RNA, synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) using extracted RNA as a template is performed for further analysis. For most molecular genetic sequencing methods of AM fungi a PCR step is required to increase the total amount of target DNA/RNA/cDNA. There are many PCR conditions proposed <b>for</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> AM fungi and some of the most accessible are briefly summarized below.|$|E
