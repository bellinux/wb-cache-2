5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a <b>drug-eluting</b> stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>drug-eluting</b> stents {{continue}} {{to represent a}} major medical advance for angioplasty, evidence has always shown new clot thrombosis formation with stents to be a problem, thus clotting suppressant agents are routinely given during placement, and anticlotting agents should be continued; the question is for how long. Coronary arterial healing occurs after the placement of a <b>drug-eluting</b> stent, but complete healing of the vessel takes time. For <b>drug-eluting</b> stents, {{the time course of}} complete healing in humans is unknown.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 2004, <b>drug-eluting</b> stents {{were used}} in nearly 80 percent of all {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions.|$|E
25|$|To {{further reduce}} the {{incidence}} of restenosis, <b>drug-eluting</b> stents (DES) were introduced which consisted of stents coated in anti proliferative agents. Animal studies and later clinical trials showed a reduction in restenosis to approximately 5%.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} with over 6000 patients showed that {{coronary artery bypass}} was associated with lower risk for major adverse cardiac events compared to <b>drug-eluting</b> stenting. However, patients had {{a higher risk of}} stroke events.|$|E
25|$|<b>Drug-eluting</b> stents {{generally}} {{consist of}} three parts - the stent platform, a polymer coating that binds {{the drug to}} the stent and releases drug (although stents have been tested that do without a coating), and the drug.|$|E
25|$|The SYNTAX {{trial was}} a {{randomized}} controlled trial of 1800 patients with multivessel coronary disease, comparing CABG versus PCI using <b>drug-eluting</b> stents (DES). The {{study found that}} rates of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events at 12 months were significantly higher in the DES group (17.8% versus 12.4% for CABG; P=0.002). This was primarily driven by higher need for repeat revascularization procedures in the PCI group with no difference in repeat infarctions or survival. Higher rates of strokes were seen in the CABG group.|$|E
25|$|An implant {{is a kind}} {{of medical}} device made to replace and act as a missing {{biological}} structure (as compared with a transplant, which indicates transplanted biomedical tissue). The surface of implants that contact the body might be made of a biomedical material such as titanium, silicone or apatite depending on what is the most functional. In some cases, implants contain electronics, e.g. artificial pacemakers and cochlear implants. Some implants are bioactive, such as subcutaneous drug delivery devices in the form of implantable pills or <b>drug-eluting</b> stents.|$|E
2500|$|Whether <b>drug-eluting</b> stents are {{at higher}} risk than bare-metal stents for late {{thrombosis}} is intensely debated. [...] In meta-analyses of the sirolimus- and paclitaxel-eluting stent trials, a small but statistically higher risk of thrombosis was shown after the first year, compared to bare-metal stents. [...] Late stent thrombosis often causes myocardial infarction and sometimes death. [...] In other analyses, the late thrombosis risk is offset by <b>drug-eluting</b> stents' markedly reduced risk of restenosis and its complications including myocardial infarction. A meta-analysis concluded the mortality risk associated with <b>drug-eluting</b> and bare-metal stents is similar.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{concern has}} been {{expressed}} about overzealous use of stents in general. Two studies found about half of patients received stents for unapproved reasons, with worse outcomes for the patients in both studies. [...] More recent data suggest off-label use of both bare-metal stents and <b>drug-eluting</b> stents have increased risks. [...] However, <b>drug-eluting</b> stents seemed to have similar or improved rates of death or MI compared with bare-metal stents, and consistently reduced need for target vessel revascularization. [...] Overall, the data {{support the use of}} [...] <b>drug-eluting</b> stents for off-label indications.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Drug-eluting</b> stents {{also have}} been shown to be {{superior}} to bare-metal stents in reducing short-term complications of stenting in saphenous vein grafts; however, use in these bypass grafts is an example of an [...] "off-label" [...] use of <b>drug-eluting</b> stents. [...] That is, this application has not been sufficiently examined by the Food and Drug Administration for that agency to recommend the use. [...] For [...] "on-label" [...] applications, the FDA [...] "believes that coronary <b>drug-eluting</b> stents remain safe and effective when used for the FDA-approved indications. These devices have significantly reduced the need for a second surgery to treat restenosis for thousands of patients each year." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Drug-eluting</b> stents [...] {{in current}} {{clinical}} use {{were approved by}} the FDA after clinical trials showed they were statistically superior to bare-metal stents [...] {{for the treatment of}} native coronary artery narrowings, having lower rates of major adverse cardiac events [...] (usually defined as a composite clinical endpoint of death + myocardial infarction + repeat intervention because of restenosis). The first <b>drug-eluting</b> stents to be approved in Europe and the U.S. were coated with paclitaxel or an mTOR inhibitor, such as sirolimus.|$|E
2500|$|Though less {{frequent}} with <b>drug-eluting</b> stents, neointimal proliferation can still occur in DES and cause restenosis. Stent occlusion because of thrombosis may occur during the procedure, {{in the following}} days, or later. [...] The presence of thrombi around the stent may, in turn, affect the <b>drug-eluting</b> performance of the stent. [...] Treatment with the antiplatelet drugs aspirin and clopidogrel {{appears to be the}} most important factor reducing this risk of thrombosis, and early cessation of one or both of these drugs after <b>drug-eluting</b> stenting markedly increases the risk of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction. A recent histopathology study showed very late DES thrombosis is associated with histopathological signs of inflammation and intravascular ultrasound evidence of vessel remodeling. Compared with other causes of myocardial infarction, eosinophilic infiltrates are more common in thrombi harvested from very late DES thrombosis and correlate with the extent of stent malapposition.|$|E
2500|$|Trials of heparin-coated stents {{could not}} match the {{significant}} decrease in restenosis rates seen with the Cypher and Taxus stents. [...] With the increased supply in the chemotherapeutic <b>drug-eluting</b> stents available, the use of heparin-coated stents waned.|$|E
2500|$|Like all {{invasive}} medical procedures, implanting stents in the {{coronary arteries}} carries risk. [...] For the newer <b>drug-eluting</b> stents, very-long-term {{results are not}} yet available; however, five years after implantation, sirolimus-eluting stents remained superior to bare-metal stents.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>drug-eluting</b> stent (DES) is a {{peripheral}} or coronary stent (a scaffold) placed into narrowed, diseased peripheral or coronary arteries that slowly releases {{a drug to}} block cell proliferation. This prevents fibrosis that, together with clots (thrombi), could otherwise block the stented artery, a process called restenosis. [...] The stent is usually placed within the peripheral or coronary artery by an interventional cardiologist or interventional radiologist during an angioplasty procedure.|$|E
2500|$|A stent is {{a foreign}} {{object in the}} body, and the body {{responds}} to the stent’s presence {{in a variety of}} ways. [...] Macrophages accumulate around the stent, and nearby smooth muscle cells proliferate. [...] These physiological changes, which can cause restenosis, are limited by the drugs released by the stent, but these drugs also limit formation of a new endothelial layer over the new stent to inhibit clot formation. Endothelialization is a hallmark of vascular healing and is important for the prevention of thrombus formation. Lack of healing caused by antiproliferative drugs can make the stent an exposed surface on which a clot, sometimes life-threatening, can form. For <b>drug-eluting</b> stents (which, by design, delay formation of a new endothelium cover over the stent), the incidence of clot formation within the stent may persist {{for a longer period of}} time, perhaps as long as five years after treatment. <b>Drug-eluting</b> stents have been associated with delayed arterial healing and the prevalence of latent thrombus after five years, suggesting patients may continue to be at risk for stent thrombosis for an extended period of time.|$|E
2500|$|Clinical {{trials have}} shown the {{benefits}} of coronary stenting with bare-metal stents over other methods of angioplasty, including balloon angioplasty and atherectomy. [...] <b>Drug-eluting</b> stents (DES) have also been extensively studied, and are generally superior to bare-metal stents with respect to occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE, generally defined as death, myocardial infarction, or {{the need for a}} repeat revascularization procedure). Stents are indicated to improve the diameter of the coronary artery lumen, when narrowing (generally because of atherosclerosis) causes ischemia (reduced oxygen delivery to the muscle supplied by that artery).|$|E
2500|$|One {{to three}} or more layers of polymer {{can be used in}} the coating, e.g., a base layer for adhesion, a main layer that holds and elutes (releases) the drug into the {{arterial}} wall by contact transfer, and sometimes a top coat to slow down the release of the drug and extend its effect. The first few <b>drug-eluting</b> stents to be licensed used durable coatings. [...] The first generation coatings appear to have caused immunological reactions at times and some possibly led to thrombosis, which has driven experimentation and development of new coating approaches.|$|E
2500|$|Other studies, {{including}} the ARTS II registry, suggest [...] <b>drug-eluting</b> stenting is not inferior to coronary bypass {{for treatment of}} multiple-vessel coronary disease. The ARTS II registry compared a cohort of patients treated with multiple-vessel stenting with DES, to the historical CABG cohort in the ARTS I trial (itself a randomized comparison between multiple-vessel bare-metal stenting vs. CABG.) At three-year follow-up, major adverse cardiac events were comparable between the ARTS II DES group and the ARTS I CABG group. Reintervention was lower in the ARTS I CABG group.|$|E
2500|$|Coronary artery {{bypass graft}} surgery {{is the best}} {{treatment}} for some patients. [...] Differences between outcomes with stenting and with coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) are a point of controversy. A recent study comparing the outcomes of all patients in New York state treated with CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) demonstrated CABG was superior to PCI with DES in multiple vessel [...] coronary artery disease [...] [...] Patients treated with CABG had lower rates of death and of death or myocardial infarction than treatment with a <b>drug-eluting</b> stent. [...] Patients undergoing CABG also had lower rates of repeat revascularization.|$|E
2500|$|Though it {{occurred}} less frequently than with balloon angioplasty or other techniques, stents nonetheless remained vulnerable to restenosis, caused almost exclusively by neointimal tissue growth. To address this issue, developers of <b>drug-eluting</b> stents used the devices {{themselves as a}} tool for delivering medication directly to the arterial wall. [...] While initial efforts were unsuccessful, the release (elution) of drugs with certain specific physicochemical properties from the stent was shown in 2001 to achieve high concentrations of the drug locally, directly at the target lesion, with minimal systemic side effects. [...] As currently used in clinical practice, [...] "drug-eluting" [...] stents refers to metal stents that elute a drug designed to limit the growth of neointimal scar tissue, thus reducing the likelihood of stent restenosis.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the results}} of the first trials of <b>drug-eluting</b> stents were published, there was a general feeling in the interventional {{cardiology}} community that these devices would be part of the perfect revascularization regimen for coronary artery disease. [...] With the very low restenosis rates of the RAVEL and SIRIUS trials, interventions were performed on more complex blockages in the coronary arteries, under the assumption that the results in real life would mimic the results in the trials. [...] The antiplatelet regimens that were advised for the drug eluting stents were based on the early trials of these stents. [...] Based on these trials, the antiplatelet regimen was a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for 3 months when Cypher stents were used, and 9 months when Taxus stents were used, followed by aspirin indefinitely.|$|E
2500|$|At {{approximately}} the same time, Cordis (a division of Johnson & Johnson) was developing the Cypher stent, a stent that would release sirolimus (a chemotherapeutic agent) over time. [...] The first study of these individuals revealed an incredible lack of restenosis (zero percent restenosis) at six months. [...] This led to the approval for the stent {{to be used in}} Europe in April 2002. [...] Further trials with the Cypher stent revealed that restenosis did occur in some individuals with high risk features (such as long areas of stenosis or a history of diabetes mellitus), but that the restenosis rate was significantly lower than with bare metal stents (3.2 percent compared to 35.4 percent). [...] About a year after approval in Europe, the United States FDA approved the use of the Cypher stent as the first <b>drug-eluting</b> stent for use in the general population in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Interventional {{procedures}} have {{been plagued by}} restenosis due {{to the formation of}} endothelial tissue overgrowth at the lesion site. [...] Restenosis is the body's response to the injury of the vessel wall from angioplasty and to the stent as a foreign body. [...] As assessed in clinical trials during the late 1980 and 1990s, using only balloon angioplasty (POBA, plain old balloon angioplasty), up to 50% of patients suffered significant restenosis; but that percentage has dropped to the single to lower two digit range with the introduction of <b>drug-eluting</b> stents. [...] Sirolimus, paclitaxel, and everolimus are the three drugs used in coatings which are currently FDA approved in the United States. [...] As opposed to bare metal, drug eluting stents are covered with a medicine that is slowly dispersed with the goal of suppressing the restenosis reaction. [...] The key to the success of drug coating has been (a) choosing effective agents, (b) developing ways of adequately binding the drugs to the stainless surface of the stent struts (the coating must stay bound despite marked handling and stent deformation stresses), and (c) developing coating controlled release mechanisms that release the drug slowly over about 30 days. [...] One of the newest innovations in coronary stents is the development of a dissolving stent. [...] Abbott Laboratories has used a dissolvable material, polylactic acid, that will completely absorb within 2 years of being implanted.|$|E
