One unsolved aspect of qualia {{is the concept of}} the fundamental information involved in creating the experience. He does not address a position on the metaphysics of the information underlying the experience of qualia, nor does he state what information actually is. However, Orpwood does suggest that information in general is of two types: the information structure and <b>information</b> <b>message.</b> Information structures are defined by the physical vehicles and structural, biological patterns encoding information. That encoded information is the information message; a source describing what that information is. The neural mechanism or network receives input information structures, completes a designated instructional task (firing of the neuron or network), and outputs a modified information structure to downstream regions. The <b>information</b> <b>message</b> is the purpose and meaning of the information structure and causally exists {{as a result of that}} particular information structure. Modification of the information structure changes the meaning of the <b>information</b> <b>message,</b> but the message itself cannot be directly altered.|$|E

This form of local feedback continuously cycles part of the networks output structures as its next input information structure.

As the network of mechanisms cannot recognize the <b>information</b> <b>message,</b> but only the input information structure, the network is unaware that it is representing its own previous outputs. The neural mechanisms are merely completing their instructional tasks and outputting any recognizable information structures. Orpwood proposes that these local networks come into an attractor state that consistently outputs exactly the same information structure as the input structure. Instead of only representing the <b>information</b> <b>message</b> derived from the input structure, the network will now represent its own output and thereby its own <b>information</b> <b>message.</b> As the input structures are fed-back, the network identifies the previous information structure as being a previous representation of the <b>information</b> <b>message.</b> As Orpwood states, ...|$|E
2500|$|Representation of the {{networks}} own output structures, by which represents its own <b>information</b> <b>message,</b> is Orpwood's explanation that grounds the manifestation of qualia via neurobiological mechanisms. These mechanisms are particular to [...] networks of pyramidal neurons. Although computational neuroscience still has much to investigate regarding pyramidal neurons, their complex circuitry is relatively unique. Research shows that the complexity of pyramidal neuron networks {{is directly related to}} the increase in the functional capabilities of a species. When human pyramidal networks are compared with other primate species and species with less intricate behavioral and social interactions, the complexity of these neural networks drastically decline. The complexity of these networks are also increased in frontal brain regions. These regions are often associated with conscious assessment and modification of one's immediate environment; often referred to as executive functions. Sensory input is necessary to gain information from the environment, and perception of that input is necessary for navigating and modifying interactions with the environment. This suggests that frontal regions containing more complex pyramidal networks are associated with an increased perceptive capacity. As perception is necessary for conscious thought to occur, and since the experience of qualia is derived from consciously recognizing some perception, qualia may indeed be specific to the functional capacity of pyramidal networks. This derives Orpwood's notion that the mechanisms of re-entrant feedback may not only create qualia, but also be the foundation to consciousness.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- It {{has been}} shown that the {{standardized}} hash-algorithms SHA- 1, RIPEMD- 160, MD- 5 and others of that type have substantial performance restrictions due to their sequential structure. Modified variants of hash-algorithms are suggested which make it possible to independently calculate partial hashsignatures while maintaining the irreversibility level of the standard algorithms. These variants give new opportunities for wide parallel calculation of hash-signatures. In fact, applying the suggested modified algorithms remove the performance restrictions affiliated with the calculation an <b>information</b> <b>message’s</b> hash-signatures. In practice, the hash-algorithms suggested may be used for integrity and authentication of <b>information</b> <b>messages</b> in computer network.
