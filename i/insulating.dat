5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} {{typically have}} high melting and boiling points, and are hard and brittle. As solids {{they are almost}} always electrically <b>insulating,</b> but when melted or dissolved they become highly conductive, because the ions are mobilized.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, their {{volatile}} composition {{means that}} as they repeatedly approach the Sun, radiation gradually boils the volatiles off until the comet splits or develops an <b>insulating</b> crust that prevents further outgassing.|$|E
40|$|A newly {{designed}} <b>insulated</b> constrictor nozzle, which was equipped the <b>insulated</b> constrictor section {{composed of the}} mutually <b>insulated</b> several water-cooled disks, {{was used to examine}} the constriction effect on the forced elongated arc. The arc voltage-current characteristics of the elongated arc was a rising characteristics. When the length of the <b>insulated</b> constrictor section was increased, the electric field intensity of the elongated arc was decreased at the outlet region of the <b>insulated</b> constrictor section and the heat loss of the <b>insulated</b> constrictor was increased with increasing distance from the <b>insulated</b> constrictor inlet. The thermal efficiency of the <b>insulated</b> constrictor section was 74 ～ 94 % and was higher than that of the plasma jet generator...|$|R
5000|$|Described by {{developers}} as “green building”, <b>insulated</b> siding {{may be used}} by {{homeowners to}} make homes more environmentally friendly. By reducing energy consumption, <b>insulated</b> siding can reduce air pollution. <b>Insulated</b> siding has an industry system R-value range of 2.0 - 5.5. According to manufacturers, <b>insulated</b> siding is manufactured to last for 50 years or more, potentially reducing landfill contributions.|$|R

5|$|Cape sparrows {{prefer to}} roost in nests, and while {{wandering}} {{outside of the}} breeding season, birds in uncultivated areas roost socially in old nests or dense bushes. In farmland and towns, Cape sparrows build special nests for roosting, lined more poorly than breeding nests but incorporating a greater quantity of <b>insulating</b> material.|$|E
5|$|Hexagonal BN {{is used in}} xerographic {{process and}} laser {{printers}} as a charge leakage barrier layer of the photo drum. In the automotive industry, h-BN mixed with a binder (boron oxide) is used for sealing oxygen sensors, which provide feedback for adjusting fuel flow. The binder utilizes the unique temperature stability and <b>insulating</b> properties of h-BN.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, {{plus the}} noble gases are collectively {{referred}} to as the elemental gases. These elements are gaseous at standard temperature and pressure (STP). They are also distinguished by having the lowest densities, lowest melting and boiling points, strongest <b>insulating</b> properties, and highest electronegativity and ionization energy values in the periodic table.|$|E
50|$|<b>Insulated</b> {{neighborhoods are}} defined as {{chromosome}} loops that are formed by CTCF homodimers, co-bound with cohesin, and containing at least one gene. The CTCF/cohesin-bound regions delimiting an <b>insulated</b> neighborhood are called “anchors.” One study in human Embryonic stem cells identified ~13,000 <b>insulated</b> neighborhoods that, on average, each contained three genes and was about 90kb in size. Two lines of evidence argue that the boundaries of <b>insulated</b> neighborhoods are insulating: 1) the vast majority (~90-97%) of enhancer-gene interactions are contained within <b>insulated</b> neighborhoods and 2) genetic perturbation of CTCF/cohesin-bound <b>insulated</b> neighborhood anchors leads to local gene dysregulation due to novel interactions outside of the neighborhood.|$|R
50|$|Genetic and {{epigenetic}} variation of <b>insulated</b> neighborhood anchors {{have been linked}} to several human diseases. One study of a genetic variant linked to asthma disrupts CTCF binding and <b>insulated</b> neighborhood formation. Studies of imprinted loci showed DNA methylation controls CTCF-anchored loops regulating gene expression. Individuals with methylation aberrations at an imprinted CTCF-binding site near IGF2/H19 form aberrant <b>Insulated</b> Neighborhoods and develop Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (when both alleles have the paternal type of <b>insulated</b> neighborhood) or Silver-Russell syndrome (when both alleles have the maternal type of <b>insulated</b> neighborhood).|$|R

5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the <b>insulating</b> blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly <b>insulating</b> layer of snow.|$|E
5|$|Under high {{pressures}} helium {{can form}} compounds with various other elements. Helium-nitrogen clathrate (He(N2)11) crystals have been grown {{at room temperature}} at pressures ca. 10 GPa in a diamond anvil cell. The <b>insulating</b> electride Na2He {{has been shown to}} be thermodynamically stable at pressures above 113 GPa. It has a fluorite structure.|$|E
5|$|Wet {{deposits}} of ash on high voltage insulators can initiate a leakage current (small amount of current flow across the insulator surface) which, if sufficient current is achieved, can cause ‘flashover’ (the unintended electrical discharge around {{or over the}} surface of an <b>insulating</b> material).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an alternative technology for storing hydrogen fuel onboard automobiles. <b>Insulated</b> pressure vessels are cryogenic-capable pressure vessels that can accept cryogenic liquid fuel, cryogenic compressed gas or compressed gas at ambient temperature. <b>Insulated</b> pressure vessels offer advantages over conventional H{sub 2 } storage approaches. <b>Insulated</b> pressure vessels are more compact and require less carbon fiber than GH{sub 2 } vessels. They have lower evaporative losses than LH{sub 2 } tanks, and are much lighter than metal hydrides. After outlining the advantages of hydrogen fuel and <b>insulated</b> pressure vessels, the paper {{describes the}} experimental and analytical work conducted to verify that <b>insulated</b> pressure vessels can be used safely for vehicular H{sub 2 } storage. The paper describes tests that have been conducted to evaluate the safety of <b>insulated</b> pressure vessels. <b>Insulated</b> pressure vessels have successfully completed a series of DOT, ISO and SAE certification tests. A draft procedure for <b>insulated</b> pressure vessel certification has been generated to assist in a future commercialization of this technology. An <b>insulated</b> pressure vessel has been installed in a hydrogen fueled truck and it is currently being subjected to extensive testing...|$|R

50|$|Somatic {{mutations}} that alter <b>insulated</b> neighborhood anchors {{can contribute}} to tumorigenesis. Chromosomal alterations such as translocations, deletions and tandem duplications intersecting with <b>insulated</b> neighborhood anchor sites can activate oncogenes. Epigenetic dysregulation can also contribute to tumorigenesis by altering <b>insulated</b> neighborhoods. IDH-mutant gliomas display altered DNA methylation patterns, so CTCF binding, which is DNA methylation-dependent, is also altered. Altered CTCF-binding disrupts <b>insulated</b> neighborhoods {{and can lead to}} oncogene misregulation.|$|R
5|$|According {{to their}} shared {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless <b>insulating</b> gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E
5|$|For the Americans, Laos {{became almost}} {{exclusively}} an air war, one which saw {{a reversal of}} the role it played in the conflict in neighboring South Vietnam. In Laos, the Air Force applied conventional air power in the support of an unconventional ground war. The mission of the U.S. Air Force was to seal off the southern Mekong River Valley, thus providing a buffer for Thailand; <b>insulating</b> the Vientiane government from direct communist threat; draining PAVN manpower and resources; and interdiction of the approaches to the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E
5|$|In {{cold water}} diving, where a diver wearing a highly buoyant {{thermally}} <b>insulating</b> dive suit {{has a large}} excess of buoyancy, steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders. They also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of steel cylinders can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by the diver.|$|E
40|$|<b>Insulated</b> {{pressure}} vessels are cryogenic-capable {{pressure vessels}} {{that can be}} fueled with liquid hydrogen (LIQ) or ambient-temperature compressed hydrogen (CH 2). <b>Insulated</b> pressure vessels offer the advantages of liquid hydrogen tanks (low weight and volume), with reduced disadvantages (lower energy requirement for hydrogen liquefaction and reduced evaporative losses). This paper shows {{an evaluation of the}} applicability of the <b>insulated</b> pressure vessels for light-duty vehicles. The paper shows an evaluation of evaporative losses and insulation requirements and a description of the current experimental plans for testing <b>insulated</b> pressure vessels. The results show significant advantages to the use of <b>insulated</b> pressure vessels for light-duty vehicles...|$|R

50|$|A {{switchgear}} may be {{a simple}} open-air isolator switch {{or it may be}} <b>insulated</b> by some other substance. An effective although more costly form of switchgear is the gas-insulated switchgear (GIS), where the conductors and contacts are <b>insulated</b> by pressurized sulfur hexafluoride gas (SF6). Other common types are oil or vacuum <b>insulated</b> switchgear.|$|R

The specially designed lighting, the clear tempered glass, the <b>insulating</b> glass, and the truss system emphasize {{the functions of the}} space and bring a bright look to the building. The 6-meter tall lobby on the ground floor is connected by the escalators coming up from the entrance hall and the platforms built underground.|$|E
5|$|Reversible pulpitis is {{characterized}} by short-lasting pain triggered by cold and sometimes heat. The symptoms of reversible pulpitis may disappear, either because the noxious stimulus is removed, such as when dental decay is removed and a filling placed, or because new layers of dentin (tertiary dentin) have been produced inside the pulp chamber, <b>insulating</b> against the stimulus. Irreversible pulpitis causes spontaneous or lingering pain in response to cold.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{nonmetals}} {{exist as}} diatomic molecules in their standard states: hydrogen (H2); nitrogen (N2); oxygen (O2); fluorine (F2); chlorine (Cl2); bromine (Br2); and iodine (I2). They are generally highly <b>insulating,</b> highly electronegative, non-reflective gases, noting that bromine, a liquid, and iodine, a solid, are both volatile at room temperature. Exceptions to this generalised description {{occur at the}} boundaries of the category: hydrogen has a comparatively low electronegativity due to its unique atomic structure; iodine, in crystalline form, is semi-lustrous, and a semiconductor in the direction of its layers, both of these attributes being consistent with incipient metallic character.|$|E
50|$|<b>Insulated</b> {{shipping}} containers are {{a type of}} packaging used to ship temperature sensitive {{products such}} as foods, pharmaceuticals, organs, blood, biologic materials, and chemicals.

50|$|Initial {{versions}} of <b>insulated</b> vinyl siding were field-tested in Georgia. Between 1993 and 1997, design and process solutions {{were developed to}} improve the functionality and durability of the product. In 1997, one vinyl siding manufacturer launched the first full-scale commercialization of <b>insulated</b> vinyl siding. Between 1998 and 2003, most other vinyl siding manufacturers launched their own brands of <b>insulated</b> siding. Since 2003, product development and product line extensions have allowed <b>insulated</b> siding to experience consistent growth and recognition as a premium residential cladding.|$|R

5|$|Snow affects such human {{activities}} as transportation: creating {{the need for}} keeping roadways, wings, and windows clear; agriculture: providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock; such sports as skiing, snowboarding, snowmachine travel; and warfare: impairing target acquisition, degrading the performance of combatants and materiel, and impeding mobility. Snow affects ecosystems, as well, by providing an <b>insulating</b> layer during winter under which plants and animals are able to survive the cold.|$|E
5|$|The exact mass-luminosity {{relationship}} {{depends on}} how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher opacity has an <b>insulating</b> effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star {{does not need to}} produce as much energy to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium. By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn more fuel to remain in equilibrium. Note, however, that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via convection, which changes the conditions needed to remain in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|The flowers provide dyes {{of bright}} yellow or green, {{and have been}} used for hair dye. The dried leaves and hair were made into candle wicks, or put into shoes to help with <b>insulating</b> them. The dried stems were also dipped into suet or wax to make torches. Due to its weedy capacities, the plant, unlike other species of the genus (such as V.phoeniceum), is not often cultivated.|$|E
50|$|Callender's, {{originally}} an importer and refiner of bitumen {{for road}} construction, began manufacturing <b>insulated</b> cables in the 1880s at their Erith {{site on the}} Thames.
