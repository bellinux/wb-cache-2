5|$|During mid-1997, Jackson and Walsh {{began writing}} with Stephen Sinclair. Sinclair's partner, Philippa Boyens, {{was a major}} fan {{of the book and}} joined the writing team after reading their treatment. It took 13–14 months to write the two film scripts, which were 147 and 144 pages respectively. Sinclair left the project due to {{theatrical}} obligations. Amongst their revisions, Sam is caught eavesdropping and forced to go along with Frodo, instead of Sam, Merry, and Pippin figuring out about the One Ring themselves and voluntarily going along after confronting Frodo about it, as occurs in the original novel. Gandalf's account of his time at Orthanc was pulled out of flashback and Lothlórien was cut, with Galadriel <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does in the story at Rivendell. Denethor attends the Council with his son. Other changes included having Arwen rescue Frodo, and the action sequence involving the cave troll. The writers also considered having Arwen absorb Éowyn's role entirely by having her kill the Witch-king.|$|E

Hester was {{rejected}} by the villagers even though she spent her life <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> could to help the sick and the poor. Because of the social shunning, she spent her life mostly in solitude, and wouldn't go to church.|$|E

On a June 22, 1989, {{appearance}} on The Tonight Show, Johnny Carson asked Manilow about the headline story. Manilow replied {{that he was just}} friends with Byrd, an innocent picture had been taken, {{and that there was no}} truth to the supposed engagement. After he met Byrd, his band gave him a videotape of Debbie Does Dallas as a present for his birthday. Manilow told Carson that he could not watch his friend <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does in that movie.|$|E

[...] Kim, the show's musical director described the idea of the intimate concert, [...] "This project is the most mature project for Beyoncé, because {{to be able to be}} in an intimate setting like this like the Roseland, which is a historic place, it's an amazing thing. I think the challenge of it is to be able to present your whole album as its own concept, as its own piece and it's a great way to educate the people about what this album means to her; It's for her, it's for the fans, it's for anybody." ...|$|E

500|$|Meredith is {{the narrator}} of the show and serves as the focal point for most episodes. Pompeo's {{connection}} with Patrick Dempsey (Derek Shepherd) is acclaimed as a high point of the series. Rhimes has characterized Meredith as not believing in good or bad, but instead <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thinks is right. Grey has been positively received by television critics, with Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times referring to her as [...] "the heroine of Grey's Anatomy". News of Pompeo leaving arose when it was made clear that her contract ended after the eighth season, {{and whether or not}} she would return to the series after her contract expires has been the centre of media speculation ever since. In 2016, Pompeo re-negotiated her contract and signed up for the thirteenth season of the show.|$|E
500|$|Angel is {{the student}} council {{president}} at the afterlife school. This places her {{at odds with the}} SSS as her responsibilities require her to suppress delinquency and other disruptive activities that the team does. The SSS initially calls her [...] "Angel" [...] since they do not know her real name, but they still refer to her by it even after finding out her real name to be Kanade Tachibana. It is difficult to understand what she is thinking due to her rarely showing any outward emotions and her way of talking bluntly. She is personally dedicated to helping others overcome their regrets and pass on. However, she often lacks a proper understanding of others, as she never thinks to try to explain to the SSS why she was <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did. She enjoys eating mapo doufu, a spicy dish.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke {{felt that}} Ellen brought a [...] "maternal energy" [...] to the series, and {{described}} the character as [...] "a lioness, which is tough and badass and 'You touch my children, I will kill you.'" [...] Likewise, actress Samantha Ferris described her as a [...] "gun-toting, beer-slinging, bar-owning broad" [...] with a [...] "very maternal core". Ferris also feels that, despite Ellen having gone through a lot in her life, she is cautious rather than jaded, and is [...] "very protective {{of the things she}} has in her life", especially her daughter Jo and the Winchesters. Thus, her main concern is Jo's safety, which prompts her to forbid her daughter from going on hunts. When she realizes that she can no longer stop Jo from <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants, Ellen becomes her hunting partner, deciding it {{is the best way to}} look after her. By the time of Ellen's final appearance, actress Alona Tal came to view their characters more as equals rather than mother and daughter.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone, Mike Powell {{gave the}} track {{three and a}} half stars out of five. The {{reviewer}} mused it was [...] "effervescent", and said it was [...] "durable music", though noted it followed a formula [...] "as old as [...] is". A writer for the website Pretty Much Amazing classified the song's [...] "hooks" [...] as [...] "catchy-as-hell" [...] and the synthesizers as [...] "bouncy", and concluded the review by naming the song [...] "pop excellence". Digital Spy editor Lewis Corner opined that the song was [...] "very good" [...] and commented that [...] "the Peckham star is back <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does best, albeit slightly more polished around the edges". He finally wrote that [...] "the result is more than enough to keep our obsession rolling through yet another summer stretch".

500|$|Grey is {{the protagonist}} and {{focal point of}} the series.

Pompeo says she is unaware if her {{character}} knows how to have fun, adding: [...] "All of my scenes with [...] are the same—we're either breaking up or having sex." [...] Her personality has evolved over the past few seasons from depressed, to happy and [...] "fixed". Pompeo said to Good Morning America, [...] "I am so incredibly lucky to have Patrick , to have the chemistry that we do, we have an amazing relationship, and it's like any other relationship, you have your ups and downs. But we work it out, and we've found a way to do this for this long and still get along, and make it work and believe in what we're doing." [...] Pompeo told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "It's awkward with Patrick [...] because he's like my brother. As soon as the camera is off, I'm like, 'Is your hand on my butt?' But there are millions of girls who have been waiting for this, so I feel an obligation to the fans."

Kevin O'Donnell of Spin {{compared}} the [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] video to [...] "I'm Slave 4 U" [...] {{and added that}} it takes elements of classic Spears videos, such as [...] "scantily-clad dancers, tightly executed choreography, ridonkulously sequined outfits, and pouty, overly sincere close-ups of Spears" [...] and [...] "places them in an apocalyptic, end-of-days scenario." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV also highlighted the comparisons to [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U", explaining that [...] "the director's cut of the video is a sexy mash-up of Spears <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does best: groping half-naked guys, giving the camera bedroom eyes and being sassy {{in a number of}} leather jackets and skintight bodysuits." [...] Chris Gayomali of Time stated that the video [...] "s sweaty, at times blinding, yet undeniably enjoyable, adopting many of its key elements from Britney's coming-of-age 'I'm a Slave 4 U.'" [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone called it [...] "a good, memorable video." [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly said it [...] "is exactly what you’d expect for this song, and from Britney at this point in her career", and also complimented Spears for getting rid of the product placement in the [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] video.|$|E

500|$|From 1986 to 1992 Hill {{was one of}} the world's top sport climbers, {{winning over}} thirty {{international}} titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, [...] "at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). [...] "It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited to get to the top... I proved a point about women and what we're capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route." [...] As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.|$|E

[...] Danny Eccleston, in a review for Q, called it a [...] "brave, radical and punchy (at a {{refreshing}} 49 minutes in length) album". A retrospective review in Blender remarked: [...] "Her first 'headphones album'... It's more playful and less pompous than Ray of Light." [...] Rolling Stone stated that the album was a rough and improvised version of Ray of Light, but lauded that Madonna had chosen to make a more [...] "instinctive" [...] record than her previous endeavours. Mojo magazine said that [...] "Music is fitful and its charms aren't all immediate, but Madonna is still <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does best--giving a lick of pop genius to the unlikely genre of experimental dance music." [...] NME said that Music is [...] "vocodered, stretched, distorted, warped, deliberately upstaged by beats so showy they belong in a strip joint – quite simply, she's almost managed to make herself disappear. That bluntly explicit title isn't just pointless irony. This record is about the music, not Madonna; about the sounds, not the image." [...] Slant Magazine criticised Madonna's collaborations with William Orbit, {{who had worked with}} her on Ray of Light, calling them repetitive and uninteresting despite being catchy.
