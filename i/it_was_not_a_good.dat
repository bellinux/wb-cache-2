5|$|Over {{the field}} seasons of 1924 and 1925, Wheeler ran {{excavations}} of the Roman fort of Y Gaer near Brecon, a project aided {{by his wife}} and two archaeological students, Nowell Myres and Christopher Hawkes. During this project, he was visited by the prominent Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie and his wife Hilda Petrie; Wheeler greatly admired Petrie's emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies. Wheeler published the results of his excavation in The Roman Fort Near Brecon. He then began excavations at Isca Augusta, a Roman site in Caerleon, where he focused on revealing the Roman amphitheatre. Intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding, he contacted the press and organised a sponsorship of the excavation by the middle-market newspaper the Daily Mail. In doing so, he emphasised the folkloric and legendary associations that the site had with King Arthur. In 1925, Oxford University Press published Wheeler's first book for a general audience, Prehistoric and Roman Wales; he later expressed the opinion that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> book.|$|E
25|$|Pang De {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in chapter 58 as a trusted general under Ma Teng. At that time, Ma Teng had left Liang Province and travelled to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) while Ma Chao remained in the province. One night, Ma Chao had a dream about being attacked by a pack of tigers in a snowy land so he consulted his subordinates about it. Pang De told him that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> omen. Later, Ma Chao received news that his father Ma Teng was lured into a trap in Xu and {{had been killed by}} Cao Cao's men. This led to the Battle of Tong Pass, but in the novel, the order of events related to the battle had been reversed and some fictional stories were included.|$|E

25|$|Keeton {{was again}} Nottinghamshire's leading batsman in 1934, {{averaging}} more than 43 runs an innings, {{and his three}} centuries in the season included two double-centuries. Against Gloucestershire in June he scored 261, his highest score to that point, from a weak attack in which all players except the wicketkeeper bowled. Less than a month later he made 223 against Worcestershire. When {{a few days later}} Herbert Sutcliffe was forced through injury to stand down from the England team to play the Australians in the fourth Ashes Test at Leeds, Keeton was drafted in as his replacement for his Test debut. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> Test match for England: outplayed in all departments over four days, they saved the match through the intervention, when they were 165 runs behind with just four second-innings wickets remaining, of a thunderstorm which flooded the pitch, making further play impossible. No England batsman reached 50 in either innings, and Keeton, with scores of 25 and 12, like all his batting colleagues, got into double figures twice but not much further; by contrast, Bill Ponsford scored 181 and Don Bradman 304 for the Australians. Sutcliffe was recovered {{by the time of the}} fifth Test and resumed his place in the team at Keeton's expense.|$|E
500|$|With {{respect to}} infrageneric {{classification}} (i.e., taxonomic ranking {{below the level}} of genus) in Mycena, several characteristics suggest the mushroom fits best in Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus' section Fragilipedes: the ellipsoidal, amyloid spores; dextrinoid spore-bearing tissue; smooth cheilocystidia; gills with the edge the same colour as the face; and the non-slimy, distinctly coloured cap. According to the 1986 infrageneric classification proposed by Rolf Singer, the mushroom would be classified in subgenus Mycena, subsection Ciliatae, [...] Alcalina (roughly equivalent to section Fragilipedes of Maas Geesteranus) because of the amyloid spores, smooth, elongated cheilocystidia, dull-coloured pigment, and stem without either latex or a slimy sheath. Grgurinovic erected the new section Nargan to accommodate M.nargan, because its scales, lack of coarse fibrils {{at the base of the}} stem, and lack of [...] coating meant <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fit for section Fragilipedes.|$|E
500|$|In December 1952, on {{the advice}} of Smith's friend Roy Brook, who was in Bradford's second team, new Bradford City manager Ivor Powell invited Smith back to City for another trial and he played for the {{reserves}} against Gainsborough Trinity and Notts County. This time, Smith's trial was successful and Bradford City – still a Third Division North side – signed him on amateur forms. Smith had played only seven games for the reserves in the Midland League and was still unpaid when he was given his first-team debut against Scunthorpe United on 17 January 1953 coming into the side for Brendan McManus, whom Smith said was [...] "having a rough time". <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start for Smith, with City losing 4–0, but he followed this with a clean sheet in his second game against Stockport County and kept his place in the side {{for the remainder of the}} season, playing 19 games, before he signed part-time professional terms in July 1953. He had previously worked part-time as a lorry driver, earning £4 10s (£4.50) working 48 hours per week as a lorry driver, but the club did not want him driving around the country and offered him £10 per week plus a £4 win bonus. To supplement his playing contract, the club gave Smith a job looking after their Valley Parade ground.|$|E

Naomi continued to cause problems for Sonya and Toadie's marriage and when Sonya went away, Naomi decided to make her move.

500|$|Kindler wrote both {{parts of}} [...] "Sanctuary for All", as well [...] "Fata Morgana", [...] "Kush", [...] "The Five", [...] "Requiem", [...] "Instinct", {{and the second}} part of [...] "Revelations". He penned his scripts quickly, with [...] "Kush" [...] being written in three and a half days. Wood contributed to the story of [...] "Fata Morgana" [...] by {{bringing}} up the idea of incorporating the Morrígan from Irish mythology, which would start giving the season an ancient and mythological feel. [...] "Kush" [...] introduces a series of episodes involving the working relationship between Will and Magnus. [...] "The Five" [...] became {{a significant part of the}} series mythology, revealing the Five, which Magnus is a part of, how Magnus got her longevity, and that Henry Foss is actually part werewolf. Tapping believed that introducing the Five was a [...] "cool concept". Kindler introduced vampires in the episode, and felt it would be best to introduce them as a dead species. He also felt that including real-life historic figures such as Tesla was a [...] "very ballsy thing". In [...] "Requiem", Kindler wanted a scenario in which Will has to make a difficult decision to deal with Magnus when she becomes the threat of the episode. Though Kindler at first believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> episode, it ended up as a highlight of the season according to the producers. In writing [...] "Instinct", Kindler, inspired by Cloverfield, wanted to show the audience the protagonists hunting an abnormal in real-time, where it does not always go according to plan.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{were not}} new to studio {{recording}} and Best's drumming had been found acceptable by Polydor in Hamburg, but Richards had alerted Martin to Best's unsuitability for British studio work. Martin wanted to substitute Best with an experienced studio session drummer for the recordings. This was common practice {{at the time in}} British recording studios. When Lennon, McCartney and Harrison learned that Martin and the engineers preferred replacing Best with a session drummer for their upcoming recording session on 4 September 1962, they considered using it as a pretext to permanently dismiss Best from the group. Eventually, after a very long delay, they asked Epstein to dismiss Best from the band. Epstein agonised over the decision. As he wrote in his autobiography, A Cellarful of Noise, he [...] "wasn't sure" [...] about Martin's assessment of Best's drumming and [...] "was not anxious to change the membership of the Beatles {{at a time when they}} were developing as personalities … I asked the Beatles to leave the group as it was". Epstein also asked Liverpool DJ Bob Wooler, who knew the Beatles intimately, for advice to which Wooler replied that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea as Best was very popular with the fans. Ultimately, Epstein decided that [...] "If the group was to remain happy, Pete Best must go". Epstein summoned Best to his office and dismissed him on Thursday 16 August, ten weeks and one day after the first recording session. Epstein asked Best to continue to play with the band until Ringo joined on Saturday 18 August. Best played his last two gigs with the Beatles on 15 August at the Cavern Club, Liverpool. He was due to play his last show on 16 August at the Riverpark Ballroom, Chester, but never turned up; Johnny Hutchinson of the Big Three was rushed in as a substitute. Best had been with the group for two years and four days.|$|E

Southern Democrats were enacting laws that disfranchised most Black voters and were imposing segregation through “Jim Crow” laws. Northern Democrats seemed unwilling and/or unable to control the excesses of their Southern parties. The National Negro Democratic League was fractured by the debate over the issue of linking the nation’s currency to silver as well as to gold. By 1904, Taylor was positioned to abandon the party and bureau that he had led as president for two terms. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time to be a Black democrat.

2500|$|Despite the {{existence}} of attacks on RC4 that broke its security, cipher suites in SSL and TLS that were based on RC4 were still considered secure prior to 2013 based {{on the way in}} which they were used in SSL and TLS.

New forms of attack disclosed in March 2013 conclusively demonstrated the feasibility of breaking RC4 in TLS, suggesting <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> workaround for BEAST. An attack scenario was proposed by AlFardan, Bernstein, Paterson, Poettering and Schuldt that used newly discovered statistical biases in the RC4 key table to recover parts of the plaintext with a large number of TLS encryptions. An attack on RC4 in TLS and SSL that requires 13 × 220 encryptions to break RC4 was unveiled on 8 July 2013 and later described as [...] "feasible" [...] in the accompanying presentation at a USENIX Security Symposium in August 2013.

Thus, he decided to pursue the study of Classics at Magdalen College, Oxford, passing his entrance exams in January 1953; at the time he had thoughts of becoming a professional academic. He was the first member of his family to receive anything more than a basic education, and he noted that this removed him from his [...] "cultural background" [...] and led to something of a schism with other members of his family, who [...] "could not cope with me, and I could not cope with" [...] them.

In 1955, he joined the university theatrical society, playing the role of Mark Antony in a performance of William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra where he co-starred alongside Dudley Moore and where Kenneth Baker was the stage manager. In August 1956, he decided that he wished to devote himself to novel writing, and decided to abandon his university education without taking a degree; he left Oxford in late 1956. He nevertheless felt that the academic rigour which he learned during his university studies has remained [...] "a permanent strength through all my life".|$|E
