5|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} released as a two-LP set with a gatefold <b>jacket</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> booklet containing lyrics, a text {{version of the}} story, and photographs taken by Ethan Russell illustrating it. MCA Records re-released the album as a two-CD set in 1985 with the lyrics and text story line on a thin fold-up sheet {{but none of the}} photographs. The album was reissued as a remastered CD in 1996, featuring a reproduction of the original album artwork. The original mix had been criticised in particular for Daltrey's vocals being buried, so the 1996 CD was completely remixed by Jon Astley and Andy Macpherson.|$|E
5|$|The prince found {{fulfillment}} {{in activities}} that required physical skills, {{rather than in the}} classroom. At his father's Santa Cruz farm, Pedro trained unbroken horses, and became a fine horseman and an excellent farrier. He and his brother Miguel enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even at night or in inclement weather. He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts, applying himself to wood carving and furniture making. In addition, he had a taste for music, and under the guidance of Marcos Portugal the prince became an able composer. He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with several musical instruments (including piano, flute and guitar), playing popular songs and dances. Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of white cotton trousers, striped cotton <b>jacket</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> broad-brimmed straw hat, or a frock coat and a top hat in more formal situations. He would frequently take time to engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.|$|E

40|$|Synopsis: The {{research}} described encompasses laboratory {{as well as}} in-situ {{testing of}} reinforced concrete beam-column joints and multicolumn bridge piers rehabilitated with FRP composite jackets. Fourteen RC beam-column joint tests were performed <b>and</b> <b>a</b> design equation was developed which determines {{the thickness of the}} FRP composite <b>jacket</b> <b>and</b> the orientation of the fibers for maximum effectiveness in enhancing shear capacity and ductility. Several in-situ tests were conducted at the South Temple Bridge in Salt Lake City, which included a three-column bridge pier without an FRP composite seismic retrofit, a pier retrofitted with FRP composite <b>jackets,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pier retrofitted with FRP composite <b>jackets</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> reinforced concrete grade beam. The design of the seismic retrofit was based on rational criteria, which included the design of the foundation and column retrofit, and the design equation for retrofitting reinforced concrete beam-column joints, developed in the laboratory tests. The performance target for the seismic retrofit was a displacement ductility twice that of the pier without the FRP composite retrofit. The FRP composite jacket was able to strengthen the cap beam-column joints of the pier effectively and the displacement ductility was increased to the designed level...|$|R

25|$|Rimmer's Space Corps uniform changes {{several times}} {{during the course of the}} show. In the first two series it is a grey-and-beige shirt-and-tie ensemble; in Series III and IV this becomes a green suit with a shiny high-collared jacket, which is changed to red in Series V; in Series VI and VII, Rimmer's jacket becomes quilted and is red when he is in soft-light form and blue for hard-light; the alive Rimmer in Series VIII wears an all-beige uniform similar in design to the original. In the 2009 three-part special Back to Earth, Rimmer wears a blue suit similar to his Series III and VI green suit but with the {{addition}} of a plain waist-high belt worn over the <b>jacket</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quilted collar.|$|E
25|$|Philip's parents {{appeared}} {{regularly on}} the news and clutched what {{has now become a}} well-recognised picture of a smiling Philip in his Confirmation clothes of a blue <b>jacket</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> red rosette. This photo has been deemed a precursor to that of British infant Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal 21 years later. However, the family, unlike the McCanns, have been relatively private about their loss, speaking to the media on only a few occasions in the past 25 years. It has been reported that this is due to several inaccurate reports of the incident of which they have disapproved. Gardaí have, however, praised the media as a proven method for encouraging people to come forward with further information on the case each time an appeal is broadcast. Residents' organisation ACRA also launched an intense campaign to attempt to find Philip.|$|E
