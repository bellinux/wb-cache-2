40|$|This study, {{compiled}} {{according to}} commonly agreed specifications, {{provides an overview}} of the key issues and challenges that are apparent in relation to the <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> of third-country nationals to and from Ireland. The <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> of third-country national workers is an area that has received little policy attention in Ireland. The Irish immigration system does not actively facilitate the <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> of third-country nationals, nor are there measures introduced specifically to restrict such mobility. <b>Intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> rights are provided for certain categories of third-country nationals within the EU acquis subject to the necessary conditions being met. However, Ireland has not exercised its opt-in to several EU Directives that are relevant in this regard: the Long-term Residents Directive, the Blue Card Directive and the Students Directive. A third-country national, who is resident in another Member State under the terms of one of these Directives, holds no advantage over a third-country national travelling to Ireland from outside the EU: each must meet the same immigration requirements. Most relevant data sources in Ireland are not designed to record the <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> of third country nationals: detailed figures on visa applications by current location of applicant are not readily available; the employment permits administrative system has the potential to capture information on the place of residence of the applicant, but this field is not consistently filled. Furthermore due to measurement issues associated with sub-populations in sample surveys, data on migration flows by origin/destination, broken down by nationality, are not published by the Central Statistics Office. Sufficient data exist to indicate that <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> to and from Ireland is low...|$|E
30|$|Third, while {{migration}} {{from outside the}} EU was more significant than <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> in the past, the two are of comparable weight in recent years. This has two consequences for the present analysis. First, it provides another indication {{to the effect that}} the significance of <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> has increased in recent years. Second, it is a reminder that adjustment through labour mobility may happen via the movement of third-country nationals (or via the slowing of im{{migration from}} third countries).|$|E

The sustainability of this policy has recently been threatened by divisive debates between EU countries {{about the need to}} restrict welfare benefits for EU workers. This paper develops a theory for why the current free movement rules might present particular challenges for certain EU member states. It focuses on the potential roles of three types of national institutions and social norms in determining national policy positions on free movement in the EU 15 states: labour markets (especially their “flexibility”); welfare states (especially their “contributory basis”); and citizenship norms (focusing on the “Europeanness” of national identities). I show that these institutions and norms vary across member states and explain why we can expect these differences to contribute to divergent national policy preferences for reforming free movement...|$|R
40|$|CARIM-India: Developing a {{knowledge}} base for policymaking on India-EU migrationThis paper proposes {{to examine the}} conditions, rights and possibilities of third-country national students, and in particular Indian students, seeking to study {{in one of the}} EU Member States {{from the perspective of the}} EU legal migration regime. It will be argued that current Directive 2004 / 114 provides such students with an important set of rights (such as, arguably, a right of entry and residence upon fulfilment of the conditions therefore and a right to work during the studies) but also contains a set of regrettable limitations (such as the lack of provision for students to work in the host country after his or her studies and the restrictive conditions attached to their <b>intra-EU</b> student <b>mobility).</b> Some of these limitations can, however, be overcome by special categories of TCN students relying on a culmination of rights from different sources, in particular agreements concluded by their country of origin with the EU (such as eg. the EEC – Turkey agreement). As such, a number of case studies of such special TCN students are conducted in order to illustrate the possibilities that Indian students may have under their own pending EU-India Trade agreement.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the likely impact that European Union (EU) {{will have on}} the labor compact. It is argued that, despite increased economic integration in Europe, countries will still be able to maintain distinct labor practices if they are willing to bear the cost of those practices. The incidence of many social protections probably already falls on workers. In addition, it is argued that imperfect mobility of capital, labor, goods and services will limit the pressure that integration will place on the labor compact. Evidence is presented suggesting that labor mobility among EU countries has not increased after the elimination of remaining restrictions on <b>intra-EU</b> labor <b>mobility</b> in 1993. Moreover, immigration from non-EU countries, which is much larger than intra-EU migration, has declined since 1993. Evidence is also reviewed suggesting that the demand for social protection rises when countries are more open, and therefore subject to more severe external shocks. This finding suggests that increased economic integration and European Monetary Union could lead to greater demand for social protection. The U. S. experience with state workers' compensation insurance programs is offered as an example of enduring differences in labor market protections in highly integrated regional economies with a common currency. ...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] This {{annual review}} on Employment and Social Developments in Europe (ESDE) brings {{together}} for the first time a comprehensive analysis of challenges facing the EU in the areas of both employment and social policy. Replacing two previous reports - Employment in Europe and the Social Situation Report, the ESDE becomes the European Commission’s flagship analytical review on employment and social issues. It builds on the Quarterly Reviews of the EU Employment and Social Situation which the Commission has started producing in 2011 and provides detailed analysis of key structural developments. The 2011 edition focuses on changes in Europe’s job structure, recent increases in income inequalities, the varying patterns of poverty and social exclusion, the problem of in-work poverty, challenges and measures in the area of active ageing, and provides an updated analysis of <b>intra-EU</b> labour <b>mobility.</b> The integrated approach which the Commission has applied in preparation of the review corresponds to the Europe 2020 strategy. This is a long-term development strategy which sees social inclusion, the fight against poverty, greater labour market participation, employment and job quality as essential elements for Europe’s prosperity. Europe 2020 emphasizes that the objectives of smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth are mutually reinforcing and sets economic, employment and social policies on an equal footing. This approach also underpins the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines and the country-specific recommendations adopted by the European Council in June 2011. Nearly all social challenges have a strong labour market dimension, for example the problem of in-work poverty. At the same time, social policy plays a very important role in improving employment outcomes, e. g. as regards the inclusion of disadvantaged people or active ageing...|$|R
40|$|The report studies {{cross-border}} {{labour mobility}} in the Central Baltic region {{together with the}} policies and measures related to that. It provides background information on the current migration flows between Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Sweden {{as well as information}} on the national labour markets and current labour demand in each of the countries. This report is the final report of the INTERREG IVA project "CentralBaltic JobFerry". Based on statistical data and stakeholder interviews conducted in the Latvia, Estonia, South West Finland and Östergötland/Sweden, the report notes that countries in the Central Baltic region are facing labour shortage in the health care, social services, ICT and construction sectors. There is an increased need for specialised and skilled labour force in those sectors. The EU has identified cross-border labour mobility as a way to increase the matching of labour demand and supply. However the actual <b>intra-EU</b> cross-border labour <b>mobility</b> remains low. The report identifies the main obstacles to labour mobility based on stakeholder interviews and policy reviews. Lack of language skills, lack of cooperation between relevant labour market actors and authorities, lack of easily available information as well as problems with the portability of pension rights and social benefits are the main factors that impede the mobility of workers in the Central Baltic region. To tackle these issues, increased cooperation is needed both within countries and regions and across borders. The CentralBaltic JobFerry project has published a separate policy brief presenting several policy recommendations targeted at regional, national and EU level actors.

What is the extent of labour mobility within the EU? How can the fundamental rights of refugees and migrants from outside the EU be protected? How does <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> impact on public services? What have social partners done to address the integration of third-country nationals and challenges for EU labour markets?

30|$|The {{growth of}} <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility,</b> {{in the form}} of free {{movement}} and posted workers, also affects the inclusion-exclusion dilemma, since it gives new impetus to the ‘old’ debate regarding whether today’s migrants should be included as trade union members, considering the ‘temporary’ nature of much current mobility as well as increased concern about social dumping. In this respect, the literature provides examples of trade unions trying to organize new migrants (see, e.g., Fitzgerald and Hardy, 2010; Heyes, 2009; James and Karmowska, 2012). However, much of the emphasis has been on the need to create networks with communities and to provide language facilities, both instruments aimed at facilitating relationships (and diminishing tensions) between foreign and local workers. Instead the recruiting and organizing migrant workers remained weak due to the temporary nature of their immigration (Fitzgerald and Hardy, 2010).|$|E
30|$|The lack of {{portable}} social benefits—such as pensions, health care, and social assistance—might also constrain {{the mobility of}} labor between EU countries. EU legislation grants portability of such benefits at a level not found in any other region of the world. In principle, the most important benefits (for example, public pension and health benefits) are fully portable within the European Union and, to some extent, with countries outside the European Union. Nevertheless, important challenges remain 22. First, the administration of portability can be burdensome for intra-EU migrants. For example, old-age pensions are not paid as a single benefit, but by each pension insurance fund separately. The determination of separate pensions, taking into account contribution periods from different member states, is complex and opaque. Second, legislation on portability {{does not apply to}} occupational benefits, so moving might lead to considerable losses. Third, social assistance benefits are excluded from portability; the lack of a Europe-wide social safety net could also act as a barrier to <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility.</b>|$|E

It presents original empirical material employing creative research techniques gathered in Warsaw. The study reveals that social adaptation of intra-EU highly skilled migrants is spatially selective and expats develop connections with spaces related to their family life reproduction, such as international schools, expatriate associations and places of leisure and consumption. The article argues that more attention should be paid in future research to <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> and the gender imbalance in accessing particular local resources, such as the labour market...|$|E
40|$|The paper first {{discusses}} the {{main sources of}} concern {{for people in the}} perspective of professional mobility abroad as they result from the analysis of the Eurobarometer survey, wave 75. 1 of 2011. Second, it tests whether portability of social security within Europe is a determinant of <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility.</b> It does this by using Eurobarometer data for the estimation of a multinomial logit model with a propensity matching scheme in which those that made the experience of social security transfer in the past (either difficult or easy) are compared to those that never had such experience. The results suggest that an easy experience with the transfer of social security across countries may increase the propensity to move abroad for professional reasons. In contrast, difficulties are likely to negatively affect mobility incentives. The sign of the effect is stable across countries, but intensity varies depending on the group of countries considered being them EU- 15 or EU- 12...|$|E
40|$|Welfare tourism" {{expresses the}} concern that {{individuals}} use the right of free movement of persons {{with a view to}} benefiting from a more favourable welfare system. The principle of free movement of persons entitles EU citizens to reside in another Member State, under certain conditions. Only limited restrictions can curtail this right, namely temporary restrictions based on the Accession Treaties, agreed for the recent enlargements. Even if there are very few barriers to free movement, <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> is limited and most of it is directed to EU 15. National social security systems are coordinated to ensure that free movement of persons is not hindered. Expenditure on social protection is spread across a range of welfare benefits in broadly similarly shares throughout the EU. Assessing the impact of immigration is not straightforward. Some elements can help to assess its impact on social security, but those studies which do exist stress the lack of data relevant to the issue, and the limited impact on welfare systems. Current concerns about "welfare tourism" mobility relate in particular to the imminent ending of transitional arrangements...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} context of deep {{recession}} since 2008, acute Eurozone crisis since 2009 and fragile recovery as of 2013, managing effectively labour migration is crucial {{and at the}} same time it may seem a balancing act between opposed concerns: why would we need immigration if domestic unemployment is high? Why don’t we encourage more <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> to deal with differences in member state labour markets and further restrict immigration from third countries? This policy paper argues that there are some labour market sectors where ethnicisation (these are “migrant” jobs) persists and resists the crisis effects: natives do not want to take jobs in cleaning and caring even if they are unemployed. Moreover, to be unemployed does not make someone skilled for working in the cleaning and caring sector. Such sectors have been so far outside the scope of EU policy initiatives for managing labour migration and there is a gap there that needs to be addressed. We propose here an EU level sectorial approach, particularly looking at the domestic work sector...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{economic}} crisis with resulting high unemployment, EU economies face vacancies across the skill spectrum. At the low end there is a structural need {{when it comes to}} seasonal work. The Seasonal Workers Directive was launched {{at the same time as}} the Inter-Corporate Transferees (ICTs) Directive in 2010 – as part of the Commission’s 2005 Policy Plan on Legal Migration – and initially appeared to be more troublesome, with the stigma of ‘migrants stealing local jobs’ haunting it. However, without the provisions for <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> that have plagued the ICTs Directive, the Seasonal Workers Directive became less problematic despite the fact that seasonal workers are more numerous than intra-corporate transferees. This Policy Brief looks at how negotiating parties ensured a focus not only on the needs of the European labour market, but also saw an opportunity to bring added value to seasonal workers’ rights, through equal treatment to EU nationals. It assesses the final outcome of three and a half years of intra-EU negotiation, looking at the rights gained for seasonal migrants, the level of harmonization achieved, and the future of migration policy with the strategic guidelines for the area of freedom, security and justice in mind...|$|E
40|$|Discussions on {{problems}} {{in higher education}} in Europe typically focus on rising enrolment rates, access, governance, underperformance in research and teaching, lack of internationalisation, the lack of private and public funding. Our proposals for reform are based on more autonomy for universities, higher tuition fees, more private funding, introduction of income-contingent loans, better governance, more competition and internationalisation. Taking a subsidiarity perspective, {{the role of the}} EU in reforming the higher education sector in Europe is providing mutual policy learning opportunities on higher education reforms across Member States and supporting the building of higher education infrastructure in Member States (through the Structural and FP Funds). But beyond the support to Member States policies, the EU should further develop the European dimension, through furthering the goals of the Bologna reforms, cross recognition of qualifications, funding and promoting <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> of students, researchers and teachers. The EU should take more initiatives to facilitate global mobility and cooperation. Finally, consistent with the subsidiarity principle, the EU can develop "flagships" initiatives. higher education, enrolment, access, governance, research, teaching, funding, tuition fees, income-contingent loans, open market for the EU, Bologna reforms, mobility, competition, subsidiarity, flagships...|$|E
40|$|This {{open access}} book {{looks at the}} {{migration}} of Southern European EU citizens (from Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece) who move to Northern European Member States (Belgium, France, Germany, United Kingdom) {{in response to the}} global economic crisis. Its objective is twofold. First, it identifies the scale and nature of this new Southern European emigration and examines these migrants’ socio-economic integration in Northern European destination countries. This is achieved through an analysis of the most recent data on flows and profiles of this new labour force using sending-country and receiving-country databases. Second, it looks at the politics and policies of immigration, both {{from the perspective of the}} sending- and receiving-countries. Analysing the policies and debates about these new flows in the home and host countries’ this book shows how contentious the issue of <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> has recently become in the context of the crisis when the right for EU citizens to move within the EU had previously not been questioned for decades. Overall, the strength of this edited volume is that it compiles in a systematic way quantitative and qualitative analysis of these renewed Southern European migration flows and draws the lessons from this changing climate on EU migration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{distinguish}} {{two ways}} in which national public pension systems can distort intra-EU movements of workers. First, each national pension system may display an inherent mobility bias. We propose the ‘Lodge Test ’ to identify any such bias and show that many national pension systems in the EU are not mobility neutral. Second, mobility distortions may arise from differences between national pension systems. Using the CESifo pension model, we estimate both average and year-by-year implicit tax rates for select national pension systems in the EU. We then discuss how the observed differences in implicit tax rates on income may distort mobility and might even give rise to age-specific tax competition. Non-technical summary Cross-border mobility in the EU remains relatively low, despite EU citizens having {{the legal right to}} work anywhere in the EU as if it were one country. One long-recognised reason for distortions in <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> choices is the fact that tax, social insurance and pension systems differ across the EU. In recent decades, the EU has through basic coordination of different national systems started to address some of the most blatant problems for workers who move within the EU. But the work is far from complete, even for systems where substantial EU leve...|$|E
40|$|Freedom of {{movement}} of citizens constitutes {{one of the}} core values of the European Union and is closely linked to European citizenship. There is, however, a heated debate {{in many of the}} destination Member States about the impact of <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> on their public services. The debate centres on the ‘welfare magnet hypothesis’, which holds that migrants, including mobile citizens from the central and eastern European Member States, are attracted by the better quality of these services and easier access to them in the host countries. The issue has become highly politicised recently, especially {{as a consequence of the}} economic crisis and the increased inflow of these EU mobile citizens. The main objective of this research project is to explore whether there is any evidence to support the welfare magnet hypothesis. It examines the take-up of benefits and social services by mobile citizens from 10 central and eastern European Member States (EU 10 mobile citizens) in 9 host countries – Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK – compared to the native populations and other citizen groups.

40|$|Since 2000 it is {{estimated}} that between 10, 000 and 20, 000 Somali immigrants have left the Netherlands for the UK. This exceptionally high level of intra-European Union (EU) mobility is in contrast with the general trend of very low levels of <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility.</b> Based on 33 in-depth interviews with Dutch Somalis in London and Leicester this paper tries to explain the relocation of Somalis from the Netherlands to the UK. The presence of a large Somali community in the UK, economic and educational opportunities in the UK, and differences in integration policies have infl uenced Dutch Somalis’ decision to relocate. It is argued, however, that the wider context in which these movements take place should be taken into account as well. Immigrants may (initially) not always {{be in a position to}} move where they want to move. As such, Somalis’ relocation from the Netherlands to the UK could also be seen as a follow-up to an earlier movement that was interrupted along the way. Dutch Somalis’ narratives about their onward move provide us with a comparison of the Netherlands and the UK as countries of settlement. At the same time, these stories also challenge the binary oppositions that have tended to inform how we think about migration in a static and often linear way...|$|E
40|$|Opening up {{new legal}} {{migration}} channels' {{to respond to}} economic needs for labour {{is one of the}} four priorities of the European Commission for its upcoming European Agenda on Migration. The EU approach to legal labour migration has, to date, been very fragmented and limited. It has focused, indeed, on specific categories of potential legal migrants: highly-qualified, intra-corporate transferees, seasonal workers or students and non-remunerated trainees and researchers. The approach is clearly not up to the challenges posed by the EU labour market prospects and does not integrate, in a comprehensive way, all third-country nationals accessing European labour markets, including family reunification beneficiaries, asylum-seekers and foreign students. The main challenges related {{to the development of a}} EU labour migration vision are the following. How to articulate <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> and international migration to the EU labour market? How to make EU- and Member States legal migration systems and competences compatible? How to ensure that employers can tap workers from a sufficient pool of suitably qualified individuals (and that qualifications obtained abroad are recognized) ?

40|$|This {{qualitative}} multi-method studymaps {{the politics}} of brain drain {{at the level of}} the European Union and follows the evolution of the issue over the last four parliamentary periods. By utilizing a novel combination of interviews with a content and network analysis of parliamentary questions, the article demonstrates how {{the politics of}} brain drain travel from the domestic level to the European through frames that connect the issue to problems and solutions at the Union-level. After presenting a statistical overview of <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> flows, I conclude that the politics of brain drain are not adequately captured or addressed in the official numbers. Instead, I turn to discourse in order to analyze the prevailing interpretations of brain drain, why it occurs, and what to do about it. The analysis reveals that the uncertainty, controversy, and open-endedness of brain drain as an intra-European phenomenon lends itself well to multiple framings by actors in pursuit of preconceived political ends. This creates a space of opportunities within the Commission between laissez-faire and interventionist responses that vary in terms of the economic assumptions and political preferences brought to bear on the issue. Although the current balance is weighted in favor of a supply-side, employability logic towards brain drain, there is evidence of a schism within the Commission that presents an opportunity to productively engage with other understandings of the issue in pursuit of best practices...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{financial}} crisis that commenced in 2008, the relationship between migration and social benefits has become increasingly contested {{in a number of}} large EU member states. The Eastern expansion of the EU in 2004 and 2007 has added a new dimension to the relationship. Concerns have spread across a number of member states about the 'costs' and 'financial burdens' of migration and <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> and there have been calls for restrictions of existing EU rights and freedoms in the areas of EU free movement, social security coordination, asylum, and migration laws. The collection of essays contained in this book examines the main policy controversies that have emerged in the EU regarding linkages between welfare and migration. Does migration constitute a disproportionate burden to member states' domestic labour markets and welfare systems? Should non-citizens be entitled to social benefits in the state where they live? Is there objective evidence and statistical data indicating abuse of social benegits and increasing financial burdens by non-citizens, 'social welfare tourism' or the so-called 'welfare magnet' hypothesis, whereby migrants are attracted to countries that provide more generous welfare? The book analyses these controversies as they affect different categories of non-citizens in the framework of EU law and policy. This is coupled with an examination of the uses or misuses of data, information and social science knowledge in the debates on the reliance by non-citizens on social benefits. The book concludes with a set of recommendations addressed to EU policy-makers...|$|E
40|$|While {{there is}} a growing body of social {{research}} on migration and integration of immigrants from third countries arriving into the European Union (EU), this paper draws attention to the <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> and integration processes. It is doing so by presenting results of a research on social adaptation practices of highly skilled migrants from other EU countries that temporarily live in Warsaw (i. e. up to five years). The research with people of British, French and German nationality has demonstrated how they create everyday social spaces. Short-term perspective on their own life activities that are driven by their spatial mobility, contributes to development of specific adaptation strategies in which reproduction of the social space constitutes a stable component. Relations with other immigrants and local residents are reproduced and they are selective (created with Poles and other expats of similar traits), spatial (developed in specific places) and temporal (assumed to be short-term). Relations with family and close friends are sustained despite leading a hyper-mobile life. Their transnational social space is flexible regarding its scope and strenght - while social relations in Poland are selective and temporary, social ties sustained with family members and close friends outside Poland are stable and long-term. The research has also exposed a gender dimension in the transnational spaces creation with women who play active role in their reproduction. Everyday practices of women create a sense of "familiarity" and "stability" and constitute a counterbalance for "fluidity" and "changeability" around which mobile lives of their families evolve...|$|E
40|$|European {{integration}} {{brought with}} it deeper economic integration {{and the increase in}} the <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> of firms, inducing the intensification of competition for firms among EU members. In recent years, this intensified competition is also reflected by an increased European tax competition – the trend towards undercutting tax rates in order to attract firms from other EU locations. In this paper, we investigate empirically, with a panel data model for the whole EU area, the factors that explain industry location within the EU. More specifically, our approach is to examine the determinants that account for the observed differences in firm attraction (as indicated by FDI inflows) across the member states. We thereby shed light on the underlying factors and assess the relative importance of the determinants emphasized by the traditional tax competition literature vis-à-vis the factors associated with the emerging New Economic Geography (NEG) literature. Interestingly, the results indicate that differences in the tax policy (proxied by nominal and effective corporate tax rates), which are considered to be an important factor in the traditional tax competition scenario, among the EU countries are not important as a deterministic factor and do not explain the observed differences in the inward FDI across the member states. On the other hand, some factors emphasized by the NEG, such as differences in market size, differences in the degree of access and integration with international markets, and differences in the country’s peripherality, seem to be important determinants and account for the observed differences in industry location across the EU countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{perspective}} {{on the evolution of}} migration processes in post-WWII Europe. The concept of “migration cycle” is introduced to provide theoretical underpinnings for the analysis of the often complex relationship between migration and the state. This relationship becomes particularly complex when former net emigration countries transform their (migration) “status” to that of net immigration. Accordingly, three groups of European countries are distinguished in the paper taking into account their experience with inflows of foreign citizens. These are: “mature”, “new” and “future” immigration countries or, respectively, Western, Southern and Central European states.   This process of transformation of European countries from net emigration to net immigration states is analysed from three different perspectives: historical, economical and political. The paper opens with a historical and statistical overview of the past and present migration patterns in Europe and their influence on the changing demographic structure of the continent. Of particular interest are contemporary migration patterns triggered by the recent EU enlargements. The concept of the “fluid migration” as a new trend in the <b>intra-EU</b> <b>mobility</b> is introduced to highlight the changing structure of European migration. Next, the paper takes an economic perspective to analyse the impact of migration processes on both national and European labour markets and demands for welfare state support. It shows that while the political debate on European migration is often coloured by a populist view of immigration, the available studies emphasise the broadly positive long-term influence of migration on (European) host labour markets and welfare state...|$|E
