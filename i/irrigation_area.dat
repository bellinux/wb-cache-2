5|$|Large scale {{irrigation}} commenced {{with the}} establishment of the Murrumbidgee <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Area</b> (MIA) in 1912 which diverted water from the Murrumbidgee River near Narrandera. The River Murray Waters Agreement of 1915 allowed 26 weirs to be constructed with locks to provide permanent riverboat access to Echuca. When riverboat transport was no longer significant, the weirs supported irrigation. Irrigation in the region continued to develop with the construction of the Hume Dam between 1919 and 1931, the Burrinjuck Dam built in 1928 and Blowering Dam built in 1968.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{water for}} {{irrigation}} comes from two main sources, river systems and underground aquifers. Major river systems used for irrigation in Australia include the Murray-Darling system, the Ord River in the Kimberley region of Western Australia and many rivers {{along the east}} coast of Australia. This includes the Burdekin River <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Area</b> in North Queensland where irrigation is used during the dry season for double-cropping.

25|$|When the Liberal Reform Party under Carruthers won the 1904 election, Le was {{appointed}} as Secretary for Public Works on 30 August 1904.

25|$|The western {{slopes and}} plains fill a {{significant}} portion of the state's area and have a much sparser population than areas nearer the coast. Agriculture is central to the economy of the western slopes, particularly the Riverina region and Murrumbidgee <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Area</b> in the state's south-west. Regional cities such as Albury, Dubbo, Griffith and Wagga Wagga and towns such as Deniliquin, Leeton and Parkes exist primarily to service these agricultural regions. The western slopes descend slowly to the western plains that comprise almost two-thirds of the state and are largely arid or semi-arid. The mining town of Broken Hill is the largest centre in this area.|$|E
25|$|Other criticisms {{center around}} the broader {{environmental}} impact of irrigation on both the ecosystem around the vineyard {{as well as the}} added strain on global water resources. While advances in drip irrigation has reduced the amount of waste water produced by irrigation, the irrigation of substantial tracts of land in areas like the San Joaquin Valley in California and the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia requires massive amounts of water from dwindling supplies. In Australia, the centuries-old practice of flood irrigation used in places like the Murrumbidgee <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Area</b> caused severe environmental damages from water-logging, increase salination and raising the water tables. In 2000, the Australian government invested over A$3.6 million into research on how to minimize the damage caused by extensive irrigation. In 2007, concerns about ecological damage to the Russian River caused government officials in California to take similar measures to cut back water supplies and promote more efficient irrigation practices.|$|E
