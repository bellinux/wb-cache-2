5000|$|... #Caption: The <b>headlight</b> <b>unit</b> {{found on}} the 2014 Ford Fusion. The low beams utilise a {{projector}} beam configuration. (North America) ...|$|E
50|$|The RS125 was revised {{again in}} 1999 with more rounded and bulbous fairings, five spoke rims {{and a single}} air duct on the driver's right hand side. The lip on the <b>headlight</b> <b>unit</b> is {{increased}} in size.|$|E
5000|$|In early 2003 {{the family}} [...] "Sobol" [...] has {{undergone}} restyling, a similar family of [...] "Gazelle" [...] with the redesign of feathers and replacing the rectangular headlights on modern <b>headlight</b> <b>unit</b> teardrop shape, {{as well as}} the replacement of the instrument panel and so on.|$|E
5000|$|Daytime {{running lights}} on the [...] "Corona Rings" [...] around the main <b>headlight</b> <b>units</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The RS125 {{was given}} {{completely}} new fairing styling {{similar to the}} RSV 1000R. The most notable features are the angular fairings, two <b>headlight</b> <b>units,</b> digital gauge and multispoke Marchesini-styled rims.|$|R
50|$|In February 1999, the Vectra was updated, {{receiving}} a mildly modified body (that {{can be identified}} by the single piece <b>headlight</b> <b>units</b> and body-coloured bumpers) together with somewhat improved handling and better equipment.|$|R
50|$|Aprilia {{introduced}} the first RS125 in 1992. It has the distinctive features {{of having an}} angular tail section and swept front fairing, square cut <b>headlight</b> <b>unit,</b> three spoke rims, air scoops on the upper front middle fairing, Electric starter or kick start on the left hand side and analogue gauges.|$|E
50|$|The RS125 is {{revised and}} the R suffix is dropped. The RS retains {{a lot of}} the {{appearances}} of the previous RS but there are some notable differences. The first one is a new engine, the Rotax 122, a new improved version to the previous one. The front air intakes are integrated into the front upper portion of the middle fairing. The <b>headlight</b> <b>unit</b> is rounded and the lip is introduced to the top centre. A digital gauge is added in place of the temperature gauge.|$|E
50|$|The TX3 was the Laser flagship. It came {{standard}} with 14-inch satin-chrome alloy wheels, sports cloth interior trim, red insert strips in {{the body}} side mouldings and bumpers, black tailgate and beaver panel garnishes, semi-bucket seats with adjustable seat height, back and lumbar support, auto fade interior lamps, and all other Ghia appointings. EFI and A/C was standard, and automatic transmission was not available. The TX3 also had a unique front fascia with quad headlights and the parker lamps incorporated into the indicator lenses (L/GL/Ghia had the parkers inside the main <b>headlight</b> <b>unit)</b> and two-tone paint.|$|E
50|$|In the {{interest}} of making the vehicle more aerodynamic, designers again used wraparound composite <b>headlight</b> <b>units</b> and a larger grille. Although protruding from the body, the larger front bumper was given a rounded design. The interior again saw updates to the dashboard and instrument panel, {{with the addition of}} leather front seats as an option (for XLT and Eddie Bauer trims).|$|R
5000|$|June 1979 saw a {{completely}} redesigned Nissan Gloria with assistance with Pininfarina, {{with a more}} simple and straightforward appearance over the previous generation, and exchanging the single <b>unit</b> halogen <b>headlights</b> with 4 sealed beam <b>headlight</b> <b>units,</b> achieving a more American appearance, similar to the Buick Century {{during the same time}} period. Computer-controlled fuel injection was added to more engines offered, with the [...] "E" [...] designation signifying fuel injection.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984 and 1985, the Corsar was marketed only as 4-door sedan, {{the same}} European Santana body (no Passat Variant body was offered here for those first years), {{matching}} {{the appearance of}} the USA's market version (badged there as VW Quantum). At the time, the Corsar and Quantum saloons shared the same front grille design, featuring four squared <b>headlight</b> <b>units</b> (two beams for the right and left sides with amber-coloured rectangular emergency indicators below each) rather than the Santana's grille design.|$|R
50|$|Exterior changes include: one removed slat {{from each}} kidney grille, a {{slightly}} redesigned full-LED adaptive headlights, three distinct LED's {{in the fog}} lights, integrated indicators in the accent strip cutting {{across the top of}} the <b>headlight</b> <b>unit,</b> a larger and lower front air intake (for the front bumper), the exterior mirrors get indicators. The facelifted 6 Series comes with a newly designed 20-inch multi-spoke wheels. The Hofmeister Kink in the BMW 6 Series Coupe and Gran Coup√© has been slightly redesigned. There is also a new chrome strip that sits in between the exhausts in the lower rear bumper and the style for the model designation badges has also been slightly changed. Minor alterations to interior trim and audio options.|$|E
50|$|From May 2001, {{coinciding with}} {{the launch of the}} Magna VR-X Limited Edition, MMAL distanced all VR-X models from the Sports by {{equipping}} the former with unique five-spoke 17x7-inch alloy wheels shod with 225/50 Bridgestone performance tyres. Furthermore, the suspension was modified with higher rate springs, revised shock absorbers and a new front sway bar. Cosmetically, both the Magna Sports and VR-X were fitted with black brake callipers, black interior door handles, black inserts in the exterior door handles, and revised <b>headlight</b> <b>units</b> now featuring clear turn bezels (as opposed to the original amber).|$|R
50|$|The 2015 Ford F-150 makes {{a number}} of design departures from {{previous}} F-Series trucks. In a major redesign of the headlights, the rectangular <b>headlight</b> <b>units</b> were replaced with C-shaped units bracketing a trapezoidal grille. The LED headlights were originally planned to use glass for the optics to focus the beam, but it could not achieve the needed clarity, so Ford designers instead used polycarbonate thermoplastic. Each lamp uses one LED for the high beam, a second one for the low beam {{and one for the}} orange thermoplastic light pipe. The two beams, along with the light pipe, are then housed within one module.|$|R
5000|$|That meant, however, {{that the}} Honda Primo network needed an Accord-based compact sedan for the {{dealership}} channel. Honda adopted a rather simple solution {{of creating a}} [...] "sister car" [...] to Accord, the Honda Ascot. Technically, the Ascot was identical to the Accord sedan, and the interior, including the dashboard, was shared with the Accord. The exterior sheetmetal was unique to the Ascot, with cosmetic differences provided for a different look, befitting the Ascot's upmarket role as the top-of-the-line model of Honda Primo, which sold small, entry-level products. The <b>headlight</b> <b>units</b> were borrowed from the Honda Inspire, adding to its luxurious appearance, as well as installing LED high mounted brake light in the trunk rear spoiler.|$|R
50|$|The next {{facelift}} in 1986 {{changed the}} round <b>headlights</b> to rectangular <b>units,</b> {{as well as}} other minor cosmetic retouches.|$|R
2500|$|UPS {{refers to}} its {{delivery}} van as a [...] "package car". [...] The company utilizes several designs and sizes of package cars, dependent on routes and package volume. [...] The rounded-nose design of fiberglass {{hood of the}} UPS package car was patented by the company in 1965. [...] Morgan Olson (Grumman Olson), Union City Body, and Utilimaster manufacture the bodies for UPS delivery vans; older vehicles are based on Ford or General Motors P-chassis, while package cars introduced since the 1990s are based on Freightliner, Navistar, or Workhorse chassis. [...] Originally, UPS delivery vehicles were equipped with manual transmissions and steering, although many newer vehicles are updated with automatic transmissions. [...] In a 2010s redesign of the hood, the rounded-nose design has been phased out; its sealed-beam headlights have been replaced with automotive-sourced composite <b>headlight</b> <b>units</b> faired into the hood.|$|R
50|$|In 1968 the RPB Piraya was introduced. It was a low, two seated kit {{car with}} gullwing-doors {{inspired}} by the Ford GT40 and made for a Volkswagen Beetle chassis. It sold 40 kits {{in less than a}} year, but some customers found it difficult to assemble the cars. In 1969 the RPB-GT was introduced. Prices started at 3800 SEK. The design was similar to the Piraya, but had normal front hinged doors. The kit was made easier to assemble for the customer. The GT sold well, most as kits, but some as completed cars. It used a fuel tank from Renault 10, hinges to the front and rear hood came from Renault 4, door handles and locks from Renault 16, door hinges and side windows (cut to size) from the Mini, the front screen from a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette, rear and front lights were Hella universal (although the same <b>headlight</b> <b>units</b> was also used in Saab 96, Saab 99 and Renault 16).|$|R
50|$|Mk III (1941) - {{similar to}} late {{production}} Mk II, {{with a slightly}} shorter wheelbase. Late production vehicles had single rear door, no radiator grille and no <b>headlight</b> covers. 2,630 <b>units</b> built.|$|R
50|$|In June 1979 the 323/Familia {{underwent}} a facelift, replacing the previous round <b>headlights</b> with rectangular <b>units</b> which were {{designed as a}} single unit along with the grille. The new style was in line {{with that of the}} recently released Mazda Capella/626 (CB). Other minor differences occurred along with the facelift.|$|R
50|$|The Sovnarkom demanded these {{alterations}} to {{be reversed}} {{before the start}} of mass production, and also requested several other changes, including increase of the road clearance to at least 185 mm, removal of the running boards, replacement of the free-standing <b>headlights</b> with recessed <b>units</b> and substitution of the metal roof panel with an artificial leather insert.|$|R
2500|$|The car had {{a single}} bench seat with a small open {{compartment}} behind suitable for luggage. There was also a fold-down hood with detachable sidescreens. The <b>headlights</b> were separate <b>units</b> mounted {{on the side of}} the car, though of such low output, they have been described as providing [...] "more of a glimmer than a beam". At the rear there was a tiny, single, centrally-mounted lamp.|$|R
50|$|Unlike Cape Town's and Durban's {{suburban}} trainsets, {{those working}} around Johannesburg had jumper connections {{on the roof}} above the end connecting doors. The Class 3Es were also equipped with these connections, immediately to the right hand side of each headlight. During a shortage of suburban motor coaches c. 1948-1949, Class 3Es were used to haul suburban sets on the Witwatersrand {{and it is likely}} that the electric heating system was used during those winters. In the picture alongside showing rarely seen snow on the ground along the Johannesburg-Pretoria line on the Transvaal Highveld, the roof jumper connections between the suburban coaches and next to the <b>unit's</b> <b>headlight</b> are visible.|$|R
50|$|Being {{designed}} as the successor of the Honda Quint, the Integra {{is closely related}} to the Civic, although it featured a small list of key upgrades over its smaller stablemate to help merit a price increase over the CRX Si, which was otherwise the sportiest subcompact vehicle being offered by Honda Verno; enlarged 4-wheel disc brakes replaced the small front-disc/rear-drum setup used by the Civic and CRX, suspension calibration was re-worked, better tires were used and a 113-hp DOHC fuel-injected 16-valve engine was used in place of the SOHC unit from the CRX Si. Just like the Prelude and the Vigor of that period, the Integra featured sleek, sporty pop-up headlights, like its Japanese dealership Honda Verno stablemates, with the CRX adopting semi-concealed doors over the <b>headlights.</b> Nearly 228,000 <b>units</b> were sold during the four-year run of the first-generation model, most of them in the United States.|$|R
2500|$|The generational {{change that}} AMC Matadors {{received}} for 1974 in the United States was also introduced in Mexico. The Classic DPL obtained the longer [...] "coffin nose" [...] front clip design {{complete with the}} change from dual <b>headlights</b> to single <b>units,</b> grille-mounted parking lights as well as five-mile-per-hour bumpers with standard bumper guards. The rear licence plate was relocated {{to the center of}} the rear panel and obtained new longer rectangular taillights. The interior saw the all-new padded dashboard with three squared pods for instruments (emergency lights, gasoline level and water temperature to the left, 200 km/h speedometer at the center and the electric clock on the right) and a horizontal radio design. Seats and interior door panels were once again redesigned. Units ordered with the automatic transmission also included power steering and a heater. The beginning of automotive engine emission certification in Mexico affected the [...] six, which changed to a lower 8.5:1 compression ratio.|$|R
