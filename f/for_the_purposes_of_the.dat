5|$|Although French is an {{official}} language <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act {{does not require}} it to be {{an official}} language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba's government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial government services in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke both, and 0.9 percent spoke neither.|$|E

5|$|Historically Bournemouth {{was part}} of Hampshire, with {{neighbouring}} Poole, just {{to the west of}} the border, in Dorset. At the time of the 1974 local government re-organisation, it was considered desirable that the whole of the Poole/Bournemouth urban area should be part of the same county. Bournemouth therefore became part of the non-metropolitan county of Dorset on 1 April 1974. On 1 April 1997, Bournemouth became a unitary authority, independent from Dorset County Council. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lieutenancy it remains part of the ceremonial county of Dorset.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{appear in}} art, either to {{illustrate}} their botanical appearance, or <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism. For example, the Virgin Mary was compared by the Venerable Bede to a lily, the white petals denoting purity of body, while the yellow anthers signified the radiant {{light of the}} soul; accordingly, European portraits of the Virgin's Annunciation may depict a vase of white lilies in her room to indicate her attributes. Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in portraits, and as main subjects in still lifes.|$|E

5|$|Coatbridge is {{presently}} {{part of the}} burgh constituency of Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, electing one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Before the constituency's creation in 2005, Coatbridge lay in the Coatbridge and Chryston constituency. Hugh Gaffney of the Scottish Labour Party has been the MP since the 2017 snap election. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scottish Parliament, Coatbridge forms part of the Coatbridge and Cryston constituency, which is represented by Fulton MacGregor of the Scottish National Party. Coatbridge is further represented by seven regional MSPs from the Central Scotland electoral region.

5|$|If morning {{cortisol}} {{levels are}} over 500nmol/l, ACTH deficiency is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100-500 require a stimulation test. This, too, {{is done with}} the insulin tolerance test. A cortisol level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar rules out ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar stimulation test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investigation. If the insulin tolerance test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring {{the response of the}} adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH stimulation test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Stimulation testing with metyrapone is an alternative. Some suggest that an ACTH stimulation test is sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin tolerance test is only needed if the ACTH test is equivocal. The insulin tolerance test is discouraged in children. None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of time may be needed if initial results are not conclusive.|$|E

Antarctica's status is regulated by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty and other related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System. Antarctica is defined as all land and ice shelves south of 60° S <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the Soviet Union (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and the United States. It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on Antarctica. This was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{few times}} a federal court was asked to {{invalidate}} a law or action on Third Amendment grounds was in Engblom v. Carey (1982). In 1979, prison officials in New York organized a strike; they were evicted from their prison facility residences, which were reassigned to members of the National Guard who had temporarily taken their place as prison guards. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled: (1) that the term owner in the Third Amendment includes tenants (paralleling similar cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, governing search and seizure), (2) National Guard troops count as soldiers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Amendment, and (3) that the Third Amendment is incorporated (that is, that it applies to the states) by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was remanded to the district court, which dismissed the case on the grounds that state officials could not have been aware of this interpretation.|$|E
5|$|TETCO was {{the brainchild}} of {{corporate}} lawyers Charles Francis and James Elkins, who convinced the construction specialists George and Herman Brown, and the fuel engineer E. Holley Poe, that buying the Big and Little Inch pipelines could be a lucrative opportunity. The corporation was established specifically <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bid, and came to their bidding figure by estimating that the likely competition would bid at $130 million; their own figure exceeded this by 10 percent, and added on $127,000 to avoid a suspiciously round number. TETCO believed it could afford to make this offer because it intended to reuse the electric motors in the oil pumping mechanisms for moving the natural gas; it also believed that the price of gas would rise considerably in the post-war markets.|$|E
5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty was {{a mutual}} naval arms {{limitation}} and disarmament treaty between the five major naval {{powers of the}} time: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and France. One of the main aspects of the treaty was the limitation on the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted {{as part of the}} Royal Navy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treaty, Australia was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within six months of the treaty's ratification, then disposed of by scuttling, as Australia did not have the facilities to break her up for scrap, and the British share of target ships was taken up by Royal Navy vessels. This was the only time the Australian military has been affected by a disarmament treaty until the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning the use of anti-personnel mines.|$|E

As of 7 December 2005, no such list had been published. For this reason, in Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005), decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, the applicants should have done so against the Attorney-General. Nonetheless, the suit should not be dismissed as this was a procedural irregularity that could be cured by substituting the Attorney-General as the respondent.|$|E
5|$|World War II, or the Second World War, was {{a global}} {{military}} conflict, the joining {{of what had}} initially been two separate conflicts.

This global conflict split {{the majority of the}} world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. It involved the mobilization of over 100 million military personnel, making it the most widespread war in history, and placed the participants in a state of total war, erasing the distinction between civil and military resources. This resulted in the complete activation of a nation's economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war effort. Over 60 million people, the majority of them civilians, were killed, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.
