5|$|A {{structured}} {{assessment of}} speech includes {{an assessment of}} <b>expressive</b> language by asking the patient to name objects, repeat short sentences, or produce as many words as possible from a certain category in a set time. Simple language tests form part of the mini-mental state examination. In practice, the structured assessment of receptive and <b>expressive</b> language is often reported under Cognition (see below).|$|E
5|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} of neural development characterized by {{impaired social interaction}} and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. Typically there is particular difficulty acquiring <b>expressive</b> communication skills.

5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop <b>expressive</b> aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in <b>expressive</b> aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both <b>expressive</b> and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with <b>expressive</b> aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E

(2008d; 2011) {{to capture the}} style of organizations and commanders: experience, risk taking, use of power and force, diplomacy; ethics; norms; morale; creativity; and unorthodox behaviour. The use of <b>Expressives</b> can range from situations where participants (e.g. commanders) express their style to other participants (e.g. subordinates), or by Staff that develop models over the participants (commanders and subordinates) {{to be used in}} Course of Action development and war gaming.

50|$|<b>Expressives</b> {{are words}} which {{describe}} sounds, visual phenomena, bodily sensations, emotions, smells, tastes etc., with minute precision and specificity. They {{are characterized by}} special morphophonemic patterns, and make extensive use of sound symbolism.

The writer wants to find the English utterances that twelve-year-old children can produce, the types of speech act that are produced by the children, and the speech act that occurs most dominantly. In doing this study, the writer used the speech act classification based on Searle?s theory (1976) namely declarations, representatives, <b>expressives,</b> directives and commissives. In collecting the data, the writer used observation in the children?s course.

The analysis also moved beyond an elite model of deliberation by investigating the use of <b>expressives</b> (humor, emotional comments, and acknowledgments).

40|$|Abstract Much {{earlier work}} claims that appositives and <b>expressives</b> are {{invariably}} speaker-oriented. These claims {{have recently been}} challenged, most extensively by Amaral, Roberts & Smith 2007. We are convinced by this new evidence. The questions we address are (i) how widespread are non-speaker-oriented readings of appositives and <b>expressives,</b> and (ii) what are the underlying linguistic factors that make such readings available? We present two experiments and novel corpus work that bear directly on this issue. We find that non-speaker-oriented readings, while rare in actual language use, are systematic. We also find that non-speaker-oriented readings occur even outside of attitude predications, which leads us to favor an account based in pragmatically-mediated perspective shifting over one that relies on semantic binding by attitude predicates...|$|R

40|$|Talking {{politics}} online is {{not exclusively}} reserved for those spaces dedicated to politics, particularly the everyday political talk {{crucial to the}} public sphere. However, past net-based public sphere research has focused mostly on political spaces thereby neglecting an array of other genres.

The purpose is to see whether a forum dedicated to reality TV provides the communicative space, content, and style for politics that extends the public sphere. The central question is whether it fulfils the requirements of rationality and ‘decent’ deliberation. Moreover, the analysis moved beyond a formal notion by investigating how <b>expressives</b> influence the more traditional elements of deliberation. The findings revealed that Wife Swap participants engaged in political talk that was often deliberative.

40|$|Language is {{the most}} {{important}} of human life. In communication, people do not only utter sentences but also transfer it into behavior and this is called speech act. According to Searle illocutionary act is one part of speech act and it has five categories, those are assertive, directives, commisives, <b>expressives</b> and declaratives. The purpose of this research is to identify, classify and analyze illocutionary act and its function in the film entitled Fireproof by Alex Kendrick. The collected data have been identified of the utterances which contain illocutionary acts that are used by the characters in the film and analyzed descriptively based on the theory of Searle. The finding shows that there are four kinds of illocutionary act in the film, those are assertives, directives, <b>expressives,</b> and commisives whereas declaratives is not found in the utterances that uttered by the characters. The outcome {{of this study is to}} give contribution of the language development in linguistic study especially on illocutionary acts through pragmatic study and to be expected to help the students of English Department in understanding illocutionary act in the film...|$|R
