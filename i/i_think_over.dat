[...] They went to Torquay on 1 July, and Darwin began writing his Orchid paper. By 10 August, he feared his paper would run [...] "to 100 M.S. folio pages!!! The beauty of the adaptations of parts seems to me unparalleled... I marvel often as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>over</b> the diversity & perfection of the contrivances." ...|$|E
500|$|Trescothick {{was unable}} to avoid a {{recurrence}} of his previous difficulties when travelling abroad, however, and returned home on 15 October, citing the same [...] "stress related illness". Brian Rose, who Trescothick had approached initially after Somerset's defeat by Trinidad and Tobago on 12 October, released {{a statement to the}} media stating [...] "Marcus admitted {{a couple of days ago}} that he wasn't 100% so that's fair enough. I think his future will be in domestic cricket and that may even help him with this particular form of illness. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>over</b> the next two or three years you'll see Marcus Trescothick performing wonderfully well in county cricket." [...] Michael Vaughan, who had by then retired from cricket, praised Trescothick's [...] "courageous" [...] decision, as did Vikram Solanki, then PCA chairman. Journalist Andrew Miller called for an end to the rising criticism of Trescothick's decision from the public, while Paul Hayward of the Guardian also derided those critical of the Somerset player's actions. Despite returning home, Trescothick continued to affirm his commitment to the club by signing a new three-year contract with optional fourth year, in December. He was named captain for the 2010 season.|$|E

500|$|... Darwin's {{belief that}} black people had the same {{essential}} humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from John Edmonstone in 1826. Early in the Beagle voyage, Darwin nearly lost {{his position on the}} ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. [...] He wrote home about [...] "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." [...] Regarding Fuegians, he [...] "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like Jemmy Button: [...] "It seems yet wonderful to me, when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>over</b> all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here." ...|$|E
500|$|They reached Tierra del Fuego on 18 December 1832 and Darwin {{was taken}} aback at what he {{perceived}} as the crude savagery of the Yaghan natives, {{in stark contrast to}} the [...] "civilised" [...] behaviour of the three Fuegians they were returning as missionaries (who had been given the names York Minster, Fuegia Basket and Jemmy Button). He described his first meeting with the native Fuegians as being [...] "without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle I ever beheld: I could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilised man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement." [...] In contrast, he said of Jemmy that [...] "It seems yet wonderful to me, when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>over</b> all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here." [...] (Four decades later, he recalled these impressions in The Descent of Man to support his argument that just as humans had descended from [...] "a lower form", civilised society had arisen by graduations from a more primitive state. He recalled how closely the Fuegians on board the Beagle [...] "resembled us in disposition and in most of our mental faculties.") ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I... I... Well, we {{can talk}} about that when we meet. I mean, it's no good trying to say what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>over</b> the 'phone, I'm sort of knocked out. I never dreamed... But, I say, what did you mean about Bruce?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a threat," [...] he said, quietly. [...] "Countess, I beg {{that you}} will leave me. <b>I</b> will <b>think</b> <b>over</b> all that you have said, and I will discuss it fully with your brother, and my other advisers.

I am sometimes so mad with myself when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>over</b> it all,--that I should like to blow my brains out." ...|$|E
60|$|But his snicker was palpably an {{assumption}} of unconcern {{he did not}} possess. The more <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>over</b> it the more I am surprised that such keen men as the gangsters should have been frightened by what had occurred. But frightened they were, the three of them, out of their bunks {{and out of the}} precious surcease of their brief watch below.|$|E

6000|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>over</b> {{that talk}} {{in the light of}} all that has {{happened}} since, I can imagine how she came to me full of a human appeal I was too foolish to let her make. I don't know. I confess I have never completely understood Beatrice. I confess I am still perplexed at many things she said and did. That afternoon, anyhow, I was impossible. I posed and scolded. I was--I said it--for [...] "taking the Universe by the throat!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sheila {{lowered her}} eyes softly {{on to the}} rich-toned picture in the glass. 'Supposing,' she said, {{watching}} her lips move, 'supposing--of course, I know you are getting better and all that--but supposing you don't change back as Mr Bethany thinks, what will you do? Honestly, Arthur, when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>over</b> it calmly, the whole tragedy comes back on me with such a force it sweeps me off my feet; I am for the moment scarcely my own mistress.

60|$|I {{may well}} say, now that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it <b>over,</b> {{that it was}} this {{particular}} hen that started the mutiny. The men, well-driven by Mr. Pike, were ripe for an explosion, and Possum and the hen laid the train.|$|R

60|$|I {{hope you}} will find the purpose and the plot of my book very plain when you see it as a whole piece. I am looking forward to sending you the proofs {{complete}} about the end of next month. It is all sketched out and I am working hard on it, giving it all the pains possible to be bestowed on a labour of love. Your critical opinion two months in advance of the public will be invaluable to me. For you know what store I set by it, and how <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>over</b> a hint from you.|$|E

"'The more <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>over</b> this matter,' he said, 'the more strange it is {{that you}} should be able to do all these {{wonderful}} things, after having seen it done once by the white hakim. The more I think of it, the more certain I feel that you are not what you seem. I have sent for Saleh and Abdullah. They have told me what you did for them, and that you gave up your horse to them, and dressed their wounds, and brought them in here. They are full of praise of your goodness, and but few of my people would have thus acted, for strangers. They would have given them a drink of water, and ridden on.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{different}} {{the vegetation}} is here {{from what it}} is with us!" [...] she said with nervous quickness, directing {{his attention to the}} grass road beneath them, without lifting her eyes. [...] "I don't mean what is cultivated,--for I suppose it takes centuries to make the lawns they have in England,--but even here the blades of grass seem to press closer together, as if they were crowded or overpopulated, like the country; and this forest, which has been always wild and was a hunting park, has a blase look, as if it was already tired of the unchanging traditions and monotony around it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>over</b> there Nature affects and influences us: here, I fancy, it is itself affected by the people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will, at any rate, {{do nothing}} to mar you. And, to tell the truth, <b>I</b> must <b>think</b> <b>over</b> the matter fully before I can decide what I had better say to Bell about it. From her not {{speaking}} to me--" ...|$|R
