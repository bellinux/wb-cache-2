25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the power of the {{executive}} to appoint JCs for limited periods or to hear a specific case, and to extend the tenure of Supreme Court judges beyond the age of 65 by hiring them on a term basis, may motivate such judges to render <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> in line with government policy.

500|$|The {{construction}} {{and operation of}} an international airport depends on a complicated set of <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> affected by technology, politics, economics and geography as well as both local and international law. Designing an airport even for domestic traffic or as [...] "non-hub" [...] has, from the beginning, required extensive co-ordination between users and interested parties – architects, engineers, managers and staff all need to be involved. Airports may also be regarded as emblematic of national pride and so the design may be architecturally ambitious. An example is the planned New Mexico City international airport, intended to replace an airport that has reached capacity.|$|E

500|$|James Cameron {{has said}} that he [...] "tried to make a film that would touch people's spirituality across the broad spectrum." [...] He also stated that one of the film's {{philosophical}} underpinnings is that [...] "the Na'vi represent that sort of aspirational part of ourselves that wants to be better, that wants to respect nature, while the humans in the film represent the more venal versions of ourselves, the banality of evil that comes with corporate <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> made out of remove of the consequences." [...] Film director John Boorman saw a similar dichotomy as a key factor contributing to its success: [...] "Perhaps the key is the marine in the wheelchair. [...] He is disabled, but Mr Cameron and technology can transport him into the body of a beautiful, athletic, sexual, being. [...] After all, we are all disabled in one way or another; inadequate, old, broken, earthbound. [...] Pandora is a kind of heaven where we can be resurrected and connected instead of disconnected and alone." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was held}} in the Malaysian Court of Appeal case of Sugumar Balakrishnan v. Pengarah Imigresen Negeri Sabah (1998) that the term life in Article 5(1) of the Constitution is not limited to mere existence, but is a wide concept that must receive a broad and liberal interpretation. Likewise, {{personal}} liberty should be similarly interpreted, as any other approach to construction will necessarily produce an incongruous and absurd result. On the facts, personal liberty extended to the liberty of an aggrieved person to go to court and seek judicial review, and thus a statutory provision that sought to oust the power of judicial review was apparently inconsistent with this fundamental liberty. However, the apparent inconsistency could be resolved by permitting an ouster clause to immunize from judicial review only those administrative acts and <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not infected by an error of law. Although the Federal Court reversed the Court of Appeal on this point, in the subsequent case Lee Kwan Woh v. Public Prosecutor (2009) the Federal Court held that the provisions of the Constitution should be interpreted [...] "generously and liberally", and that [...] "on no account should a literal construction be placed on its language, particularly upon those provisions that guarantee to individuals the protection of fundamental rights".

2500|$|Odor {{recognition}} {{is the most}} common and direct means used to measure odor memory. In an odor recognition test participants are asked whether or not they recognize an odor. [...] More specifically, a participant is subjected to a certain olfactory-related stimulus, and after a delay period is asked to decide if a probe (a stimulus that could or could not be the same as the initial stimulus) {{is the same as the}} one he/she initially encountered. Memory accuracy is assessed by the amount of correct recognition <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> made. A potential problem with this measure involves the generation of verbal labels that may enhance memory for olfactory stimuli. [...] There are various ways of measuring the effect of verbal labeling, which include comparison of odors and odor names, as well as the speed and accuracy with which lexical decisions are made regarding odor names. It has been suggested that odor recognition testing should be considered as a measure that involves both memory for perceptual information as well as potentially confounding memory due to the generation of verbal labels.|$|E

Napolitano's questions were critical of the airlines' plans to impose self-regulation in response to recent customer service controversies. As the founder and Chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Napolitano further asked whether the Airlines provide mental health services to their employees because of the stressful nature of flight attendant jobs and the increasing demands that airline companies put on flight attendants. Mr. William J. McGee, the country’s foremost expert and advocate on consumer rights as the Aviation Consultant for Consumers Union responded that this was “an excellent question because… {{right now we have}} a situation where employees are under tremendous strain because of the executive <b>decisions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> putting flight attendants in the front lines of many of these situations. Flight attendants have a primary responsibility to ensure safety, evacuation, and of course customer service, but we have asked them to be bouncers, and police officers, and all kinds of other things, so {{there is no question that}} there is an issue of training as well.” ...|$|E
