40|$|Abstract: In this work, {{we present}} a {{mathematical}} model for the dynamics of glucose regulatory system under the combined use of <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> physical activity, the model is an improvement on the work by Brian et al (2000). In our proposed model, we incorporated a parameter h by defining itin terms of; physical activity <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> (calorie restriction) as factors that affects glucose and insulin homeostasis. The study ushered in a mathematical model for studying {{the dynamics of the}} glucose regulation under the combined effect of <b>dieting</b> (calorie restriction) <b>and</b> physical activity. The model was used to investigate the effect of <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> physical activity on glucose and insulin homeostasis, The result of the study showed that; <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> physical activity has great impact on the regulation of plasma glucose and insulin concentration, <b>and</b> that <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> physical activity can be used on any population for the management of glucose and insulin homeostasis. Furthermore, our study corroborates the clinical trial studies by Margarita et al (2005), Jean (1999), that; <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> physical activity improves insulin an...|$|R
40|$|The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Health Belief Model (HBM), and a {{modified}} HBM including intention were compared {{in their ability}} to predict <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> fasting. Female university students (n = 373) completed a survey assessing variables from the TPB and the HBM. Three months later, a subsample reported subsequent weight loss behaviors. The TPB predictor model explained 35 % of the variance in follow-up <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> 67 % in intention. The HBM model explained 29 % of the variance in follow-up <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> the modified HBM model explained 38 % of the variance in follow-up <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> 57 % in intention [...] The TPB model for fasting explained 14. 5 % of the variance in follow-up fasting and 58 % in intention. The modified HBM model explained 19 % of the variance in follow-up fasting and 41 % in intention. Results show all models were able to predict a significant portion in the variance of <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> fasting follow-up behavior; however the variance explained in follow-up fasting increased when intention was added to the HBM model. Attitude measures were the strongest predictors of behavioural intention and intention was the strongest predictor of follow-up <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> fasting in the TPB and modified HBM models.

Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the <b>diet</b> <b>and</b> 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Barborka, also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the <b>diet</b> <b>and</b> 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies.

We investigated the predictors of <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> non-dieting approaches in Australian adults using predictors that were identified in a previous qualitative study. Methods We conducted a prospective study, with two waves of data collection occurring 4 weeks apart. At baseline, participants completed a questionnaire assessing constructs drawn from the theory of planned behaviour (attitude, subjective norm, and self-efficacy), past behaviour, non-planning, attributions for dieting failure, weight control beliefs, <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> non-dieting intentions.

30|$|The {{present study}} aimed to analyze mothers’ {{perceptions}} {{about their own}} <b>diets</b> <b>and</b> those of their children (aged 2 – 3) considering the criterion of being healthy or not, {{as well as to}} investigate potential associations between these perceptions and maternal/family characteristics.

Studying how mothers perceive their own <b>diets</b> <b>and</b> those of their children can help to understand the quality of children’s <b>diets</b> <b>and</b> their resulting health outcomes. Thus, the knowledge of this topic can improve the effectiveness of nutritional interventions, which is of prime importance in early childhood.|$|R
