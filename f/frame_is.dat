50|$|In a {{strip of}} movie film, {{individual}} <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> separated by <b>frame</b> lines. Normally, 24 <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> needed for one second of film. In ordinary filming, the <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> photographed automatically, one after the other, in a movie camera. In special effects or animation filming, the <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> often shot one at a time.|$|R
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{findings from the}} ice survey were a positive reading from the metal detector, coupled with a significant echo from the Ground Penetrating Radar, both from the small area where the <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> assumed to have sunk.|$|E
5|$|Descendants of Wyatt Earp's cousins {{assert that}} Earp carried the pistol {{featured}} in the auction and while in Tombstone, although the grips, barrel, and cylinder have been replaced. Only the <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> original, and its serial number has been filed off. However, X-ray testing showed an original serial number, 5686, which matches a batch of revolvers purchased by the U.S. Army in 1874.|$|E
5|$|The SIII has an 8-megapixel camera {{similar to}} that of the Galaxy SII. It can take 3264×2448-pixel {{resolution}} photos and record videos in 1920×1080-pixel (1080p) resolution. Samsung improved the camera's software over that of its predecessor to include zero shutter lag, and Burst Mode and Best Shot, which work together to quickly take numerous photos before the best-judged <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> selected. The phone can also take pictures while recording videos. The rear-facing camera is complemented by a 1.9-megapixel front-facing camera that can record 720p videos. The phone has LED flash and autofocus.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>frames</b> <b>were</b> {{available}} in two colors, red and white, and painted with DuPont Imron paint. Cannondale achieved {{the distinction of}} becoming the first high-volume producer of aluminum frames. Previously only steel <b>frames</b> <b>were</b> mass-produced, while aluminum <b>frames</b> <b>were</b> handmade in low volumes.|$|R
30|$|However, when coding a video {{sequence}} using B-frames, the <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> encoded out of order, since future <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> required to encode a B-frame. Therefore, the MVs of reference frames (in future and/or previous <b>frames)</b> <b>are</b> available {{and can be}} used in order to calculate the MVPs.|$|R

5|$|The {{equivalence}} between gravitational and {{inertial effects}} {{does not constitute}} a complete theory of gravity. When it comes to explaining gravity near our own location on the Earth's surface, noting that our reference <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> not in free fall, so that fictitious forces are to be expected, provides a suitable explanation. But a freely falling reference frame {{on one side of}} the Earth cannot explain why the people on the opposite side of the Earth experience a gravitational pull in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{objects to}} be {{transformed}} may be something else than ordinary physical objects extending in three spatial dimensions (and time, unless the <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> the rest frame). It is for these objects that representation theory is needed for the mathematical description of transformations induced by ordinary Lorentz transformations of spacetime. For instance, the electromagnetic field is often (naively) envisaged by the assignment to each point in spacetime of a three-dimensional vector representing the electric field and another three-dimensional vector representing the magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Following this, Inna appears {{wearing a}} yellow dress while {{standing}} on a stair, with her shadow not moving alike to her. When the track's breakdown is played, Inna is presented lying on a XXL-photo of her face, {{and she and her}} backup dancers are particularly shown clapping their hands and performing subtle movements. The visual ends with Inna appearing on the TV's display from the beginning, before it is switched off by a woman previously shown. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray people performing tribal moves while the video's <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> vertically constrained to just the center of the screen, and two lesbian girls touching their body and picturing themselves.|$|E
25|$|Although the axes of the unprimed <b>frame</b> <b>are</b> {{orthogonal}} and the axes of the primed <b>frame</b> <b>are</b> inclined, the <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> actually equivalent. The asymmetry {{is due to}} unavoidable mapping distortions, {{and should}} be considered no stranger than the mapping distortions that occur, say, when mapping a spherical Earth onto a flat map.|$|R
50|$|The {{throstle}} <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> {{a descendant}} of the water frame. It used the same principles, was better engineered and driven by steam. In 1828 the Danforth throstle <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> invented in the United States. The heavy flyer caused the spindle to vibrate, and the yarn snarled every time the <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> stopped. Not a success.|$|R
50|$|Westinghouse Brake & Saxby Signal Co. Ltd. {{was one of}} the {{companies}} that produced miniature power lever frames. All-electric power lever <b>frames</b> <b>were</b> produced from 1929 onwards; earlier mechanical <b>frames</b> <b>were</b> produced before this date. In the UK, the Style 'L' all-electric miniature power lever <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> the most predominant on UK main line railways.|$|R
5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, {{is the study of}} the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> projected.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its structural steel <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural light into the lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, flush {{with the rest of the}} building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall flagpoles.|$|E

5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
5|$|The film clips are a motif used {{to enhance}} {{the theme of the}} desire to find meaning or detect patterns. They are {{released}} over the internet and gain a cult following, {{in the same way that}} the lonelygirl15 videoblog gained an international following in 2006. Corporate interest in the footage is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods. The characters debate whether the anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or a work in progress, and when or where they were shot. This enigmatic nature of the footage is said to metaphorically represent the nature of the confusing and uncertain post-9/11 future. The author Dennis Danvers has remarked that the footage being edited down to a single <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> like the world compressed into a single novel. The footage, released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators, has also been contrasted to Pattern Recognition written under contract for a large corporation and which uses liminal name-dropping that definitively sets it in London, Tokyo, and Moscow in 2002.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} academic debate concerning {{the involvement of}} Antanas Smetona in planning the coup. In 1931, Augustinas Voldemaras, who had since been ousted {{from the government and}} forced into exile, wrote that Smetona had been planning the coup since 1925. Historian Zenonas Butkus asserted that an idea of a coup had been raised as early as 1923. However, this time <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> disputed, since the military did not take action until the autumn of 1926. Smetona's personal secretary, Aleksandras Merkelis, held that Smetona knew about the coup, but neither inspired nor organized it. Before the coup, Smetona had been the editor of Lietuvis (The Lithuanian), and a shift in its orientation that took place in late November has been cited as evidence that he was not informed about the coup until then. Before the issue of 25 November appeared, the newspaper was critical of the government and of the Christian Democrats. On that date, however, the newspaper published several articles about 21 November student protest and an article headlined Bolshevism's Threat to Lithuania. The latter article argued that the communists posed a genuine threat and that the current government was incapable of dealing with it. After that date, the newspaper ceased issuing criticisms of the Christian Democrats.|$|E

50|$|Baby giant or baby jumbo <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> Ethernet <b>frames</b> that <b>are</b> only {{slightly}} larger than allowed by the IEEE Ethernet standards. Baby jumbo <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> for example required to enable IP/MPLS over Ethernet to deliver Ethernet services. Most implementations will require non-jumbo user <b>frames</b> to <b>be</b> encapsulated into MPLS frame format which in turn may be encapsulated into a proper Ethernet frame format with EtherType values of 0x8847 and 0x8848.The increased overhead of extra MPLS and Ethernet headers means that the support of 1600 byte <b>frames</b> <b>is</b> a mandatory requirement in Carrier Ethernet networks.|$|R
50|$|Japanese- and French-made frames {{from the}} bike boom are {{particularly}} common in North America. These range widely in quality: low-end <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> made of ordinary high-tensile steel using thick, heavy tubing and stamped steel dropouts. Better <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> nearly always made of some variant of chromoly steel alloy and include forged or investment-cast dropouts. Higher-end <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> often made of butted steel tubing, which is thicker {{at the ends}} and thinner in the middle, reducing weight but increasing the cost.New lugged <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> manufactured, often to custom geometry {{from a number of}} speciality manufacturers.|$|R
25|$|The {{definition}} {{is dependent on}} the chosen frame of reference. When the chosen <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> co-moving with the object in question then this definition precisely agrees with the operational definition. If the specified <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> the surface of the Earth, the weight according to the ISO and gravitational definitions differ only by the centrifugal effects due to the rotation of the Earth.|$|E

30|$|Complexity {{reduction}} is initially obtained with temporal downsampling, since only the key <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> conventionally encoded. However, if the key <b>frames</b> <b>were</b> to be encoded as I-frames, {{a more significant}} complexity reduction can be achieved, since {{there will be no}} motion estimation at the encoder side. Note that if the key <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> selected as the reference frames and the WZ <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> the nonreference <b>frames,</b> then the key <b>frames</b> can <b>be</b> coded as conventional I-, P-, or reference B-frames, without drifting errors. This not only increases the performance in terms of RD, but also increases the complexity since motion estimation may be used for the key frames as well.|$|R
