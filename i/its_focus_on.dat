5|$|Varner's In Nature's Interests? {{offers a}} {{resolution}} of the debate between individualistic approaches to animal rights and holistic accounts of environmental ethics. Varner defends an interest-based biocentric individualism according to which all living beings—including plants—have morally significant interests that ground prima facie (though overridable) duties. The approach follows {{in the tradition of the}} work of Kenneth Goodpaster and Paul Taylor, though Varner's approach differs from Taylor's in <b>its</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> interests rather than duties, with Varner showing clear utilitarian commitments.|$|E
5|$|Although {{important}} discoveries {{continued to}} elude Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory, mainly due to <b>its</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> {{the development of}} the cyclotron rather than its scientific use, through his increasingly larger machines, Lawrence was able to provide crucial equipment needed for experiments in high energy physics. Around this device, he built what became the world's foremost laboratory for the new field of nuclear physics research in the 1930s. He received a patent for the cyclotron in 1934, which he assigned to the Research Corporation, a private foundation that funded much of Lawrence's early work.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite {{began to}} {{emphasize}} a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as {{he needed the}} guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured {{that there would be no}} possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in <b>its</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> faith and submission to authority.|$|E

5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear.

5|$|EU {{legislation}} {{makes no}} provision for the preservation and protection of breed types, which, {{in the case of}} Limousins, have been maintained and the breed developed through a rigorously enforced breed standard for over a century. An attempt to protect the integrity of the French Limousin Herd Book by opposing the entry of foreign purebreds that may have been subject to less stringent selection criteria is prohibited under EU legislation because it is considered to hinder intra-Community trade. Current EU legislation with <b>its</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> free trade thus has the potential to result in the dilution of purebred breeds and loss of efficiency gains arising from crossbreeding.|$|E
