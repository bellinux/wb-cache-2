5|$|Amyntas III {{was forced}} to flee <b>his</b> <b>kingdom</b> in either 393 or 383BC (based on {{conflicting}} accounts), owing to a massive invasion by the Illyrian Dardani led by Bardylis. The pretender to the throne Argaeus ruled in his absence, yet AmyntasIII eventually returned to <b>his</b> <b>kingdom</b> {{with the aid of}} Thessalian allies. AmyntasIII was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379BC.|$|E
5|$|Ælfwald of East Anglia died in 749 after ruling for thirty-six years. During Ælfwald's rule, <b>his</b> <b>kingdom</b> enjoyed {{sustained}} growth and stability, albeit under the senior {{authority of the}} Mercian king Æthelbald, who ruled <b>his</b> <b>kingdom</b> from 716 until he was murdered by his own men in 757. Ælfwald {{was the last of}} the Wuffingas dynasty, who had ruled East Anglia since the 6th century. A pedigree in the Anglian collection that lists Ælfwald and his descendants, includes many earlier Wuffingas kings.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} highly exaggerated {{reports about}} the role of the Christians and their help to the British during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, Tipu decided to minimise the threat to <b>his</b> <b>kingdom</b> from the British and banish the Christians of Canara. According to Severine Silva, this decision was the logical outcome of the plans he had nurtured since the time of the conquest of Mangalore with his father Hyder in 1768.|$|E

5|$|Anna's hold on {{the western}} limits of <b>his</b> <b>kingdom,</b> which bordered on the Fen lands that {{surrounded}} the Isle of Ely, was strengthened by the marriage in 651 (or slightly later) of his daughter Æthelthryth to Tondberht, a prince of the South Gyrwe, a {{people living in the}} fens who may have been settled in the area around Ely. Æthelthryth, accompanied by her minister Owine, travelled from Ely to Northumbria when she married for the second time, to Ecgfrith.|$|E
5|$|During 632 or 633, Edwin of Northumbria {{was overthrown}} and slain and <b>his</b> <b>kingdom</b> was ravaged by Cadwallon ap Cadfan, {{supported}} by Penda of Mercia.

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše in the 14th century BC, Qatna may {{have become part of}} <b>his</b> <b>kingdom.</b> In 1977, Astour {{considered}} Qatna a constitutent part of the lands of Nuhašše, and identified a king of Qatna named Adad-Nirari with the Nuhaššite king. Astour was followed by Thomas Richter in 2002, who considered Qatna to be a secondary city in the domain of the Nuhaššite king. The tablets of Qatna mention a šakkanakku (military governor) named Lullu, and Richter considered him an official of Nuhašše. The hypothesis of Richter is debated; a number of scholars accept it, for example Pfälzner, who suggested that the Nuhaššite king may have resided in Qatna's royal palace. Richter dated the rule of the Nuhaššite king to the period preceding the Hittite king Šuppiluliuma I's first Syrian war, during which Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše opposed the Hittites, was defeated, and, according to Richter, had <b>his</b> <b>kingdom</b> split between different Hittite puppets including Idanda of Qatna.|$|E

5|$|During {{the same}} period, Bisutun died, and <b>his</b> <b>kingdom</b> {{was thrown into}} civil war; his {{governor}} of Tabaristan, Dubaj ibn Bani, supported his son as the new Ziyarid ruler, while Bisutun's brother Qabus claimed the throne for himself. Adud al-Dawla quickly sent an army to aid Qabus against Dubaj. Qabus managed to defeat him and capture the son of Bisutun in Simnan. Adud al-Dawla then made the Abbasid caliph give Qabus the title of Shams al-Ma'ali.|$|E

5|$|Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (SV 325, The Return of Ulysses to his Homeland) is {{an opera}} {{consisting}} of a prologue and five acts (later revised to three), set by Claudio Monteverdi to a libretto by Giacomo Badoaro. The opera was first performed at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the 1639–1640 carnival season. The story, taken from {{the second half of}} Homer's Odyssey, tells how constancy and virtue are ultimately rewarded, treachery and deception overcome. After his long journey home from the Trojan Wars Ulisse, king of Ithaca, finally returns to <b>his</b> <b>kingdom</b> where he finds that a trio of villainous suitors are importuning his faithful queen, Penelope. With the assistance of the gods, his son Telemaco and a staunch friend Eumete, Ulisse vanquishes the suitors and recovers <b>his</b> <b>kingdom.</b>|$|E

The Poles were persuaded by the papacy to give Izyaslav assistance recovering <b>his</b> <b>kingdom,</b> and on July 15, 1077, Izyaslav re-entered Kiev.|$|E
5|$|King Bhimdev {{established}} <b>his</b> <b>kingdom</b> in {{the region}} in the late 13th century, and brought many settlers to the islands.

The Delhi Sultanate annexed the islands in 1347–48 and controlled it until 1407. During this time, the islands were administered by the Muslim Governors of Gujarat, who were appointed by the Delhi Sultanate.|$|E
5|$|Mithridates the Great was {{the ruler}} of Pontus, a large kingdom in Asia Minor (modern Turkey), from 120 to 63 BC. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand <b>his</b> <b>kingdom,</b> and Rome for its part seemed equally eager for war and the spoils and {{prestige}} that it might bring. In 88 BC, Mithridates ordered {{the killing of a}} majority of the 80,000 Romans living in <b>his</b> <b>kingdom.</b> The massacre was the official reason given for the commencement of hostilities in the First Mithridatic War. The Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla forced Mithridates out of Greece proper, but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival, Gaius Marius. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus behaved as a {{sovereign}} monarch; outside <b>his</b> <b>kingdom,</b> {{he had an}} overall administrative and military authority over the provincial governors of the Roman eastern provinces. Inside Palmyra, no Roman provincial official had any authority; the king filled the government with Palmyrene staffs.
