5|$|A herd {{lives on}} the Rachel Carson {{component}} of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, a series of five small islands and several salt marshes. There were no horses at the Sanctuary until the 1940s. It is unclear whether the Bankers swam over from nearby Shackleford or were left by residents who <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> islands to graze livestock. They are owned and managed {{by the state of}} North Carolina and regarded as a cultural resource.|$|E
5|$|A print from Sheila's right {{ring finger}} {{was found on the}} right side of the butt, {{pointing}} downwards. A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints that could not be identified.|$|E
5|$|During {{an autopsy}} on Susan Snow, Assistant Medical Examiner Janet Miller {{detected}} {{the scent of}} bitter almonds, an odor distinctive to cyanide. Tests verified that Snow had died of acute cyanide poisoning. Investigators examined {{the contents of the}} Snow-Webking household and discovered the source of the cyanide: the bottle of Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules that both Snow and Webking <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> morning of Snow's death. Three capsules out of those that remained in the 60-capsule bottle were found to be laced with cyanide in toxic quantities.|$|E

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{had been}} used to separate isotopes before. Francis William Aston had used it to partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig Hertz had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it through a series of stages. In the United States, William D. Harkins had used it to separate chlorine. Kistiakowsky was familiar with the work of Charles G. Maier at the Bureau of Mines, who <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> process to separate gases.|$|E
5|$|Gord Downie {{released}} Secret Path in October 2016, {{a concept}} album about Chanie Wenjack's escape and death. It {{was accompanied by}} a graphic novel and animated film, aired on CBC Television. All proceeds go to the University of Manitoba's Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. Following his death in October 2017, Downie's brother Mike said he was aware of 40,000 teachers who <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> material in their classrooms, and hoped to continue this.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK banned some of Proactiv's {{advertising}} as misleading. A viewer {{complained that}} the celebrities were likely to have used the US version of Proactiv, which differs from the UK version. According to the ASA, the celebrities had signed statements saying they <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> UK version {{for a few weeks}} one to three years earlier, but the advertisements gave the appearance that they had continued to benefit from it, so the viewer's complaint was upheld.|$|E

5|$|In July 2004, Ellefson sued Mustaine for $18.5 {{million in}} Manhattan Federal Court. Ellefson alleged that Mustaine short-changed him on profits {{including}} tour merchandise and publishing royalties. The suit was dismissed in 2005, and Mustaine filed a countersuit alleging that Ellefson <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> band's name in {{an advertisement for}} musical equipment; the suit was settled out of court.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Louis Cormier, who {{was given}} the ring name Rudy Kay because he resembled a retired wrestler who <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> same name, {{spent much of his}} career {{balancing}} his roles as promoter and wrestler. He helped found the ESA in 1969 and operated shows under the title International Wrestling (IW). He won five tag team championships while teaming with The Beast and held two titles as a singles wrestler. He retired from active competition in 1982 and died of septicemia on May 25, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Most of the German bombers {{had passed}} over {{and had an}} {{altitude}} advantage over French fighters trying to gain height to intercept. Skirmishes were few and far between, but some French units suffered heavy losses. For the attack, the Germans <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> new C-250 Flammbombe (Flame Bomb) which had only been cleared for use 24 hours earlier. The incendiary bomb did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft.|$|E

The team's entry was not accepted, and the Brabham family later obtained legal recognition of their exclusive rights to the Brabham brand.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to social}} {{networking}} sites, technologies like {{short message service}} (SMS) and the telephone also {{had a significant impact}} on social interactions. In 2000, market research group Ipsos MORI reported that 81% of 15- to 24-year-old SMS users in the United Kingdom <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> service to coordinate social arrangements and 42% to flirt.|$|E
5|$|The arrow-head {{design of}} the castle's bastion {{reflected}} new ideas about defensive fortifications spreading out from Italy in the 16th century. Earlier Henrician castles <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> older European style of semi-circular bastions to avoid presenting any weak spots in the stonework, but an arrow-headed design enabled defenders to provide much more effective supporting fire against an attacking force. Yarmouth {{was among the first}} fortifications in Europe, and the first in England, to adopt this design.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} mediaeval {{medicine}} started roughly {{around the year}} 1000 with the {{school of medicine in}} Salerno, which combined elements of Latin, Greek, Arabic and Jewish medicine. Galen and Dioscorides (who <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> Graeco-Roman weight system) were among the most important authorities, but also Arabic physicians, whose works were systematically translated into Latin.|$|E
5|$|Two {{people were}} arrested in 1997 and four in 1998 for espionage activities. Of those arrested in 1997, one was a male {{permanent}} resident who was a deep-cover operative of a foreign intelligence service who <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> other person, a female Singaporean, as a collaborator. Three of the people arrested in 1998 were agents for a foreign intelligence agency. One of them had recruited the fourth person to collect intelligence on and to subvert a local community organization. All the detainees were subsequently released.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E

5|$|At 12:00, Dornal de Guy on Manche {{pulled away}} from her {{battered}} opponent, obeying Hamelin's order to join with his flagship. Hamelin then sent Manche and Créole after the slow Charlton and United Kingdom, using Vénus to chase Windham. Stewart <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> break in the action to effect rudimentary repairs to his battered ship and, with the agreement of his officers, determined to abandon the other ships and escape alone. Manche and the corvette rapidly overhauled and captured Charlton and United Kingdom, their captains Charles Mortlock and William D'Esterre making no serious attempt to resist or escape. Vénus however became embroiled in a lengthy chase as Stewart threw all not essential stores overboard {{in an effort to}} make his ship lighter and faster. For five days, Windham led Vénus in pursuit across the Bay of Bengal and it was not until 10:30 on 22 November that Hamelin finally closed with the British ship and forced her surrender.|$|E
5|$|BMC {{was active}} at {{two of the}} {{traditional}} season-opening races, attaining seventh place with Ballan in the Italian opener Trofeo Laigueglia, and eighth with Quinziato in the Belgian opener, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Ballan narrowly missed victory a week later at Montepaschi Strade Bianche, finishing second at the line behind Philippe Gilbert. Ballan acknowledged that Gilbert and not he <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> optimal tactics in the final sprint, but felt nonetheless pleased with his early-season form. The two {{had been part of}} a 19-rider group that made all the selections through the sectors of unpaved roads before the finish on cobblestones in Siena.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{encounters}} Chinese agent Wai Lin, {{who is also}} {{investigating the}} matter and the two agree to work together. They discover that Carver <b>had</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> GPS encoder to push the British ship off course and into Chinese waters to incite a war for ratings. With the British fleet {{on their way to}} China, Bond and Wai Lin find Carver's stealth ship, board it and prevent the firing of a British cruise missile at Beijing. They blow a hole in the ship, exposing it to radar, leading to its sinking averting war between Britain and China.|$|E
