40|$|Many {{children}} with hypertension, particularly those with new-onset hypertension related to glomerulonephritis, organ transplantation, {{or other forms}} of secondary hypertension, require treatment with a short-acting antihypertensive in order to quickly achieve blood pressure (BP) control. We administered <b>isradipine,</b> a short-acting, second-generation calcium antagonist, to 72 such children. Retrospective data collection was undertaken {{to determine the effects of}} <b>isradipine</b> treatment. The mean age of children treated with <b>isradipine</b> was 74 ± 55  months (mean±SD). Nearly all of these children had secondary hypertension and were initially treated as hospital inpatients for newly diagnosed hypertension. Mean <b>isradipine</b> dose was 0. 36 ± 0. 17  mg/kg per day, with no significant variation in dose according to patient age. <b>Isradipine</b> was administered three times per day in most instances, but 21 % of the time it was administered four times per day. An extemporaneous <b>isradipine</b> suspension was used in 62 % of treatment courses. BP control was achieved with <b>isradipine</b> alone in 38 children; the remainder received <b>isradipine</b> in combination with additional antihypertensives. Comparison of pre-treatment BP with BP obtained 8 ± 9  days later demonstrated a significant BP reduction with <b>isradipine</b> treatment, with a mean reduction of 14 ± 13  mmHg for systolic BP and 13 ± 15  mmHg for diastolic BP. There was no effect of <b>isradipine</b> treatment on heart rate. Adverse effects occurred in 9. 5 % of treatment courses, and included headache, flushing, dizziness, and tachycardia. We conclude that <b>isradipine</b> successfully lowers BP in hypertensive {{children with}} secondary forms of hypertension.

40|$|Twelve {{patients}} with essential hypertension were randomized in a double-blind cross-over study {{to investigate the}} blood pressure BP-lowering activity of <b>isradipine</b> regular formulation (RF) 2. 5 mg twice daily (between 7 and 8 a. m. and at approximately 6 p. m.), and <b>isradipine</b> modified release (MR), 5 mg once daily (between 7 and 8 a. m.). The two randomized treatment periods were separated by a placebo period. Patient compliance was similar between placebo and <b>isradipine</b> RF and MR treatment. As compared with placebo, <b>isradipine</b> RF decreased daytime BP by 10 mm Hg systolic (SBP, p < 0. 001) and by 6 mm Hg diastolic (DBP, p < 0. 01), and night SBP and DBP by 7 (p < 0. 05) and 3 mm Hg (P = NS), respectively. <b>Isradipine</b> MR reduced the daytime SBP 8 mm Hg (p < 0. 05) and DBP by 3 mm Hg (p = NS), and the night SBP by 1 mm Hg (p = NS) and DBP by < 1 mm Hg (P = NS). Analysis of variance showed that the interaction terms between the effects of treatment and time of day were not significant for SBP (F = 1. 56, p = 0. 24) or DBP (F = 1. 40, p = 0. 26) with <b>isradipine</b> RF treatment, but they were significant for SBP (F = 6. 33, p = 0. 03) and DBP (F = 5. 12, p = 0. 04) with <b>isradipine</b> MR treatment.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the effects of <b>isradipine</b> and placebo on blood pressure (BP) at the end of the dosing interval (‘trough'). Following a three-week placebo period, 187 patients who had previously shown a response to treatment with <b>isradipine</b> (based on office BP measurements) were randomized to double-blind treatment with 2. 5 mg <b>isradipine</b> twice daily or placebo for six weeks. Four of these patients withdrew from the study during the double-blind phase because of adverse events (one taking <b>isradipine</b> and three taking placebo). Blood pressure during the double-blind study was always measured 12 h after drug administration (trough values). The rate of normalization [defined as diastolic BP (DBP) ≤ 90 mm Hg] was 52 / 96 (54 %) in the isradipine-treated group compared with 30 / 87 (33 %) in the placebo group.

40|$|Abstract — Withdrawal {{hyperexcitability}} {{was seen}} in isolated mouse hippocampal slices, prepared after chronic treatment with ethanol, by inhalation for 2 weeks. The pattern of hyperexcitability differed from those seen previously when a different method of ethanol administration and a different strain of mice were used. Thresholds for field potentials were decreased, but the transient increase in paired pulse potentiation, reported earlier, was not evident. Chronic administration of the calcium channel antagonist, <b>isradipine</b> (PN- 200 - 110) during ethanol treatment significantly decreased the withdrawal syndrome, both in vivo and in vitro. Brain concentrations of <b>isradipine</b> during the test period {{were found to be}} sufficient to produce acute effects on the withdrawal hyperexcitability. No changes were seen in the field potentials when slices were prepared after treatment with <b>isradipine</b> alone.

Previous studies showed that <b>isradipine</b> did not protect against the hyperexcitability due to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A antagonism, so the results suggest that neuronal calcium channels may be involved in ethanol withdrawal hyperexcitability, but decreases in GABAA inhibition may not be important...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the influence of hypertension and of long-term treatment with the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist <b>isradipine</b> on the morphology of the femoral artery in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). DESIGN: Systolic blood pressure (SBP), body weight and morphology of the femoral artery were evaluated, and the ultrastructure of the endothelium was analysed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. METHODS: SHR were divided into three groups, a control group which was left untreated and two <b>isradipine</b> treatment groups, one at 0. 01 mg/kg per day and the other at 0. 1 mg/kg per day. Two age-matched groups of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were included in the study; one group was left untreated and was used as a normotensive reference group and the other was treated with <b>isradipine</b> at 0. 1 mg/kg per day. The study lasted 12 weeks. RESULTS: SBP did not change in the WKY rats, whether treated with <b>isradipine</b> or not, but was significantly increased in SHR as a function of age. The lower dose of <b>isradipine</b> did not alter SBP in the SHR, but the higher dose brought SBP values into the normal range after the first week of treatment. Light microscopy of sections of the femoral artery did not reveal any structural differences in the five rat groups examined. Both transmission and scanning electron microscopy showed endothelial alterations in the SHR, together with thickening of the internal elastic lamina. Treatment with <b>isradipine</b> significantly improved the morphology of the endothelium in SHR. The higher dose was more effective, but the lower dose partly countered the hypertension-dependent changes in the morphology of the endothelium. No significant modifications to the structure of the endothelium were noticed in isradipine-treated WKY rats compared with untreated WKY rats. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that structural changes occur in the endothelium of the femoral artery of SHR and that <b>isradipine</b> treatment has a protective effect.
