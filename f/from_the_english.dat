25|$|The first American {{publication}} was {{edited by}} Richard James Dunglison, whose father Robley Dunglison was physician to Thomas Jefferson. Dunglison edited {{the next four}} editions. These were: the Second American Edition (February 1862); the New Third American <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Fifth <b>English</b> Edition (May 1870); <b>the</b> New American <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Eighth <b>English</b> Edition (July 1878); and <b>the</b> New American <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Tenth <b>English</b> Edition (August 1883). W. W.

2500|$|In words {{coming from}} Middle English, most cases of <b>the</b> Modern <b>English</b> diphthongs [...] {{originate}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Middle <b>English</b> long monophthongs [...] through the Great Vowel Shift, although some cases of [...] originate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Middle <b>English</b> diphthongs [...]|$|R
50|$|Newton means <b>the</b> new {{enclosure}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>English</b> ‘niwe’ and ‘tun’. The medieval {{hamlet of}} Newton, which lay between Bower Hinton and Hurst, was first {{referred to in}} 1327. Stapleton was first recorded in 1195. It means <b>the</b> steep enclosure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>English</b> ‘steap’ and ‘tun’. Alternatively it may be <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>English</b> ‘stapel’ and ‘tun’, meaning ‘settlement by a post’.|$|R
5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this idea {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the social}} {{programs}} involved during the event were {{the opening ceremonies}} at the Tipsport arena. Included were musical performances <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> rock band Deep Purple, who performed at the opening ceremony 18 February, and the Slovak band Elán, who performed on 20 February. Concerts {{took place on the}} Liberec main square where medal award ceremonies occurred. In addition, there were special themed days, including Italian Day, Czech Day, Norwegian Day and Slovak Day. One recurring theme of this was free beer for people from these countries in some pubs at happy hour. The most famous fans at the championships were the Norwegians, who were very numerous compared with the other countries.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{perceived}} the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority, precipitating the First Bishops' War in 1639. Charles {{did not seek}} subsidies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Parliament to wage war, but instead raised an army without parliamentary aid and marched to Berwick-upon-Tweed, {{on the border of}} Scotland. Charles's army did not engage the Covenanters as the king feared the defeat of his forces, whom he believed to be significantly outnumbered by the Scots. In the Treaty of Berwick, Charles regained custody of his Scottish fortresses and secured the dissolution of the Covenanters' interim government, albeit at the decisive concession that both the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly of the Scottish Church were called.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problematic}} {{element is}} -ey, as in Romsey. This commonly means 'island', <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>English</b> -eg. However, -ey {{can also be}} derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>English</b> hæg, meaning 'enclosure', as in Hornsey.|$|R
50|$|The unusual name is {{probably}} derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>English</b> motes funta, meaning 'spring near the confluence' or 'spring of the moot' or possibly 'spring of <b>the</b> stone' (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>English</b> motere: sonte).|$|R
50|$|Fulwood was {{originally}} an Anglo-Saxon settlement, with <b>the</b> name originating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>English</b> language “Ful Wuda” meaning a “wet, marshy woodland“. However other {{interpretations of the}} name are “foul, dirty wood” and “folks wood” <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>English</b> “folc”.|$|R
5|$|David I {{established}} the first chartered burghs in Scotland, copying the burgher charters and Leges Burgorum (rules governing virtually {{every aspect of}} life and work) almost verbatim <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> customs of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. Early burgesses were usually Flemish, English, French and German, rather than Gaelic Scots. The burgh's vocabulary was composed totally of either Germanic and French terms. The councils that ran individual burghs were individually known as lie doussane, meaning the dozen.|$|E
5|$|England {{is highly}} industrialised, {{but since the}} 1970s {{there has been a}} decline in {{traditional}} heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy. Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of the economy is dominated by pharmaceuticals, cars (although many English marques are now foreign-owned, such as Land Rover, Lotus, Jaguar and Bentley), crude oil and petroleum <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> parts of North Sea oil along with Wytch Farm, aircraft engines and alcoholic beverages.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, he was {{appointed}} {{to sit on the}} University Council of Victoria's third university La Trobe on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a move away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> tradition prevalent in Australia towards and American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.|$|E

50|$|It is {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book as Cocheham. The name may be <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>English</b> cōc + hām, meaning 'cook village', i.e. 'village noted for its cooks', although the first element may be derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>English</b> cōc(e) meaning 'hill'.|$|R
5|$|Jamestown is {{the capital}} of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, located on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is also the {{historic}} main settlement of the island and is on its north-western coast. It is the island's only port and the centre of the island's road and communications network. It was founded when colonists <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> East India Company settled on the island in 1659 and was briefly occupied by the Dutch East India Company in 1673 before being recaptured. Many of the buildings built by the East India Company in the 1700s survive and give the town its distinctive Georgian flavour.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep is a prequel to the series, {{released}} for the PlayStation Portable in Japan on January 9, 2010, and in North America on September 7, 2010 {{with additional}} content. The game is set {{ten years before}} {{the events of the}} first Kingdom Hearts game, revealing the origins of the villain, Xehanort. It consists of four scenarios, three of which focus on one of the game's three protagonists, Terra, Ventus and Aqua. The game was re-released exclusively in Japan under the title Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix on January 20, 2011 with the content <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> versions as well as new features, such as an additional fifth scenario.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E
50|$|Witcombe means <b>the</b> white valley <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>English</b> ‘hwit’ and ‘cumb’.

It may also be ‘wide valley’ from Old English.|$|R

5|$|Ruisdael's {{work was}} in {{demand in the}} Dutch Republic during his lifetime. Today it is spread across private and {{institutional}} collections around the world; the National Gallery in London, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, and the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg hold the largest collections. Ruisdael shaped landscape painting traditions worldwide, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Romantics to the Barbizon school in France, and the Hudson River School in the US, and influenced generations of Dutch landscape artists.|$|E
5|$|Since his {{resignation}} <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>English</b> Concert in 2003, Pinnock has continued {{his career as}} a conductor, appearing with major orchestras and opera companies around the world. He has also performed and recorded as a harpsichordist in solo and chamber music and conducted and otherwise trained student groups at conservatoires. Trevor Pinnock won a Gramophone Award for his recording of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos with the European Brandenburg Ensemble, an occasional orchestra formed to mark his 60th birthday.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{became more}} popular still {{following}} the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting {{was no longer}} restricted to the nobility. Although spread throughout France, a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions. During the early 19th century, British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France. The British brought their own hunting dogs, and {{this resulted in a}} change of preference as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow to the existence of the Picardy Spaniel. In addition the infusion of blood <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Setter into the local spaniel population created the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E

5|$|Thomas' name {{suggests}} a strong likelihood {{that he came}} from Buittle in Kirkcudbrightshire, Galloway, lands in {{the control of the}} Douglas family. In 1388, it was claimed that he had been a scholar of Decrees (i.e. Canon law) at the University of Oxford for five years, a claim to some extent confirmed by the grant of safe-conduct <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> crown on 18 February 1380, to travel and study at Oxford for a year.|$|E
5|$|When Scotland finally {{paid the}} ransom in 1424, James, aged 32, {{returned}} with his English bride determined to assert this authority. Several {{members of the}} Albany family were executed, and he succeeded in centralising control {{in the hands of}} the crown, but at the cost of increasingly unpopularity and he was assassinated in 1437. His son James II when he came of age in 1449, continued his father's policy of weakening the great noble families, most notably taking on the powerful Black Douglas family that had come to prominence at the time of Robert I. His attempt to take Roxburgh <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> in 1460 succeeded, but at the cost of his life as he was killed by an exploding artillery piece.|$|E
5|$|With Marais's loans {{combined}} with the Ebden scholarship, Smuts began to enjoy a degree of financial security. Though far from affluent {{he was at least}} able to meet his basic expenses. From his second year onwards Smuts began to enter more into the social arena of the university. He ceased to be lonely, making a number of friends and acquaintances, principally amongst the other colonial students. Though no longer so reclusive as he had been during his first year, he remained extremely serious and devoted to his work; an attitude which served as a barrier separating him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> undergraduates, though not from the Fellows at Cambridge, with many of whom he struck up friendships.|$|E
