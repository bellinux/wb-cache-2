5|$|STS-108 Endeavour {{visited the}} ISS, {{delivering}} over three tons of equipment, supplies, {{and a fresh}} crew to the orbiting outpost. The hatches were opened between Endeavour and the ISS <b>Destiny</b> <b>Laboratory</b> on December 7, enabling the ten crew members to greet one another. The Expedition 3 crew officially ended their 117-day residency on board the International Space Station on December 8 as their custom Soyuz seat-liners were transferred to Endeavour for the return trip home. The transfer of the Expedition 4 seat-liners to the Soyuz return vehicle attached to the station marked the official exchange of crews.|$|E
5|$|With {{the landing}} of Discovery on June 12, 1998, the Phase One program concluded. Techniques and {{equipment}} {{developed during the}} program assisted the development of Phase Two: initial assembly of the International Space Station (ISS). The arrival of the <b>Destiny</b> <b>Laboratory</b> Module in 2001 {{marked the end of}} Phase Two and the start of Phase Three, the final outfitting of the station, completed in 2012. In 2015, a reconfiguration of the American segment was completed to allow its docking ports to accommodate NASA-sponsored commercial crew vehicles, that are expected to start visiting the ISS in 2017.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 2001, Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the ISS, {{bringing}} the five American crew members of STS-98 temporarily to the station. The mission was originally planned for mid-January, but was delayed due to NASA's concerns about some cables on the shuttles. This mission brought the U.S. built <b>Destiny</b> <b>laboratory,</b> {{which has a}} mass of 16 short tons. It was installed {{with the use of}} the shuttle's robotic Canadarm, controlled by Marsha Ivins. Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. Curbeam helped with the installation during a spacewalk. The Destiny module had a cost of US$1.4billion, and would be used primarily for scientific research. During the spacewalk an ammonia coolant leak created a contamination scare, which happened when Curbeam was hooking up coolant lines to Destiny. The other two spacewalks went ahead without any problems. While the Shuttle was docked, the control of the station's orientation was switched from propellants to electrically powered gyroscopes, which had been installed in September 2000. The gyroscopes had not been used earlier due to the lack of key navigational electronics.|$|E
50|$|Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the Space Station at 15:17 GMT {{to begin}} a week of joint {{operations}} for the STS-112 and Expedition 5 crews. With commander Jeffrey Ashby at the controls, Atlantis' docking system engaged the Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (<b>Destiny</b> <b>Laboratory's</b> forward docking port) {{in the front of}} the space station as the two spacecraft sailed 245 miles above central Asia at five miles per second. Crew members of Atlantis were the first visitors for the Expedition 5 station crew who arrived at the outpost the first week of June 2002.|$|R

40|$|The Fluids and Combustion Facility (FCF) is a modular, multi-user, two-rack {{facility}} {{dedicated to}} combustion and fluids {{science in the}} US <b>Laboratory</b> <b>Destiny</b> on the International Space Station. FCF is a permanent facility {{that is capable of}} accommodating up to ten combustion and fluid science investigations per year. FCF research in combustion and fluid science supports NASA's Exploration of Space Initiative for on-orbit fire suppression, fire safety, and space system fluids management. The Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) is one of two racks in the FCF. The CIR major structural elements include the International Standard Payload Rack (ISPR), Experiment Assembly (optics bench and combustion chamber), Air Thermal Control Unit (ATCU), Rack Door, and Lower Structure Assembly (Input/Output Processor and Electrical Power Control Unit). The load path through the rack structure is outlined. The CIR modal survey was conducted to validate the load path predicted by the CIR finite element model (FEM). The modal survey is done by experimentally measuring the CIR frequencies and mode shapes. The CIR model was test correlated by updating the model to represent the test mode shapes. The correlated CIR model delivery is required by NASA JSC at Launch- 10. 5 months. The test correlated CIR flight FEM is analytically integrated into the Shuttle for a coupled loads analysis of the launch configuration. The analysis frequency range of interest is 0 - 50 Hz. A coupled loads analysis is the analytical integration of the Shuttle with its cargo element, the Mini Payload Logistics Module (MPLM), in the Shuttle cargo bay. For each Shuttle launch configuration, a verification coupled loads analysis is performed to determine the loads in the cargo bay as part of the structural certification process...|$|R
40|$|The {{first phase}} of the International Space Station {{construction}} has been completed, and research has begun. Russian, U. S., and Canadian hardware is on orbit, and Italian logistics modules have visited often. With the delivery of the U. S. <b>Laboratory,</b> <b>Destiny,</b> significant research capability is in place, and dozens of U. S. and Russian experiments have been conducted. Crew members have been on orbit continuously since November 2000. Several "bumps in the road" have occurred along the way, and each has been systematically overcome. Enormous amounts of hardware and software are being developed by the International Space Station partners and participants around the world and are largely on schedule for launch. Significant {{progress has been made in}} the testing of completed elements at launch sites in the United States and Kazakhstan. Over 250, 000 kilograms of flight hardware have been delivered to the Kennedy Space Center and integrated testing of several elements wired together has progressed extremely well. Mission control centers are fully functioning in Houston, Moscow, and Canada, and operations centers Darmstadt, Tsukuba, Turino, and Huntsville will be going on line as they are required. Extensive coordination efforts continue among the space agencies of the five partners and two participants, involving 16 nations. All of them continue to face their own challenges and have achieved significant successes. This paper will discuss the contributions of the International Space Station partners and participants, their accomplished milestones, and upcoming events. The International Space Station program, the largest and most complicated peacetime project in history, has progressed part way up the mountain, and the partners are continuing their journey to the top. The International Space Station (ISS) is unprecedented in its technological, engineering, and management complexity, and is one of the largest international collaborations ever undertaken. The ISS is a dramatic example of the ability of nations to work together as a team toward common goals and dreams. The challenges encountered and overcome by the international ISS team have been likened to climbing a mountain. Construction of the ISS has progressed rapidly in the past year. ISS is now a functioning microgravity laboratory in space hosting a permanent human presence, prompting the characterization that we are "part way up the mountain, and the team continues its climb. ...|$|R
40|$|The Mice Drawer System (MDS) is an Italian Space Agency (ASI) {{facility}} {{which is}} able to support mice onboard the International Space Station during long-duration exploration missions (from 100 to 150 -days) by living space, food, water, ventilation and lighting. Mice can be accommodated either individually (maximum 6) or in groups (4 pairs). MDS is integrated in the Space Shuttle middeck during transportation (uploading and downloading) to the ISS and in an EXPRESS Rack in <b>Destiny,</b> the US <b>Laboratory</b> during experiment execution. Osteoporosis is a debilitating disease that afflicts millions of people worldwide. One of the physiological changes experienced by astronauts during space flight is the accelerated loss of bone mass {{due to the lack}} of gravitational loading on the skeleton. This bone loss experienced by astronauts is similar to osteoporosis in the elderly population. MDS will help investigate the effects of unloading on transgenic (foreign gene that has been inserted into its genome to exhibit a particular trait) mice with the Osteoblast Stimulating Factor- 1, OSF- 1, a growth and differentiation factor, and to study the genetic mechanisms underlying the bone mass pathophysiology. MDS will test the hypothesis that mice with an increased bone density are likely to be more protected from osteoporosis, when the increased bone mass is a direct effect of a gene involved in skeletogenesis (skeleton formation). Osteoporosis is a debilitating disease that afflicts millions worldwide. One of the physiological changes experienced by astronauts during space flight is the accelerated loss of bone mass {{due to the lack of}} gravitational loading on the skeleton, a loss that is similar to osteoporosis in the elderly population on Earth. Osteoblast Stimulating Factor- 1 (OSF- 1), also known as pleiotrophin (PTN) or Heparin-Binding Growth- Associated Molecule (HB-GAM) belongs to a family of secreted heparin binding proteins [...] OSF- 1 is an extracellular matrix-associated growth and differentiation factor that is normally expressed in cartilage; it can stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of human osteoprogenitor cells (cell that differentiate into an osteoblast) in vitro. The Mice Drawer System will study the effects of microgravity on transgenic mouse bones in order to identify genetic mechanisms playing a role in the reduction of the bone mass observed in humans and animals as a consequence of long-duration (greater than 100 days) microgravity exposure. Onboard the ISS, MDS is relatively self-sufficient; a crewmember will check the health status of the rodents on a daily basis, by assessing them through the viewing window. Water levels will be assessed by the crew daily and refilled as needed. Replacement of the food bars and replacement of the waste filters will be conducted inflight by crewmembers every 20 -days...|$|R

40|$|The Lab-on-a-Chip Application Development - Portable Test System, {{known as}} LOCAD-PTS, was {{launched}} to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard Space Shuttle Discovery (STS- 116) on December 9 th, 2006. Since that time, {{it has remained}} onboard ISS and has been operated by the crew on 10 separate occasions LOCAD-PTS is a handheld device for rapid biochemical analysis; it consists of a spectrophotometer, a series of interchangeable cartridges, a pipette and several clean/sterilized swabbing kits to obtain samples from ISS surfaces. Sampling, quantitative analysis and data retrieval is performed onboard, therefore reducing the need to return samples to Earth. Less than 20 minutes are required from sampling to data, significantly faster than existing culture-based methods on ISS, which require 3 - 5 days. Different cartridges are available {{for the detection of}} different target molecules (simply by changing the formulation within each cartridge), thereby maximizing the benefit and applications addressed by a single instrument. Initial tests on ISS have focused on the detection of the bact. erial macromolecule endotoxin, a component of bacterial cell walls. LOCAD-PTS detects endotoxin with a cartridge that contains a formulation known as Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay. LAL is derived from blood of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, and detects enodotoxin with an enzyme cascade that triggers generation Of a yellow colored dye, p-nitroanaline. The more p-nitroanaline product, the more endotoxin is in the original sample. To enable quantitative analysis, the absorbance of this color is measured by LOCAD-PTS through a 395 nm filter and compared with an internal calibration curve, to provide a reading on the LED display that ranges from 0. 05 Endotoxin Units (EU) /ml to 5 EU/ml. Several surface sites were analyzed within ISS between March 2007 and February 2008, including multiple locations in the US <b>Laboratory</b> <b>Destiny,</b> Node 1 Unity, AMock, and Service Module Zvezda. The goals of this initial study were to i) test the cleanliness of reagents/supplies on orbit, ii) test the crew's ability to collect and process a sample in microgravity without contamination, iii) demonstrate nominal function of the LOCAD-PTS, and iv) provide a general survey of endotoxin within the ISS. The surface sites varied greatly in terms of their frequency-of-use and material texture/composition; from relatively smooth aluminum, to fabric, to the room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) rubber of a Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) spacesuit. Results showed that: i) the swabbing kits and reagents remained clean on orbit, ii) the crew could collect and process a sample without contamination, and iii) the LOCAD-PTS functioned nominally in > 99 % of the 55 tests completed. We will present detailed results of the survey of endotoxin on ISS surfaces. These results and technology are important in the near-term - by providing an extra tool in the toolbox for ISS microbial monitoring. They are also important in the longer term as valuable preparation for human exploration of the Moon and Mars. One of the proposed science goals for the human exploration of Mars will be to detect and characterize any indigenous biological molecules that may exist on the Martian surface. To achieve that goal, the crew must have the technology available onboard to differentiate indigenous biology from any terrestrial biological material brought to Mars by the spacecraft and crew (termed 'forward contamination'). The LAL assay is already one of the official methods used by NASA's planetary protection program to certify cleanliness of interplanetary robotic spacecraft prior to launch; and therefore endotoxin is a good marker of forward contamination (as well as other microbial molecules detectable with LOCAD-PTS e. g. box- 1, 3 -glucan and lipoteichoic acid). Furthermore, the distribution and abundance of these molecules on the ISS provides a good indicator of what to expect on the Crew Exploratioehicle Orion, the lunar lander Antares, and future crewed spacecraft destined for Mars. In addition, technology such as LOCAD-PTS has been proposed to help evaluate forward contamination during lunar surface operations by the crew, as preparation for the human exploration of Mars...|$|R
