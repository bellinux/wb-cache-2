50|$|The {{horizontal}} and vertical adjustment range of a firearm sight is often advertised by the manufacturer using mils.

This optical sight {{is similar to the}} PSO-1 4×24 sight used on the Russian SVD rifle and the Romanian I.O.R.

The BDC feature must be tuned at the factory for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of rifle and cartridge (the 7,9 M75 sniper ammunition) at a predefined air density.

5000|$|It may {{be noted}} from the diagram above {{that no matter}} how [...] "tight" [...] the heel bend, {{reversing}} the stick head over the ball, with a [...] "traditional" [...] style hockey stick head, always requires both a vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the stick head position. This is not anywhere near as difficult as it was with the very long head stick and this sort of adjustment will be almost sub-conscious in an experienced player. Note too, that when the shaft is held vertically, the ball is more securely stopped, when on the ground, to the toe side of the shaft rather than {{in the middle of the}} shaft. Novice players frequently assume that the centre of the ball will align with the centre of the shaft when stopping the ball in this way and as a result, the ball deflects off to the heel side and usually into their feet. Because of the heel slope on the stick head the vertical shaft stop is actually much easier to carry out securely (when the ball is on the ground) if the handle is held at least 10° off the vertical, with the top of the handle sloped to the player's left. When the ball in the air, a little off the ground, below knee height for example, is often easier to catch the ball correctly if the handle is vertical.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Appropriations {{of the military}} services provide resources {{for a wide variety}} of programs, including manpower support programs. It is assumed that some relationship exists between changes in manpower levels and O&M tunding, often referred to as the O&M support "tail"This research examined the O&M, Navy and O&M, Marine Corps appropriations to identify programs which provide funding that surports the general active duty population of the Navy and Marine Corps. A framework to be used in calculating the O&M support "tail" that accompanies manpower adjustments was developed. It was determined that the O&M support "tail" was small and specific to certain manpower support programs. Many O&M manpower support costs will not change until force structure and infrastructure changes take place. It is concluded that O&M adjustments based on changes to manpower should be targeted only at specific programs whose costs vary with the manpower level.

The performance, expressed as the deviation from the earth vertical (measured in degrees), was calculated by a computer. The three groups fulfilled the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>adjustments</b> within the same accuracy. No relation with age, sex or severity of scoliotic deformity was found.

This optical sight features 4× magnification, a 6° field of view, and the objective lens is 24 mm in diameter.

The LPS 4×6° TIP2 elevation turret features bullet drop compensation (BDC) in 50 m increments for engaging point and area targets at ranges from 100 m up to 1,000 m.

5000|$|Using extreme {{examples}} {{is useful}} {{as a means of}} demonstrating effects that occur in less extreme configurations but are much more difficult to spot and therefore to explain. The first observation is an easy one (top left in the image captioned [...] "Reversed head in various…"). If the stick head is rotated onto the reverse (lighter colour) the toe is not going to disappear into the ground to enable the reverse side of the stick to be presented to the ball—a vertical adjustment is necessary. Secondly (top right), if the handle of the stick is kept at exactly the same angle and rotated, a <b>horizontal</b> <b>adjustment</b> is necessary to bring the reversed head to a position where contact will be made with the ball. The third figure (bottom left) shows these adjustments having been made (and a change to the angle of the handle because the position of the hand holding the stick at the top would be about the same as it is when gripping the stick in the forehand position), but the area of stick head making contact with the ball is very small; so control may not be adequate. The fourth figure (bottom right) demonstrates that to get good contact with the ball on a larger area of the reversed head, it is necessary to move the handle much nearer to the vertical. This means the player must bring the ball in very close to the feet and come to a more upright dribbling position—this in turn impairs the ability to scan the pitch and keep the ball in peripheral vision at the same time—a considerable disadvantage when dribbling to evade opponents.|$|E
