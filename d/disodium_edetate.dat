It is used in topical treatment of dry eyes and is now commercially available in oil based surfactant containing eye drops. Surfactants can irritate the eye surface causing burning, itching and irritation of the conjunctiva, and oil-based drops can result in blurred vision. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop surfactant free aqueous 0. 05 % (w/v) CyA eye drops where the drug is present in an aqueous vehicle containing CyA/cyclodextrin (CyA/CD) nanoparticles. The effects of the natural α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins (αCD, βCD and γCD), as well as of the water soluble hydroxypropyl derivatives of γCD and αCD (HPγCD, HPαCD) and randomly methylated βCD (RMβCD), were determined in pure water. αCD had the best solubilizing effect increasing the solubility of CyA above 0. 05 % upon addition of only 5 % (w/v) αCD. γCD did not have as good solubilizing effect but was tested further due to its superior ability to form nanoparticles and its favorable toxicological profile. Seven eye drop formulations were prepared and tested. All contained 0. 05 % (w/v) CyA in addition to polyvinyl alcohol, benzalkonium chloride, <b>disodium</b> <b>edetate</b> and various amounts of CD (αCD, γCD and mixtures thereof).

Samples were collected during 150 min and analysed for etoposide concentration with high-performance liquid chromatography. Conversion of prodrug to etoposide during incubation with gastric juice was negligible. There was significant conversion during incubation with bile at pH 7 - 8. The percentage of prodrug converted to etoposide at pH 8 after 60 min was 78 +/- 18 % (mean +/- S. D.) for a 0. 1 mg ml- 1 prodrug solution and 36 +/- 26 % for 0. 5 mg ml- 1. At pH 7, after 60 min 22 % of prodrug was converted to etoposide when incubated at 0. 1 mg ml- 1 and 10 % at 0. 5 mg ml- 1. No conversion was found after inactivation of alkaline phosphate (AP) by overnight heating of bile at 65 degrees C or by the addition of <b>disodium</b> <b>edetate</b> to the bile.

40|$|Objective : To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} the addition of <b>disodium</b> <b>edetate</b> (EDTA) to propofol on haemodynamics, ionised calcium and magnesium serum concentrations, and adverse events during cardiac surgery. Design: Double-blind, randomised, multicenter trial. Setting: Operating room and intensive care unit of 5 academic health centres. Patients: A total of 102 evaluable patients, aged 34 to 85 years, undergoing first-time, elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Interventions: Comparison of propofol with EDTA and propofol without EDTA, each in conjunction with the opioid sufentanil, for intraoperative anaesthesia and postoperative sedation. Measurements and Results: There were no significant differences at any time between the two formulations in any clinical chemistry measurements, including ionised calcium, ionised magnesium, total calcium, parathyroid hormone, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, potassium, and phosphate. During bypass, the mean concentration of ionised calcium decreased to below the normal range, but the decrease was similar in both groups (propofol with EDTA, 0. 98 ± 0. 07 mmol/L [N = 51]; propofol, 0. 99 ± 0. 10 mmol/L [N = 51]; p = NS). Calcium concentration returned to normal after rewarming. Mean ionised magnesium concentrations remained within normal limits in both groups. Similarly, there were no clinically meaningful differences between treatments with respect to haemodynamic variables, efficacy variables, or incidence of adverse events.

Methods: In vitro susceptibility assays were performed against several gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria representative of the microbial flora of epithelial surfaces or colonizing the conjunctiva, as well as against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Using different concentrations of SHMG alone or in combination with EDTA, the minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations against these organisms were assessed. In addition, 8 brands of multidose eye drops containing 0. 002 % SHMG and 0. 1 % EDTA as preservative were tested for antimicrobial activity using the antimicrobial effectiveness test recommended by the international pharmacopoeias. Results: The minimal inhibitory and bactericidal/fungicidal concentration values of SHMG ranged from 0. 0025 % to 0. 0125 % for bacteria and from 0. 125 % to 0. 50 % for mold and yeast. Susceptibility testing demonstrated that the addition of EDTA substantially increased the SHMG activity against all bacterial and fungal strains. The preservative effectiveness test was applied to commercial eye drops. All the drop solutions met the criteria reported by the U. S. Pharmacopeia for parenteral and ophthalmic preparations. All products also satisfied the major acceptance criteria of the European Pharmacopeia with respect to the antifungal activity. With regard to the antibacterial activity, the less-stringent criteria of the European Pharmacopeia were fulfilled.

Demonstrados laboratorialmente níveis séricos tóxicos de chumbo, foi submetido à quelação com EDTA e à retirada cirúrgica do projétil, com boa recuperação da polineuropatia, sem necessidade ulterior de corticosteróides. Enfatiza-se: 1) o possível papel do sistema imune na fisiopatogenia da intoxicação por chumbo, podendo ser um dos motivos das diferentes apresentações clínicas das neuropatias plúmbicas na infância e no adulto; 2) a importância da retirada do {{material}} plúmbeo quando alojado em articulações. This is a {{case report}} of a twenty-five years old man who developed, due to lead intoxication, a severe axonal peripheral predominantly motor neuropathy, after a shotgun injury. The projectile was retained in the right hip. Before this diagnosis had been done he was treated with corticosteroids in immunosuppressive doses and showed an improvement, but he had worsened at each attempt to interrupt the drug. Because he had also other signs of lead intoxication, such as abdominal cramps, severe anemia and seizures it was search for the blood levels of lead that was 101. 2 }&# 956;g/dl. The patient was treated with calcium <b>disodium</b> <b>edetate</b> and surgical removal of lead fragments. After {{that he had a}} good outcome with no need of corticosteroids. It is emphasized the possible relevance of the immune system on the mechanism of plumbic intoxication and the importance of the withdrawal of the lead material retained in joints...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to optimize the formulation factors for maximum in vitro permeation of gatifloxacin from aqueous drops through excised goat cornea and to evaluate the permeation characteristics of drug from selected marketed eyedrop formulations. Permeation studies were conducted by putting 1 mL of formulation on the cornea (0. 67 cm 2) fixed between the donor and receptor compartments of an all-glass modified Franz diffusion cell and measuring gatifloxacin concentration in the receptor (containing normal saline under stirring) by spectrophotometry at 291. 5 nm, after 120 minutes. Raising the drug concentration of the drops increased the drug permeation but decreased the percent permeation and the in vitro ocular availability. Raising the pH of the formulation from pH 5 to 7. 2 increased both the drug permeation and the in vitro ocular availability. Eyedrops containing benzalkonium chloride (BAK; 0. 01 % wt/vol) and <b>disodium</b> <b>edetate</b> (EDTA; 0. 01 % wt/vol) showed maximum permeation, followed by Zymar, BAK (0. 01 % wt/vol), Gatilox, Gatiquin, and Gate (statistically significantP<. 05 compared with control). In vitro titration of the formulations with 0. 1 N NaOH indicated the presence of a buffer in Zymar (pH 6) and Gate (pH 5. 8), which may cause irritation and induce lacrimation, resulting in reduced ocular availability in vivo. Thus, formulation with BAK and EDTA, which is unbuffered, has a better likelihood of being absorbed in vivo. The BAK-EDTA formulation significantly (P<. 05) increased the permeation of gatifloxacin through paired excised corneas of goat, sheep, and buffalo, compared with the control formulation. The goat cornea showed the greatest increase in permeation, followed by the sheep and buffalo corneas...|$|E
40|$|Objetivo: Avaliar a eficácia de um produto usado habitualmente para limpeza de lentes de contato (CompleteÒ: poliexametileno de biguanida (TrisChemTM), tiloxapol, trometamina e EDTA em solução isotônica estéril) na desinfecção do cone do tonômetro de aplanação. Métodos: O cone permaneceu imerso na solução no período médio de 28 minutos. Foi utilizado um recipiente para limpeza de lentes de contato e um suporte de isopor. Ao final de cada dia, durante 22 dias, foram {{realizadas}} culturas para fungos e bactérias, exames diretos para fungos e bacterioscopia por Gram. Foi testado "in vitro" o poder bactericida e fungicida do produto para S. aureus ATCC# 25923, E. coli ATCC# 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC# 27853, C. albicans ATCC# 76615, A. niger ATCC# 16404. Resultados: Nas culturas, nos exames diretos para fungos e nas bacterioscopias por Gram não foram identificados microrganismos. No estudo "in vitro", foram necessárias 48 horas para eliminação completa de todas cepas estudadas. Conclusão: Não foram encontradas bactérias e fungos em todos exames realizados da solução e recipiente. No entanto, os testes "in vitro" demonstraram que o tempo de imersão do cone na solução (média de 28 minutos) é insuficiente para eliminação completa dos microrganismos, o que inviabiliza o uso desse produto na desinfecção do cone plástico do tonômetro de aplanação. Purpose: To {{evaluate the}} efficacy of a product which is normally used for cleaning of contact lenses (CompleteÒ: polyhexamethylene biguanide (Tris ChemTM), Tyloxapol, USP, Tromethamine, USP, and <b>Edetate</b> <b>disodium,</b> USP, in sterile isotonic solution) in the disinfection of the cone of the applanation tonometer. Methods: The cone remained immersed in the solution for an average period of 28 minutes. A container for cleaning the contact lenses and a polystyrene support were used. At {{the end of each}} day, for 22 days, cultures for fungi and bacteria were carried out as well as direct examinations for fungi and Gram bacterioscopies for S. aureus. The bactericide and fungicide power of the product for S. aureus ATCC# 25923, E. coli ATCC# 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC# 27853, C. albicans ATCC# 76615 and A. niger ATCC# 16404 was verified in vitro. Results: In the cultures, in the direct examination for fungi and in the bacterioscopy by Gram, microorganisms were not identified. In the study in vitro, 48 hours were necessary for the complete elimination of all studied bacteria. Conclusions: Bacteria and fungi were not found in any of the examinations carried out in the solution and in the receptacle {{despite the fact that the}} tests in vitro had demonstrated that the time of immersion of the head in the solution (average of 28 minutes) was insufficient for the complete elimination of the microorganisms, what makes the use of this product impractical in the disinfection of the plastic cone of the applanation tonometer...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate the effect of formulation factors on in vitro permeation of moxifloxacin from aqueous drop through freshly excised goat, sheep, and buffalo corneas. Aqueous isotonic ophthalmic solutions of moxifloxacin hydrochloride of different concentrations (pH 7. 2) or 0. 5 % (wt/vol) solutions of different pH or 0. 5 % solutions (pH 7. 2) containing different preservatives were made. Permeation characteristics of drug were evaluated by putting 1 mL formulation on freshly excised cornea (0. 50 cm 2) fixed between donor and receptor compartments of an all-glass modified Franz diffusion cell and measuring the drug permeated in the receptor (containing 10 mL bicarbonate ringer at 37 °C under stirring) by spectrophotometry at 291 nm, after 120 minutes. Statistical analysis was done by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s test. Increase in drug concentration in the formulation resulted in an increase in the quantity permeated but a decrease in percentage permeation. Increase in pH of the solution from 5. 5 to 7. 2 increased drug permeation, indicating pH-dependent transport. Compared with control formulation, moxifloxacin 0. 5 % (wt/vol) solution (pH 7. 2) containing <b>disodium</b> <b>edetate</b> (EDTA) (0. 01 % wt/vol) produced significantly (P<. 05) higher permeation with all the corneas. Formulation with benzyl alcohol significantly (P<. 05) increased permeation with buffalo cornea compared with its control. Presence of benzalkonium chloride (BAK) (0. 01 % wt/vol) and EDTA (0. 01 % wt/vol) in the formulation increased permeation to the maximum with all the corneas. The results suggest that moxifloxacin 0. 5 % ophthalmic solution (pH 7. 2) containing BAK (0. 01 %) and EDTA (0. 01 %) provides increased in vitro ocular availability through goat, sheep, and buffalo corneas...|$|E
40|$|The {{appropriate}} clinical {{management of}} children who are moderately poisoned with lead (Pb) is under active investigation. To determine the pattern of change in blood Pb (BPb) levels in the absence of chelation therapy, we followed moderately Pb-poisoned children (initial blood Pb levels 1. 21 - 2. 66 mumol/l or 25 - 55 micrograms/dl) for 6 months with repeated BPb level measurements. Chelation therapy was not administered because all the children had negative lead mobilization tests indicating limited response to the chelating agent, calcium <b>disodium</b> <b>edetate</b> (CaNa 2 EDTA). Eligible children received the following interventions: notification of the health department to remediate lead hazards; reinforced educational efforts about the toxicity sources and treatment of Pb during 10 clinic and 3 home visits; and iron therapy for children with ferritin levels less than 16 micrograms/l. To quantify the lead paint hazards in the home, we combined a visual rating of the surfaces (intact to peeling) with an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement of the lead content of the painted surface. The sum of these assessments is termed the home environmental score (HES). Data were analyzed from 79 children. BPb levels declined by 27 %, on average, over 6 months. HES was correlated with BPb at enrollment, but neither the initial nor later HES measurements predicted BPb at other time points. The HES was highest at enrollment and declined by 50 % and 75 % at the second and third home visits, respectively. However, only a minority of the children (20 %) achieved an HES of 0, indicating no lead paint hazards at home. Despite some ongoing Pb exposure, a parallel fall in BPb levels was observed in subgroups of children with either initially low or high HES (above or below the median HES of 37). Iron status did not account for the change in BPb levels. These data provide evidence that our measure, the HES, is quantifiably related to BPb levels in children, that this correlation is significant only prior to intervention; and that BPb levels decline in children who are moderately poisoned with Pb after they are enrolled in a comprehensive intervention program, {{even in the absence of}} chelation therapy and in the presence of ongoing lead paint exposure and Fe deficiency...|$|E
