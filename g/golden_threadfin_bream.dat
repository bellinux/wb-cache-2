The notchedfin <b>threadfin</b> <b>bream</b> is an {{important}} commercial species for the trawl fishery in Taiwan, and it is caught in substan-tial numbers year round by small trawlers in waters off southwestern Taiwan. Unfortunately, since the catch statistics of all Nemipterus species are pooled as“threadfin bream”, accurate esti-mates of neither the yield nor fishing effort of this species are available. However, the annual yield of <b>threadfin</b> <b>bream</b> in southwestern Taiwan decreased from 510 MT in 1989 to 54 MT in 1997, suggesting that the abundances of threadfin species might have decreased over the past 2 decades. Since the notchedfin <b>threadfin</b> <b>bream</b> comprises the major proportion of the catch of <b>threadfin</b> <b>bream</b> species in southwestern Taiwanese waters, an evaluation of the stock sta-tus of this species is urgently needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} acid and {{alkaline}} solubilizing processes on {{the properties of}} the protein based film from <b>threadfin</b> <b>bream</b> surimi was investigated. Surimi films prepared from both processes had the similar light transmission, tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) (P< 0. 05).

The protein concentration in the film-forming solution directly affected {{the properties of the}} film. Increase in protein concentration resulted in an increase in TS, EAB as well as WVP. The film prepared by acid solubilizing process had an increase in yellowish color as evidenced by the continuous increase in b* and E* values during the storage at r oom temperature. The acid and alkali solubilizing processes caused the degradation of muscle protein in surimi, especially with increasing exposure time.
