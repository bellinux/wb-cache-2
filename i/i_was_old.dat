500|$|Wanderone enjoyed {{promoting}} a feud with world champion Mosconi {{over how to}} present pool— either as a rough-and-tumble gambling game (Wanderone) or as a genteel pastime and art form (Mosconi). Mosconi's widow, Flora, said of the rivalry, [...] "My husband hated Minnesota Fats because he felt that [...] was always hurting {{the image of the}} game instead of helping it." [...] Wanderone would state smugly, [...] "I may have 'given away' a few games to deserving competitors, but I have never lost a real money game since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough to spell 'Weeli Mesconi'." [...] The two competed on Valentine's Day (February 14), 1978 in a televised match on ABC's Wide World of Sports. With almost 11 million viewers, the game was the second-highest rated episode of the show for that year, behind only the Muhammad Ali vs. Leon Spinks rematch. The game was held at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, and was announced by Howard Cosell. Although Wanderone lost the game, he won the audience with his banter, and with his joking manner. Mosconi on the other hand was reportedly perceived as cold.|$|E
2500|$|I {{think about}} my father being called ‘boy’, my uncle being called ‘boy’, my brother, coming back from Vietnam and being called ‘boy’. So I {{questioned}} myself: “What does a black man have to do before he’s given the respect as a man?” So when I was 18 years old, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough to fight and die for my country, old enough to drink, old enough to vote, I said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough {{to be called a}} man. I self-ordained myself Mr. T so the first word out of everybody’s mouth is [...] "Mr." [...] That’s a sign of respect that my father didn’t get, that my brother didn’t get, that my mother didn’t get.|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{was born}} in Bowling Green, Warren County Kentucky, at Western University Hospital. He has written and talked {{extensively}} about his gender dysphoria and transgender issues. He is a gay man, and has said, [...] "Ever since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> {{enough to know what}} gay men were, I've considered myself a gay man that happens to have been born in a female body, and that's the perspective I'm coming from." [...] In 2003, Martin wrote that, while gender theorists like Kate Bornstein would call him a [...] "nonoperative transsexual", Martin would not insist on a pedantic label, writing [...] "I'm just me". In August 2010, he began the process of gender reassignment, and, in 2011 expressed that he would prefer to be referred to by male pronouns.|$|E
