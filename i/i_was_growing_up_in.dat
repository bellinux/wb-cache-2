2500|$|After {{losing his}} {{re-election}} bid for Mayor to George Voinovich in 1979, Kucinich initially kept {{a low profile}} in Cleveland politics. He criticized a tax referendum proposed by Voinovich in 1980, which voters eventually approved. He also struggled to find employment and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he stayed with a friend, actress Shirley MacLaine. During the next three years, Kucinich worked as a radio talk-show host, lecturer, and consultant. It was a difficult period for Kucinich financially. Without a steady paycheck, Kucinich fell behind in his mortgage payments, nearly lost his house in Cleveland, and ended up borrowing money from friends, including MacLaine, to keep it. On his 1982 income tax return, Kucinich reported an income of $38. When discussing this period, Kucinich stated, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Cleveland, my early experience conditioned me {{to hang in there}} and not to quit...

60|$|And now, {{because my}} mind was not {{confused}} enough before, I complicated its confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and happiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company with Biddy,--when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and scatter my wits again.
