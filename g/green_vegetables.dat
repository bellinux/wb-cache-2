5|$|Celtic law made {{specific}} provision {{with regard to}} cabbages and leeks, stating {{that they should be}} enclosed by fences for protection against wandering cattle. The two <b>green</b> <b>vegetables</b> were the only ones mentioned specifically in the laws, though uncultivated plants were still likely to be used in their cooking. The leek went on to be so important to Welsh cuisine—found in many symbolic dishes including cawl and Glamorgan sausage—that it became the country's national vegetable.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of the Ancient Greek diet was bread, and this was accompanied by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils. In Ancient Rome, a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by <b>green</b> <b>vegetables</b> but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and turnips and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy <b>green</b> <b>vegetables</b> such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{reports on}} the use of {{modified}} activated carbon as an environmental friendly adsorbent, obtained from a <b>green</b> <b>vegetable</b> waste, for the removal of copper (II) from wastewaters. The activated carbon was prepared from <b>green</b> <b>vegetable</b> waste by KOH treatment for 24 h at 60 °C and thereafter evaluated by studying the effects of pH, contact time, dosage and initial concentration and optimized in the batch processing mode. The morphological and chemical changes in activated carbon were fully characterized by SEM, TGA, DSC, FTIR techniques. The Langmuir isotherm, yielded adsorption capacity of 75. 0 mgg− 1 for a pseudo-second-order model. Overall, these results suggest that <b>green</b> <b>vegetable</b> waste derived activated carbon as a low-cost adsorbent for the removal of copper (II) will be useful for future scale-up for the tertiary treatment of wastewater...|$|R

40|$|Background: No {{national}} {{studies have}} examined associations between (1) school food availability and accessibility and (2) secondary student fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption. This article uses 5 years of nationally representative data from secondary school students to examine associations between the school food environment and student fruit and <b>green</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption. Methods: From 2008 to 2012, cross-sectional, nationally representative data from US {{middle and high school}} students were collected annually on self-reported fruit and <b>green</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption. Each year, data from administrators at each relevant school were collected on food item availability (any venue) and accessibility (total number of school sources). Data were obtained from 10, 254 eighth-grade students in 317 schools and 18, 898 tenth- and 12 th-grade students in 518 schools. Associations were estimated by multi-level models controlling for student- and school-level characteristics. Results: Availability showed minimal association with student consumption. Candy/regular-fat snack accessibility was associated negatively with middle school fruit consumption. Salad bar availability and accessibility were positively associated with middle school <b>green</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption; FV accessibility was associated positively with high school fruit and <b>green</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption. Significant associations were consistent across student racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Conclusions: Forthcoming USDA nutrition standards for school foods and beverages sold outside of reimbursable meal programs should result in the removal of school candy/regular-fat snacks. In deciding which items to make available under the new standards, schools should consider increasing the number of FV sources?including salad bars?thereby potentially increasing student FV consumption...|$|R
25|$|Because many {{children}} in VAD-affected countries rely on rice as a staple food, genetic modification to make rice produce the vitamin A precursor beta-carotene {{was seen as}} a simple and less expensive alternative to ongoing vitamin supplements or an increase in the consumption of <b>green</b> <b>vegetables</b> or animal products. Initial analyses of the potential nutritional benefits of golden rice suggested consumption of golden rice would not eliminate the problems of vitamin A deficiency, but could complement other supplementation. Golden Rice 2 contains sufficient provitamin A to provide the entire dietary requirement via daily consumption of some 75g per day.|$|E
25|$|Azerbaijan has {{the largest}} {{agricultural}} basin in the region. About 54.9 percent of Azerbaijan is agricultural lands. At the beginning of 2007 there were 4,755,100 hectares of utilized agricultural area. In the same year the total wood resources counted 136 million m³. Azerbaijan's agricultural scientific research institutes are focused on meadows and pastures, horticulture and subtropical crops, <b>green</b> <b>vegetables,</b> viticulture and wine-making, cotton growing and medicinal plants. In some lands it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes, sugar beets, cotton and tobacco. Livestock, dairy products, and wine and spirits are also important farm products. The Caspian fishing industry is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga. In 2002 the Azerbaijani merchant marine had 54 ships.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{was sometimes}} used in cooking <b>green</b> <b>vegetables,</b> as {{it gives them}} a bright green colour—which has been described as artificial-looking—due to its reacting with chlorophyll to produce chlorophyllin. However, this tends to affect taste, texture and nutritional content, and is no longer common. Baking soda is still used, though, in the traditional British mushy peas recipe for soaking the peas. It is also used in Asian and Latin American cuisine to tenderize meats. Baking soda may react with acids in food, including vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid). It is also used in breading such as for fried foods to enhance crispness and allow passages for steam to escape, so the breading is not blown off during cooking.|$|E
