50|$|A pin chuck is a {{specialized}} chuck {{designed to hold}} small drills (less than 1 mm in diameter) {{that could not be}} held securely in a normal <b>drill</b> <b>chuck.</b> The drill is inserted into the pin chuck and tightened; the pin chuck has a shaft which is then inserted into the larger <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> to hold the drill securely. Pin chucks are also used with high-speed rotary tools other than drills, such as die grinders and jig grinders.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} uses of tapers was to mount drill bits {{directly}} to machine tools, {{such as in the}} tailstock of a lathe, although later <b>drill</b> <b>chucks</b> were invented that mounted to machine tools and in turn held non-tapered drill bits.|$|R
50|$|Ruth: Ruth, with {{gardening}} gloves on, had accidentally mismeasured her boards, {{resulting in}} the third piece being shorter than the first two. When laminating the boards, she does not securely place her bits in the <b>drill's</b> <b>chuck,</b> causing her gloves to be trapped in the drill. Avoiding the gloves from then on, Ruth finishes in 20:07, but admits she needs rehabilitation.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> {{may have}} a hollow body that threads {{directly}} onto a lathe's threaded spindle nose. (These are fairly rare, especially nowadays.) ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1962-65: A diesel {{compression}} braking system, {{eventually to}} be manufactured by Jacobs (of <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> fame) and nicknamed the [...] "Jake Brake", was invented and patented by Clessie Cummins.|$|E
5000|$|Names {{known to}} {{figure in the}} history of chuck {{development}} include those of Simon Fairman (1792-1857) and his son-in-law Austin F. Cushman (1830-1914), and Arthur Irving Jacobs. Fairman invented the piece of tooling that we today would call a scroll chuck, and Cushman developed and sold this design under his business, Cushman Industries. Judging from a historical sketch given by the Jacobs Chuck Manufacturing Company(a well-known brand in the <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> field), Arthur I. (A.I.) Jacobs was apparently the person who further developed Cushmans self-centering scroll-gear idea into the type of <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> known today (for which his company would later become famous). A.I. Jacobss patent of 1902 (...) appears to be the principal patent. The term [...] "drill chuck" [...] clearly did not originate with him, but his new type of <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> evidently long ago displaced any earlier types that lacked the angled jaw movement and outer sleeve now found on all common drill chucks.|$|E
5000|$|RÖHM [...] is a German {{chucking}} tool manufacturer. It {{was founded in}} 1909 by Heinrich Röhm. Its headquarters is in Sontheim/Brenz Germany. RÖHM’s range of products includes <b>drill</b> <b>chucks,</b> live centers, face drivers, lathe chucks and independent chucks as well as vices, gripping technology, power chuck technology, mandrels and tool clamping systems. RÖHM currently counts approximately 1500 employees. The company’s products offer solutions especially for the automobile industry, engineering, the energy sector, rail vehicles and aerospace. From the 1950s until 2010, they also manufactured a line of inexpensive firearms under the Röhm Gesellschaft (RG) division. In 2010, RG was sold to Umarex.|$|R

50|$|The Jacobs Taper (abbreviated JT) is {{commonly}} used to secure <b>drill</b> press <b>chucks</b> to an arbor. The taper angles are not consistent varying from 1.41° per side for #0 (and the obscure #) to 2.33° per side for #2 (and #2 short).|$|R
50|$|Run-out is {{dynamic and}} cannot be compensated. If a {{rotating}} component, {{such as a}} <b>drill</b> <b>chuck,</b> does not hold the drill centrally, then as it rotates the rotating drill will turn about a secondary axis.|$|E
50|$|The {{triangle}} shank {{is almost}} always made by machining three flats on round bar stock. It is intended as a minor modification of a straight shank, still allowing it {{to be held in}} a 3-jaw <b>drill</b> <b>chuck,</b> but allowing higher torque transmission and limited slipping.|$|E
50|$|In a {{torque-controlled}} drill, for instance, {{one shaft}} {{is driven by}} a motor and the other drives a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck.</b> The clutch connects the two shafts so they may be locked together and spin {{at the same speed}} (engaged), locked together but spinning at different speeds (slipping), or unlocked and spinning at different speeds (disengaged).|$|E
2500|$|Spade bits {{are used}} for rough boring in wood. They tend to cause {{splintering}} when they emerge from the workpiece. [...] Woodworkers avoid splintering by finishing the hole from {{the opposite side of}} the work. [...] Spade bits are flat, with a centering point and two cutters. The cutters are often equipped with spurs in an attempt to ensure a cleaner hole. With their small shank diameters relative to their boring diameters, spade bit shanks often have flats forged or ground into them to prevent slipping in <b>drill</b> <b>chucks.</b> Some bits are equipped with long shanks and have a small hole drilled through the flat part, allowing them to be used much like a bell-hanger bit. Intended for high speed use, they are used with electric hand drills. Spade bits are also sometimes referred to as [...] "paddle bits".|$|R
50|$|Tools with an R8 taper are {{inserted}} {{directly into}} the machine's spindle. R8 collets are typically used to hold tooling with round shanks, although any shape can be held if the collet has the correct corresponding shape cut in it. The collets have a precision bore with axial compression slots for holding cutting tools and are threaded for the drawbar. The R8 system is commonly used with collets {{ranging in size from}} ″ to ″ in diameter or tool holders with the same or slightly larger diameters. The collets or tool holders are placed {{directly into the}} spindle and the drawbar is tightened into the top of the collet or tool holder from above the spindle. Other tools such as <b>drill</b> <b>chucks,</b> fly cutters, indexable insert cutters, etc. may have an R-8 taper shank built into or added to the tool.|$|R

50|$|Machine tool {{operators}} {{must be able}} {{to install}} or remove tool bits quickly and easily. A lathe, for example, has a rotating spindle in its headstock, to which one may want to mount a spur drive or work in a collet. Another example is a drill press, to which an operator may want to mount a bit directly, or using a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck.</b>|$|E
50|$|Axial run-out is {{the result}} of a {{rotating}} component not being parallel with the axis, such as a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> not holding the drill exactly in line with the axis. In general, cutting tools are less tolerant of axial run-out since the tool tip tends to dig in and further increase run-out. However a shaft may be more tolerant of axial run-out since the centre of gravity is displaced less.|$|E
50|$|A <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> is a {{specialised}} self-centering, three-jaw chuck, {{usually with}} capacity of 0.5 in or less and rarely greater than 1 in, {{used to hold}} drill bits or other rotary tools. This type of chuck is used on tools ranging from professional equipment to inexpensive hand and power drills for domestic use; it is the type a person who does not normally work with machine tools {{is most likely to}} be familiar with.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} L. T. C. Rolt, {{the original}} installation was of machines for wire-braiding crinoline frames, and Charles simultaneously imported metal cutting machine tools to aid his friend Hiram Maxim who was developing a machine gun. This is a moot point: the Maxim gun was not developed {{for a further}} 20 years, and {{it is unlikely that}} Maxim was in England during the 1860s; however, the Gatling gun was patented in 1862. Rolt claimed that Charles Churchill & Co began trading in 1865 as importers of engineering tools and is thought to have imported the first examples of Morse tapered twist <b>drills,</b> self-centring <b>drill</b> <b>chucks</b> (manufactured by Cushman) and hand-held micrometers into the UK. According to Floud, he imported agricultural implements and other non-engineering items at this time. In its early years the company traded from 28 Wilson Street, Finsbury: sales catalogues were published certainly between 1876 and 1882 stating this address.|$|R
40|$|Rock {{fragmentation}} {{process by}} drilling rig {{is accomplished by}} the simultaneous effects of drill pipe rotation and axial downwards motions. Hydraulic chuck transfers engine power to drill pipe during the drilling and sampling process suchthatit’s {{one of the most}} important components of <b>drilling</b> rig. <b>Chuck</b> available on the market, design is not considered clamping force and drilling capacity matching, resulting in slipped drill, injury <b>drill</b> or <b>chuck</b> destruction. This study designs a maximum clamping diameter 73 mm hydraulic chuck, focuses on the interaction mechanism of the gripper slips and drill pipe. A model to simulate and optimize the clamp mechanism and slips has been developed by the finite element analysis method, conclude the structure of the optimal size of the hydraulic chuck. This research may be a better suggestion on resolving the problems of pipe damage and slipping down. The study method would also be a reference for the design of other kinds of chucks. A model to simulate and optimize rainwater-harvesting systems for irrigation has been developed...|$|R
50|$|In 1945, the company, {{which by}} then {{employed}} 1400 people, {{was occupied by}} the Americans and Heinrich Röhm was evacuated to Heidenheim an der Brenz with his family. The new rulers in East Germany occupied the intact factory {{and turned it into}} a nationally-owned company. In 1946, the family moved to Sontheim/Brenz, where Heinrich Röhm decided at the age of 63 to reconstruct his company with the support of his sons. Without capital and without a plot of land the company was set up again from scratch. First of all, children's toys were made from plywood and wood waste in a leased carpentry. With the production of rock drills a change was made again to the business of metal machining. The same year, land was purchased and a barrack was constructed in order to reconstruct the RÖHM factory. The production, which started the following year, once more involved key-type <b>drill</b> <b>chucks.</b> Former clients supported the reconstruction by showing trust, placing orders and demanding the resumption of the past product range.|$|R
50|$|The flats of a hex shank {{can either}} be {{machined}} on a round shank, as in the photograph, or be the natural flats of hex bar stock. A hex shank can be grasped by a 3-jaw <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> or held in a chuck specifically for hex shanks. Quarter-inch hex shanks are common for machine screwdriver bits and have spread from that application {{to be used for}} drill bits that are compatible with screwdriver machinery.|$|E
50|$|The {{uppermost}} counterbore tools {{shown in}} the image are the same device. The smaller top item is an insert, the middle shows another three-fluted counterbore insert, assembled in the holder. The shank of this holder is a Morse taper, although there are other machine tapers {{that are used in}} the industry. The lower counterbore is designed to fit into a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck,</b> and being smaller, is economical to make as one piece.|$|E
50|$|The arbor of a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> {{is often}} a Morse taper and this allows the chuck {{assembly}} to be removed and directly replaced with the shank of a Morse taper drill bit. A range of sleeves {{may be used to}} bring the size of the smaller Morse tapers up {{to the size of the}} drive spindle's larger taper. Sockets are also available to extend the effective length of the drill as well as offering a variety of taper combinations.|$|E

50|$|A chuck is a {{specialized}} type of clamp. It {{is used to}} hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylinder. In drills and mills it holds the rotating tool whereas in lathes it holds the rotating workpiece. On a lathe the chuck is mounted on the spindle which rotates within the headstock. For some purposes (such as <b>drilling)</b> an additional <b>chuck</b> may be mounted on the non-rotating tailstock.|$|R
2500|$|Lower {{power units}} are usually called [...] "hammer drills," [...] {{typically}} have a [...] "cam-action" [...] or [...] "percussion" [...] hammering mechanism, {{in which two}} sets of toothed gears mechanically {{interact with each other}} to hammer while rotating the drill bit. [...] With [...] "cam-action" [...] <b>drills,</b> the <b>chuck</b> has a mechanism whereby the entire chuck and bit move forward and backwards on the axis of rotation, the motion is tied to the rotation of the chuck. This type of drill is often used with and without the hammer action but {{it is not possible to}} use the hammer action alone as it is the rotation over the [...] "cams" [...] which causes the hammer motion. [...] These units are usually smaller and are commonly powered by cordless technology. [...] They are not typically used for production construction drilling, but rather for occasional drilling of concrete or masonry.|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{machine tool}} spindles, and many power tool spindles, have a taper {{as their primary}} method of {{attachment}} for tools. Even on many drill presses, handheld drills, and lathes, which have chucks (such as a <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> or collet chuck), the chuck is attached by a taper. On drills, drill presses, and milling machines, the male member is the tool shank or toolholder shank, and the female socket is integral with the spindle. On lathes, the male may belong to the tool or to the spindle; spindle noses may have male tapers, female tapers, or both.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Top: an {{assembled}} keyless chuck. This type of chuck is tightened by {{twisting the}} body using firm hand pressure only. While convenient, this feature {{can cause the}} chuck to loosen if too much torque is applied. Bottom: the widely used keyed type of <b>drill</b> <b>chuck</b> with its key. The arbor is shown separately to the right. These chucks require a toothed key to provide the necessary torque to tighten and loosen the jaws. When the key is turned its teeth mate with teeth on the chuck, turning an internal screw which in turn moves the threaded jaws in or out along a tapered surface. The taper allows the jaws to clamp drill shanks {{of a range of}} diameters. The end view shows the three small jaws that slide within the body.|$|E
50|$|RÖHM {{was founded}} in 1909 in Zella-Mehlis, Thuringia by Heinrich Röhm. Its first product was a two-jaw <b>drill</b> <b>chuck.</b> In 1910 the first patent - {{improved}} drill chucks - was filed. Export business started the same year. Due to the influences of World War I production came to a standstill and resumption {{turned out to be}} difficult {{after the end of the}} war. In 1926, RÖHM started the production of key-type drill chucks. It was the first company in Germany to do so. The following years the manufacturing plants were modernized and extended. Between 1939 and 1940, a 40m conveyor belt for the production of drill chucks was put into service. Therefore, for the first time, a company produced precision tools in mass production and RÖHM was said to be the most modern and efficient factory of its industry.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the polymerisation shrinkage stress under water of four resin-modified glass-ionomers and three resin composite materials. METHODS: Transparent acrylic rods (5 mm diameter× 30 mm) were prepared and secured into <b>drill</b> <b>chucks</b> connected to a universal testing machine. A plastics cup was placed around the lower rod and a distance of 1. 00 mm was established between the prepared surfaces which provided a C-factor of 2. 5. For composite only, an adhesive layer (Scotchbond Universal Adhesive) was placed on the rod ends and cured to achieve a bond with the rod end. Materials were placed between the rods and a strain gauge extensometer was installed. Materials were light cured for 40 s and the plastics cup was filled with ambient temperature water. To determine polymerisation shrinkage stress (σpol) three specimens of each material were tested for a 6 -h period to determine mean maximum σpol (MPa), σpol rate (MPa/s) and final σpol (MPa). ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests were used to determine significant differences between means. RESULTS: The highest mean maximum σpol of (5. 4 ± 0. 5) MPa was recorded for RMGIC and (4. 8 ± 1. 0) MPa for composite. The lowest mean final σpol of (0. 8 ± 0. 4) MPa was recorded for RMGIC. For mean maximum σpol,σpol rate and final σpol there were significant differences between materials within groups, although no significant difference (p> 0. 05) was observed when comparing the RMGIC group to the composite group. CONCLUSION: When comparing mean σpol, maximum σpol, and σpol rates between individual RMGIC and composite materials significant differences (p 0. 05) were observed. The null hypothesis that there is no difference in the short term σpol of RMGIC materials when compared to composite materials is only partly rejected. RELEVANCE: Limited information is available on the comparison of RMGIC and resin composite σpol levels. This study provides information on the short term levels in a wet environment and will assist in understanding the initial σpol rates RMGIC place in cavities. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|Among {{underground}} coal miners, {{hearing loss}} {{remains one of}} the most common occupational illnesses. In response to this problem, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) conducts research to reduce the noise emission of underground coal-mining equipment, an example of which is a roof bolting machine. Field studies show that, on average, drilling noise is the most significant contributor to a roof bolting machine operator's noise exposure. NIOSH OMSHR has determined that the <b>drill</b> steel and <b>chuck</b> are the dominant sources of drilling noise. NIOSH OMSHR, Corry Rubber Corporation, and Kennametal, Inc. have developed a bit isolator that breaks the steel-to-steel link between the drill bit and drill steel and a chuck isolator that breaks the mechanical connection between the drill steel and the chuck, thus reducing the noise radiated by the <b>drill</b> steel and <b>chuck,</b> and the noise exposure of the roof bolter operator. This paper documents the evolution of the bit isolator and chuck isolator including various alternative designs which may enhance performance. Laboratory testing confirms that production bit and chuck isolators reduce the A-weighted sound level generated during drilling by 3. 7 to 6. 6 dB. Finally, this paper summarizes results of a finite element analysis used to explore the key parameters of the drill bit isolator and chuck isolator to understand the impact these parameters have on noise.
