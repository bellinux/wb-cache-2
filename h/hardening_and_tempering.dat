5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case <b>hardening)</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> are not cast in dies.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{most people}} cannot {{determine}} if steel has undergone the <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> process by simply looking at it, {{there is a}} reliable and simple test. When examining a piece of steel, obtain a hand file and file an edge of the selected metal. If the piece of steel has not undergone the <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> process, the metal file should easily 'bite' into the sample. If the metal has been hardened, the file fails to cut into the sample and glances off with little visible effect.|$|E
5000|$|The {{addition}} of {{large amounts of}} nickel and chromium needed for corrosion resistance in stainless steels means that traditional <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> methods are not effective. However, precipitates of chromium, copper, or other elements can strengthen the steel by similar amounts in comparison to <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering.</b> The strength can be tailored by adjusting the annealing process, with lower initial temperatures resulting in higher strengths. The lower initial temperatures increase {{the driving force of}} nucleation. More driving force means more nucleation sites, and more sites means more places for dislocations to be disrupted while the finished part is in use.|$|E
50|$|Of course, the counterpunch had to {{be harder}} than the punch itself. This was {{accomplished}} by annealing (softening) the punch blank, and <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> the counterpunch. Such a tool solved two issues, one technical and one aesthetic, that arose in punchcutting.|$|E

SEM observations of the worn surface revealed plastic deformation with delamination of surface layers by subsurface cracks as the mechanism in the as-sintered condition. Microploughing and formation of surface platelets and traces of their detachment was found to be the dominant wear mechanism for the <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> specimen...|$|R

50|$|Originally, all tool bits {{were made}} of high carbon tool steels with the {{appropriate}} <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering.</b> Since the introductions of high-speed steel (HSS) (early years of the 20th century), sintered carbide (1930s), ceramic and diamond cutters, those materials have gradually replaced the earlier kinds of tool steel in almost all cutting applications. Most tool bits today are made of HSS, cobalt steel, or carbide.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of iron made possible stone carving tools, such as chisels, drills and saws made from steel, that {{were capable of}} being <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> to a state hard enough to cut stone without deforming, while not being so brittle as to shatter.

30|$|High quality medium carbon {{alloy steel}} {{was used to}} cast the shearer’s guiding sliding shoe. At rough machining, the shoe was <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> to improve its {{substrate}} mechanical properties.

50|$|The {{primary use}} of a centre is to ensure {{concentric}} work is produced; this allows the workpiece to be transferred between machining (or inspection) operations without any loss of accuracy. A part may be turned in a lathe, sent off for <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> and then ground between centers in a cylindrical grinder. The preservation of concentricity between the turning and grinding operations is crucial for quality work.|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{materials}} science processes of <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering,</b> the blanks are hollow ground, {{according to one}} of the two fundamental blade profiles. At the highest end of hollow ground, more hollow than even the 1/1 grade, is the so called singing razor, so named because its blade produces a specific resonant tone when plucked, similar to a guitar string. The singing razor blade at this excited stage is essentially a vibrating [...] Its manufacturing process is so demanding that a full 25% of the blades get rejected as not meeting standards. Thiers Issard does not produce flat ground (wedge) type blades.|$|E
50|$|Steel {{forms the}} core of most metal strings. Certain {{keyboard}} instruments (e.g., harpsichord) and the Gaelic harp use brass. Other natural materials, such as silk or gut—or synthetics such as nylon and kevlar are also used for string cores.

50|$|After the {{workpiece}} is done being formed, it is normalized. The blade is carefully and evenly heated and then cooled slowly. The point of normalizing {{is to remove}} the stresses which may have built up within {{the body of the}} blade while it was being forged. During the forging process the blade might be heated and cooled differentially creating stress, some parts might be hammered more than others, some areas hammered enough to work harden. If these stresses are left in the blade they could affect the finishing and {{when it came time to}} heat treat the blade, the <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> might not be as even. Potentially enough stress could be added that the blade would be weak in spots, weak enough that it could fail under enough stress.|$|E
50|$|On leaving Ardingly College, Comber {{worked with}} his father at Nymans for two years, during which time he visited other famous gardens, notably Leonardslee, whose owner, Sir Edmund Loder, {{recommended}} him to Henry Elwes, who engaged him at his home, Colesbourne Park, Gloucestershire.http://www.colesbournegardens.org.uk/about-us/history-of-colesbourne-park.html Elwes admired his skills, and encouraged him to write an article for the Gardeners' Chronicle which was accepted for publication; Comber was just 17. Such was his precocity that at this same age he was entrusted with {{the management of the}} glasshouses and botanical collections when the older staff duly left for service in World War I. A knee injury prevented Comber himself seeing active service in the war, and he was eventually directed to 'work of national importance', namely <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> parts of Lewis guns at Earlswood.|$|E
50|$|Metalworking taps {{and dies}} were often made by their users during the 18th and 19th centuries (especially if the user was skilled in toolmaking), using such tools as lathes and files for the shaping, and the smithy for <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering.</b> Thus {{builders}} of, for example, locomotives, firearms, or textile machinery {{were likely to}} make their own taps and dies. During the 19th century the machining industries evolved greatly, and the practice of buying taps and dies from suppliers specializing in them gradually supplanted most such in-house work. Joseph Clement was one such early vendor of taps and dies, starting in 1828. With the introduction of more advanced milling practice in the 1860s and 1870s, tasks such as cutting a tap's flutes with a hand file became a thing of the past. In the early 20th century, thread-grinding practice went through significant evolution, further advancing {{the state of the art}} (and applied science) of cutting screw threads, including those of taps and dies.|$|E
50|$|The Iron Age is a {{cultural}} period from roughly 1200 BC to 50 BC with {{the widespread use of}} iron for tools and weapons. Iron is not much harder than bronze but by adding carbon iron becomes steel which was being produced after about 300 BC. Steel can be <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> producing a sharp, durable cutting edge. A new woodworking tool allowed by the use of steel is the hand-plane.|$|R

50|$|The {{two major}} {{processes}} of <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> {{can be broken}} down into four major steps. First, a piece of carbon steel is heated gradually until it reaches a temperature above the alloy's critical temperature. The steel is then quenched, usually in water or oil (though other quenches, such as brine or sodium hydroxide solutions, are sometimes used to achieve a particular result). The steel is now at that given alloy's maximum hardness, but as discussed above, also brittle. At this point, tempering is usually performed to achieve a more useful balance of hardness and toughness. The steel is gradually heated until the desired temper colours are drawn, generally at a temperature significantly lower than the alloy's critical point. Different colours in the temper spectrum reflect different balances of hardness to toughness, so different temper levels are appropriate for different applications. The steel is then re-quenched to 'fix' the temper at the desired level. A talented smith or metalworker can fine-tune the performance of a steel tool or item to precisely what is required based solely on careful observation of temper colours. A visual representation of this process may make the concept easier to understand.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{materials}} {{have been used}} for balance springs. Early on, steel was used, but without any hardening or tempering process applied; as a result, these springs would gradually weaken and the watch would start losing time. Some watchmakers, for example John Arnold, used gold, which avoids the problem of corrosion but retains the problem of gradual weakening. <b>Hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> steel was first used by John Harrison and subsequently remained the material of choice until the 20th century.|$|R
