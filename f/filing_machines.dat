40|$|A multibody {{model of}} an {{industrial}} cutting <b>file</b> <b>machine</b> for dynamic analysis {{is presented in}} this work. One of the main subassembly systems of the machine is a cam-follower mechanism {{that is used to}} promote the motion of the tool (chisel). Thus, the Newton-Euler formulation for multibody systems is considered here to model and analyse this cam-follower mechanism. For this purpose, polynomial functions are utilized to describe cam profile, being the chisel defined as flat surface. The motion of the chisel is controlled by gravity and a translational spring element. The contact events that take place between the cam and follower surfaces are modelled using both penalty formulation and nonsmooth approach. The parameters studied and discussed throughout this work are the chisel displacement and velocity, as well as the dynamic spring load. Finally, an industrial cutting-file machine is utilized to obtain experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{outlines}} the effective filing process which {{is done by}} machine. Filing operation {{can be used on}} a wide range of materials as a finishing and burr removing operation. However mostly hand filing is done in industrial fields which is time consuming and not effective as much. Filing is probably very important and most frequent operation in metal work. The filing is done generally by hand with one hand on wood handle and other hand on tip of file. The aim of the present work is reduce human efforts in the filing process by designing the advanced <b>filing</b> <b>machine.</b> There are many problems related to hand filing. So, this paper describes filing process by use of small machine. Prior to the development of modern machining equipment it provided a relatively accurate means for the production of small parts, especially those with flat surfaces. This machine will definitely help in reducing time and human effort in metal as well as wood <b>filing</b> process. Filling <b>machine</b> is in compact size, portable and can be taken anywhere on shop floor. This machine is electrically operated and very easy to handle with one hand. The working model of filling machine is designed in Pro-Engineer software...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{modeling}} {{and analysis of}} planar rigid multibody systems that experience contact-impact events is presented and discussed throughout this work. The methodology {{is based on the}} nonsmooth dynamics approach, in which the interaction of the colliding bodies is modeled with multiple frictional unilateral constraints. Rigid multibody systems are stated as an equality of measures, which are formulated at the velocity-impulse level. The equations of motion are complemented with constitutive laws for the forces and impulses in the normal and tangential directions. In this work, the unilateral constraints are described by a set-valued force law of the type of Signoriniâ€™s condition, while the frictional contacts are characterized by a set-valued force law of the type of Coulombâ€™s law for dry friction. The resulting contact-impact problem is formulated and solved as an augmented Lagrangian approach, which is embedded in the Moreau time-stepping method.

5000|$|By 1813, North {{had signed}} a {{government}} contract to produce 20,000 pistols that specified that parts of the lock had to be completely interchangeable between any of the 20,000 locks: the first contract of which any such evidence exists. It was during this period that North {{is believed to have}} invented a milling machine, which was able to shape metal mechanically and thus replaced filing by hand. Historian Diana Muir believes that he accomplished this around 1816. According to Muir's book Reflections in Bullough's Pond, North [...] "was the first arms maker to implement a number of machine production techniques, yet he cautiously halted his pursuit of mass-produced, interchangeable parts" [...] whenever it became apparent that it was uneconomic. For some time, interchangeable-part manufacturing in metal would continue to be a combination of machine-made parts and human skill in <b>filing</b> <b>machined</b> parts to precise size for such high-end uses as military weapons, in which interchangeable parts were worth paying for at high prices (they were worth high prices because an army on campaign could cannibalize damaged weapons for parts).|$|R
