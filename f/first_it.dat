5|$|Although Nash was {{responsible}} for the street's general development, some individual buildings were designed by Charles Robert Cockerell and Sir John Soane, amongst others. By 1819, the Crown were receiving regular rent and the street was becoming established. At <b>first,</b> <b>it</b> was called New Street and became a dividing line between Soho, which had declined socially and economically, and the fashionable squares and streets of Mayfair to the west. Carlton House did not last long following completion of the works and was demolished in 1829, to be replaced by Carlton House Terrace, also designed by Nash.|$|E
5|$|Between 1906 and 1908, the Pentecostal message {{had spread}} among Christian and Missionary Alliance (CMA) churches and conferences. At <b>first,</b> <b>it</b> was greeted {{positively}} by the CMA leadership, but {{the doctrine of}} initial evidence divided the organization. Former CMA Pentecostal congregations in the Midwest and Northeast were left without oversight and began associating with the Apostolic Faith Movement and the Chicago Pentecostal missions.|$|E

5|$|During the Depression, {{the state}} sought to ease {{unemployment}} through {{public works projects}} as an economic stimulus. It applied this to the new Highway 82. <b>First</b> <b>it</b> converted the Maroon Creek Bridge for automotive traffic by widening it with a timber deck, which was then paved and supported with outriggers. In 1937, four miles (6.4km) between Glenwood Springs and Carbondale was paved; {{the remainder of the}} road to Aspen was oiled the following year.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{about the}} nature of law in general were {{beginning}} to change. In 1716, the Septennial Act was passed, which had a number of consequences. <b>First,</b> <b>it</b> showed that Parliament no longer considered its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the Triennial Act (1694) (enacted {{less than a quarter of}} a century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, Michael met Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. They fell in {{love and}} began to {{correspond}} in her native English. Michael spoke both French and English fluently. At <b>first</b> <b>it</b> seemed they would marry; however, the Orthodox Church prohibited the marriage of first cousins, and Michael's father and Beatrice's mother were siblings. Nicholas refused to permit the marriage and, to Michael's and Beatrice's mutual dismay, their romance ended.|$|E
5|$|In January 1531, Campeggio was {{dismissed}} as cardinal protector, {{although it did}} not become public knowledge until May. At <b>first</b> <b>it</b> was unclear whether Henry VIII intended to appoint a successor, with Giovanni Domenico de Cupis emerging as an active candidate in March 1532. The king favoured Alessandro Farnese (future Pope Paul III), and instructed his ambassadors on 21 March to offer it to Farnese, and then de Cupis or Giovanni del Monte (future Pope Julius III) {{in the event that}} Farnese declined or was not approved.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} unknown whether 55 Cancri e {{was a small}} gas giant like Neptune or a large rocky terrestrial planet. In 2011, a transit of the planet was confirmed, allowing scientists to calculate its density. At <b>first</b> <b>it</b> was suspected to be a water planet. As initial observations showed no hydrogen in its Lyman-alpha signature during transit, Ehrenreich speculated that its volatile materials might be carbon dioxide instead of water or hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|Nairobi National Park is a {{national}} park in Kenya. Established in 1946, the national park was Kenya's <b>first.</b> <b>It</b> is located approximately 7 kilometres (4mi) south of the centre of Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, with an electric fence separating the park's wildlife from the metropolis. Nairobi's skyscrapers {{can be seen from}} the park. The proximity of urban and natural environments has caused conflicts between the animals and local people and threatens animals' migration routes.|$|E
5|$|Nouvelles Extraordinaires, {{like other}} {{newspapers}} of its time, gave primarily political and commercial information, classified by source and {{date of arrival}} (the oldest, from the most distant lands, coming <b>first).</b> <b>It</b> offered reports on international politics, such as wars and diplomatic relations, as well as coverage of major domestic affairs. The newspaper also contained trivia, editorials and advertising.

5|$|Simultaneously, Sihanouk {{ordered the}} arrest of Chinese {{middlemen}} involved in the illegal rice trade, thereby raising government revenues and placating the conservatives. Lon Nol was forced to resign, and, in a typical move, the prince named new leftists to the government to balance the conservatives. The immediate crisis had passed, but it engendered two tragic consequences. <b>First,</b> <b>it</b> drove thousands of new recruits {{into the arms of}} the hard-line maquis of the Cambodian Communist Party (which Sihanouk labelled the Khmers rouges ("Red Khmers")). Second, for the peasantry, the name of Lon Nol became associated with ruthless repression throughout Cambodia.|$|E
