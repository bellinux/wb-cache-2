40|$|The Clark and Washoe Remote Sensing Study (CAWRSS) field season {{took place}} in September 1994. The study was {{designed}} to characterize the exhaust emissions of the on-road vehicle fleet in the two major urban centers of the State of Nevada. The air quality in Las Vegas (Clark County) and Reno (Washoe County) is significantly worse than the surrounding rural areas and vehicle emissions have been identified as one of the primary sources of the pollution. Inspection and maintenance programs, mandated by the federal government, have been implemented in both urban areas. The study compared the State-approved test, a no-load, two-speed <b>idle</b> <b>test,</b> to two other measurement techniques: remote sensing devices (RSDs) and the IM 240 test, a loaded-mode test run on a dynamometer. Results were viewed from two different perspectives. Fleet-wide characteristics showed that concentrations of CO (%,) measured with RSDs were higher than those obtained with the no-load idle tests. Characteristics of pollution distributions derived from the two techniques were similar in range and shape. Observations for individual vehicles were then compared.

Truck idling in particular is more problematic than other vehicles mainly because of the duration of idling and the high amount of emissions produced. This report is intended to identify the characteristics of truck idling emissions by collecting data using an advanced portable emission measurement system (PEMS), in which the attempt is made to measure actual idling emissions from truck tailpipes and to relate measured emissions to altered pre-testing driving conditions. Employed for the testing is. the On-Board Emission Monitoring system OEM- 2100 TM, an advanced PEMS., This equipment can determine the second-by-second emissions of HC, CO, CO 2, O 2, and NOx in the exhaust gas by a functional equivalent of a repair-grade dual five-gas analyzer subsystem.

According to official emissions data, gasoline powered vehicles (private and taxis) account for approximately 72 % of total CO emissions, 34 % of total NOx emissions, and 25 % of COV emissions. Several measures {{have been taken to}} curtail the growth of vehicle related emissions. All vehicles should pass an <b>idle</b> emissions <b>test</b> every year. Since 1993, all vehicles should comply with stricter emission standards that require in practice the use of three-way catalytic converters.

If we compare measurement result values of RT, XT, which are contained in a brochure for ABB transformers and those obtained through simulation, different tolerances are obtained. For reactance results, deviations are up to 20 % for all three tested transformers. For results of active resistance tolerances are up to 5 % for all three tested transformers.

The sweeps showed that when the EGR rate is increased, the efficiency does not diminish, HC trace is flat, and CO is low even with 45 % of EGR. NOx exponentially decreases by increasing EGR while soot levels are nearly zero throughout the sweep. The EGR sweeps underlined that at high EGR levels, the pressure rise rate is a concern. To overcome this problem and keep high efficiency and low emissions, a sweep in {{the timing of the}} pilot injection and pilot-main ratio was done at similar to 16. 5 bars gross IMEP.

Low load conditions were examined as well. It was found that by placing the start of injection at similar to 35 top dead center, the efficiency is maximized, on the other hand, when the injection is at similar to 25, the emissions are minimized, and the efficiency is only 1. 64 % lower than its optimum value.

Since then, Taiwan has continued doing remote sensing each year. By the year 2001, Taiwan has accumulated over 7 millions valid records of remote sensing measurement, {{the highest in the}} world. However, since remote sensing can only serve as a screening tool to identify high emitters, which does not correct any emission problem unless these high mitters are forced to receive proper inspection and maintenance, TEPA is currently engaged in establishing all necessary guidelines for remote sensing law enforcement. Among them, to establish the remote sensing screening standard is considered top priority. Since high emission vehicles found by remote sensing will be assessed by <b>idle</b> <b>test</b> whichis the current standard for vehicle emission inspection in Taiwan, the concern for error of commission between remote sensing and idle tests has made the selection for remote sensing high emitters screening standard more difficult.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the behavioral and stochastic aspects of modeling emission reductions from vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs. Forecasts {{of the potential}} emission reductions from such programs have been modeled {{by the use of}} the Environmental Protection Agency's MOBILE Model, EPA's computer model for estimating emission factors for mobile sources. We examine the structure of this Model and review the way behavior of drivers, mechanics and state regulatory authorities is incorporated in the current generation of the Model. We focus particularly on assumptions about vehicle repair under I/M, compliance with I/M requirements, and the impact of test measurement error on predicted I/M effectiveness. We also include some preliminary comparisons of the Model's outcomes to results of the I/M program in place in Arizona. Finally, we perform some sensitivity analyses to determine the most influential underlying parameters of the Model. We find that many of the assumptions of the I/M component of the Model are based on relatively small data sets on vehicle done in a laboratory setting, and that the output of the Model makes it difficult to compare the results against real world data from on-going state programs. In addition, the Model assumes that vehicles will either be repaired or receive a waiver. In the Arizona program {{there appears to be a}} third category of vehicles � those which fail the test and do not receive passes. This share may be as high as a third of all failing vehicles. Vehicles which do not eventually pass the test would be treated in the Model as non-compliant. However, in current programs, states do not seem to be measuring and entering the compliance rate correctly. The paper also {{examines the}} evidence about whether emissions deteriorate over the life of vehicle in a grams per mile basis (as assumed by the Model) or a grams per gallon basis. It finds support for the argument that emissions deteriorate on a grams per gallon basis. We find through sensitivity analysis that the repair effectiveness assumed by the Model to occur in an IM 240 test are much greater than for the <b>idle</b> <b>test,</b> and that identification rates and repair effectiveness vary a great deal according to the cutpoint. These results are based on small numbers of vehicle tests in a laboratory setting and could be compared to real world evidence. Examining costs and cost-effectiveness of variations in I/M programs is important for determining improvements in I/M programs. States may not have incentives to develop cost-effective programs based on current Model that forecast emission reduction "credits" that are overly optimistic. ...|$|E

Motor vehicles from the 1966 model year and beyond were subjected to Smog Check I. Also automobiles with a motor swap performed prior to the March 19, 1984 mandate which was older than the model year of the vehicle e.g. a 1970 LT-1 350 swapped into a 1975 Chevrolet with the 1970 smog gear intact (with documentation e.g. receipts) are considered noncompliant illegal engine swaps - this means that the engine swap performed after the date of enactment must be the same model year or newer. Engine swaps which are the same year or newer where the vehicle class did not have it as a manufacturer option (from a Chevrolet S-10 with a late model LSx powertrain transplant with the associated smog gear intact salvaged from the donor vehicle which includes the OBDII diagnostic connections) must be approved by a 'referee' smog test station where the engine/transmission package is certified where a silver tag is stickered to the door jamb.

The tests were made on a single-cylinder universal test engine at compression ratios of 5. 0, 5. 5, and 6. 0. Most of the tests were made with a fuel-injection system, although one set of runs was made with a carburetor when using gasoline to establish comparative performance. The tests show that the b. m. e. p. obtained with safety fuel when using a fuel-injection system is slightly higher than that obtained with gasoline when using a carburetor, although the fuel consumption with safety fuel is higher. When the fuel-injection system is used with each fuel and with normal engine temperatures the b. m. e. p. with safety fuel is from 2 to 4 percent lower than with gasoline and the fuel consumption about 25 to 30 percent higher. However, a few tests at an engine coolant temperature of 250 F have shown a specific fuel consumption approximating that obtained with gasoline with only a slight reduction in power.

40|$|Biodiesel has {{generated}} increased interest recently {{as an alternative}} to petroleum-derived diesel. Due to its high oxygen content, biodiesel typically burns more completely than petroleum diesel, and thus has lower emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM). However, biodiesel may increase or decrease nitrogen oxide (NO x) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, depending on biodiesel feedstock, engine type, and test cycle. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare emissions from 20 % blends of biodiesel made from 4 feedstocks (soybean oil, canola oil, waste cooking oil, and animal fat) with emissions from ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD). Emissions of NO x and CO 2 were made under real-world driving conditions using a Horiba On-Board Measurement System OBS- 1300 on a highway route and arterial route; emissions of NO x, CO 2, HC, CO, and PM were measured in a controlled setting using a chassis dynamometer with Urban Dynamometer Drive Schedule.

40|$|The design {{trend for}} light duty diesel engines is towards lower {{compression}} ratio and higher turbocharger boost. This can enable higher specific power and lower pollutant emissions to be achieved, but raises concerns that cold start operation might be adversely affected. This is investigated and quantified through {{the study of}} a modern light duty diesel engine at two compression ratios and temperatures down to - 20 ºC. Key indicators of cold start performance are the magnitude and cycle-to-cycle variation of indicated mean effective pressure. Initial {{studies were carried out}} at 300 rpm, a speed representative of post-first-fire conditions. Studies were then conducted at higher engine speeds representative of cold idle. The utility of different injection strategies, timings and quantities is investigated when varying test temperature and engine speed through a range of values encountered during the cold start phase of engine operation. The importance of the glow plug as a cold start aid is also investigated by varying its operating temperature and protrusion into the combustion chamber. The indicated mean effective pressure was used to assess the effects of varying input parameters, and gross heat release rate information is used to identify the phenomena responsible for desirable or undesirable characteristics. Reduction in compression ratio led to no deterioration of initial start performance from speeds just above cranking, provided an appropriate injection strategy was chosen. Higher indicated mean effective pressure was possible at low speeds using low compression ratio due to reduced losses and more complete combustion. Cycle-to-cycle variability in indicated mean effective pressure increased markedly for both compression ratios at engine speeds representative of cold <b>idle,</b> especially when <b>test</b> temperature was reduced. Stability reduction was more severe at low compression ratio. Multiple pilot injections at high compression ratio cold idle resulted in better cycle-to-cycle stability. Analysis of heat release profiles suggested that additional pilots assisted fuel mixing, a conclusion supported by a computational fluid dynamics model. Multiple pilots created a more homogeneous fuel distribution through the bowl at time of main injection. Multiple pilots could not stabilise operation at low compression ratio. Improvement in cold idle at low compression ratio was achieved by increasing glow plug temperature, which significantly increased the rate of fuel preparation. This increased the initial rate of heat release and resulted in significantly less variation in the heat release rate profiles. Small changes in glow plug protrusion rapidly degraded cold idle performance, indicating the importance of correct design...|$|R

The fifty-six locomotives spent most of their time inside the borders of Maryland and some spent all their time inside the state borders. Usually when a locomotive traveled beyond the Maryland State border it was into an adjoining state. They were divided into four groups according to assignment: (1) Power Unit/Switcher Mate units, (2) Remote Control units, (3) SD 50 Pusher units and (4) Other units. The primary data of interest were idle data plus the status of the locomotive [...] stationary or moving. Also collected were main engine off, idling or working. Idle data were collected by county location, by locomotive status (stationary or moving) and type of idle (Idle 1, main engine idling, APU off; Idle 2, main engine off, APU on; Idle 3, main engine off, APU off; Idle 4, main engine idle, APU on). Desirable main engine idle states are main engine off and APU off or main engine off and APU on. Measuring the time the main engine spends in these desirable states versus the total time it could spend in an engine idling state allows the calculation of Percent Idle Management Effectiveness (%IME). IME {{is the result of the}} operation of the APU plus the implementation of CSXT's Warm Weather Shutdown Policy. It is difficult to separate the two. The units demonstrated an IME of 64 % at stationary <b>idle</b> for the <b>test</b> period. The data collected during calendar year 2004 demonstrated that 707, 600 gallons of fuel were saved and 285 tons of NOX were not emitted as a result of idle management in stationary idle, which translates to 12, 636 gallons and 5. 1 tons of NOx per unit respectively. The noise reduction capabilities of the APU demonstrated that at 150 feet from the locomotive the loaded APU with the main engine shut down generated noise that was only marginally above ambient noise level...|$|R
40|$|Side {{channels}} are channels of implicit information flow {{that can be}} used to find out information that is not allowed to flow through explicit channels. This thesis focuses on network side channels, where information flow occurs in the TCP/IP network stack implementations of operating systems. I will describe three new types of idle scans: a SYN backlog idle scan, a RST rate-limit idle scan, and a hybrid idle scan. Idle scans are special types of side channels that are designed to help someone performing a network measurement (typically an attacker or a researcher) to infer something about the network that they are not otherwise able to see from their vantage point. The thesis that this dissertation tests is this: because modern network stacks have shared resources, there is a wealth of information that can be inferred off-path by both attackers and Internet measurement researchers. With respect to attackers, no matter how carefully the security model is designed, the non-interference property is unlikely to hold, i. e., an attacker can easily find side channels of information flow to learn about the network from the perspective of the system remotely. One suggestion is that trust relationships for using resources be made explicit all the way down to IP layer with the goal of dividing resources and removing sharendess to prevent advanced network reconnaissance. With respect to Internet measurement researchers, in this dissertation I show that the information flow is rich enough to test connectivity between two arbitrary hosts on the Internet and even infer in which direction any blocking is occurring. To explore this thesis, I present three research efforts: [...] - First, I modeled a typical TCP/IP network stack. The building process for this modeling effort led to the discovery of two new idles scans: a SYN backlog idle scan and a RST rate-limited idle scan. The SYN backlog scan is particularly interesting because it does not require whoever is performing the measurements (i. e., the attacker or researcher) to send any packets to the victim (or target) at all. [...] - Second, I developed a hybrid idle scan that combines elements of the SYN backlog idle scan with Antirez's original IPID-based idle scan. This scan enables researchers to test whether two arbitrary machines in the world are able to communicate via TCP/IP, and, if not, in which direction the communication is being prevented. To test the efficacy of the hybrid <b>idle</b> scan, I <b>tested</b> three different kinds of servers (Tor bridges, Tor directory servers, and normal web servers) both inside and outside China. The results were congruent with published understandings of global Internet censorship, demonstrating that the hybrid idle scan is effective. [...] - Third, I applied the hybrid idle scan to the difficult problem of characterizing inconsistencies in the Great Firewall of China (GFW), which is the largest firewall in the world. This effort resolved many open questions about the GFW. The result of my dissertation work is an effective method for measuring Internet censorship around the world, without requiring any kind of distributed measurement platform or access to any of the machines that connectivity is tested to or from.
