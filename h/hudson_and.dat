50|$|Charles Stewart Wurts (1790-1859) was {{a founder}} of the Delaware <b>and</b> <b>Hudson</b> Canal Company, which built the Delaware <b>and</b> <b>Hudson</b> Canal <b>and</b> later became the Delaware <b>and</b> <b>Hudson</b> Railway. Along with his brothers, he helped launch the {{anthracite}} industry in America.|$|R
5|$|After {{establishing}} the center point of their parcel, <b>Hudson</b> <b>and</b> his partners built a trail {{from that point}} to their boat on the Cuyahoga. It {{took more than a}} week for the group to build the trail and carry their goods from the boat. They then built a small shelter, and began to establish the township.|$|E
5|$|At the settlement, <b>Hudson</b> <b>and</b> his men built a {{home and}} the township's {{population}} increased steadily {{over the next few}} decades. Hudson's wife and children eventually moved to the township, where they had two more children. Hudson cited religion as a major influence on his life. He died on March 17, 1836 at age 75.|$|E

50|$|Hudson {{discovered}} the <b>Hudson</b> Strait <b>and</b> the immense <b>Hudson</b> Bay on his final expedition, while {{still searching for}} the Northwest Passage. In 1611, after wintering {{on the shore of}} James Bay, Hudson wanted to press on to the west, but most of his crew mutinied. The mutineers cast <b>Hudson,</b> his son, <b>and</b> seven others adrift; the <b>Hudsons</b> <b>and</b> their companions were never seen again.|$|R
5|$|Conflicting reports {{initially}} made {{it impossible}} to determine who had made the first kill, which would be the first North Korean plane shot down by the United Nations forces in the war. Later research indicated Hudson had successfully shot down the first aircraft. The exact timing of <b>Hudson</b> <b>and</b> Moran's victories remains unclear, and it is possible each scored a victory within seconds of the other. For his determination in leading the flight, though, Little was awarded a Silver Star Medal.|$|E

5|$|At {{the center}} of the station, the marines find the colonists cocooned, serving as {{incubators}} for the creatures' offspring. When the marines kill a chestburster, the other aliens are roused and ambush the troops, killing Frost, Crowe, Wierzboswki, and Drake while capturing Apone and Dietrich alive to be cocooned as hosts. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, taking control of their armored personnel carrier, and rams the nest to rescue Corporal Hicks, Private <b>Hudson</b> <b>and</b> Private Vasquez, the only three survivors. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots Spunkmeyer and Ferro, causing it to crash into the station. The remaining group barricade themselves inside the colony command center.|$|E
