50|$|In 2014, Raytheon began testing Block IV {{improvements}} to attack sea and moving land targets. The new passive radar seeker {{will pick up}} the electromagnetic radar signature of a target and follow it, and actively send out a signal to bounce off potential targets before impact to discriminate its legitimacy before <b>impact.</b> <b>Mounting</b> the multi-mode sensor on the missile's nose would remove fuel space, but company officials believe the Navy would be willing to give up space for the sensor's new technologies. The previous Tomahawk Anti-Ship Missile, retired over a decade earlier, was equipped with inertial guidance and the seeker of the Harpoon missile and there was concern with its ability to clearly discriminate between targets from a long distance, since at the time Navy sensors did not have as much range as the missile itself, which would be more reliable with the new seeker's passive detection and active millimeter-wave radar. Raytheon estimates adding the new seeker would cost $250,000 per missile. Other upgrades include a sea-skimming flight path. The first Block IV TLAMs modified with a maritime attack capability will enter service in 2021.|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and {{osteoporosis}} {{are common}} age-related conditions with major public health <b>impact.</b> <b>Mounting</b> evidence suggests {{a link between}} the two diseases. The purpose of this research was to investigate the association of BMD measures (areal and volumetric) with prevalent CVD, incident CVD, and subclinical measures of atherosclerosis. We utilized data from two prospective epidemiological studies: a) the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study that enrolled a population of older men and women (age 68 - 80 years, 51 % women, 42 % black), and b) the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) that followed a cohort of women through the menopause transition (age 45 - 58 years, 61 % white, 64 % peri-menopausal). In the cross-sectional Health ABC analysis, lower volumetric BMD (vBMD) measures of the spine were associated with higher CVD prevalence in men and women, and areal BMD (aBMD) of the trochanter was related to CVD in women. Additionally, aBMD of the total hip was related to subclinical peripheral arterial disease in men. In the SWAN analysis, we observed an inverse cross-sectional association between trabecular vBMD of the spine and aortic calcification. Meanwhile, no associations with coronary artery calcification were noted after adjusting for age. In the longitudinal Health ABC analysis, lower vBMD measures of the spine were associated with higher CVD incidence in white men, but not in blacks. In women, aBMD of the femoral neck was associated with incident CVD in the full cohort. In race-specific analyses, aBMD measures of the total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter exhibited significant relationships with incident CVD in black women, but not in whites. These relationships were independent of age and shared risk factors between osteoporosis and CVD. The inflammatory cytokines interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, oxidized LDL, and endogenous estradiol did not explain these associations. Overall, our findings provide epidemiological evidence for the presence of an inverse association between BMD and CVD. An understanding of the common mechanisms underlying bone loss and atherogenesis has significant public health implications as it may set the stage for dual-purpose preventive and therapeutic interventions that target both osteoporosis and CVD...|$|E
