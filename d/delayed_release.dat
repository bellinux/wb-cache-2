5|$|Vampyr had a <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> in Germany {{and opened}} to a {{generally}} negative reception from audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere and it opened to more mixed opinions at its French debut. The film was long considered {{a low point}} in Dreyer's career, but modern critical reception to the film {{has become much more}} favorable with critics praising the film's disorienting visual effects and atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The soundtracks {{for both}} {{releases}} {{of the game}} were well received by critics. Uematsu's mix of orchestral and rock tracks for XIV were praised, though the <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> of a full album drew criticism. Soken's work on A Realm Reborn, including both his original tracks as well as themes carried over from XIV and previous Final Fantasy games, were heavily praised by reviewers for the game. Music from the initial release of the game has been played in the international Distant Worlds Final Fantasy concert series, and books of sheet music for piano arrangements of music from the game have been produced.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> {{from late}} 2012 to March 2013, Tomb Raider {{received}} much anticipation and hype. Upon release, {{the game was}} well received, with critics praising the graphics, the gameplay, Luddington's performance as Lara, and Lara's characterization and development, although {{the addition of a}} multiplayer mode was not well received and some reviewers directed criticism towards the disconnection between the narrative and the player's actions during gameplay. Tomb Raider sold one million copies within 48 hours of its release, and has sold more than 8.5 million copies as of April 2015, making it the best-selling Tomb Raider title to date. An updated version, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, was released in North America on 28 January 2014 and in Europe on 31 January 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One containing all features and DLC. A sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider, was released in November 2015.|$|E

5|$|Shattered Memories was {{published}} by Konami for the Wii in North America on 8 December 2009; in Europe on 26 February 2010; and in Japan on 25 March 2010. The Australian release was delayed until 22 June 2010, due to European supply problems caused by the economic effects of the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull. Major Australian retailers struggled to confirm available copies of the game for several months after the <b>delayed</b> <b>release,</b> potentially damaging initial sales of the game. The PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable versions were published in North America on 19 January 2010; in Europe on 26 February 2010; in Japan on 25 March 2010; and in Australia on 22 Apri 2010. It also became available on the PlayStation Network for Europe and the United Kingdom on 28 April 2014. Compatibility with PS Vita was planned but cancelled; the games are currently only available for the PSP.|$|E
5|$|The <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> of Odin Sphere led {{to issues}} with the company: they needed to start other {{projects}} to keep their company going, leading {{to the development of}} GrimGrimoire. The development of GrimGrimoire drained the company's funds, forcing Kamitani to take out a flexible loan of 20 million yen to keep the company afloat and fund development for their next projects, in addition to finding these projects new publishers as Atlus refused to take any more of Vanillaware's products until they had seen how Odin Sphere performed commercially. Nippon Ichi Software would handle GrimGrimoire, while Marvelous Entertainment accepted their next project, Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii. The commercial success of Odin Sphere both enabled the development of Muramasa: The Demon Blade and cleared Kamitani's debt. In tandem with their other titles, Odin Sphere helped establish Vanillaware as a respected developer.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the development, the game was intended to be released on the PlayStation 2. In May 2005, however, after the positive reception of the tech demo of Final Fantasy VII, the team decided to move the game to the PlayStation 3 and developed it with the new Crystal Tools engine, a seventh generation multiplatform game engine created by Square Enix for its next generation games. Square Enix believed that developing a new engine would speed up development time later in the project, though it would initially cause a delay in the game's development. However, the delay was longer than originally anticipated as the engine had to accommodate the requirements of several other games in addition to XIII. Another factor in the platform move was the <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> of Final Fantasy XII, which came out a very short time before the release of the PlayStation 3. A PC port was considered during development, but was decided against due to how Square Enix saw the video game market situation at the time as well as additional complexities that Square Enix did not have experience with related to the PC platform, such as security issues. Final Fantasy XIII was first shown at the 2006 E3 convention. The trailer shown was an artistic concept that did not represent the final concept for the game, since at the time there was no playable form of the game. Announced alongside the game was Final Fantasy Versus XIII, later retitled as Final Fantasy XV, and the PlayStation Portable game Final Fantasy Type-0, originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, the three of which form the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy series. Square Enix explained that although all three games are thematically linked, they are not directly related in terms of story.|$|E

25|$|Centurylink {{continues}} {{to partner with}} Direct TV to bundle services, which could indicate a lack of faith in their own PRISM TV service. This, coupled with their <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> of PRISM and its extremely slow growth casts Centurylink's foray into TV distribution as a failed experiment.|$|E
25|$|The {{oral route}} is {{generally}} {{the most convenient}} and costs the least. However, some drugs can cause gastrointestinal tract irritation. For drugs that come in <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> or time-release formulations, breaking the tablets or capsules can lead to more rapid delivery of the drug than intended.|$|E
25|$|This {{was another}} routine by the Weinsteins, who <b>delayed</b> <b>releases</b> {{so they could}} shift {{potential}} money-losing films to future fiscal years and ensure they would receive annual bonuses from Miramax's corporate parent, The Walt Disney Company.|$|R

25|$|The album {{spent two}} weeks on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at No. 122. The {{critical}} reaction upon the album's <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> has been mixed, though fairly acknowledging the commercial challenges faced by many established artists against the prevailing sounds of the 1990s, including electronica and the emerging genre of grunge.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} {{edition of}} the single was released five days before the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, which caused a <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> in many regions of Japan.

25|$|Reviews for {{the delayed}} PC version {{questioned}} the reason behind the <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> date {{as the game}} was virtually unchanged from the console version albeit with better graphical enhancements and minor bonus content.

25|$|Griffith left Biograph in October 1913 after {{finishing}} Judith of Bethulia, {{unhappy with the}} company's resistance to larger budgets, feature film production or giving onscreen credit to him and the cast. With him went many of the Biograph actors, his cameraman Billy Bitzer and his production crew. As a final slight to Griffith, Biograph <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> of Judith of Bethulia until March 1914, to avoid a profit-sharing arrangement the company had with him.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, the Tennessee Valley Authority National Fertilizer Development Center began {{developing}} sulfur-coated urea; sulfur {{was used}} as the principal coating material because of its low cost and its value as a secondary nutrient. Usually there is another wax or polymer which seals the sulfur; the slow-release properties depend on the degradation of the secondary sealant by soil microbes as well as mechanical imperfections (cracks, etc.) in the sulfur. They typically provide 6 to 16 weeks of <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> in turf applications. When a hard polymer is used as the secondary coating, the properties are a cross between diffusion-controlled particles and traditional sulfur-coated.|$|E

25|$|A {{prescription}} extended release niacin, Niaspan, has a {{film coating}} that <b>delays</b> <b>release</b> of the niacin, {{resulting in an}} absorption {{over a period of}} 8–12 hours.

They also announced the patch Meggs had spoken of would be released within the week. On December 19, Mark Dochtermann promised the patch would be released before Christmas, along with Vengeance, stating they had <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> of the patch for the PC version so as to coincide its release with the Mac version of the game. Although the Mac version was ultimately released in January 2002, the patch was never officially released by MumboJumbo for either version of the game.|$|E
25|$|The game {{received}} {{a boost to}} pre-order sales following the <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> of Final Fantasy XV, which was originally scheduled for the same month as Persona 5.

In its first week of release, Persona 5 topped Japanese game sales charts. The PS4 version reached #1 with sales of 264,793 units, while the PS3 version reached #2 with 72,974. This resulted in a combined sales total of 337,767 units.
