5|$|SuperSpeed (SS) adds two {{additional}} pairs of shielded twisted wire (and new, mostly compatible expanded connectors). These {{are dedicated to}} <b>full-duplex</b> SuperSpeed operation. The half-duplex lines are still used for configuration.|$|E
5|$|USB3.0 {{provides}} {{two additional}} differential pairs (four wires, SSTx+, SSTx−, SSRx+ and SSRx−), providing <b>full-duplex</b> data transfers at SuperSpeed, {{which makes it}} similar to Serial ATA or single-lane PCI Express.|$|E
5|$|SuperSpeed (SS) rate of 5.0Gbit/s. The written USB3.0 {{specification}} {{was released}} by Intel and its partners in August 2008. The first USB3.0 controller chips were sampled by NEC in May 2009, and the first products using the USB3.0 specification arrived in January 2010. USB3.0 connectors are generally backward compatible, but include new wiring and <b>full-duplex</b> operation.|$|E
5|$|The new SuperSpeed mode {{provides}} a {{data signaling rate}} of 5.0Gbit/s. However, due to the overhead incurred by 8b/10b encoding, the payload throughput is actually 4Gbit/s, and the specification considers it reasonable to achieve only around 3.2Gbit/s (0.4GB/s or 400MB/s). However, this should increase with future hardware advances. Communication is <b>full-duplex</b> in SuperSpeed transfer mode; earlier modes are half-duplex, arbitrated by the host.|$|E
25|$|The <b>full-duplex</b> {{capability}} makes SPI {{very simple}} and efficient for single master/single slave applications. Some devices use the <b>full-duplex</b> mode to implement an efficient, swift data stream for {{applications such as}} digital audio, digital signal processing, or telecommunications channels, but most off-the-shelf chips stick to half-duplex request/response protocols.|$|E
25|$|Broad bandwidth: A single {{optical fiber}} can carry over 3,000,000 <b>full-duplex</b> voice calls or 90,000 TV channels.|$|E

25|$|Microwire/Plus is an {{enhancement}} of Microwire and features <b>full-duplex</b> communication {{and support for}} SPI modes 0 and 1. There was no specified improvement in serial clock speed.|$|E
25|$|UHS-III: Version 6.0, {{released}} in February 2017, added two new data rates to the standard. FD312 provides 312 MB/s while FD624 doubles that. Both are <b>full-duplex.</b> The physical interface and pin-layout {{are the same}} as with UHS-II, retaining backward compatibility.|$|E
25|$|A {{version of}} Ethernet (Avionics <b>Full-Duplex</b> Switched Ethernet (AFDX) / ARINC 664) transmits data between {{the flight deck}} and {{aircraft}} systems. The control, navigation, and communication systems are networked with the passenger cabin's in-flight internet systems. In January 2008, FAA concerns were reported regarding possible passenger access to the 787's computer networks; Boeing has stated that various protective hardware and software solutions are employed, including air gaps to physically separate the networks, and firewalls for software separation. These measures prevent data transfer from the passenger internet system to the maintenance or navigation systems.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the only}} means for race {{officials}} to communicate to drivers was through the usage of flags. With the advent of two-way or <b>full-duplex</b> radios, {{this is not necessarily}} the case. Most drivers racing on paved short track oval courses do not rely on flags; rather, they are informed of track conditions by their crew chiefs and spotters or by yellow / red flashing lights found on most oval tracks. Occasionally, though, some drivers must rely on the use of flags for information when they experience radio malfunctions. Flags are still used to tell the crowd of spectators what is happening. Dirt track and lower level racers are less likely to have radios than their paved track counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|Because the <b>full-duplex</b> {{nature of}} SPI is rarely used, an {{extension}} uses both data pins in a half-duplex configuration to send two bits per clock cycle. [...] Typically a command byte is sent requesting a response in dual mode, {{after which the}} MOSI line becomes SIO0 (serial I/O 0) and carries even bits, while the MISO line becomes SIO1 and carries odd bits. [...] Data is still transmitted msbit-first, but SIO1 carries bits 7, 5, 3 and 1 of each byte, while SIO0 carries bits 6, 4, 2 and 0.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{keyboard}} was mechanically connected {{directly with the}} printer mechanism, keyboard character inputs were immediately typed by the printer mechanism, behavior called half-duplex {{by most of the}} computer industry. [...] However, IBM insisted on calling this behavior full duplex, causing much confusion. [...] If the computer system in turn echoed the typed input, having been configured to expect a <b>full-duplex</b> terminal, the echoed output would look something like tthhiiss. [...] A further discussion of this terminology {{can be seen in the}} article on terminal emulation and elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the late}} 1980s {{and the arrival}} of {{cellular}} and PCS mobile phone service, GTE offered Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) on VHF (152MHz) and UHF (454MHz) frequencies in Los Gatos. The service included <b>full-duplex</b> dial service. There were tight restrictions on call lengths because {{there were only a few}} channels available. In the late 1970s, daytime calls longer than three minutes were billed at over $1 per minute to discourage the long-winded. The VHF equipment was located near the Santa Clara Valley Water District's Rinconada Water Treatment Plant on More Avenue at NAD27 coordinates [...] The IMTS system included General Electric mobile radio voting equipment. (Voting is a form of diversity combining used in mobile radio systems on land.) One receiver for at least one of the voted IMTS channels was located in a pole mount-cabinet on a utility pole along Montevina Road off California State Route 17. These IMTS systems were dismantled after cellular systems became available to subscribers in the Bay Area.|$|E
50|$|Some {{datasets}} support <b>full-duplex</b> operation, and <b>full-duplex</b> (4-wire) {{can be used}} in many {{circumstances to}} improve performance by eliminating the turn-around time, at the added expense of 4-wire installation and support. In typical <b>full-duplex,</b> data packets are transmitted along one wire pair while the acknowledgements are returned along the other.|$|E
50|$|A <b>full-duplex</b> (FDX) system, or {{sometimes}} called double-duplex, allows communication in both directions, and, unlike half-duplex, allows {{this to happen}} simultaneously. Land-line telephone networks are <b>full-duplex,</b> since they allow both callers to speak and be heard at the same time, with the transition from four to two wires being achieved by a hybrid coil in a telephone hybrid. Modern cell phones are also <b>full-duplex.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A simple {{illustration}} of a <b>full-duplex</b> communication system. <b>Full-duplex</b> is not common in handheld radios as shown here {{due to the}} cost and complexity of common duplexing methods, but is used in telephones, cellphones and cordless phones.|$|E
50|$|In such conditions, the <b>full-duplex</b> {{end of the}} {{connection}} sends its packets while receiving other packets; {{this is exactly the}} point of a <b>full-duplex</b> connection. Meanwhile, the half-duplex end cannot accept the incoming data while it is sending - it will sense it as a collision. The half-duplex device ceases its current data transmission, sends a jam signal instead and then retries later as per CSMA/CD. This results in the <b>full-duplex</b> side receiving an incomplete frame with CRC error or a runt frame. It does not detect any collision since CSMA/CD is disabled on the <b>full-duplex</b> side. As a result, when both devices are attempting to transmit at (nearly) the same time, the packet sent by the <b>full-duplex</b> end will be discarded and lost due to an assumed collision and the packet sent by the half duplex device will be delayed or lost due to a CRC error in the frame.|$|E

50|$|The Lynx {{protocol}} {{is based}} on the assumption that a connection between two sites is capable of <b>full-duplex</b> transmission. Lynx will send a stream of data while simultaneously polling the receive-buffer for any interruptions from the other end. On half duplex links this will not work, but almost all modems in use today are capable of <b>full-duplex</b> operation. Lynx makes use of <b>full-duplex</b> operations to insure efficient transfer speed. On certain occasions, after a file header is transmitted or after recovering from a line error, Lynx will wait for the other end to resynchronize.|$|E

50|$|If a {{duplex channel}} can be {{operated}} {{only one way}} at a time it is styled a half-duplex channel and half-duplex protocols must be used. If a duplex channel can be shared and operated in both directions simultaneously it is styled a <b>full-duplex</b> channel and <b>full-duplex</b> protocols may be used.|$|E

50|$|SDLC {{operates}} independently on each communications link, and {{can operate}} on point-to-pointmultipointor loop facilities, on switched or dedicated, two-wire or four-wire circuits, and with <b>full-duplex</b> and half-duplex operation.A unique characteristic of SDLC {{is its ability}} to mix half-duplex secondary stations with <b>full-duplex</b> primary stations on four-wire circuits, thus reducing the cost of dedicated facilities.|$|E
50|$|A good analogy for a <b>full-duplex</b> {{system is}} a two-lane road with one lane for each direction. Moreover, in most <b>full-duplex</b> mode systems {{carrying}} computer data, transmitted data {{does not appear to}} be sent until it has been received and an acknowledgment is sent back by the other party; that way, such systems implement reliable transmission methods.|$|E
50|$|All {{these three}} {{standards}} define both <b>full-duplex</b> and half-duplex communication. However, half-duplex operation for gigabit speed isn't supported by any existing hardware. Higher speed standards, 2.5GBASE-T up to 40GBASE-T running at 2.5 to 40 Gbit/s, consequently define only <b>full-duplex</b> point-to-point links which are generally connected by network switches, and don't support the traditional shared-medium CSMA/CD operation.|$|E
