5|$|Roguelike {{games were}} {{initially}} developed for computing environments with limited memory, including shared mainframe systems and early home computers; this limitation prevented developers from retaining {{all but a}} few dungeon levels <b>in</b> <b>memory</b> while the game was running, leading to procedural generation to avoid the memory storage issue. Roguelikes were also often written in languages like BASIC, which are not as efficient <b>in</b> <b>memory</b> and data management compared to modern languages, further limiting the scope the game could cover.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{the dual}} store memory model {{proposed}} by Richard C. Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin <b>in</b> 1968, <b>memories</b> can reside <b>in</b> the short-term [...] "buffer" [...] {{for a limited}} time while they are simultaneously strengthening their associations <b>in</b> long-term <b>memory.</b> When items are first presented, they enter short-term memory, but due to its limited space, as new items enter, older ones are pushed out. However, each time an item <b>in</b> short-term <b>memory</b> is rehearsed, it is strengthened <b>in</b> long-term <b>memory.</b> Similarly, the longer an item stays <b>in</b> short-term <b>memory,</b> the stronger its association becomes <b>in</b> long-term <b>memory.</b>|$|R
