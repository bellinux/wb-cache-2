2500|$|Faxian, a Chinese monk, recounted:Ten <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> Buddha's tooth will {{be brought}} out and carried to the Abhayagiri Monastery... {{on both sides of}} the road; the king sets images of the Five Hundred Forms which the Buddha assumed in his {{previous}} existence.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In four <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> {{you will}} be weeping instead of laughing, {{because there will be}} {{hundreds}} of miles between you and me.' ...|$|E
60|$|So I tramped {{down this}} morning in the snow-storm--and there was a {{stirring}} time. They will sail a week or ten <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The envoy thought awhile, then replied smiling: [...] "It is well, O Egypt; on {{the tenth}} <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> I will attend for my answer, {{and on the}} {{eleventh}} I sail hence to join Antony my Lord." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I exclaimed, {{feeling that}} I must say {{something}} {{and that it}} did not much matter what I said, [...] "Dogeetah will arrive here on the second <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> within half an hour after sunset." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Begone," [...] {{said the}} king, [...] "and stand before {{me on the}} thirtieth <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> with the answer of this boy with an axe! If thou standest not before me, then some shall come to seek thee and the boy with an axe also." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on!" [...] Daylight cried. [...] "Bettles's right, and I want in on this. I bet {{five hundred}} that sixty <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> I pull {{up at the}} Tivoli door with the Dyea mail." ...|$|E
6000|$|Coppy {{rose and}} escorted his small guest to the door, adding--'You're {{the best of}} little fellows, Winkie. I tell you what. In thirty <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> you can tell if you like--tell any one you like.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{made you}} a {{sporting}} proposition, Warden," [...] I said quietly. [...] "You can cinch me {{as tight as}} you please, but if I smile ten <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> will you give the Bull Durham to Morrell and Oppenheimer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A bat it is, O King, {{one with}} wide wings and swift. This bat says that my sister, One-hand, will meet {{you on the}} third <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> at this hour on the further side of the ford of the Ibululwana, where three milk-trees grow {{together}} on a knoll. She will be sitting under the centre milk-tree and will wait for two hours, no more, {{to show you the}} secret entrance to the kloof." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The news is ill, O Queen," [...] I answered. [...] "I {{have this}} from the lips of Dolabella, who has it {{straight}} from Cæsar's secretary. On the third <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> Cæsar will send thee and the Princes Ptolemy and Alexander and the Princess Cleopatra to Rome, there to feast {{the eyes of the}} Roman mob, and be led in triumph to that Capitol where thou didst swear to set thy throne!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{words are}} these I hear?" [...] cried Meneptah. [...] "Is there indeed {{one in this}} land of Egypt who dares to say that Pharaoh's decree shall be disobeyed? Write it down, Scribes, and you, O Officers, let it be proclaimed from Thebes to the sea, that on the third <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> at the hour of noon in the temple of Hathor in this city, the Prince, the Royal Heir, Seti Meneptah, Beloved of Ra, will wed the Royal Princess of Egypt, Lily of Love, Beloved of Hathor, Userti, Daughter of me, the god." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall see}} me," [...] said the soldier, [...] "all in good time. Three <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> I will come again, and will show myself to you, but just now it cannot be. But if I come, {{will you marry}} me?" ...|$|E
60|$|P.S. I {{learned from}} a letter from St. Petersburg that Fred. hurried off to Copenhagen to meet Mary before she left, {{which was to be}} the 1st day of June. I infer from this that she should be here in two or three <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Standing," [...] he snarled. [...] "I'll go you. But you {{bet your}} sweet life you'll have to go some to smile ten <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> Roll him over, boys, and cinch him till you hear his ribs crack. Hutchins, show him {{you know how to}} do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{a doctor}} also," [...] went on Mavovo, [...] "one of the {{greatest}} of doctors who can open the 'Gates of Distance' and read that which is hid in the womb of the Future. Therefore I will answer your questions which you put to the lord Macumazana, the great and wise white man whom I serve, because we have fought together in many battles. Yes, I will be his Mouth, I will answer. The white man Dogeetah, who is your blood-brother and whose word is your word among the Mazitu, will arrive here at sunset on the second <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> I have spoken." ...|$|R
5000|$|With this {{declaration}} of war, radio {{became part of}} the propaganda campaign. Throughout the war, the attack on Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda. Direct wartime programming began shortly after the United States entry into the war. The first live broadcast to Germany, called Stimmen aus Amerika ("Voices from America") took place on Feb 1, 1942. It was introduced by [...] "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" [...] and included the pledge: [...] "Today, and every <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war.... The news may be good or bad for us - We will always tell you the truth." ...|$|R
60|$|The sombre van, {{which had}} {{accompanied}} them all <b>day</b> <b>from</b> London, <b>now</b> began {{to reveal that}} their destination was also its own. It had been drawn up exactly opposite the open gate. The bystanders all fell back, forming a clear lane from the gateway to the van, and the men in cloaks entered the latter conveyance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Between {{the desire}} of a beloved {{daughter}} to whom I have pledged my word and my duty to the great city over which I rule, my strait is hard indeed," [...] answered Sakon. [...] "Hearken, king Ithobal, I must have time. Give me eight <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> in which to answer you, for if you will not, I deny your suit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go back," [...] he said, [...] "and {{tell that}} dog you name a sultan, that low as he is, the humble-born son of Ayoub, I, Al-je-bal, do him an honour {{that he does}} not observe. My queen is dead, and two <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> when my month of {{mourning}} is expired, I shall take to wife his niece, the princess of Baalbec, who sits here beside me, my bride-elect." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{for this}} change certain things would happen twelve <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> For instance, Nikolaus would save Lisa from drowning. He would {{arrive on the}} scene at exactly the right moment--four minutes past ten, the long-ago {{appointed}} instant of time--and the water would be shoal, the achievement easy and certain. But he will arrive some seconds too late, now; Lisa will have struggled into deeper water. He will do his best, but both will drown." ...|$|E
5000|$|Donovan's primary {{interests}} were military intelligence and covert operations. Sherwood handled {{the dissemination of}} domestic information and foreign propaganda. He recruited the noted radio producer John Houseman, who because of his Romanian birth {{at the time was}} technically an enemy alien, to develop an overseas radio program for broadcast to the Axis powers and the populations of the territories they had conquered, which became known as the Voice of America. The first broadcast, called in German Stimmen aus Amerika ("Voices from America") aired on Feb. 1, 1942, and included the pledge: [...] "Today, and every <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war[...] [...] [...] The news may be good or bad for us -- We will always tell you the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was no answer, and Chaka spoke again. [...] "This is {{no little}} matter," [...] he said, [...] "to be washed {{away with the}} blood of one or two and be forgotten. The man who wrought it shall not die alone or travel with a few to the world of spirits. All his tribe shall go with him, down to the baby in his hut and cattle in his kraal! Let {{messengers}} go out east and west, and north and south, and summon the witch-doctors from every quarter! Let them summon the captains from every regiment and the headmen from every kraal! On the tenth <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> the circle of the Ingomboco must be set, and there shall be such a smelling out of wizards and of witches as has not been known in Zululand!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'So {{then here}} is my plan. Listen, Nala, and say if it be good, or if thou hast a better, show it forth. Let {{messengers}} go out and summon all thy impi, that it be gathered here on the third <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> This being done, let the impi, led by Maiwa, march on the morrow of the fourth day, and crossing the mountains let it travel along {{on the other side}} of the mountains till it come to the place on the further side of which is the kraal of Wambe; that shall be some three days' journey in all.[*] Then on the night of the third day's journey, let Maiwa lead the impi in silence up the secret path, so that it comes to the crest of the mountain that is above the strong place, and here let it hide among the rocks.|$|R
6000|$|... "My lords," [...] {{she began}} {{as soon as}} she had {{received}} their obsequious greetings, [...] "I know not if you have heard the news. The Cæsar hath succeeded in quitting Rome; he {{is on his way to}} rejoin his legions and nothing can stand in the way of his progress. In a few <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> he will make his State re-entry into the city, and the city will resound from end to end with rejoicings in his honour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will do my best, Sir Wingrave," [...] he said, {{reverting}} {{to the subject}} of their interview, [...] "to study Miss Lundy's interests in every way. I will also see that she has the letter you have left for her within eight <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> But if you could see you way to leave some sort of address so that I should have a chance of communicating with you, if necessary, I should assume my responsibilities with a lighter heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Yarmouth," [...] said Mrs. Flushing, [...] "just find my {{diary and}} see where ten <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> would bring us to, and ask the hall porter how many men 'ud be wanted to row eight people up the river for a week, and what it 'ud cost, {{and put it on}} a slip of paper and leave it on my dressing-table. Now--" [...] she pointed at the door with a superb {{forefinger}} so that Rachel had to lead the way.|$|E
50|$|Popularly {{known as}} 3 Up/ 4 Dn (Kalka Mail was 1 Up/ 2 Dn), it {{originally}} {{ran in the}} pre-independence <b>days</b> <b>from</b> Santahar, <b>now</b> in Bangladesh, to Guwahati. It travelled along the Santahar-Kaunia Line up to Kaunia, then to Lalmonirhat along Parbatipur-Lalmonirhat-Burimari Line, crossing the Teesta. Thereafter, it took the now defunct Mogalhat-Gitaldaha route crossing the Dharla over the bridge, part of which has since been washed away, on to Golokganj, Fakiragram and Amingaon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good. At dawn on {{the fourth}} <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> it {{is the purpose of}} Umgona, his {{daughter}} Nanea, and Nahoon, to cross the river into Natal by the drift that is called Crocodile Drift, taking their cattle with them and flying from the king. I also shall be of their company, for they know that I have learned their secret, and would murder me if I tried to leave them. Now you who are chief of the border and guardian of that drift, must hide at night with some men among the rocks in the shallows of the drift and await our coming. First Nanea will cross driving the cows and calves, for so it is arranged, and I shall help her; then will follow Umgona and Nahoon with the oxen and heifers. On these two you must fall, killing them and capturing the cattle, and afterwards I will give you the rifle." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He bids you regard him as your leader, {{and to act}} as he may advise. Two of us are to go {{with you}} to look after your horses. He begs that one of you will come {{to the base of the}} Great Pyramid on the twelfth day after I left him, that is in ten <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> to tell him what news you have {{gathered}} and to consult with him. He is convinced that the news you sent him will call all the Arabs to arms again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is all which we need say for the present M. le Comte," [...] {{concluded}} His Majesty; [...] "within six <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> you should be {{on your way to}} Brest where Le Levantin should by then be waiting her orders and ready to put to sea. A month later, if wind, weather and circumstances favour us, that young adventurer will have been handed over to the English authorities and we, who had worked out the difficult diplomatic problems so carefully, will have shared between us the English millions." ...|$|E
6000|$|Meantime, {{watch for}} a sign from me. Eight <b>days</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> we shall be wide asunder; for I shall be {{on the border of}} the Pacific, and you far out on the Atlantic, {{approaching}} England. That day, if I am alive and my sublime discovery is proved and established, I will send you greeting, and my messenger shall deliver it where you are, in the solitudes of the sea; for I will waft a vast sun-spot across the disk like drifting smoke, and you will know it for my love-sign, and will say [...] "Mulberry Sellers throws us a kiss across the universe." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was only}} two <b>days</b> <b>now</b> <b>from</b> the date which I had been assured was to mark a crisis in his fortunes. Would he regard this sudden tempest as being in any way {{connected}} with the mysterious fate which threatened him? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We come, O ye gods," [...] said Nam, {{addressing}} Juanna and Otter, who sat {{side by side}} on the throne-like chairs: [...] "we come to {{ask your}} will, for ye have laid down a new law which we do not understand. On the third <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> is the feast of Jal, and fifty women are made ready to be offered to Jal that his wrath may be appeased with their blood, and that he may number their spirits among his servants, and withhold his anger from the People of the Mist, giving them a good season. This has been the custom of the land for many a generation, and whenever that custom was broken then the sun has not shone, nor the corn grown, nor have the cattle and the goats multiplied after their kind. But now, O ye gods, ye have proclaimed a new law, and I, who am yet your servant, come hither to ask your will. How shall the feast go, and what sacrifice shall be offered unto you?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} head and spoke no more of Eric; but Björn's words fixed {{themselves}} in her heart like arrows. The tale was strange to her, for it seemed that Eric had been made outlaw at Swanhild's suit, and yet Eric was Swanhild's love: for Swanhild's self had sent the lock of Brighteyes' hair by Hall, {{saying that he was}} her love and soon would wed her. How, then, did Swanhild bring a suit against him who should be her husband? Moreover, she heard that Swanhild sailed down to Coldback, and was bidden to the marriage-feast, that should be on the third <b>day</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> Could it be, then, when all was said and done, that Eric was less faithless than she deemed? Gudruda's heart stood still and the blood rushed to her brow when she thought on it. Also, even if it were so, it was now too late. And surely it was not so, for had not Eric been made outlaw? Men were not made outlaw for a little thing. Nay, she would meet her fate, and ask no more of Eric and his doings.|$|R
