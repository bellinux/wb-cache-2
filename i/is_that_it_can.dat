5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of {{the wide variety of}} evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|Aveni {{states that}} one of the {{strengths}} of the Brown methodology <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the Incas as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the Han dynasty, in the second century BC.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of general relativity <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be applied to the universe as a whole. A key point is that, on large scales, our universe appears to be constructed along very simple lines: all current observations suggest that, on average, the structure of the cosmos should be approximately the same, regardless of an observer's location or direction of observation: the universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. Such comparatively simple universes can be described by simple solutions of Einstein's equations. The current cosmological models of the universe are obtained by combining these simple solutions to general relativity with theories describing the properties of the universe's matter content, namely thermodynamics, nuclear- and particle physics. According to these models, our present universe emerged from an extremely dense high-temperature state –the Big Bang– roughly 14 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.|$|E

50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of a heterodyne bat detector <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> only convert a narrow band of frequencies, typically 5 kHz, {{and has to}} be continually retuned, and can easily miss species out of its current tuned range.|$|R
5|$|The GCD of two numbers a and b is {{the product}} of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used {{multiple}} times, but only as long as the product of these factors divides both a and b. For example, since 1386 can be factored into 2×3×3×7×11, and 3213 can be factored into 3×3×3×7×17, the greatest common divisor of 1386 and 3213 equals 63=3×3×7, the product of their shared prime factors. If two numbers have no prime factors in common, their greatest common divisor is 1 (obtained here as an instance of the empty product), in other words they are coprime. A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors. Factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many widely used cryptographic protocols is based upon its infeasibility.|$|E

25|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the divisional structure <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> support unhealthy rivalries among divisions.

25|$|The {{significant}} {{advantage of}} GC/pyrolysis method for hydrogen isotope measurement <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> separate different compounds in the samples.

40|$|This paper elaborates on {{the role}} of {{fidelity}} on the effectiveness of simulation-based driver training. The use of visual stereo presentations in driving simulators is used as a case study. A literature review indicates that a stereo presentation is associated with possible advantages and disadvantages. Possible advantages <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> provide a relevant cue for near-distant driving tasks, induce positive reactions amongst participants, improve validity and credibility of data, improve performance and learning, and create new possibilities for augmented stereo instructions. Possible disadvantages <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> increase costs, increase simulator sickness, increase distraction, and induce performance reduction in case of display artefacts. Additionally, complicating factors due to the complexity of human perception, human psychology, and individual differences, make it difficult to predict effects of fidelity on training outcome. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> concluded <b>that</b> changes in fidelity ambiguously affect training effectiveness. Exploitation of non-fidelity aspects, such as the didactical possibilities of driving simulators, might be a more obvious means of improving training...|$|R
