The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the change of physical and chemical properties of peat soil of Jambo Aye Aceh Utara due to the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> drainage <b>treatments.</b> The research was set according to randomized completely design with three replication. Pipes of alluminium with length of 100 cm and diameter of 30 cm was used to set the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> drainage <b>treatments.</b> The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> drainage <b>treatments</b> were: no-drainage, 20 cm, 40 cm, and 60 cm. The results showed the dept of drainage on peat soil affected some of physical and chemical properties of peat soil. From the physical properties point of view, the deeper of drainage was conducted, the more subsidence occurred, otherwise the higher bulk density was occurred. From the chemical properties point of view, the drainage more than 20 cm decreased pH, N-total, P-available, K-exchangeable, and Base Saturated, otherwise increased C-organic, Cation Exchangeable Capacity, and Al-exchangeable. It was recommended to use the drainage <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 20 cm for controlling the change of some physical and chemical properties of peat soil...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} high {{frequency}} mechanical impact (HFMI) treatment procedure on the weld toe geometry and fatigue strength in 1300 MPa yield strength steel welds were investigated. In this regard first {{the effect of}} three or six run treatments on the weld toe geometry was evaluated. The fatigue strength and weld toe geometry of as-welded and HFMI treated samples was then compared. Fatigue testing was done under fully reversed, constant amplitude bending load. When {{increasing the number of}} treatment runs from three to six, the weld toe radius and width of treatment remained almost constant. However, a slightly smaller <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> in the base metal and a somewhat larger <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> in the weld metal was observed. HFMI treatment increased the fatigue strength by 26 %. The treatment did not increase the weld toe radius significantly, but resulted in a more uniform weld toe geometry along the weld. A <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> in the base metal in the range of 0. 15 - 0. 19 mm and a width of treatment in the range of 2. 5 - 3 mm, were achieved.

30|$|By advocating {{empirical}} linguistics research, I do {{not mean}} to undermine the value of a traditional study of language and the power of human intuition.

The other way round, the results of quantitative research can well serve to inform classical linguistic propositions. For instance, the Zipf kind of relationship describing the distribution of many types of linguistic data, characterizes most of self-organizing systems, indicating strongly that language is a self-organizing system, too.

Using tensile plastic deformation, the residual stress in martensite was changed, giving rise to a strong increase of the Barkhausen noise activity. This variation was correlated to a modification of the sign and amplitude of the residual stress in the martensite phase. Directional measurements of the Barkhausen noise revealed the anisotropy of the residual stresses induced by the tensile plastic deformation.
