I succeeded to this estate <b>encumbered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>{{mortgage}},</b> created by your grandfather, an extravagant and unbusiness-like man. That mortgage I looked to your mother's fortune to pay off, but other calls made this impossible. For instance, the sea-wall here had to be built if the Abbey was to be saved, and half a mile of sea-walling costs something. Also very extensive repairs to the house were necessary, and I was forced to take three farms in hand when I retired from the army fifteen years ago. This has involved {{a net loss of}} about ten thousand pounds, while all the time the interest had to be paid and the place kept up in a humble fashion." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s, as Berlin {{experienced}} an economic boom after German reunification, {{a group of}} investors bought the former listening station area from the City of Berlin with the intention to build hotels and apartments. There was talk of preserving the listening station as a spy museum. Berlin's building boom produced a glut of buildings, however, and the Teufelsberg project became unprofitable. The construction project was then aborted. As of the early 2000s, there has been talk of the city buying back the hill. However, this is unlikely, as the area is <b>encumbered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> of nearly 50 million dollars. The site has been heavily covered in graffiti since the company abandoned the project. Since 1996, the site has been privately owned and is currently fenced off from the surrounding park. In the summer of 2016, landlord Marvin Schutte opened the site to visitors who are able to climb the listening station towers and admire the ever-evolving [...] "street art gallery" [...] that fills the site's abandoned buildings. [...] The site and buildings have uneven surfaces, broken glass, and building debris. Accessing the main dome involves ascending a pitch dark stairwell in the centre of the building. As of April 2017, entry to the site is €8 payable at the main entrance gate and a sign informs visitors that it is open from 10am to [...] "one hour before sunset." ...|$|R
