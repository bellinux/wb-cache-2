25|$|Planning {{permission}} for Runway 2 (23L/05R) permits use of both runways between {{the hours of}} 0600-2200. At night between the hours of 2200-0600 single runway operations based on Runway 1 (23R/05L) are used. Exceptions are made for emergencies and planned maintenance. In practice, <b>dual</b> <b>runway</b> operations incorporating Runway 2 (23L/05R) are only used at peak demand, which is currently {{in the morning and}} then again between 1300-2000hrs.|$|E
25|$|Most {{aircraft}} arriving into Manchester Airport use the Instrument Landing System, {{which in}} line with most other airports has a glide slope of 3 degrees equal to descending 318 feet per nautical mile. The prevailing wind direction is westerly, so normally aircraft fly from northeast to southwest. In practice this means that normally aircraft land from the northeast over Stockport, Cheadle and Heald Green and takeoff towards Knutsford. In <b>dual</b> <b>runway</b> operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 1 (23R) and depart from Runway 2 (23L). When the wind direction changes, usually affecting 20% of movements per annum, operations are reversed with aircraft landing from the southwest, lining up to the south over Northwich and over Knutsford and taking off towards Stockport. In <b>dual</b> <b>runway</b> operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 2 (05R) and depart from Runway 1 (05L). Sometimes, aircraft arriving into Manchester Airport are held in stacks, usually in poor weather when the movement rate decreases. The airport has 3 stacks: DAYNE, MIRSI and ROSUN, each located approximately 15/20 miles from the airport. DAYNE serves arrivals from the south, ROSUN {{from the north and}} east and MIRSI from the west. If you live within 20 miles of the airport, you will likely see and hear aircraft.|$|E

It is located next to the ancient city of Bagram, 11 km southeast of Charikar in the Parwan Province of Afghanistan. The airfield features a <b>dual</b> <b>runway</b> capable of handling any size military aircraft, including Lockheed Martin C-5 Galaxy and Antonov An-225. The base is mainly occupied by Government contractors, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and minimally by the United States Armed Forces.|$|E
40|$|Airport {{capacity}} constraints and growing traffic demand in air transportation cause congestion and delay {{on the ground}} and in the air. Conservative wake turbulence separation minima in the approach phase guarantee a minimum of in-flight wake encounters of trailing aircraft. On the other hand, in many situations weather-based separation minima could support more efficient runway utilization. This work estimates delay reduction and capacity gains of DLR`s Wake Vortex Prediction and Monitoring System (WSVBS) through the application of reduced time-based approach separations for a single and <b>dual</b> dependent <b>runway</b> system. The system dynamically adjusts approach separations without compromising safety. Delay calculations are conducted with a dynamic runway queuing model, which is capable to process time varying approach separations. It provides the relevant delay data, where several representative operational scenarios enabled through the application of reduced separations on a single and <b>dual</b> dependent <b>runway</b> system are considered. Capacity profiles are created by processing WSVBS separation data with the actual traffic demand. The results give insight about possible delay reductions as well as related operational impact under given implementation assumptions. It is shown that the WSVBS provides efficiency gains on both runway systems, whereas operational requirements regarding the single runway system need {{to be taken into account}} applying reduced individual separations. Regarding the <b>dual</b> dependent <b>runway</b> system, an average hourly delay reduction up to 15 minutes maximum is revealed for the defined scenario setup...|$|R

Based on information gained during early real time controller experiOlents, a programmed controller concept (fas...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the short}} {{distance}} to the city centre, approaches to, and departures from, the airport are above water due to the heading of the <b>dual</b> parallel <b>runway</b> system (04R/22L & 04L/22R). Those runways point to the Øresund strait, close in both directions. The supplementary runway (30/12) oriented perpendicular to the main runways also has its approach or departure over Øresund in one direction. In the opposite direction, the 30/12 runway has noise restrictions as flight happens close over residential areas. Other advantages are the low altitude of the airport and absence of hills and high buildings below the approach directions. In case of fog, the runway 22L is equipped with an ILS of category III C system, which allows modern aircraft to land in zero sight. Runway 04R/22L was widened by 4 meters in each side at DKK 30M to accommodate the Airbus A380, {{as part of a}} general concrete renewal program of DKK 300M.|$|R

50|$|Throughout the 1970s, {{airport traffic}} {{continued}} to grow, but the airport was not expanded further. A new large airport {{located at the}} island of Saltholm (with a connecting bridge to Denmark and Sweden) was on the drawing board. It {{would be a huge}} investment, and the proposal was evaluated thoroughly by many experts. In 1980, however, the Danish parliament instead decided to expand the capacity of Copenhagen airport to 20-22 million passengers by the year 2000. This solution was far cheaper than building a new airport and because the new types of aircraft were less noisy, an airport on Saltholm did not offer a decisive environmental gain. In 1973 the airport handled 8 million passengers per year. The third (long) runway opens and the <b>dual</b> <b>runway</b> system (04L/22R-04R/22L) opened, strongly expanding the starts and landings capacity.|$|E
50|$|On March 15, 1951, the National Ensign was hoisted, re-commissioning {{the station}} as a Naval Air Facility. The station {{soon became a}} beehive of activity, as it was slated to become a Master Jet Base. New {{construction}} around the base was begun which included <b>dual</b> 8,000-foot <b>runways,</b> and new facilities to replace the temporary structures of World War II, including a modern operations tower capable of handling all the complex flights of a full-scale Naval Air Station. Two outlying fields were also planned to be built, one for gunnery and one for carrier practice landings. On June 15, 1950, North Korea on Chinese authorization crossed the 38th parallel and invaded their neighbors in South Korea. Acting quickly and on little notice, the American military reversed the post-World War II trend of reduction-in-forces and several subordinate commands stationed at NAS Brunswick were re-commissioned. While not directly involved in combat operations in Korea, its squadrons contributed {{to the war effort}} by assuming the many responsibilities of commands who had been deployed to the Pacific. In 1959, NAS Brunswick’s primary mission was support of Fleet Air Wing Three which was composed of Patrol Squadrons Seven, Ten, Eleven, Twenty One, Twenty Three, and Twenty Six. Flying the P2V Neptune and PB4Y-2 Privateer, the squadrons played a major part in the defense of the North Atlantic area, tracking Soviet submarines around the clock throughout the Cold War. In 1962, NAS Brunswick and Fleet Air Wing Five began the transition to the P-3A Orion marking {{the beginning of a new}} era in Naval Patrol Aviation. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 and more encompassing, during the entirety of the Cold War between American and Soviet forces, both the P2V and P-3A became nationally well-known due to their surveillance of Soviet ships in the Atlantic Ocean, leading to a safe resolution. Fleet Air Wing Five aircraft also played an important part in America’s early manned space programs in 1965 and 1966, helping to locate Mercury and Gemini capsules after splashdowns. In 1966, Wing Five began deployments in the Western Pacific. Based at Naval Station Sangley Point in the Philippines, squadrons flew patrol and combat missions in support of Seventh Fleet operations in South East Asia throughout the years of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. On August 2 of 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein launched an invasion on the neighboring country of Kuwait. In response, the United States launched a wholly defensive mission to the Middle East named Operation Desert Shield. Patrol Squadron Twenty Three was the first East Coast maritime patrol squadron in-theater for Operation Desert Shield, providing maritime surveillance throughout the Red Sea. Patrol Squadron EIGHT participated in joint operations during Desert Storm, flying combat sorties in the effort to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi forces.|$|R
