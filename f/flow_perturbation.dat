30|$|The {{present study}} has {{analyzed}} the large dataset of SuperDARN observation to examine statistically ionospheric <b>flow</b> <b>perturbation</b> {{in association with}} SIs caused by sudden rises or drops of the solar wind dynamic pressure. It is revealed that negative SIs induce <b>flow</b> <b>perturbation</b> with a significant dawn-dusk asymmetry in flow intensity of a higher-latitude sunward flow, while such an asymmetry is not identified for positive SIs. A qualitative but likely interpretation is that the solar wind structures with abrupt drop of dynamic pressure are preferentially accompanied by an enhancement of IMF-By component. The enhanced IMF-By upon negative SIs strengthens flows of the pre-existing round cell, resulting in the apparent dawn-dusk asymmetry of <b>flow</b> <b>perturbation</b> derived as the difference in flow pattern between pre-SI and SI intervals.|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} plasma {{velocity}} signatures expected {{in association with}} flux transfer events (FTEs). Events moving faster than or opposite the ambient media should generate bipolar inward/outward (outward/inward) <b>flow</b> <b>perturbations</b> normal to the nominal magnetopause in the magnetosphere (magnetosheath). <b>Flow</b> <b>perturbations</b> directly upstream and downstream from the events {{should be in the}} direction of event motion. Flows on the flanks should be in the direction opposite the motion of events moving at subsonic and subAlfvénic speeds relative to the ambient plasma. Events moving with the ambient flow should generate no <b>flow</b> <b>perturbations</b> in the ambient plasma. Alfvén waves propagating parallel (antiparallel) to the axial magnetic field of FTEs may generate anticorrelated (correlated) magnetic field and <b>flow</b> <b>perturbations</b> within the core region of FTEs.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of the {{perturbation}} of the meridional flow in the activity belts detected by local helioseismology on the development and strength of the surface magnetic field at the polar caps. We carried out simulations of synthetic solar cycles with a flux transport model, which follows the cyclic evolution of the surface field determined by flux emergence and advective transport by near-surface flows. In each hemisphere, an axisymmetric band of latitudinal flows converging towards the central latitude of the activity belt was superposed onto the background poleward meridional flow. The overall effect of the <b>flow</b> <b>perturbation</b> is to reduce the latitude separation of the magnetic polarities of a bipolar magnetic region and thus diminish its contribution to the polar field. As a result, the polar field maximum reached around cycle activity minimum is weakened by the presence of the meridional <b>flow</b> <b>perturbation.</b> For a <b>flow</b> <b>perturbation</b> consistent with helioseismic observations, the polar field is reduced by about 18 % compared to the case without inflows.

40|$|The {{analysis}} for the physical mechanism of the long-wave instability in liquid film flow is extended {{to take into account}} the presence of a surfactant of arbitrary solubility. The Navier-Stokes equations are supplemented by mass balances for the concentrations at the interface and in the bulk, by a Langmuir model for adsorption kinetics at the interface, and are expanded in the limit of long-wave disturbances. The longitudinal <b>flow</b> <b>perturbation,</b> known to result from the perturbation shear stress which develops along the deformed interface, is shown to contribute a convective flux that triggers an interfacial concentration gradient. This gradient is, at leading order, in phase with the interfacial deformation, and as a result produces Marangoni stresses that stabilize the flow. The strength of the interfacial concentration gradient is shown to be maximum for an insoluble surfactant and to decrease with increasing surfactant solubility. The decrease is explained in terms of the spatial phase of mass transfer between interface and bulk, which mitigates the interfacial flux by the <b>flow</b> <b>perturbation</b> and leads to the attenuation of Marangoni stresses. Higher-order terms are derived, which provide corrections for disturbances of finite wavelength...|$|E

40|$|A new {{framework}} is presented for estimation {{and control of}} instabilities in wall-bounded shear flows described by the linearised Navier-Stokes equations. The control design considers the use of localised actuators/sensors to account for convective instabilities in an optimal control framework. External sources of disturbances are assumed to enter the control domain through the inflow. A new inflow disturbance model is proposed for external excitation of the perturbation modes that contribute to transition. This model allows efficient estimation of the <b>flow</b> <b>perturbations</b> within the localised control region of a conceptually unbounded domain. The state-space discretisation of the infinite-dimensional system is explicitly obtained, which allows application of linear control theoretic tools. A reduced-order model is subsequently derived using exact balanced truncation that captures the input/output behaviour and the dominant perturbation dynamics. This model is used to design an optimal controller to suppress the instability growth. The two-dimensional non-periodic channel flow is considered as an application case. Disturbances are generated upstream of the control domain and the resulting <b>flow</b> <b>perturbations</b> are estimated/controlled using point wall shear measurements and localised unsteady blowing and suction at the wall. The controller is able to cancel the perturbations and is robust to both unmodelled disturbances and sensor inaccuracies. For single-frequency and multiple-frequency disturbances with low sensor noise a nearly full cancellation is achieved. For stochastic forced disturbances and high sensor noise an energy reduction in perturbation wall shear stress of 96 Â % is shown. Control & SimulationAerodynamic...|$|R

30|$|Note, however, {{that the}} <b>flow</b> <b>perturbation</b> deduced {{by the present}} {{analysis}} {{is the difference between}} the pre-SI convection and the total convection during SIs, not the flow pattern during SI itself. That is, the <b>flow</b> <b>perturbation</b> shown in Fig.  3 corresponds to a subtraction of the flow pattern on the top panels from that on the bottom panels in Fig.  4. Thus, one can expect naturally that the subtracted flow pattern should be a simple pair of symmetric vortices, if we assume that the round cell does not vary significantly between before and during SIs and the dawn-dusk symmetric vortices induced upon SIs, as illustrated by case C. Conversely, the fact that the residual flow pattern shows a dawn-dusk asymmetric enhancement of the higher-latitude sunward flow implies that either assumption of the symmetry of vortices or the constant round cell could break for negative SIs, as illustrated by cases A and B, respectively. In case A, the dusk (dawn) side SI cell becomes stronger, resulting in an enhancement of residual sunward flow on the dusk (dawn) side for positive (negative) IMF-By conditions. In case B, the round cell faster than its pre-SI level results in an enhanced sunward flow on dusk and reduced flow on dawn in the residual flow pattern for positive IMF-By cases, and vice versa for negative IMF-By. The dawn-dusk polarity of the enhancement of residual sunward flow is consistent with the negative SI results shown in Fig.  3. Therefore, both hypotheses could explain the observed asymmetry for negative SIs.|$|E
