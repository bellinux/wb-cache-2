We {{show that the}} deflection produced {{in the presence of}} the black hole angular momentum explicitly depends on whether the motion of the light ray is in the direction, or opposite to the spin. Compared to the zero-spin Schwarzschild case, the bending angle is greater for <b>direct</b> <b>orbits,</b> and smaller for retrograde orbits, confirming our physical intuition about the loss of left-right symmetry from a lensing perspective. In addition, we show that for higher spins, the effect is more pronounced resulting in tighter winding of <b>direct</b> <b>orbits</b> with respect to the axis of rotation, and a higher degree of unwinding of retro <b>orbits.</b> A <b>direct</b> consequence of this effect is a shift in image positions in strong gravitational lensing.

The other four regular satellites are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings.

These moons were probably captured by Jupiter from solar orbits. Eighteen of the irregular satellites have not yet been named.|$|E

This effect occurs because the satellite orbits more slowly than the speed at which the Earth rotates beneath it.

40|$|Reduced {{trajectory}} {{data and}} orbital elements are reported for 20 double-station meteors photographed at the NASA-NMSU meteor observatory {{during the winter}} of 1974 / 75.

The elements for the Geminids are obtained using times of appearance chosen by adopting 34. 6 km/s as the heliocentric velocity of the shower.

Unlike most terrestrial feeders among temnospondyli, Chenoprosopus, which lived in dry environments, displayed weaker bite capabillities than Nigerpeton, which presents strong bite capabilities. The skull of Chenoprosopus presented stresses in the posterior part of the skull than in the rest of the skull because of weak bite capabilities that could be the adductor musculature beneath the squamosal bones.|$|R

40|$|The tidal {{evolution}} of globular clusters subject to {{various degrees of}} the internal diffusion process is investigated. In cases of negligible diffusion, clusters {{are found to be}} tidally truncated to the theoretical tidal radius at perigalacticon. There is no apparent orbital phase dependence of the tidal radius for clusters with eccentric orbits. In clusters with moderately short two-body relaxation time scales, diffusion processes significantly modify the structure of the outer regions {{in such a way that}} the limiting radius may be comparable to the tidal radius at apogalacticon. The Galactical tidal torque induces isotropy in the velocity dispersion of the outer regions of the cluster. For relaxed clusters, the velocity dispersion may be isotropic in the core, anisotropic in the envelope and isotropic near the limiting radius. Disk shocking is also very efficient for isotropizing the orbits of stars in the outer cluster regions. Stars with <b>direct</b> <b>orbits</b> are less stable, so that prolonged tidal interaction can lead to apparent retrograde rotation in the outer regions of the cluster...|$|R

Analysis is applied to the NBI heated plasmas in the Compact Helical System (CHS) device. Comparison is made between theoretical results and experimental observations. The increased ion particle losses caused by the orbit loss and charge exchange loss with neutrals make the radial electric field more negative than the value of purely neoclassical calculation.

40|$|Session 01 - Exoplanets: {{abstract}} no. 01. 07 The {{orbit of}} the circumbinary planet Kepler- 16 b is significantly non-Keplerian {{because of the}} large secondary-to-primary mass ratio (0. 29) and orbital eccentricity (0. 15) of the binary, as well as the proximity of the planet to the binary (orbital period ratio 5. 6). We present an analytic theory which models the motion of the planet (treated as a test particle) by the superposition of the circular motion of a guiding center, the forced oscillations due to the non-axisymmetric components of the binary's potential, the epicyclic motion, and the vertical motion. In this analytic theory, the periapse and ascending node of the planet precess at nearly equal rates in opposite directions, and the largest forced oscillation term corresponds to a forced eccentricity of 0. 035. The nodal precession period (42 years) found in <b>direct</b> numerical <b>orbit</b> integration is in excellent agreement with the analytic theory, while the periapse precession period (49 years) and forced eccentricity (0. 038) are slightly larger than the analytic values.
