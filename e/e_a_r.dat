Few people have any proper appreciation of the enormous difficulties which a child has to encounter in learning to read and spell. How many parents become discouraged, and manifest their discouragement and dissatisfaction to the child in reproving and complaints, at what they consider his slow progress in learning to spell--forgetting that in the English language there are in common, every-day use eight or ten thousand words, almost all of which are to be learned separately, by a bare and cheerless toil of committing to memory, with comparatively little definite help from the sound. We have ourselves become so accustomed to seeing the word bear, for example, when denoting the animal, spelt b <b>e</b> <b>a</b> <b>r,</b> that we are very prone to imagine that there is something naturally appropriate in those letters and in that collocation of them, to represent that sound when used to denote that idea. But what is there in the nature and power of the letters to aid the child in perceiving--or, when told, in remembering--whether, when referring to the animal, he is to write bear, or bare, or bair, or bayr, or bere, as in where. So with the word you. It seems to us the most natural thing in the world to spell it y o u. And when the little pupil, judging by the sound, writes it y u, we mortify him by our ridicule, as if he had done something in itself absurd. But how is he to know, except by the hardest, most meaningless, and distasteful toil of the memory, whether he is to write you, or yu, or yoo, or ewe, or yew, or yue, as in flue, or even yo as in do, and to determine when and in what cases respectively he is to use those different forms? ...|$|E

Insertion of linker sequences between the PERE and the site of transcription initiation in the PCNA promoter severely impairs the promoter's response to <b>E</b> 1 <b>A</b> 243 <b>R</b> transactivation.

Weak transcriptional activators render the PCNA basal promoter subject to transactivation by <b>E</b> 1 <b>A</b> 243 <b>R</b> but do not endow the adenovirus E 1 B basal promoter with a similar response.

40|$|Background and objectives: This study {{examined}} the efficacy of C. <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>A.,</b> a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator, for correcting anemia in patients who had chronic kidney disease (CKD) and were not on dialysis. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: In this open-label, randomized, parallel-group, Phase III study, 324 adult patients with CKD not on dialysis nor receiving treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive subcutaneous C. <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>A.</b> once every 2 wk or darbepoetin alfa once weekly during an 18 -wk correction period and a 10 -wk evaluation period.

Dosage was adjusted to achieve a hemoglobin (Hb) response and to maintain Hb 1 g/dl of the response level and 11 to 13 g/dl. Primary end points were Hb response rate during correction and evaluation and change in Hb concentration between baseline and evaluation. Results: Hb response rates were 97. 5 % for C. <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>A.</b> and 96. 3 % for darbepoetin alfa. Adjusted mean changes in Hb from baseline to evaluation were 2. 15 g/dl (C. <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>A.)</b> and 2. 00 g/dl (darbepoetin alfa). Analysis showed that C. <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>A.</b> once every 2 wk was as effective as darbepoetin alfa once weekly for correcting anemia.

40|$|The {{proliferating cell}} nuclear antigen (PCNA), a crucial {{component}} of eukaryotic cell cycle and DNA replication complexes, is {{induced by the}} adenovirus <b>E</b> 1 <b>A</b> 243 <b>R</b> oncoprotein through <b>a</b> cis-acting element termed the PERE (PCNA-E 1 A responsive element).

We have identified a second PERE-binding protein, the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor, which forms heterodimers with ATF- 1 at this site.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Extending the {{administration}} interval of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) represents {{an opportunity to}} improve the efficiency of anaemia management in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, effective haemoglobin (Hb) maintenance can be challenging with epoetin alfa and epoetin beta administered at extended intervals. C. <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>A.,</b> a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator, has a unique pharmacologic profile and long half-life (approximately 130 h), allowing administration at extended intervals. Phase III results have demonstrated that C. <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>A.</b> administered once every 4 weeks effectively maintains stable Hb levels in patients with CKD on dialysis. METHODS: STRIATA (Stabilizing haemoglobin TaRgets in dialysis following IV C. <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>A.</b> Treatment for Anaemia) was a multicentre, open-label randomized phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous C. <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>A.</b> administered once every 2 weeks (Q 2 W) for Hb maintenance following direct conversion from darbepoetin alfa (DA). Adult patients on dialysis receiving stable intravenous DA once weekly (QW) or Q 2 W were randomized (1 : 1) to continue their current DA regimen (n = 156) or receive intravenous C. <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>A.</b> Q 2 W (n = 157) for 52 weeks. Doses were adjusted to maintain Hb levels within +/- 1. 0 g/dl of baseline and between 10. 0 and 13. 5 g/dl. The primary endpoint was the mean Hb change between baseline and the evaluation period (weeks 29 - 36). RESULTS: Most patients (> 80 %) received DA QW before randomization. The mean (95 % CI) difference between C. <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>A.</b> and DA in the primary endpoint was 0. 18 g/dl (- 0. 05, 0. 41), within a pre-defined non-inferiority limit. C. <b>E.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>A.</b> was clinically non-inferior to DA (P < 0. 0001) in maintaining Hb levels. Both treatments were well tolerated.
