5|$|In 2009 American film {{directors}} Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New World Order, {{a critically}} acclaimed documentary film which explores {{the world of}} conspiracy theorists - such as American radio host Alex Jones - who consistently expose and vigorously oppose {{what they perceive as}} an emerging New World Order. The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing populist agitators (such as Alex Jones) and hip hop music's left-wing populist rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor <b>Griff</b> of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique), thus illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to her work for the freedpeople of Washington, D.C., <b>Griffing</b> was also a women's rights activist. In the 1850s, <b>Griffing</b> became involved with women's rights organizations, making contact with women like Susan B. Anthony who would inspire her {{to fight for the}} rights of women as well as African Americans. Throughout the 1850s, <b>Griffing</b> joined various feminist organizations, such as the Ohio Women's Rights Association, which she became the president of in 1853. Shortly after President Abraham Lincoln gave the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, <b>Griffing</b> joined the Women's Loyal National League as a lecturing agent, where she helped collect thousands of signatures for a women's antislavery petition that was eventually presented to the United States Congress by Charles Sumner. <b>Griffing</b> was also active in the temperance movement that was popular amongst many feminist activists during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.|$|R

25|$|In {{the last}} half of the eighteenth century there had been an {{increasing}} need for transport to exploit the coal reserves at Ashby Wolds and lime from the quarries north of Ashby-de-la-Zouch. The first proposal was for a canal running from Burton-on-Trent on the upper River Trent to Marston on the Coventry Canal. A second suggestion was for a canal from Ashby Wolds to the Coventry Canal at <b>Griff.</b> Both proposals were made in December 1781. The first was opposed by the Coventry company, though the second was not. Robert Whitworth had estimated the cost of the project at £46,396, but the scheme was dropped a year later. William Jessop proposed a canal and tramway between Breedon and the Trent, with a connecting link to the Trent and Mersey Canal in 1787, which also came to nothing. A proposal in 1790 was well received at the time, but opposition afterwards prevented a bill being submitted to Parliament. Another proposal for a canal northwards to the Trent at Burton was actively discussed between 1791 and 1793. There was wide support for a canal to <b>Griff</b> in 1792, but the muted support of Penn Assheton Curzon, a local landowner and Member of Parliament, led to it being dropped.|$|E
25|$|The Crimson Tide then rallied {{and took}} a 33–31 lead {{in the third quarter}} on a pair of Neb Hayden {{touchdown}} throws.

Colorado then responded with a pair of unanswered touchdowns and a safety in the fourth quarter and won the game 47–33. Touchdowns were scored on Anderson runs of two and three-yards with a combined quarterback sack of Hayden for a safety by Bill Brundige and Herb Orvis providing the final margin.|$|E

50|$|While in Washington, D.C., <b>Griffing</b> {{maintained}} her {{dedication to}} women's {{rights and the}} cause of suffrage.

50|$|Even {{with this}} setback, <b>Griffing</b> {{continued}} to help better {{the lives of}} the freedpeople. She worked with her government contacts to help freedpeople find jobs in the north, and sometimes travelled with them to make sure they arrived safely. The Freedmen's Bureau worked with <b>Griffing</b> on this project, providing barracks in Rhode Island, offices in New York City, and fund for rent and other necessary expenses. By 1867, <b>Griffing</b> was working for the Freedmen's Bureau once more, this time as an agent for the Capitol Hill and Navy Yard districts. Throughout her tenure, <b>Griffing</b> fought for increased aid for the freedpeople, as well as continuing her efforts at finding employment for African Americans in the north. She also kept contact with her associates in the federal government and in private aid organizations in order to obtain as much aid as possible for the destitute of Washington, D.C. <b>Griffing</b> worked as an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau until it ran out of funding and was forced to stop providing aid in late 1869. She continued working to aid freedpeople through the National Freedmen's Aid Association of the District of Columbia until her death in 1872.|$|R
25|$|The cult {{success of}} the series won it the BAFTA for Best Drama Series in 1998. It was notable for {{featuring}} comic characters and sub-plots that lent a lot of humour to the series. Unusually, it was produced by the BBC's in-house Entertainment department rather than the Drama department – this was because Renwick preferred working with people he knew rather than the people at Drama who might not share his vision. It has included guest-stars such as Bob Monkhouse, <b>Griff</b> Rhys Jones, Rik Mayall, Jack Dee, Bill Bailey, John Bird and Nigel Planer; who are mainly associated with comedy, but who gave straight performances.|$|E

5000|$|During the Civil War, <b>Griffing</b> {{was struck}} by the plight of the {{recently}} freed slaves, especially those who were fleeing to Washington, D.C. Determined to help the freedpeople establish themselves, <b>Griffing</b> and her three daughters moved to Washington, D.C. in 1864, while her husband remained in Ohio. Why her husband remained behind is uncertain. <b>Griffing</b> became an agent for the National Freedmen's Relief Association of the District of Columbia, where she opened up two industrial schools for freedwomen in order to teach them marketable skills such as sewing. These schools were also designed to inculcate freedwomen with the values of the Northern white middle class. In Griffing's words, [...] "the Industrial School furnishes an opportunity for instruction in social science, and domestic relations, as well as the higher forms of Industry, and a marked change is observable in personal tidiness, good manners, and in the control and government of young children - whom some of the mothers are obliged to bring with them to the Rooms." [...] While in Washington, <b>Griffing</b> also used her political influence to lobby Congressmen for more direct aid for the formerly enslaved people of Washington. Through her lobbying of Radical Republican members of Congress, such as Benjamin Wade and Charles Sumner, <b>Griffing</b> became instrumental in establishing the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, more commonly known as the Freedmen's Bureau. In June 1865, as reward for her work in helping to create the Freedmen's Bureau, Commissioner Oliver Otis Howard appointed <b>Griffing</b> the assistant to the assistant commissioner for Washington, D.C.|$|R
