40|$|Abstract: Culture {{cannot be}} reduced to {{religion}} even though religion is {{an important aspect of}} it. However, exceptionally, religion most usually is the first thing to come to the mind when Middle-Eastern societies are at stake. In a sense, the culture of all Middle-Eastern societies, including Turkey, is equated with Islam –a world religion currently echoing with “oppression ” and “terrorism”. This paper explores what kinds of percep-tions European young people have regarding religious life in Turkey. Additionally and more importantly, the paper questions if European youth’s perceptions of religious life in Turkish society get significantly changed after living in this society for about a year. The data for this paper comes from a qualitative/ethnographic research conducted to examine major effects of <b>European</b> <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Service</b> Program. Prior to the <b>voluntary</b> <b>service,</b> more or less a similar line of thinking on Islam is expected to be found among European young volunteers while a diversity of perceptions is anticipated to be arising from an experience of living in Turkey, a finding that would partially confirm the literature...|$|R
40|$|What {{does it mean}} {{to learn}} in a group of people from {{different}} cultures? How does one encounter people from different cultures when there is no clear ‘quantitative’ domination of any culture? By asking these questions the paper represents a hermeneutic phenomenological study that explores the phenomenon of learning in a culturally diverse group. A phenomenological study is undertaken with young people (18 - 30 years) from different EU countries who participated in learning mobility project <b>European</b> <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Service</b> and had long-term volunteering experience abroad. The research concentrates on the lived moments of vis-à-vis intercultural encounters during learning process in groups. Specifically, through the descriptions of lived experience and phenomenological reflection the paper describes how young people experience self and others while they are learning in culturally diverse groups. Lived experiences of young people lead them into ‘no-man’s land’ (Waldenfels, 2011) where connection and separation simultaneously exist...|$|R
40|$|Coordinator: Youth {{unemployment}} {{is a serious}} issue now days. It is even more striking after the economic crisis increased the unemployment rates in the whole Europe. As a rule, the youth {{unemployment is}} more or less double to the general unemployment rate. One of the reasons is lack of practical skills and experience and volunteering {{can be one of the}} solutions for this problem. With this project, Together would like to contribute to increasing employment of young people through volunteering. Promoting a high level of employment is also an important objective of the EU as the unemployment rate among young adults is significantly higher than for other age groups. We think that <b>European</b> <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Service</b> (EVS) can be a valuable tool to overcome youth unemployment. Because the better employability of youngsters can only be achieved if young people are properly equipped with knowledge, skills and competencies through high-quality, relevant education and training. The EVS is an important non-formal learning experience for young people. This project will provide opportunity for 28 young people from FYR Macedonia to be EVS volunteers and spend 1 month volunteering and get international experience in one of th...|$|R
