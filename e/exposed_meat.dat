Sarcophaga bullata, {{in addition to all}} species of the family Sarcophagidae, may be considered [...] "specialized flies," [...] a term coined by Baker and Baker to describe flies that feed on carrion and dung. Specialized flies have been proven capable of detecting and selectively favoring plant nectars with high amino acid concentrations.

40|$|The curing of meat is a {{conservation}} technique widely used since ancient times to prolong shelf-life.

40|$|Abstract This study {{examined}} the color changes of packaged beef due {{to the effects of}} carbon monoxide exposure before vacuum packing and storage time, as well as consumers&# 8217; evaluations of that beef. In the experiment, 400 striploin steaks (M. longissimus dorsi) were vacuum packed or after 48 hours of exposure to different concentrations of CO (0. 1 %, 0. 3 %, and 0. 5 %) vacuum packed. The color measurements and consumer evaluations were conducted after 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21 days of storage in the dark at 2 ± 1 °C. Consumers evaluated the color, surface discoloration, attractiveness, and their willingness to buy the meat. The results showed that regardless of storage time, the color parameters (L*, a*, b*, C*) were significantly higher for the steaks vacuum packed after exposure to carbon monoxide in comparison to those packaged in a vacuum without the use of CO. Based on the consumer evaluations, the most attractive steaks were those that had been exposed to 0. 3 % and 0. 5 % CO, which were characterized by bright red or cherry-red colors. Consumers did not accept the appearance of steaks packaged without the carbon monoxide pretreatment. <b>Exposing</b> <b>meat</b> to CO before packaging allows to obtain the attractive color of vacuum packed beef...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} {{an increased risk of}} lymphoma among workers <b>exposed</b> to <b>meat,</b> without conclusive evidence. We conducted a multicenter case-control study during 1998 – 2004 in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain, including 2, 007 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 339 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma and 2, 462 controls. We collected detailed information on occupational history and assessed exposure to meat in general and several types of meat via expert assessment of the questionnaires. The odds ratio (OR) of non-Hodgkin lymphoma for ever occupational exposure to meat was 1. 18 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 95 – 1. 46), that for exposure to beef meat was 1. 22 (95 % CI 0. 90 – 1. 67), and that for exposure to chicken meat was 1. 19 (95 % CI 0. 91 – 1. 55). The ORs were higher among workers with longer duration of exposure. An increased risk among workers <b>exposed</b> to beef <b>meat</b> was mainly apparent for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR 1. 49, 95 %CI 0. 96 – 2. 33), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (OR 1. 35, 95 % CI 0. 78 – 2. 34) and multiple myeloma (OR 1. 40, 95 %CI 0. 67 – 2. 94).

40|$|Improvements in {{food safety}} require {{initiatives}} that address risks identified along the ‘farm-to-fork continuum’. Two papers {{in this issue}} of the Journal look at opposite ends of this continuum; an article by Akoachere et al. examines a common foodborne pathogen (Salmonella Typhimurium) in livestock (1) and Takanashi et al. assess the impact of food hygiene in the home on diarrhoea (2). Foodborne disease is defined as illness resulting from consumption of contaminated food; food can be contaminated with microbial pathogens or a toxic substance (3). Many common foodborne pathogens are zoonotic (4). To attribute diarrhoeal disease to zoonotic transmission or other transmission routes, data collected for specific pathogens through investigations of outbreaks, analytical studies, and laboratory-based studies can provide insights. Transmission from animals to humans can occur through direct contact (5), consumption or handling of meat (6), consumption of unpasteurized milk (7), untreated water (8, 9) or consumption of contaminated fresh produce (10). In the article by Akoachere et al., microbial subtyping was used as a means to link Salmonella Typhimurium-related disease in humans with animal reservoirs (1). In investigations of outbreaks, the linkage between humans and animals is clear as there is laboratory evidence, along with information for a specific exposure window (11, 12). In analytical studies, epidemiological evidence suggests a link by detecting an elevated risk of being an S. Typhimurium case among those <b>exposed</b> to <b>meats</b> (13) or animal contact (14).

Follow-up analyses with participants' self-reported exposure to unprocessed meat supported the notion that these cross-cultural variations indeed reflected differences in unprocessed meat exposure. In contrast, disgust and empathy, in turn, predicted a lower willingness to eat meat and a higher willingness to choose a vegetarian alternative dish equally in both countries.

Contamination of pig farmers, veterinarians and abattoir workers with these strains has been observed. However, although contamination levels of 10 % of retail pork were reported from the Netherlands and Canada, there are limited data of contamination rates of workers handling raw meat. We investigated the rates of MRSA contamination of local butchers working in wet markets, where recently slaughtered pigs are cut up. Nasal swabs collected from 300 pork butchers at markets throughout Hong Kong were enriched in brain heart infusion broth with 5 % salt and cultured on MRSASelect®. Isolates were confirmed as Staphylococcus aureus and susceptibility testing performed. The presence of mecA was confirmed, SCCmec and spa type determined and relatedness investigated by PFGE. Subjects completed a questionnaire on MRSA carriage risk factors. Seventeen samples (5. 6 %) yielded MRSA, 15 harbouring SCCmec IVb. Ten strains were t 899 (CC 9), previously reported from local pig carcasses. Five strains were healthcare associated: SCCmec type II, t 701 (CC 6), colonizing two subjects at the same establishment, and single isolates of t 008 (CC 8), t 002 (CC 5) and t 123 (CC 45). The remaining isolates were t 359 (CC 97), previously reported from buffaloes, and t 375 (CC 5), reported from bovine milk. None of these butchers reported recent hospitalization or a healthcare worker in the family. Two had recently received antibiotics, one for a skin infection.

These microorganisms are common contaminants of poultry and poultry products. This study was aimed {{to evaluate the}} antibacterial activity of metallic copper surfaces on these important enteropathogens, and to determine the potential acquisition of copper by food exposed to this metal. Results The antibacterial activity of copper surfaces was evaluated overlying them with suspensions of 10 6 CFU/ml of S. enterica and C. jejuni. Bacterial counts obtained after 0, 2, 4 and 8 hours at 10 °C and 25 °C were compared with those obtained in stainless steel and a synthetic polymer as control surfaces. The results showed that when these enteropathogens were kept in contact with copper a significant antibacterial activity was noted, on the contrary when the same load of pathogen suspensions were tested over the control surfaces {{it was found that}} the bacterial counts remained unchanged or even increased with time.

VPN 8 stipulates that game animals should normally be eviscerated in a hanging position within 2 hrs after being shot, and if bloating occurs evisceration must be done as an emergency, within 0. 5 hr, or {{as soon as possible}} after bleeding by the game harvester. It would be beneficial to know if the concept of delayed evisceration has any deleterious effects on the microbiological safety of harvested black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) meat. The objective of this research project was to determine if delayed evisceration has an effect on enteric bacterial translocation across the intestinal mucosal barrier into the abdominal cavity. Sixteen harvested animals were grouped together in groups A, B, C, D and E, based on a time delay in evisceration. After each animal was eviscerated, an 8 mm punch biopsy from the abdominal peritoneum was collected and placed into a 2 ml Biofreeze vial. In the laboratory, the biopsy samples were inoculated on blood and MacConkey agar plates and incubated for three days at 37 °C. The bacterial species targeted for isolation were indicator bacteria for movement across the intestinal barrier. The quantifiable absence of bacteria from the samples that were subjected to bacterial isolation in this study indicates that bacterial translocation across the intestinal barrier is negligible in black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) exposed to delays in evisceration for up to 5 hrs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Toxoplasmosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common food borne zoonoses worldwide, and can be a serious {{life-threatening}} disease in the congenitally infected fetus and in immunosupressed patients. Among food animals, sheep along with goats and pigs possess the highest incidence of T. gondii cysts in meat, and play a major role as a source of human infection. METHODS: In this study, a new commercial ELISA kit (PrioCHECK® Toxoplasma Ab SR, Prionics Schlieren-Zurich, Switzerland) for the detection of anti-T. gondii antibodies in serum, plasma and meat juice of sheep, was evaluated by comparing it with the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), indirect haemagglutination test (IHA) and real-time PCR, on samples from experimentally inoculated and naturally exposed sheep. RESULTS: The commercial ELISA detected the infection status in 50 % and 100 % of sheep orally inoculated with 10, 000 T. gondii oocysts (n[*]=[*] 6), from two or three weeks post infection (wpi), respectively, both on serum and plasma samples. Meat juice from all experimentally inoculated sheep collected at slaughter (12 wpi) showed positive ELISA values. In naturally exposed sheep (n[*]=[*] 396), the ELISA showed a very good agreement with IFAT (kappa[*]=[*] 0. 91 - 1. 0) and IHA (kappa[*]=[*] 0. 96 - 1. 0) performed on serum; and a positive correlation was observed between ELISA values and IFAT titers. By a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, the commercial ELISA had relative sensitivities between 93. 33 % and 100 %, and relative specificities between 96. 87 % and 100 % respect to IFAT and IHA, depending on the considered cut-off value and animal groups tested. Furthermore, the ELISA correctly recognized all animals reacting positive in real-time PCR. The ELISA results on meat juice agreed with those on serum samples in all experimentally inoculated animals, and in 94 out of 96 (97. 9 %) naturally <b>exposed</b> sheep, when <b>meat</b> juice was tested at a 1 : 10 dilution.

40|$|Reported {{habits of}} red meat consumption, {{particularly}} red meat {{that has been}} cooked to the degree termed ‘well-done', is a positive risk factor for colorectal cancer. Under high, pyrolytic temperatures, heterocyclic amines (HCA) and benzo[a]pyrene (BP) molecules can form inside and {{on the surface of}} red meat, respectively. These compounds are precursors that are metabolically converted to compounds known to act as mutagens and carcinogens in animal models, yet their role in human colorectal carcinogenesis remains to be clarified. We investigated whether intake of these compounds is associated with risk of colorectal adenoma {{in the context of a}} polyp-screening study conducted in Southern California. Using a database of individual HCAs and BP in meats of various types and subjected to specified methods and degrees of cooking, we estimated nanogram consumption of 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo[4, 5 -b]pyridine, 2 -amino- 3, 4, 8 -trimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f] quinoxaline, 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline and benzo[a]pyrene (BP). We observed a 6 % increased risk of large (> 1 cm) adenoma per 10 ng/day consumption of BP [OR = 1. 06 (95 % CI, 1. 00 - 1. 12), P (trend) = 0. 04]. A major source of BP is red <b>meat</b> <b>exposed</b> to a naked flame, as occurs during the barbecuing process. Consistent with this finding an incremental increase of 10 g of barbecued red meat per day was associated with a 29 % increased risk of large adenoma [OR = 1. 29 (95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 63), P (trend) = 0. 04].

In order to protect the remaining wild vultures, diclofenac needed to be removed from the food chain. Unfortunately the Indian government was reluctant to ban diclofenac until an alternate veterinary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was both safe in vultures and effective in cattle could be identified. Although meloxicam was tentatively identified as this drug, toxicity testing still needed to be undertaken. Using a previously validated model, two studies were undertaken to determine the acute toxic effect of diclofenac in vulture as well as to ascertain if the drug had the potential to accumulate. In the first study, meloxicam in formulation was shown to be safe as a single oral dose up to 2 mg/kg in African White Backed-Vultures (Gyps africanus). To further demonstrate the safety of food borne meloxicam, vultures were <b>exposed</b> to <b>meat</b> rich in meloxicam residues, with once again no signs of toxicity being evident. In the second study the drugs ability to accumulate was evaluated pharmacokinetically in Cape Griffon Vultures (Gyps corprotheres). From this study meloxicam was shown to have a very short half-life of elimination, making it unlikely that the drug could be a cumulative toxin. This was subsequently confirmed clinically by the absence of toxicity in birds receiving repeated doses of meloxicam. Although meloxicam was shown to be adequately safe, the safety of other veterinary NSAIDs still required elucidation. While further testing in vultures would have been possible, the small population size of the various vulture species made this unethical. Therefore a surrogate species needed to be identified. With the domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus) being commonly available, attempts were made to validate the chicken as a model. Although the dosed chickens did show similar toxicity patterns from clinical pathology to histopathology, a major problem was their higher tolerance making it impossible to use them as a surrogate. It was, however, concluded that the domestic chicken may be used in mechanistic studies in an attempt to establish an in vitro model. From the mechanistic studies both diclofenac and meloxicam were directly toxic to chicken and vulture renal tubular epithelial cells following 48 h of incubation. It was later shown that this toxicity was associated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could be temporarily ameliorated by pre-incubation with uric acid due to its anti-oxidant activity. When cultures were incubated with either drug for only two hours, meloxicam showed no toxicity in contrast to the cellular toxicity present for diclofenac. In both cases no increase in ROS production was evident. In addition diclofenac influenced the excretion of uric acid by interfering with p-amino-hippuric acid channels. The effect on uric acid excretion persisted after the removal of the diclofenac. It was therefore concluded that vulture susceptibility to diclofenac results from a combination of an increase in cellular ROS, a depletion of intracellular uric acid concentration and most importantly the drug’s long half-life in the vulture. Unfortunately the importance of the drug’s half-life in the toxicodynamics makes it unlikely that in vitro testing will be possible.
