40|$|Abstract: The {{strategic}} {{theory of}} resource-based view (RBV) put Penrose (1959) in the spotlight. The {{key to understanding}} Penrose’s assertion is the concept <b>of</b> <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth independent <b>of</b> <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> size. According to Penrose, even when <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> size are not working, <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth exist regardless of size. Further, the <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth are temporary in nature and disappear once expansion is completed. In which managerial services are the <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth embodied? This paper hypothesizes that the <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth occur where there are unused start-up expert managerial services. Regardless of size, where these services exist, paving the company’s way by step-by-step growth should produce profits...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{diversification}} can partly {{be explained by}} means of a novel concept, "economies of connectedness", denoting personal relationships of the owners that are used to add new businesses to an otherwise diversified portfolio. <b>Economies</b> <b>of</b> connectedness is a concept that complements those of cronyism and corruption, which by definition are illegal while diversification resulting from sharable personal relations is not necessarily so. The concept is illustrated by an original empirical study of Indonesia's Salim Group. The in-depth longitudinal case study shows the interplay <b>of</b> conventional <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> scope with <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> connectedness.

Finally, the information gathered from the study analyses through specially designed questionnaires from a sample of SME (Small and Medium-sized Entities), located in European countries, in order to ascertain the kind <b>of</b> <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> scale gained (if so) by such companies during their productive processes.

All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, UN and Red Cross personnel.
