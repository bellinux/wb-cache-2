5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Madeline, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for the Baja California Peninsula southward from La Paz, and a hurricane warning from San Patricio, Jalisco to El Dorado, Sinaloa, including the Islas Marías. The storm was initially forecast to move ashore near Mazatlán, prompting officials to close the city's port. President Ernesto Zedillo advised potentially affected residents to stay indoors or seek refuge in shelters. Also, {{the threat of the}} hurricane canceled a <b>fishing</b> <b>expedition</b> in the Gulf of California due to rough surf. The expedition was to provide a new aquarium in downtown Denver, Colorado with about 8,500fish. Mexican authorities deployed 2,000soldiers in remote areas of the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa to prepare for the hurricane. Several thousand residents and tourists at the resorts of Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan were put on standby to evacuate their homes. Authorities along the coast in the state of Nayarit went house to house, advising people about the oncoming storm. In addition, ships from Salina Cruz to Acapulco were advised to stay in port.|$|E

500|$|The children's book The Mousehole Cat by Antonia Barber is {{inspired}} by Tom Bawcock's Eve. It {{is the story of}} Tom Bawcock and his loyal black and white cat, Mowzer, setting sail to catch the fish. When the boat hits the storm, it is represented by a giant [...] "Storm-Cat", allowing Mowzer to eventually save the day by soothing the storm with her purring. This purring becomes a song and while the Storm-Cat is resting Tom is able to haul in his catch and return to the village. When they arrive back at the village, the entire catch is baked into a [...] "Star-Gazy" [...] pie, on which the villagers feast. Notably, Antonia Barber points out that stargazy pie was a staple of Mousehole diet before Tom's heroic <b>fishing</b> <b>expedition,</b> however, whereas according to tradition it dates from his return and legendary catch.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, {{while in}} Africa, Hemingway was almost fatally injured in two {{successive}} plane crashes. He chartered a sightseeing flight over the Belgian Congo as a Christmas present to Mary. On {{their way to}} photograph Murchison Falls from the air, the plane struck an abandoned utility pole and [...] "crash landed in heavy brush". Hemingway's injuries included a head wound, while Mary broke two ribs. The next day, attempting to reach medical care in Entebbe, they boarded a second plane that exploded at take-off, with Hemingway suffering burns and another concussion, this one serious enough to cause leaking of cerebral fluid. They eventually arrived in Entebbe to find reporters covering the story of Hemingway's death. He briefed the reporters {{and spent the next}} few weeks recuperating and reading his erroneous obituaries. Despite his injuries, Hemingway accompanied Patrick and his wife on a planned <b>fishing</b> <b>expedition</b> in February, but pain caused him to be irascible and difficult to get along with. When a bushfire broke out, he was again injured, sustaining second degree burns on his legs, front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm. Months later in Venice, Mary reported to friends the full extent of Hemingway's injuries: two cracked discs, a kidney and liver rupture, a dislocated shoulder and a broken skull. The accidents may have precipitated the physical deterioration that was to follow. After the plane crashes, Hemingway, who had been [...] "a thinly controlled alcoholic throughout much of his life, drank more heavily than usual to combat the pain of his injuries." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1892 a ship named Sunbeam, {{owned by}} Viscount Cantelupe, {{was on a}} pearl <b>fishing</b> <b>expedition</b> on the north west coast of Australia. [...] The ship was lost and the legend is that the Aboriginal people called upon serpent spirits to sink the vessel. [...] This was in revenge after the crew, who {{had been allowed to}} [...] "borrow" [...] some Aboriginal women, failed to return them at the agreed time. The story caused some {{confusion}} in the newspapers at the time because the Viscount's father-in-law, Thomas Brassey, was owner of the famous steam yacht Sunbeam RYS and it was incorrectly assumed that this was the ship that sunk.|$|E

2500|$|The Norse god who {{was most}} popular was Thor, and the Altuna Runestone in Uppland shows Thor's <b>fishing</b> <b>expedition</b> {{when he tried}} to capture the Midgard Serpent. Two centuries later, the Icelander Snorri Sturluson would write: [...] "The Midgarth Serpent bit at the ox-head and the hook caught in the roof of its mouth. When it felt that, it started so violently that both Thor's fists went smack against the gunwale. Then Thor got angry, assumed all his godly strength, and dug his heels so sturdily that his feet went right through the bottom of the boat and he braced them on the sea bed."

2500|$|Tryon now spent {{eighteen}} {{months away from}} ships. Aside from time on half pay on leave, he attended the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth to study steam technology. In August 1867 while touring Norway on a <b>fishing</b> <b>expedition,</b> he received a recall and appointment as 'additional captain' to [...] Octavia was the flagship of the East India Station commanded by Commodore Leopold Heath. Tryon was attached to Octavia, but his duties were to act as transport officer at Annesley Bay, {{which was to be}} used as a staging post for troops and supplies for Sir Robert Napier's expedition to Magdala in Abyssinia. Tryon arrived in Bombay on 10 October 1867 where preparations were already underway. 291 transport ships were chartered, mainly from Bombay but some coming from England via the Cape of Good Hope. The advance party went to Zoulla in Annesley Bay in November, described as one of the hottest places on earth. The expedition delivered a fighting force of 4,000 men to Magdala out of total 13,000 soldiers and 60,000 people involved all together. 36,000 animals, mainly for transport, had to be taken to Zoulla. There was no drinking water, so 30,000 tons had to be distilled by the ships' steam engines using 8,000 tons of coal in the process, with ships held at anchor with their engines running. Tryon's duties involved early morning meetings ashore with military authorities, days spent unloading and organising ships, and evenings spent in preparation for the next. Tryon was commended for his organisational skills and tact in dealing with all the disparate parties and complaining ships' captains. Approximately half his staff was invalided out because of the heat during the six months' stay, with the rest all suffering. When he left he was presented with a scroll recording the appreciation of his efforts by the captains of the transport fleet, and later in England was presented with a specially commissioned dinner service decorated with scenes commemorating the campaign. He was awarded the CB for his services in Abyssinia.|$|E
