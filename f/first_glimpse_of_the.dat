500|$|Anasara, a {{derivative}} of the Sanskrit word [...] "Anabasara", literally means vacation. Every {{year after the}} holy Snana Yatra, the triad images, without the Sudarshana Chakra, are taken to a secret altar named Anavasara Ghar (also known as Anasara pindi, 'pindi' is Oriya term meaning [...] "platform" [...] ) where they remain for the next fortnight of (Krishna paksha); devotees {{are not allowed to}} view these images. Instead, devotees go to the nearby Brahmagiri to see the Lord in the four-handed form of Alarnath, a depiction of Vishnu. Devotees then get the <b>first</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord only on the day before Rath Yatra, which is called Navayouvana. It is a local belief that the gods suffer from fever after taking an elaborate ritual bath, and they are treated by the special servants, the Daitapatis, for 15 days. Daitapatis perform special nitis (rites) known as Netrotchhaba (a rite of painting the eyes of the triad). During this period cooked food is not offered to the deities.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} ten premiere, the {{audience}} got its <b>first</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional Superman costume, which was left for Clark by Martha {{in the season}} nine finale. Although the suit was briefly seen through a reflection in Clark's eyes in the season nine finale, the suit {{that appeared in the}} season ten premiere was a different design. The producers, working alongside Warner Bros. and DC Comics, procured the costume worn by Brandon Routh in Superman Returns, which the team chose over the Christopher Reeve suit of the 1980s. DC Comics offered the suit worn by Reeve, but Peterson explained that it [...] "... just didn't quite fit with our world." [...] According to producer Kelly Souders, [...] "Well, the process was really a group effort. We worked with DC, and we have Alicia Louis, who does a lot of stuff for us at the studio, and who was really instrumental. It took quite a bit to get that costume. There's a lot of sign-offs, it really was Warner Bros. and DC and us working to make it happen." [...] Peterson stated that the costume plays a more prominent role in the final season, with the last scene of Smallville ending with Clark wearing it. Before then, Clark began wearing a new costume in the season ten episode [...] "Shield". Here, Clark replaced the black trenchoat with a red leather jacket, and the [...] "S" [...] shield now embossed onto the chest of that jacket.|$|E

The team commenced its ascent in May 1984. Her team almost met disaster when an avalanche buried its camp, and more than half the group abandoned the ascent because of injury or fatigue. Bachendri Pal and the remainder of the team pressed on to reach the summit.

40|$|By {{studying}} the image two-dimensional power spectra or autocorrelations projected by an asteroid as it rotates, {{it is possible}} to locate its rotational pole and derive its three axes dimensions through speckle interferometry under certain assumptions of uniform, geometric scattering, and triaxial ellipsoid shape. However, in cases where images can be reconstructed, the need for making the assumptions is obviated. Furthermore, the ultimate goal for speckle interferometry of image reconstruction will lead to mapping albedo features (if they exist) as impact areas or geological units. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> an asteroid were obtained from images of 4 Vesta reconstructed from speckle interferometric observations. These images reveal that Vesta is quite Moon-like in having large hemispheric-scale albedo features. All of its lightcurves can be produced from a simple model developed from the images. Although undoubtedly more intricate than the model, Vesta's lightcurves can be matched by a model with three dark and four bright spots. The dark areas so dominate one hemisphere that a lightcurve minimum occurs when the maximum cross-section area is visible. The triaxial ellipsoid shape derived for Vesta is not consistent with the notion that the asteroid has an equilibrium shape in spite of its having apparently been differentiated...|$|R
40|$|If {{we are to}} {{understand}} <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> debt, and especially government debt, in the economy, the starting point has to be macroeconomic models that admit financial frictions. And these frictions must create market imperfections both atemporally and intertemporally. Furthermore, debt has to matter both in the private and in the public sphere. To put it more generally, we need {{to understand}} why the Modigliani-Miller theorem fails and why Ricardian equivalence fails. Without models that admit financial frictions and a clear role for both public and private debt, we cannot start to understand why the structure and size of central bank balance sheets matter, nor can we understand why <b>the</b> maturity structure <b>of</b> government finances should have an impact on aggregate activity.

40|$|ATP-dependent Lon proteases are {{multi-domain}} enzymes {{found in}} all living organisms. All Lon proteases contain an ATPase domain belonging to <b>the</b> AAA+ superfamily <b>of</b> molecular machines and a proteolytic domain with a serine-lysine catalytic dyad. Lon proteases {{can be divided into}} two subfamilies, LonA and LonB, exemplified by the Escherichia coli and Archaeoglobus fulgidus paralogs, respectively. The LonA subfamily is defined by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a large N-terminal domain, whereas the LonB subfamily has no such domain, but has a membrane-spanning domain that anchors the protein to <b>the</b> cytoplasmic side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membrane. The two subfamilies also differ in their consensus sequences. Recent crystal structures for several individual domains and sub-fragments of Lon proteases have begun to illuminate similarities and differences in structure–function relationships between the two subfamilies. Differences in orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active site residues in several isolated Lon protease domains point to possible roles for the AAA+ domains and/or substrates in positioning the catalytic residues within the active site. Structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proteolytic domains have also indicated a possible hexameric arrangement <b>of</b> subunits in <b>the</b> native state <b>of</b> bacterial Lon proteases. <b>The</b> structure <b>of</b> a large segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> N-terminal domain has revealed a folding motif present in other protein families of unknown function and should lead to new insights regarding ways in which Lon interacts with substrates or other cellular factors.
