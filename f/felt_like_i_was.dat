5|$|The {{world record}} jump was very smooth. It <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{lying on my}} stomach on a glass coffee table, {{watching}} a movie projected on a screen underneath the table.

25|$|As that Beatles song played, I {{became a}} killer. Joe Colucci {{was going to}} die. I {{was going to kill}} him because he was {{plotting}} to kill me. I felt the rage inside me.... Everything went in slow motion. I could almost feel the bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E

5000|$|After retirement, Vines spent a {{few months}} {{on the board of}} USFalcon, an {{information}} technology and systems engineering firm specializing in defense. He had consulted for the Department of Defense, but does not now have any industry ties. [...] "One of the reasons I chose not to do that <b>is</b> that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> taking advantage of a revolving door," [...] he said. [...] "There is a lot of hypocrisy there." ...|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the same}} time, Tillery was in rehearsals for the play [...] "Letters From a New England Negro", and the {{producer}} {{sent her a}} cassette tape containing traditional black folk songs obtained from the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution.

500|$|After {{the success}} of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Chabon spent five years working on a second novel. Called Fountain City, the novel was a [...] "highly ambitious opus ... about an {{architect}} building a perfect baseball park in Florida," [...] and it eventually ballooned to 1,500 pages, {{with no end in}} sight. The process was frustrating for Chabon, who, in his words, [...] "never <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> conceptually on steady ground." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{comparing}} work on Batman Forever, Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, explained, [...] "It {{just felt}} like everything got a little soft the second time. On Batman Forever, I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making a movie. The second time, I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making a kid's toy commercial." [...] He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable {{than the one he}} wore in Batman Forever, with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face. According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, [...] "Joel [...] would sit on a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take, 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of {{set the tone for the}} film." [...] Production designer Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from [...] "neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World's Fair on ecstasy." [...] Rhythm and Hues and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences, with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors.|$|E
500|$|Gravel {{took the}} 1980 defeat hard, recalling years later: [...] "I had lost my career. I lost my marriage. I {{was in the}} {{doldrums}} for ten years after my defeat," [...] and [...] "Nobody wanted to hire me for anything important. I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> worthless. I didn't know what I could do." [...] By his own later description, Gravel had been a womanizer while in the Senate, and in December 1980 {{he and his wife}} Rita separated.

60|$|As {{we entered}} the house <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> crying. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> chilly and tired, and {{had the feeling that}} <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> beaten even by Nature. There was now no excuse for {{returning}} to the ranch until after the rain. I had foolishly pleaded the danger of exposing Marjorie to the drive, in case of a storm, and now the rain had come--come to stay for several days; perhaps for a week. I could not consistently depart until the downpour had ceased.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{mainly focused}} on {{business}} management while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there, not really thinking about music per se at first, but just on life.

Walsh later described his reasons for not resuming his musical career after his son’s death. [...] "I just {{wanted nothing to do with}} anything that didn't have him in it. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> given every chance of happiness and he got none.

500|$|Although Spielberg {{was able}} to {{function}} autonomously in Kubrick's absence, {{he said he felt}} [...] "inhibited to honor him", and followed Kubrick's visual schema with as much fidelity as he could, according to author Joseph McBride. Spielberg, who once referred to Kubrick as [...] "the greatest master I ever served", now with production underway, admitted, [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being coached by a ghost." [...] The film was released in June 2001. It contains a posthumous production credit for Stanley Kubrick at the beginning and the brief dedication [...] "For Stanley Kubrick" [...] at the end. [...] John Williams's score contains many allusions to pieces heard in other Kubrick films.|$|E
500|$|During most of Wade's time at Marquette, {{his mother}} was either eluding the law or serving time in jail for selling crack cocaine.

Wade, then a sophomore at Marquette, went home for Christmas {{to be with his}} mom, who he believed was clean and sober {{for the first time in}} his life.

Idaho, Utah State, Colorado State, and Murray State were some of his other potential Division I destinations. He {{was considered one of}} the top Canadians committing to an NCAA program that year, in a list headlined by Andrew Nicholson and Kris Joseph. As soon as he arrived at EKU, he became close with the school. Oppong said, [...] "From the first day, I was accepted, as soon as I stepped on campus. I was here in the summertime and there were a few guys here who I knew and as soon as we came in August, I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> part of the family." [...] Head coach Jeff Neubauer commented on him, [...] "We think Papa Oppong will be a tough match-up for our opponents because he is a shooter, rebounder and slasher." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gibbs {{later said}} of his many games, “I would have been concussed in over half of them.

It’s fat-phobic and awful.

500|$|Gregg Allman's lyrical {{contributions}} to the band's debut album have been called [...] "remarkably mature lyrical conceptions for such a young man, expertly executed in a minimalist, almost haiku style." [...] Allman's inspiration came from his time in Los Angeles {{as a part of}} Hour Glass, [...] "getting fucked by different land sharks in the business," [...] experiencing great frustration among fierce competition. The traditional blues songs were, likewise, regarded as [...] "songs that were so good they couldn’t be left off the album." [...] On the writing of the record, Allman wrote in his memoir My Cross to Bear, [...] "I wrote most of that whole first record in that one week. I had total peace of mind. L.A. and all its changes didn’t even cross my mind. I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> starting all over, which I was." [...] Most of the songs on the album were written at Rose Hill Cemetery.|$|E
500|$|Mulan {{served as}} Wen's first voice-acting role. In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me. I loved using my imagination. I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little kid again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E

"To Zion," [...] {{among the}} more introspective tracks on the album, spoke about how Hill's family comes before her career and her {{decision}} to have her first child, even though many at the time encouraged her to abort the pregnancy, so as to not conflict with her burgeoning career. In an interview she discussed the song's origin and significance, commenting [...] "Names wouldn't come when I was ready to have him. The only name that came to me was Zion. I was like, 'is Zion {{too much of a}} weight to carry?' But this little boy, man. I would say he personally delivered me from my emotional and spiritual drought. He just replenished my newness. When he was born, I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born again."

And when I had got {{everything}} jammed in somehow, and my landlady and her maid had both sat on it while I locked it, I discovered I had packed {{a whole lot}} of things I wanted for Convocation at the very bottom.

I would get hold of something that <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking for, and I'd yank it up, and it would be something else. No, Anne, I did NOT swear." ...|$|R
2500|$|Many other celebrities {{released}} statements {{responding to}} Houston's death.

500|$|Filming lasted 138 days, {{during which}} Fincher shot more than 1,500 rolls of film, {{three times the}} average for a Hollywood film. The {{locations}} were in and around Los Angeles, including most notably: The Promenade Towers, Melrose Avenue, St. Brendan's Catholic Church, and Michael Heizer's public art sculpture [...] Sets were also built in Century City. Production designer Alex McDowell constructed more than 70 sets. The exterior of Tyler Durden's house was built in Wilmington, California, while the interior was built on a sound stage at the studio's location. The interior was given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the characters. Marla Singer's apartment was based on photographs of apartments in downtown LA. Overall production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and complex special effects. Fincher compared Fight Club to his subsequent, less complex film Panic Room: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Glenn Gamboa of Newsday {{wrote that}} the stage set of massive cubes {{was similar to the}} Watch the Throne Tour by Jay-Z and Kanye West and noted that the [...] "complicated" [...] system of screens which was used to leave an {{impression}} that Beyoncé and her dancers were stepping in and out of black-and-white images was influenced by the opening credits of James Bond films. He further noted, [...] "There were so many striking visual images both on stage and on screen, the show felt like a Pinterest board come to life -- packed with bold colors and graphics, elegant modern dance positions and video clips." [...] Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger also compared the light-up platforms on the stage with the towering cubes used during the Watch the Throne Tour. In another review, he noted, [...] "The light show was as hypnotic as Laser Floyd, the costumes glittered like mirror balls, and the bass at Ovation Hall was so booming that I often <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> standing in a stiff wind." [...] Chuck Darrow of the Philadelphia Media Network wrote, ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Sarsgaard played John Lotter, Lana's former boyfriend, who {{raped and}} murdered Teena. Sarsgaard {{was one of the}} first choices for the role. He later said he wanted his {{character}} to be [...] "likable, sympathetic even", because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." [...] In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt [...] "empowered" [...] by playing Lotter. In an interview with The Independent, Sarsgaard said, [...] "I felt very sexy, weirdly, playing John Lotter. I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just like the sheriff, y'know, and that everyone loved me." [...] Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role. Peirce cast Alicia Goranson, known for playing Becky on the sitcom Roseanne, as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert. Like Sevigny, Goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role.|$|E

Gattis finished tied for seventh in NL Rookie of the Year balloting.|$|E
500|$|The tale was {{the basis}} for a story in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, wherein the prince decides to slip a bowling ball {{underneath}} one hundred mattresses after three years of unsuccessful attempts with the pea.

I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sleeping on a lump as big as a bowling ball." [...] which satisfies the king and the queen. The princess gets married to the prince, and they live happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. American poet Jane Shore published a poem, [...] "The Princess and the Pea", in the January 1973 issue of Poetry, in which a close dependency between princess and pea is posited: [...] "I lie in my skin as in an ugly coat: / my body owned by the citizens / who ache and turn whenever I turn / on the pea on which so much depends" [...] (13-16). Russian writer Evgeny Shvarts incorporates the story, with two other Andersen stories, in his Naked King.|$|E

[...] The producers promised a tearful ending, and the cast admitted their crying was not faked when they filmed their scenes. LeBlanc revealed it had been too much for him {{and the rest of the}} cast; he said Kudrow started crying first, and when he looked at Aniston and Cox they also appeared emotional. Schwimmer, who LeBlanc thought was the [...] "consummate professional", was also upset, so LeBlanc [...] "just lost it." [...] Maggie Wheeler, who was Chandler's [...] "on and off" [...] girlfriend Janice, told People, [...] "the entire cast had to go back and have their makeup redone before starting," [...] and that Perry broke the tension by saying, [...] "Somebody is gonna get fired."

5000|$|Carvell {{stumbled}} into a comedy career [...] "by accident". He heard about an opening on the TV comedy series The Daily Show with Jon Stewart from Steve Bodow, {{one of the}} writers on that show. He submitted a writing sample that consisted of the headlines that Jon Stewart reads at the desk and dialogue between Stewart and correspondents. Carvell was then interviewed by the show's head writer and the executive producer. He joined the show in March 2004, just as the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign was becoming a common news topic.
