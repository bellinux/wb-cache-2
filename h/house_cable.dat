5000|$|Cable {{television}} piracy, a form {{of copyright}} infringement, is the act of obtaining unauthorized access to cable television services. [...] In older analog cable systems, most cable channels were not encrypted and cable theft was often as easy as plugging a coaxial cable attached to the user's television into an apartment <b>house</b> <b>cable</b> distribution box (which often had no securing by a cable company employee such as a lock to prevent unauthorized access). In some rural areas nonsubscribers would even run long cables to distribution boxes on nearby utility poles. Set-top boxes were required with some systems, but these were generic, and often in an unknowing violation of contract, former customers would donate them to thrift stores for sale or retain them indefinitely in storage when they ended their subscription to the service rather than return them to the provider.|$|E
50|$|On April 30, 2000, {{a dispute}} between Disney and Time Warner Cable forced WTVD off cable systems within the Raleigh-Durham-Fayetteville market for over 24 hours during the May sweeps period. Other ABC {{stations}} in markets served by Time Warner Cable, such as New York City, Los Angeles and Houston, were also {{affected by the}} outage as well before the FCC forced TWC to restore service to those areas on May 2. In July 2010, Disney {{announced that it was}} involved in another carriage dispute with Time Warner Cable which involved four ABC owned-and-operated stations (including WTVD), Disney Channel and the networks of ESPN. If a deal was not in place, the entire Disney cluster would have been removed from Time Warner and Bright <b>House</b> <b>cable</b> systems across the country. On September 2, 2010, Disney and Time Warner Cable reached a long-term agreement to keep the Disney family of channels on its systems.|$|E

40|$|The 69 KV Substation Project {{is based}} on the {{recognized}} need to provide a continuous, reliable source of power and to improve the firm capacity of the electrical service to all production facilities at Mound. The project consists of the following major element: 69 KV Substation: (1) Install a 69 KV Substation and associated equipment with two parallel 18 MVA transformers. (2) Install duct bank as required and provide 15 KV feeder cable from new substation to existing Substation 95 for connection to Mound`s existing primary distribution system. (3) Install duct bank for underground routing of the 15 KV feeder cable from Manhole 5 C to the existing power <b>house</b> <b>cable</b> pit. (4) Reconfigure existing Dayton Power and Light Co. 15 KV switchgear in P Building. The purpose of this Quality Assurance Plan (QA Plan) is to assure that the objectives of the United States Department of Energy (D. O. E.) and EG&G Mound Applied Technologies, Miamisburg, Ohio (Mound) are met for this non-weapons project relative to health and safety, protection of the environment, reliability and continuity of operations, and documentation of quality efforts.

40|$|For the LHC upgrade, CERN has {{launched}} a large program to develop next generation accelerator magnets based on high-Jc Nb 3 Sn Rutherford cables. These magnets are characterized by a magnetic field and/or an aperture significantly larger than that of current Nb-Ti LHC magnets. The increased field/aperture will require coil pre-stresses much larger than 100 MPa. Since Nb 3 Sn cables are extremely sensitive to strain, critical current measurements under traverse compression are essential to estimate the transport current properties of the conductor within the magnet. To this purpose CERN has developed a sample holder (to {{be used in the}} FRESCA test station) that allows testing Rutherford cables under a transverse force of up to 2 MN/m. The new holder can <b>house</b> <b>cable</b> samples up to 1. 8 m long and 20 mm wide. The large transverse force is only applied over the sample high field region, which is 70 cm long and over which the FRESCA dipole magnet generates a homogeneous fields of up to 10 T. Recently the critical current of the first cable sample has been measured at different transversal loads ranging from 90 MPa to 155 MPa. The measurement was carried out at 4. 3 K on a 10 mm wide Rutherford cable based on eighteen Powder In Tube (PIT) wires with a diameter of 1. 0 mm. In this paper the results of the test are reported, discussed and compared with recently measured data of the same single wire (1. 0 mm PIT) tested under transverse loads...|$|E

50|$|A cable {{assembly}} is {{the composition of}} one or more electrical cable(s) and one or more connectors. A {{cable assembly}} is not necessarily suitable for connecting two devices but can be a partial product (e.g. to be soldered onto a printed circuit board with one side, the connector mounted to the <b>housing).</b> <b>Cable</b> assemblies can also take the form of cable trees, used to connect many electrical components. In all cases the combination of the electrical cable and the connector determines the performance of the cable assembly as a whole.|$|R
50|$|The Switch Matrix {{is made up}} of RF {{switches}} and signal conditioners that are mounted together in a mechanical infrastructure or <b>housing.</b> <b>Cables</b> then interconnect the {{switches and}} signal conditioners. The switch matrix then employs a driver circuit and power supply to power and drive the switches and signal conditioners. The switch matrix uses connectors or fixtures to route the signal paths from the sourcing and measurement equipment to the DUT. The switch matrix is typically located close to the DUT to shorten the signal paths, thus reducing insertion loss and signal degradation.|$|R

50|$|In {{the valley}} of the Severn the river was {{diverted}} to drive a water-ram which pumped water to a huge stone faced tankon Moel-y-Mab, a spur of the Long Mountain.

An Upper and Lower <b>Cable</b> <b>House</b> were built. The lower one is of brick, the upper of Cefn stone from Minera. Its upper stage is of decorative timber-framing with a steeply-hipped roof.
