500|$|Of the 40 boroughs {{created in}} 1894 and 1895, 26 were in Bergen County. [...] The ones {{elsewhere}} included Roselle and Mountainside, in Union County. In September 1894, state Senator Henry D. Winton {{warned that the}} legislature at its next session was likely to amend if not gut the Borough Act because of the craze in Bergen County. Nine new members had {{been added to the}} Board of Chosen Freeholders from the previous sixteen, Winton noted, with a proportionate increase in the cost of government, which would be further inflated by the multiplicity of boroughs. The signal that the law might change did not slow the incorporations: Wood-Ridge, Carlstadt, Edgewater, Old Tappan and other boroughs trace their geneses to late 1894. There were some fistfights and hard feelings over the borough formations, and Russell Jones, whose house was on the newly <b>drawn</b> <b>line</b> between Teaneck and Bogota, saw it burn down as firefighters argued about who had jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|Greek {{philosophy}} on mathematics {{was strongly}} influenced by their study of geometry. For example, at one time, the Greeks held the opinion that 1 (one) was not a number, but rather a unit of arbitrary length. A number {{was defined as a}} multitude. Therefore, 3, for example, represented a certain multitude of units, and was thus not [...] "truly" [...] a number. At another point, a similar argument was made that 2 was not a number but a fundamental notion of a pair. These views come from the heavily geometric straight-edge-and-compass viewpoint of the Greeks: just as lines drawn in a geometric problem are measured in proportion to the first arbitrarily <b>drawn</b> <b>line,</b> so too are the numbers on a number line measured in proportion to the arbitrary first [...] "number" [...] or [...] "one".|$|E
2500|$|Euclidean Geometry is constructive. Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 {{assert the}} {{existence}} and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them {{with no more than}} a compass and an unmarked straightedge. In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as set theory, which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory. Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are models of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example, a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real <b>drawn</b> <b>line</b> will. Though nearly all modern mathematicians consider nonconstructive methods just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones—e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs that involved irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as [...] "Find the greatest common measure of ..." ...|$|E
25|$|As late as 1863, horse <b>drawn</b> <b>lines</b> {{were still}} {{considered}} a viable form of transportation. The Oakwood and Geddes lines were built that year. Later, steam locomotives replaced the horse <b>drawn</b> <b>lines.</b> The list of railroads is in chronological order.|$|R

This replaces the use of breadboards and wires.|$|R
2500|$|Fuller {{was born}} on July 12, 1895, in Milton, Massachusetts, the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller and Caroline Wolcott Andrews, and grand-nephew of the American Transcendentalist Margaret Fuller. He {{spent much of his}} youth on Bear Island, in Penobscot Bay off the coast of Maine. He {{attended}} Froebelian Kindergarten. [...] He had trouble with geometry, being unable to understand the abstraction that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented a mathematical point, or that an imperfectly <b>drawn</b> <b>line</b> with an arrow on the end was meant to stretch off to infinity. He often made items from materials he found in the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats. By age 12, he had invented a 'push pull' system for propelling a rowboat by use of an inverted umbrella connected to the transom with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination. Later in life, Fuller took exception to the term [...] "invention".|$|E

50|$|A {{nomogram}} {{consists of}} a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. The result is obtained by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or <b>drawn</b> <b>line</b> created by the straightedge is called an index line or isopleth.|$|E
