500|$|City's matchwinner Hamilton and {{his manager}} Kamara shared the {{headlines}} in the national newspapers. Hamilton said after the game: [...] "To score for my hometown team at Wembley {{has got to be}} one of the best feelings ever." [...] Kamara added: [...] "Now I am hungry for second helpings of success. And I am absolutely convinced I can get it here. We will not look out of place in the First Division because we have so much quality." [...] County's manager Colin Murphy told the press: [...] "All credit to Bradford, they won it fair and square. And that does not always happen in football. Bradford are a very experienced side compared to mine. Maybe this came a year too early for my boys." [...] Jacobs, the Bradford full-back who played 11 years for the club and won a subsequent promotion to the Premier League, said after his career: [...] "I just look back on some amazing times and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> <b>to</b> be part of them. It was a real blessing to my life. To play at Wembley was a dream fulfilled." ...|$|E
500|$|Byrom is a midfielder, {{and is more}} {{comfortable}} in the centre of midfield. He is left-footed, although the left side is not his natural position, and he is rarely deployed as a winger. In 2007, Clitheroe chairman, Carl Garner, said that Byrom has [...] "tremendous skill and potential", adding [...] "Joel is a quality player. He can do things with the ball that players on the television can't. In May 2009, Stevenage manager Graham Westley believed that the acquisition of Byrom would [...] "give the squad more balance", and has also described him as having a [...] "cultured left-foot" [...] that enables him to open up opposition defences. On securing the signature of Byrom, Westley said, [...] "Joel is very creative going forward {{and is going to}} be one hell of a player. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> <b>to</b> secure his signature as he is a real talent". Dino Maamria has called Byrom a [...] "creative midfielder", as well as being able to unlock defences. Byrom has called himself [...] "a good passer of the ball", as well as being able to [...] "chip in with a few goals and generally get the team ticking over". In March 2010, following Stevenage's 3–0 win against Crawley Town, a game in which Byrom scored a goal from just inside Crawley's half, Westley said that Byrom has the [...] "ability to score spectacular goals".|$|E
2500|$|Batty made 32 {{appearances}} {{during the}} 1996–97 season, an eventful campaign {{in which he}} missed six weeks with a fractured hand, won his third FA Trophy and helped the Cards take Premiership side Coventry City to a replay {{in the third round}} of the FA Cup. After his third FA Trophy win, he said [...] "the first one is the most special but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> <b>to</b> keep a clean sheet {{for the first time at}} Wembley". Batty also netted another goal during the season. As a recognition of Batty's continued service, he was awarded a testimonial versus former club Fulham in August 1999. Batty continued to play on until the end of the 1999–00 season, having seen his appearance-count diminish over the previous two seasons with the emergence of young understudy Darryl Flahavan. In the summer of 2000, Batty stalled over signing a new one-year contract and was then released by manager Colin Lippiatt in a summer clearout. Batty made 422 appearances and scored five goals during his nine years with Woking.|$|E

2500|$|Like many genre authors, Carl perfected her craft at {{the short}} fiction level.... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> <b>to</b> find Carl's most {{important}} stories collected {{here for the}} first time.... Of the 11 stories contained here, all have some sort of underlying mythic/historical theme, which is Carl's forté.... Perhaps the most ambitious story here is [...] "From the Labyrinth of Night." [...] A Martian exploration setup is developed nicely with rich allusions to the Minotaur legends of ancient Crete, culminating in the [...] "sacrifice" [...] demanded by the beast in the maze. The interpersonal relationships are the real driving force to the narrative, as by this point, the astronauts' explorations are mechanical efforts done out of habit more than enthusiasm.... "Upon this Shoal of Time" [...] is another ambitious science fiction story cloaked in the trappings of mythology. This time, Carl takes the reader to a far-future archaeological dig, where real science is dependent upon the financial sponsorship of media conglomerates hopeful of unearthing exclusive rights to digs that capture the public fancy, King Tut-style. After unearthing an intact Pictish skull from a Scottish burial site in Cawdor, Dr. James Henderson subjects it to a series of elaborate processes, each one designed to unlock lost memories from the subject at the sub-atomic level. His experiment is far more successful than he'd ever dreamed. At turns disturbing and impressive, with MacBethian overtones, Carl crafts a moving tale around the strength and impact memories can have on a person. One of the strongest stories presented here — the fuzzy science of the premise is presented smoothly and logically, detracting nothing from the narrative.|$|E

6000|$|By way {{of sanity}} test I alluded on purpose {{to the late}} captain. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> <b>to</b> find that Mr. Burns did not display undue {{interest}} in the subject.

60|$|DEAR LAD, - <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> <b>to</b> {{hear the}} good news about -. Bravo, he goes uphill fast. Let him beware of vanity, and he will go higher; let him be still discontented, and let him (if it might be) see the merits and not the faults of his rivals, and he may swarm at last to the top-gallant. There is no other way. Admiration is the only road to excellence; and the {{critical}} spirit kills, but envy and injustice are putrefaction on its feet.|$|E
6000|$|At this juncture, the Chainbearer came forward, {{and took}} the command. I {{could see he was}} agitated--affected might be a better word--but he was, nevertheless, steady and authoritative. He was obeyed, too, in a manner <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> <b>to</b> see. The order of the [...] "boss" [...] had {{produced}} no such impressions as those which old Andries now issued; and I really felt an impulse to obey them myself, as I would have done eighteen months before, when he stood on the right of our regiment as its oldest captain.|$|E

Secondly, because it is my deliberate opinion that I have been assailed on this subject in a manner in which no man with any pretensions to public respect or with the remotest right to express an opinion on a subject of universal literary interest would be assailed in any other country.

60|$|Thus the {{phenomena}} which the philological school of mythology explains by {{a disease of}} language we would explain by survival from a savage state of society and from the mental peculiarities observed among savages in all ages and countries. Of course there is nothing new in this: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> <b>to</b> discover the idea in Eusebius as in Fontenelle; while, for general application to singular institutions, it was a commonplace of the last century. {6a} Moreover, the idea had been widely used by Dr. E. B. Tylor in Primitive Culture, and by Mr. McLennan in his Primitive Marriage and essays on Totemism.|$|E
