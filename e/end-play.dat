50|$|Bowed {{retaining}} rings are curved versions of standard flat {{internal and external}} {{retaining rings}} and exert a pre-load on an assembly when installed in the groove. This takes up the <b>end-play</b> and acts like a spring, which keeps the assembly in compression.|$|E
50|$|A special match-grade {{go gauge}} {{can also be}} {{employed}} to verify a particularly tight, or shorter-than-SAAMI spec. chamber length. Such gauges are usually specially ordered from chamber-reamer manufacturers. This minimizes case stretch or <b>end-play</b> in order to best control the positioning of an unfired round prior to its firing in a match-grade chamber. Such chambers are also usually cut to tighter dimensions in the case-neck area. Thus, a standard go gauge may not actually chamber as easily due to these reduced dimensions, {{even if they are}} cut properly.|$|E
50|$|Beveled {{retaining}} rings feature a 15° beveled or angled edge. This angle allows the ring to wedge itself between the groove and the retained part until {{it can go}} no farther, effectively “locking” everything in place. Think of placing a cork in a bottle. The cork is forced into the opening until it is wedged as far into the opening as possible. The same thing happens when a beveled retaining ring is installed into an application. The ring is wedging itself into place between the groove wall and the retained part, resulting in what {{is referred to as}} rigid <b>end-play</b> take-up.|$|E
50|$|One THM350 {{weak point}} was {{excessive}} <b>end-play</b> between the pump and center support and resulting wobble {{of the direct}} clutch drum due to both the end play and use of a relatively narrow bushing in the drum. This weak point can be addressed by using an extra thrust washer between the planetary gear and direct clutch to remove the end play and using a wider aftermarket bushing in the direct clutch drum. Another weak point is the relatively thin center support and the lightweight matching splines in the case. This weakness can be addressed by using an inexpensive aftermarket case saver kit.|$|E
40|$|Methods for a {{blood pump}} bearing system within a pump housing to support {{long-term}} high-speed rotation of a rotor with an impeller blade having {{a plurality of}} individual magnets disposed thereon to provide a small radial air gap between the magnets and a stator of less than 0. 025 inches. The bearing system may be mounted within a flow straightener, diffuser, or other pump element to support the shaft of a pump rotor. The bearing system includes a zirconia shaft having a radiused end. The radiused end has a first radius selected to be about three {{times greater than the}} radius of the zirconia shaft. The radiused end of the zirconia shaft engages a flat sapphire endstone. Due to the relative hardness of these materials a flat is quickly produced during break-in on the zirconia radiused end of precisely the size necessary to support thrust loads whereupon wear substantially ceases. Due to the selection of the first radius, the change in shaft <b>end-play</b> during pump break-in is limited to a total desired <b>end-play</b> of less than about 0. 010 inches. Radial loads are supported by an olive hole ring jewel that makes near line contact around the circumference of the shaft to support high speed rotation with little friction. The width of olive hole ring jewel is small to allow heat to conduct through to thereby prevent heat build-up in the bearing. A void defined by the bearing elements may fill with blood that then coagulates within the void. The coagulated blood is then conformed to the shape of the bearing surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Title: Solutions of the {{offensive}} futsal combinations Objectives: The main {{aim of this}} thesis is to analyse and illustrate the solutions of {{the offensive}} combinations as considered {{through the lens of}} the match process. Methods: The data were collected via the nonparticipating observations of the video recordings of the AC Sparta Praha matches. Categorial system of observation to compare the particular components of the match was employed in order to lay down the correctness of the hypotheses. The resulting values were statistically processed based on the written data. The commentary files were filled in via dashing and writing notes. Results: Through the observations, the combinations leading to scoring the goal were found, and the key aspects of the successful executions were laid out. More possible variants of executing the offense were found. The higher success rate was found when combining the gradual offense, quick counter-offense after gaining the ball, <b>end-play</b> executed from the centre of the field and also against the defence active in the defender's half of the field. Keywords: game performance, offensive combinations, game situations, analysis, training proce...|$|E
40|$|The old, world-wide {{phenomenon}} of playing board games has received little attention among scholars studying the ancient cultures. This thesis collects and analyses game-related material from Bronze Age Crete, defines {{the field of}} research and provides a framework with definitions and typologies. A further goal {{is to use the}} results of the analyses to extend beyond the archaeological material and examine gaming as part of social history. Each part of the thesis - published separately also - is focused on a particular material. The figures of cup-holes are organised in a database. Statistical comparisons and analyses of appearance and placement suggest that most were made for the purpose of playing games. They were made on pavement slabs at open, public, multi-purpose areas, such as street corners and courtyards. The outline of a few specific games can be presented, e. g., the " 12 -ring"-game and " 10 / 2 "-game, and unpublished excavation documents show that there also were a " 3 x 10 "-game on Crete, related to the Egyptian game of Senet. The investigation of the elaborate Knossos game board provides a new understanding for its details, general layout and internal logic. Several, common game features found in other ancient games, such as separate, safe entrances, battle areas, difficult passages and <b>end-play</b> areas, can be found on this board also. Subsequently, all kinds of small objects that could possibly have been associated with games are investigated. The following categories stand out: "markers/counters", "pieces", "tiles", "dice and lots" and "visual representations". Each object is evaluated to see how likely it is that it was made for gaming or not. The finds made for gaming include cone-shaped gaming pieces, an astragalos with differently marked sides, and a six-sided signet with the Egyptian game board sign. The oldest die of Europe is discussed for the first time, and previously unpublished gaming pieces are presented. If modern theories on game classification are used, the suggested games belong most likely to a positioning kind of race game or to the subgroup of alinement games. The game-related finds can also highlight several other aspects of the Minoan society the public and private spheres, possible connections to ritual and religion, etc. There are, e. g., possible connections between games and rituals, such as games played on cup-holes that may have been ritualised and centralised over time. We have a local production of gaming material, with various dimensions of foreign influence. These influences came from Egypt and from other cultures around the Eastern Mediterranean, but little seems to have continued to the Greek mainland. From the period of Mycenaean influence on Crete, there are less gaming finds, and the cup-holes seem to have disappeared...|$|E
