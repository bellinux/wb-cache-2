5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> head in shame.|$|E

25|$|John I (c. 1252–1294) was well-liked, handsome, admired, and a {{champion}} jouster. His dukedom, the Duchy of Brabant, was a wealthy, beer-producing jurisdiction that encompassed Brussels.

With her plan to convince Ko that he has committed incest foiled, Kwan instead sets her sights on Ko's fortune, and asks Hung to play along with Ko's misconception. Ko treats <b>Hung</b> as <b>his</b> {{own flesh and blood}} and tries to make amends for being an absent father, rewriting his will to favour <b>Hung</b> over <b>his</b> own son.|$|R
25|$|When Starkad was so {{old that}} he wished to die and his {{eyesight}} was bad, he <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> gold {{around his neck and}} went out to wander. He killed a man who wanted one of his swords and some riders who were contracted to kill Starkad by Hather (Hatherus), Lennius' son.|$|E
25|$|When Beria finally {{realized}} {{what was happening and}} plaintively appealed to Malenkov to speak for him, his old friend and crony silently <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> head and refused to meet his gaze. Malenkov pressed a button on his desk as the pre-arranged signal to Marshal Georgy Zhukov and a group of armed officers in a nearby room who burst in and arrested Beria.|$|E
25|$|The Ottomans {{had tried}} to take over Mani in 1770. In this attempt the Ottomans laid siege to the Grigorakis tower in Skoutari which was garrisoned by fifteen men and was {{eventually}} destroyed after three days. The Ottoman army then advanced to the plain of 'Vromopigada' where they were caught by surprise by the Maniots who they outnumbered and were routed. But the Maniot leader Éxarchos who was Zanet's nephew and Antony's father was lured to Tripoli and <b>hung.</b> <b>His</b> mother then caused the men of Skoutari under Zanet to sack the Ottoman castle of Passavas by trickery.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Ovid, other Roman writers also mentioned lycanthropy. Virgil wrote {{of human beings}} transforming into wolves. Pliny the Elder relates two tales of lycanthropy. Quoting Euanthes, he mentions a man who <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> clothes on an ash tree and swam across an Arcadian lake, transforming him into a wolf. On the condition that he attack no human being for nine years, he {{would be free to}} swim back across the lake to resume human form. Pliny also quotes Agriopas regarding a tale {{of a man who was}} turned into a wolf after tasting the entrails of a human child, but was restored to human form 10 years later.|$|E
25|$|Scottish Protestants were {{increasingly}} viewed as dangerous turncoats who {{sided with the}} English. In 1546 David Beaton imprisoned the Protestant preacher George Wishart (1513-1546) in the castle’s Sea Tower and had him burnt at the stake {{in front of the}} castle walls on March 1. Today, brick lettering with his initials marks the spot where he died. In May of that same year, Wishart's friends conspired against the cardinal. On May 26 they gained entry to the castle by disguising themselves as masons when some building work was in progress. After overcoming the garrison, they murdered Cardinal Beaton and <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> body from his window {{on the front of the}} castle.|$|E
25|$|Seilern {{returned}} to London {{at the end}} of the war to live in a great gloomy house he had acquired at 56 Princes Gate, South Kensington, where he rarely opened the blinds and electric light was largely eschewed as he said it distorted colours in pictures. At Princes Gate the ground floor was devoted to his enormous art library, and therefore pictures were hung mainly on the first floor, well-spaced, as in a museum. Other rooms in the house, of course, also held pictures: for example, on the second floor there was a charmingly decorated room called the card-room, which was apparently rarely shown to visitors but in which, eventually, he <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> Tiepolos, and behind this was a private study, hung with a group of Impressionist pictures including a fine late Cézanne.|$|E

2500|$|The show's central protagonist was Mike Karr, tireless crimefighter, {{introduced}} {{as a police}} officer who was finishing law school. This character evolved from the earlier Perry Mason character on radio. [...] He then progressed to the district attorney's office as an assistant district attorney, <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> own shingle as a defense attorney for several years, then became district attorney of Monticello. Karr was portrayed by three actors: John Larkin (radio's Perry Mason), Laurence Hugo, and Forrest Compton.|$|E
2500|$|Marsyas, the satyr {{who first}} formed the {{instrument}} using the hollowed antler of a stag, was a Phrygian follower of Cybele. He unwisely competed in music with the Olympian Apollo and inevitably lost, whereupon Apollo flayed Marsyas alive and provocatively <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> skin on Cybele's own sacred tree, a pine. [...] Phrygia {{was also the}} scene of another musical contest, between Apollo and Pan. [...] Midas was either a judge or spectator, and said he preferred Pan's pipes to Apollo's lyre, and was given donkey's ears as a punishment. [...] The two stories were often confused or conflated, as by Titian.|$|E

The group Collective Freedom for Gilad praised the decision, stating [...] "it is with immense joy that we have welcomed the news, which shows how well the French state is mobilized at every level {{to make it possible}} for a young man to regain his freedom and family". The French town of Raincy also named Shalit an honorary citizen, and the Grenoble City Hall <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> photo on their building facade the week of 10 December 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The Tom Green Show was {{renowned for}} Green's version of shock humor. Some of Green's most notable skits include pretending to [...] "hump" [...] a dead moose (which was {{referenced}} by rapper Eminem in [...] "The Real Slim Shady"), having an X-rated lesbian scene [...] painted on his father's car (labeled the [...] "Slut Mobile"), drinking milk by sucking on a cow's teat, and putting a cow {{head in his}} parents' bed while they slept because {{his father was a}} fan of The Godfather films. Green also <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> own unauthorized piece of art in the National Gallery of Canada (which remained untouched for days) with the added twist of later coming back and vandalizing it to the horror of onlooking patrons.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, if {{you have}} a lost {{position}} and can manage to induce your opponent to play quickly, you maximize the chances of a swindle. As Benko explains, [...] "{{if you have}} a lost position, you may as well try speed chess—you can only lose a game once. Maybe your opponent will get rattled and blow his advantage." [...] GM Larry Christiansen successfully used this strategy in Burden–Christiansen, Las Vegas 1992 (diagram at left). Down a queen for a knight and pawn against an opponent rated about 2200 (master-level), he managed to outplay his opponent and win! National Master Todd Barwick explains, [...] "Christiansen <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> queen (!) in the early middle game and had a hopelessly lost position. He then moved quickly, hoping to get Jim [...] caught up in a faster paced game where the probability of Jim making a mistake was increased. The idea worked as the game actually speeded up to a blitz pace where Jim ended up blundering away a game he would have never lost had he taken his time." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{dropping}} out of high school, Choe spent two years hitchhiking, and stealing, while traveling across the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He returned to Los Angeles {{at the age of}} 21 and decided he needed formal training in order to be a [...] "real" [...] artist. Choe enrolled in the only art school that accepted him, the California College of Arts & Crafts in Oakland and dropped out two years later. He also stole art supplies, books and food to get by, After spending a week in prison for his graffiti, Choe moved back to his family home in Los Angeles. He began illustrating and writing for magazines including Hustler, Ray Gun and Vice. Around this time, he began his ongoing relationship with the Asian pop culture store-cum-magazine Giant Robot. He also started showing his paintings to art galleries, which exhibited little interest. In defiance, Choe <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> work in an ice cream shop called Double Rainbow which was located on the hipster promenade Melrose Avenue. The impromptu exhibition was so popular that the store continued showing it for two years, with Choe replenishing pieces as they sold.|$|E
2500|$|In the 18th century, Holbein found favour in Europe {{with those}} who saw his precise art as an {{antidote}} to the Baroque. In England, the connoisseur and antiquarian Horace Walpole (1717–97) praised him as a master of the Gothic. Walpole <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> neo-Gothic house at Strawberry Hill with copies of Holbeins and kept a Holbein room. From around 1780, a re-evaluation of Holbein set in, and he was enshrined among the canonical masters. A new cult of the sacral art masterpiece arose, endorsed by the German Romantics. This view suffered a setback during the famous controversy known as the [...] "Holbein-Streit" [...] (Holbein dispute) in the 1870s. It emerged that the revered Meyer Madonna at Dresden was a copy, and that the little-known version at Darmstadt was the Holbein original. Since then, scholars have gradually removed the attribution to Holbein from many copies and derivative works. The current scholarly view of Holbein's art stresses his versatility, not only as a painter but as a draughtsman, printmaker, and designer. Art historian Erika Michael believes that [...] "the breadth of his artistic legacy has been a significant factor in the sustained reception of his oeuvre".|$|E
2500|$|It took 15 {{minutes for}} Don Canham {{to be sold}} on Bo Schembechler, {{resulting}} in Schembechler becoming the 15th coach in Michigan football history. At the time, Schembechler's current employer, the Miami RedHawks, could have thrown more money at Schembechler, but Canham managed to sell Schembechler on Michigan's tradition and prestige. Schembechler's respect for Michigan was evident early on when assistants complained about how the equipment they had was worse than {{what they had to}} work with at Miami. Schembechler gestured to a rusty chair and said, [...] "See this chair? Fielding Yost sat in this chair. See this nail? Fielding Yost <b>hung</b> <b>his</b> hat on that nail. And you're telling me we had better stuff at Miami? No men, we didn't. We have tradition here, Michigan tradition, and that's something no one else has!" [...] Schembechler immediately got to work in turning around his team. He had a reputation for being hard on his players, causing 65 of his 140 players to quit the team before the season even started. In response, Schembechler promised his team [...] "Those Who Stay Will be Champions," [...] assuring the players that remained that their efforts would be rewarded.|$|E
