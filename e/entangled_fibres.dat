40|$|International audienceA {{finite element}} model is {{proposed}} in this paper to simulate the non linear mechanical behaviour of assemblies of <b>entangled</b> <b>fibres</b> submitted to large transformations. The key point of the model lies in an automatic detection of contact-friction interactions between fibres. In all areas where contact is likely to occur, intermediate geometries are constructed. They provide adapted contact search direction and offer a geometrical support for the building up of contact elements. The fibres {{are taken into account}} by an enriched kinematical 3 D beam model, formulated in large transformations. Periodic conditions are applied to randomly determined samples of fibrous media. Simulation results for the compression (up to 90 %) of five different random samples, show similar behaviours, and allow the identification of exponents of power laws...|$|E
40|$|The self-aggregation of the ionic tetrapeptide RWDW (R = arginine, W = tryptophan, D = aspartic acid) was {{studied at}} three {{temperatures}} (15, 25 and 35 degrees C) by different experimental {{techniques such as}} atomic force microscopy (AFM), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). AFM was used to investigate the morphology of the aggregates; the AFM images at 15 degrees C showed {{the presence of a}} dense network of <b>entangled</b> <b>fibres,</b> while at 35 degrees C the peptide assembled into sparse globular and fibrillar structures. Moreover, the calorimetric experiments showed that in all cases the disaggregation process is endothermic and dependent on the investigated temperature. Both the enthalpy of disaggregation and the cac change with temperature. In particular, at 35 degrees C, we obtained the lower enthalpy of disaggregation and higher cac, showing that the disaggregation process is favoured at high temperature. The DSC scans strengthen the hypothesis that the RWDW aggregation is a rather complex phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|<b>Entangled</b> {{cross-linked}} <b>fibres</b> {{were studied}} for an application as core material for sandwich structures. Specimens were produced from carbon, aramid and glass fibres, and cross-links were achieved using epoxy spraying. It was observed {{that this type}} of <b>entangled</b> cross-linked <b>fibres</b> could be fabricated without any major technical difficulties. The scope {{of this paper is to}} study the effect of some different parameters on the mechanical properties of these materials. Different effects were investigated: effect of fibres length, of fibres nature, of mixing fibres, of carbon skins and of the resin. The first part of this paper deals with the production of these <b>entangled</b> cross-linked <b>fibres.</b> The compression, tension and three point bending tests are detailed in the second part and the results are compared with usual core material currently used in industries...|$|R
40|$|Most {{suspension}} descriptions nowadays employed {{are based}} on Jeffery model {{and some of its}} phenomenological adaptations that do {{not take into account the}} possible existence of a relative velocity between the fibres and the suspending fluid when the fibre interactions increase. It is expected that at very low density of contacts, as predicted by standard suspension models, fibres move with the suspending fluid velocity. When the density of fibre interactions becomes extremely high and a percolated network of fibre contacts is established within the suspension, fibres cannot move anymore and then the fluid flows throughout the rigid or moderately deformable <b>entangled</b> <b>fibre</b> skeleton, like a fluid flowing through a porous medium. In between these two limit cases, one could expect that fibres move but with a velocity lower than the one of the suspending fluid. Thus, two contributions are expected, one coming from standard suspension theory in which fibres and fluid move with the same velocity, and the other resulting in a Darcy contribution consisting of the relative fibre/fluid velocity. In this paper, we elaborate a general model able to adapt continuously to all these flow regimes...|$|R
40|$|We {{employ a}} {{discrete}} simulation adapted from molecular dynamics techniques {{in order to}} study the mechanics of <b>entangled</b> semiflexible <b>fibres.</b> A previous model represent a fibre as a "pearl necklace" [{Rodney 05 }]. Successive configurations are obtained by minimizing a potential energy made of linking, bending and interaction terms. This "node" model however imposes limitations both on the computing time (large number of nodes) and on how to model the non-penetrability between fibres. In order to level off these limitations, a new fibre model is developed here, in which the fibres are discretised as a succession of segments. Implementation of friction forces in this "spring" model allows {{a better understanding of}} the hysteresis observed experimentally during cyclic compressions of entangled materials...|$|R
40|$|Organopalygorskites were {{synthesised}} {{by using}} dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DMDOA) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CP) with surfactant loadings equivalent to 100 % and 200 % CEC of the palygorskite. The four organopalygorskites, thus produced, were characterised by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and zeta potential measurement. FTIR and TGA data demonstrated that higher surfactant loadings as well as long branched chain DMDOA produced highly ordered surfactant conformation. SEM morphological {{results showed that the}} organopalygorskites had less <b>entangled</b> <b>fibres</b> than the unmodified palygorskite. The zeta potential values showed positive charge formation on the organopalygorskites surface when they were synthesised with surfactant loadings equivalent to 200 % CEC of the palygorskite. The organopalygorskites were tested for adsorption of p-nitrophenol (PNP) with a special focus on the adsorption isotherms. The adsorption data could be fitted with multiple isothermal models indicating that the adsorption was controlled by multiple mechanisms. Sorbent loading rate, initial pH, temperature and ionic strength might all affect the adsorption process. Also, DMDOA modified organopalygorskites reduced desorption/redispersal of adsorbed PNP back into the environment to a great extent. This study will be helpful in designing palygorskite-based organoclay adsorbents for remediating organic environmental contaminants which are ionic in nature. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{investigations of}} liquid ingress and vapour uptake in different porous media including textile fabrics and activated carbons, monitored {{by means of}} a unilateral NMR instrument. The aim of this work is to assess protective materials which prevent toxic liquid ingress and toxic vapour uptake from contaminating materials and personnel. A high performance fabric made of a combination of coated and not coated fibres can provide extremely high protection against toxic liquids. By incorporating an adsorbent layer between two highly repellent layers, an “intelligent” fabric that can prevent complete penetration through the composite system by toxic vapours can be constructed. This project was undertaken with a low-field unilateral profile NMR Mouse® (MObile Universal Surface Explorer) which can collect signal from a thin and flat sensitive volume (ca. 1. 5 cm x 1. 5 cm x 0. 6 mm) up to 10 mm above it, and in a non-invasive manner. The instrument uses a strong inherent magnetic field gradient (11. 38 T. m- 1) in conjunction with pulsed radio frequency waves. The method makes use of Fourier Transformed NMR in order to spatially resolve 1 D vertical profiles for each measurement over a field of view exceeding 500 µm and with a spatial resolution of 15 µm. One system investigated was a laminate heterogeneous layered fabric, made of a horizontal stack of three individual layers, each 70 μm thick, constructed from <b>entangled</b> <b>fibres</b> of 10 µm in diameter. The top and bottom layers are strongly repellent to the oil used as a model that represents a simulant for a toxic liquid, whilst the middle layer is non-repellent and allows oil to absorb inside...|$|E
40|$|Resumo de comunicação apresentada em " 16 th Evergreen Phage Biology Meeting, Olympia", WA, EUA, 7 - 12 Agosto 2005. Biofilms are {{frequently}} in many industrial environments and {{are responsible for}} severe negative impacts such as equipment damage, loss in product quality and in economics. For instance in pulp and paper industry, microorganisms together with their exudates and the <b>entangled</b> <b>fibres</b> and filler materials form massive and slimy protusions hanging out from the material surfaces, which interfere with the paper-making process in various steps. Also, in dairy industry, biofilm presence {{may be responsible for}} pathogen cross-contamination, product defects such as package bloating, decreased shelf life, and off flavours, odours and textures. The eradication of these biofilms, as reported by several authors, is very difficult {{due to the nature of}} biofilm structure and the physiological attributes of biofilm organisms which confer an inherent resistance to biocides. The application of biological agents such as phages as an alternative to the chemical products is an interesting approach that should be studied in more detail. This work aimed the isolation of bacteria and the respective bacteriophages from a pulp and paper mill and from a dairy industry. The focus was given to EPS producing bacteria such as P. fluorescens, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Staphylococcus sciuri, and Klebsiella oxytoca. Phages were isolated from the industrial effluents and also nearby waste water treatment plants. After phage isolation from each industrial sector, the selection was based on the wider broad of lytic activity and time of bacterial elimination. For each type of industry, a 5 phage cocktail is being developed to be tested in the control the most prevalent biofilm producing bacteria...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the properties that characterise cotton fibres in the various stages in the CPNF process as well as to determine which fibre characteristics a r e required to <b>entangle</b> the <b>fibres</b> to produce a successful CPNF. The criteria adopted in this work for a successful CPNF include: 1. the tensile strength of the fabrics 2. a well-defined pattern 3. absorbency and wicking The properties selected for investigation were 1. the cotton fibre surface (using SEM and DSC analyses) 2. the degree of degradation of the cotton fibre {{as a result of the}} CPNF process (using cellulose fluidity measurements) 3. the non-cellulosic content of the fibre (using IR, DSC, and Chemical analyses) 4. fibre friction 5. absorbency and wicking 6. tensile properties Analysis of the results indicates clearly what the fundamental properties of the cotton fibre must be for a successful cotton CPNF to be manufactured. The conclusions also indicate the necessary properties a man-made fibre must have to produce a successful CPNF...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of P 3 HT nanopatterns (lamellae and fibres) {{within a few}} minutes, in standard laboratory conditions (i. e., at room temperature and in air) and over areas as large as cm 2, is reported. The nanostructures are prepared using a wet-processing method. A satisfactory control over the pattern topology (lamellae, hierarchically connected and parallel <b>fibres,</b> <b>entangled</b> but disconnected and quasiparallel fibres, randomly oriented fibres) is obtained by simply changing one process parameter. UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses carried out over the so-fabricated structures evidence a very high degree of supramolecular organization of the polymeric chains. Such a degree of order is similar or even better than that of P 3 HT samples treated with thermal or solvent annealing procedures...|$|R
40|$|Efficient and {{faithful}} implementation of quantum information tasks, e. g., quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum metrology, requires robust and state-independent decoherence-suppressing {{measures to protect}} quantum information carriers. Here we present an experimental demonstration of a robust distribution scheme in which one photon of an entangled photon pair is successfully encoded into and decoded from a decoherence-free subspace (DFS) by a state-independent scheme. We achieved a high-fidelity distribution of the <b>entangled</b> state over <b>fibre</b> communication channel, and also demonstrated that the scheme is robust against fragility of the reference frame. The scheme, thanks to its state-independence, is also applicable to multipartite case where the photon to be distributed is entangled with many other photons. Such a universal scheme opens the possibility of robust distribution of quantum information among quantum communication and computing networks. Comment: 12 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|White biotechnologies {{have several}} {{challenges}} to overcome {{in order to}} become a viable industrial process. Achieving highly concentrated lignocellulose materials and releasing fermentable substrates, with controlled kinetics in order to regulate micro-organism activity, present major technical and scientific bottlenecks. The degradation of the main polymeric fractions of lignocellulose into simpler molecules is a prerequisite for an integrated utilisation of this resource in a biorefinery concept. The characterisation methods and the observations developed for rheology, morphology, etc., that are reviewed here are strongly dependent on the fibrous nature of lignocellulose, are thus similar or constitute a good approach to filamentous culture broths. This review focuses on scientific works related {{to the study of the}} rheological behaviour of lignocellulose suspensions and their evolution during biocatalysis. In order to produce the targeted molecules (synthon), the lignocellulose substrates are converted by enzymatic degradation and are then metabolised by micro-organisms. The dynamics of the mechanisms is limited by coupled phenomena between flow, heat and mass transfers in regard to diffusion (within solid and liquid phases), convection (mixing, transfer coefficients, homogeneity) and specific inhibitors (concentration gradients). As lignocellulose suspensions consist of long <b>entangled</b> <b>fibres</b> for the matrix of industrial interest, they exhibit diverse and complex properties linked to this fibrous character (rheological, morphological, thermal, mechanical and biochemical parameters). Among the main variables to be studied, the rheological behaviour of such suspensions appears to be determinant for process efficiency. It is this behaviour that will determine the equipment to be used and the strategies applied (substrate and biocatalysis feed, mixing, etc.). This review provides an overview of (i) the rheological behaviour of fibrous materials in suspension, (ii) the methods and experimental conditions for their measurements, (iii) the main models used and (iv) their evolution during biocatalytic reactions with a focus on enzymatic hydrolysis...|$|E
40|$|Carding is an {{essential}} pre-spinning process whereby masses of dirty tufted fibres are cleaned, disentangled and refined into a smooth coherent web. Research and development in this `low-technology' industry have hitherto depended on empirical evidence. In collaboration with the School of Textile Industries at the University of Leeds, a mathematical theory has been developed that describes the passage of fibres through the carding machine. The fibre dynamics in the carding machine are posed, modelled and simulated by three distinct physical problems: the journey of a single fibre, the extraction of fibres from a tuft or tufts and many interconnecting, <b>entangled</b> <b>fibres.</b> A description {{of the life of}} a single fibre is given as it is transported through the carding machine. Many fibres are sparsely distributed across machine surfaces, therefore interactions with other neighbouring fibres, either hydrodynamically or by frictional contact points, can be neglected. The aerodynamic forces overwhelm the fibre's ability to retain its crimp or natural curvature, and so the fibre is treated as an inextensible string. Two machine topologies are studied in detail, thin annular regions with hooked surfaces and the nip region between two rotating drums. The theoretical simulations suggest that fibres do not transfer between carding surfaces in annular machine geometries. In contrast to current carding theories, which are speculative, a novel explanation is developed for fibre transfer between the rotating drums. The mathematical simulations describe two distinct mechanisms: strong transferral forces between the taker-in and cylinder and a weaker mechanism between cylinder and doffer. Most fibres enter the carding machine connected to and entangled with other fibres. Fibres are teased from their neighbours and in the case where their neighbours form a tuft, which is a cohesive and resistive fibre structure, a model has been developed to understand how a tuft is opened and broken down during the carding process. Hook-fibre-tuft competitions are modelled in detail: a single fibre extracted from a tuft by a hook and diverging hook-entrained tufts with many interconnecting fibres. Consequently, for each scenario once fibres have been completely or partially extracted, estimates can be made as to {{the degree to which a}} tuft has been opened-up. Finally, a continuum approach is used to simulate many interconnected, entangled fibre-tuft populations, focusing in particular on their deformations. A novel approach describes this medium by density, velocity, directionality, alignment and entanglement. The materials responds to stress as an isotropic or transversely isotropic medium dependent on the degree of alignment. Additionally, the material's response to stress is a function of the degree of entanglement which we describe by using braid theory. Analytical solutions are found for elongational and shearing flows, and these compare very well with experiments for certain parameter regimes...|$|E
40|$|Designing {{structures}} that dilate rapidly in both tension and compression would benefit {{devices such as}} smart filters, actuators or fasteners. This property however requires an unusual Poisson ratio, or Poisson function at finite strains, which has to vary with applied strain and exceed the familiar bounds: less than 0 in tension and above 1 / 2 in compression. Here, by combining mechanical tests and discrete element simulations, we show that a simple three-dimensional architected material, made of a self-entangled single long coiled wire, behaves in between discrete and continuummedia, with a large and reversible dilatancy in both tension and compression. This unusual behaviour arises from an interplay between the elongation of the coiled wire and rearrangements due to steric eects, which, unlike in traditional discrete media, are hysteretically reversible when the architecture is made of an elastic <b>fibre.</b> <b>Entangled</b> fibrous materials are ubiquitous in nature andtechnology and include for instance biopolymer networks 1,organic and inorganic wools 2, 3, carbon nanotube networks 4 and fibrous scaolds 5. They represent a class of emerging materials referred to as architectured 6 or architected 7 because their mechani-cal properties after scaling strongly depend on the geometry of their internal structure. The stress–strain response of fibrous materials has been widely studied, and is often characterized by a pronounced strain stienin...|$|R
40|$|Staple {{entanglement}} in mohair fleeces {{occurs when}} adhesions form between longer and faster growing fibres and shorter and slower growing fibres. This results in accentuated crimp of the longer fibres and an "apparently" reduced staple length. The {{appearance in the}} fleece of Angora goats of staple entanglements {{can lead to the}} downgrading of the mohair to poorer style and shorter length grades, resulting in up to 60 % price reductions. This study examined how staple entanglement score (SES) is related to lifetime factors of Angora goats, and how this relationship can be explained by variations in animal size and fleece attributes. SES was scored using a five-point scale: 5, long free fibres easily separated as no adhesions; 4, some adhesions between fibres; 3, some effort to separate fibres as many adhesions; 2, many adhesions, staple <b>fibres</b> <b>entangled,</b> shortening of staple; 1, very entangled and shortened staple. Measurements were made over 9 shearing periods on a population of Angora castrated males (wethers) goats representing the current range and diversity of genetic origins in Australia, including South African, Texan and interbred admixtures of these and Australian sources. Data on genetic origin, sire, dam, date of birth, dam age, birth weight, birth parity, weaning weight, live weight, fleece growth and fleece attributes were recorded. Two restricted maximum likelihood (REML) models were developed to relate SES with age, animal lifetime factors, fleece quality attributes and live weight. One model allowed fleece quality and live weight traits in the model and the other excluded these traits. Staple entanglement was almost eliminated in mohair harvested from goats shorn every 3. months but was common in mohair from goats shorn twice or once per year. SES was less in goats of Texan genetic background, and was generally less in winter grown mohair. SES was higher for mohair with low fibre curvature (FC, 10 °/mm) and a high clean washing yield (CWY, 90 %) compared with mohair with low FC and lower CWY (80 %), and compared with all mohair with high FC (18 °/mm). The response of SES to shearing regime, genetic background, shearing season, age of goat and a response to dam age were almost identical whether or not an adjustment was made for CWY and FC. There was a moderate amount of variability due to sires and individuals. We can conclude that a large part of these effects observed, namely breed, dam age, sire, and a component of the FC and CWY effects, are genetic. Mohair producers can manage the genetic effects by careful selection of sires, especially avoiding those with low CWY or high FC, and avoiding sires with higher levels of staple entanglement or that have produced progeny with higher levels of staple entanglement. Also, unidentified environmental effects are affecting staple entanglement, although a lack of a live weight change effect on entanglement indicates that this effect might not be due to nutrition. © 2013 Elsevier B.
