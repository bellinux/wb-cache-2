5|$|Four Egyptian taekwondo practitioners, {{two men and}} two women, {{qualified}} for the Olympics, all of whom finished first at the African Qualification tournament, except for Abdelrahman Ossama in the men's 80 kg class, who was second behind Morocco's Issam Chernoubi. Tamer Bayoumi, a bronze medalist from the 2004 Olympics, was the most successful of the quartet. In the 58 kg class he defeated Nursultan Mamayev of Kazakhstan in the round of 16 before losing <b>in</b> <b>sudden</b> death to Lee Dae-Hoon of South Korea, the eventual silver medalist, in the quarterfinals. In the repechage he was defeated by Thailand's Pen-Ek Karaket. The only other Egyptian to win a match was Hedaya Malak, in the women's 57 kg, who overcame Robin Cheong of New Zealand before being defeated by Marlène Harnois of France, an eventual bronze medalist. In his first bout, Ossama lost to Tommy Mollet of the Netherlands <b>in</b> <b>sudden</b> death, while Seham El-Sawalhy, the 2010 and 2012 African champion, was eliminated by Sweden's Elin Johansson in the round of 16 of the women's 67 kg class.|$|E

5|$|The 1998 NFC Championship Game was a National Football League (NFL) {{game played}} on January 17, 1999, to {{determine}} the National Football Conference (NFC) champion for the 1998 NFL season. The visiting Atlanta Falcons defeated the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings 30–27 <b>in</b> <b>sudden</b> death overtime to win their first conference championship and advance to the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance. As {{a result of their}} loss, the Vikings were eliminated from the playoffs and became the first team {{in the history of the}} NFL to compile a regular season record of 15–1 and not win the Super Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptomatic}} (determinate) chronic stage {{affects the}} nervous system, digestive system and heart. About two-thirds {{of people with}} chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including dilated cardiomyopathy, which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result <b>in</b> <b>sudden</b> death. About one-third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage, resulting in dilation of the digestive tract (megacolon and megaesophagus), accompanied by severe weight loss. Swallowing difficulties (secondary achalasia) {{may be the first}} symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, {{eighteen}} players each {{signed an}} individual National Letter of Intent to play college football at Alabama. The 2010 recruiting class was ranked nationally {{in the top}} five by several recruiting services including Rivals, Scout, ESPNU and CBS College Sports. Spring practice began on March 12 and concluded with the annual A-Day game on April 17. Televised live by ESPN, the Crimson team of offensive starters defeated the White team of defensive starters by a final score of 23–17 before 91,312 fans in Bryant–Denny Stadium. The game was decided after the end of regulation when Brandon Gibson caught a 39-yard touchdown pass from AJ McCarron <b>in</b> <b>sudden</b> death. For their performances, Marcell Dareus earned the Dwight Stephenson Lineman of the A-Day Game Award and Mark Ingram earned the Dixie Howell Memorial Most Valuable Player of the A-Day Game Award.|$|E

5|$|In the 2004–05 season, Humphreys helped Hartlepool {{once again}} make the {{play-off}}s. During the play-off semi-final against Tranmere, Humphreys had {{the task of}} taking a penalty for Hartlepool <b>in</b> <b>sudden</b> death. This {{was the first time}} Humphreys had taken a penalty since his crucial miss at Cheltenham. This time he scored and sent Hartlepool through to the play-off final against his old club Sheffield Wednesday at the Millennium Stadium. This helped to erase the memories of Cheltenham. However, Hartlepool lost the play-off final to Sheffield Wednesday. Humphreys believes that of all the play-off defeats he has suffered that the controversial loss to Wednesday was the hardest to take. Before {{the end of the season}} Humphreys extended his contract by a further two years.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{four people}} {{can play in}} {{multiplayer}} mode, which has specific rules predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches {{are two of the}} multiplayer modes of play. This gives each player a certain number of lives or a selected time limit, before beginning the match. Free for all or team battles are also a choice during matches using stock or time. A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team has lost all of their lives. A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or more players have the same score when time expires, which causes the round to end <b>in</b> <b>sudden</b> death.|$|E
5|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as Leader of a Machine-gun Section of Company B, First Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during the assault on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Assailed by a tremendous volume of small-arms, mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial assault wave, Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up the sloping beach toward Airfield Number One despite the blanketing curtain of flying shrapnel and, personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit, continued to move forward until a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance. Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action, he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy, reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades, pinned down his unit for the second time. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack, Sergeant Cole, armed solely with a pistol and one grenade, coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes. Hurling his one grenade at the enemy <b>in</b> <b>sudden,</b> swift attack, he quickly withdrew, returned to his own lines for additional grenades and again advanced, attacked, and withdrew. With enemy guns still active, he ran the gauntlet of slashing fire a third time to complete the total destruction of the Japanese strong point and the annihilation of the defending garrison in this final assault. Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade as he returned to his squad, Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position, thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications, continue the advance and seize the objective. By his dauntless initiative, unfaltering courage and indomitable determination during a critical period of action, Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades, and his stouthearted leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E

25|$|The score {{achieved}} {{for each}} and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score, and the player with the lowest score wins in stroke play. Stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers. If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament, a playoff takes place between all tied players. Playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes, anywhere from three to a full 18. <b>In</b> <b>sudden</b> death, a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match. If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes, then play continues <b>in</b> <b>sudden</b> death format, where {{the first player to}} win a hole wins the tournament.|$|E
25|$|In NCAA collegiate {{play in the}} United States, however, sudden death, {{adopted in}} 1999 for all {{championship}} play in addition to regular season play, remains.

25|$|Yet {{despite these}} medical advances, with success in {{reducing}} the symptoms of angina and reduced blood flow, atheroma rupture events remain the major problem and still sometimes result <b>in</b> <b>sudden</b> disability and death despite even the most rapid, massive and skilled medical and surgical intervention available anywhere today. According to some clinical trials, bypass surgery and angioplasty procedures have had at best a minimal effect, if any, on improving overall survival.

25|$|Most goalkeepers also wear {{gloves to}} improve their grip on the ball, and to protect {{themselves}} from injury. Some gloves now include rigid plastic spines down each finger to help prevent injuries such as jammed and sprained fingers. Though gloves are not mandatory attire, it is uncommon for goalkeepers to opt against them due to the advantages they offer. At UEFA Euro 2004, Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo famously took off his gloves for the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against England. He then went on to score a penalty <b>in</b> <b>sudden</b> death before saving Darius Vassell's penalty to win it for the Portuguese.|$|E
25|$|This {{conclusion}} was challenged {{in the same}} journal by James R.

Additionally, Paul's blindness remitted <b>in</b> <b>sudden</b> fashion, rather than the gradual resolution typical of post-ictal states, and no mention is made of epileptic convulsions; indeed such convulsions may, in Paul's time, have been interpreted as a sign of demonic influence, unlikely in someone accepted as a religious leader.|$|E
