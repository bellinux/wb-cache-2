It is also the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and third-largest by purchasing power parity. Currently, India maintains the world's third-largest active armed force (after the United States and China) and is a nuclear-weapon state. The International Herald Tribune has stated: [...] "Clearly, a seat for India would make the body more representative and democratic. With India as a member, the Council {{would be a more}} legitimate and thus a more effective body." [...] Thomas Friedman of the New York Times said: [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> the five permanent members of the UN Security Council could be chosen ... with a vote by the fans ....

[...] "#GetItRight" [...] is a pop-funk song; it was written and produced by Pharrell Williams. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, the track is written in the key of F major with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Mariah Eakin of The A.V. Club noted the incorporation of [...] "whistling choruses and whimsical sing-alongs", while Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly recognized {{the use of a}} [...] "scratchy funk guitar"; he further stated that the lyrics [...] "Would you believe I'm dancing in the mirror? / I feel like I got no panties on / <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> I could feel ya / Now hurry, hang up that damn phone!'"

500|$|In March 1967, the United States Senate Committee on Labor's Subcommittee on Poverty held {{a series}} of hearings, as part of the ongoing [...] "War on Poverty." [...] One of the testifying {{witnesses}} was Marian Wright, a 27 year-old Yale Law School graduate working with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund in Mississippi. She told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the Mississippi Delta. In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps. With little to no income, most households could not produce the necessary funds. As a result, Wright argued, Mississippians were [...] "starving. They're starving, and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> [...] would have a chance to go and just look at the empty cupboards in the Delta and {{the number of people who}} are going around and begging just to feed their children." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly favorable, calling it [...] "the only show with any sense of mystery." [...] John Teti of The A.V. Club found the episode to have a [...] "fantastic premise for a Peter Griffin adventure" [...] but went on to state that he gives the episode [...] "points for a strong first half, but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> the writers had pushed {{themselves}} {{a little harder to}} make this one go the distance." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN reiterated his own enjoyment of the premise {{of the episode}}, but went on to state, [...] "While I can appreciate the point that good comedy does take a certain degree of wit and cleverness, this just wasn't a very satisfying end to an idea that had so much potential." [...] In a much more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the underuse of cutaways, going on to note, [...] "Reducing the reliance on cutaways seems to be the continuing trend for the series, and I think it's a good move [...] It forces smarter writing, and creates a better narrative structure." ...|$|E
500|$|The Franciscan Padre Luis Sotelo came to {{our country}} to spread the faith of God.

500|$|Aspects of Nelson's {{life and}} career were controversial, both during his {{lifetime}} and after his death. His affair with Emma Hamilton was widely remarked upon and disapproved of, {{to the extent that}} Emma was denied permission to attend Nelson's funeral and was subsequently ignored by the government, which awarded money and titles to Nelson's legitimate family. Nelson's actions during the reoccupation of Naples have also been the subject of debate: his approval of the wave of reprisals against the Jacobins who had surrendered under the terms agreed by Cardinal Ruffo, and his personal intervention in securing the execution of Caracciolo, are considered by some biographers, such as Robert Southey, to have been a shameful breach of honour. Prominent contemporary politician Charles James Fox was among those who attacked Nelson for his actions at Naples, declaring in the House of Commons <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> the atrocities of which we hear so much and which I abhor as much as any man, were indeed unexampled. I fear that they do not belong exclusively to the French– Naples for instance has been what is called [...] "delivered", and yet, if I am rightly informed, it has been stained and polluted by murders so ferocious, and by cruelties of every kind so abhorrent, that the heart shudders at the recital... demanded that a British officer should be brought forward, and to him they capitulated. They made terms with him under the sanction of the British name. Before they sailed their property was confiscated, numbers were thrown into dungeons, and some of them, I understand, notwithstanding the British guarantee, were actually executed. Other pro-republican writers produced books and pamphlets decrying the events in Naples as atrocities. Later assessments, including one by Andrew Lambert, have stressed that the armistice had not been authorised by the King of Naples, and that the retribution meted out by the Neapolitans was not unusual for the time. Lambert also suggests that Nelson in fact acted {{to put an end to}} the bloodshed, using his ships and men to restore order in the city.|$|E

2500|$|At a press conference, Deputy Chief Constable Doug LePard of the VPD {{apologized to}} the victims' families, saying [...] "I wish {{from the bottom of}} my heart that we would have caught him sooner. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that,</b> the several {{agencies}} involved, that we could have done better in so many ways. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> all the mistakes that were made, we could undo.

2500|$|The early Heinlein biographer {{and critic}} Alexei Panshin, in his 1968 {{biography}} Heinlein in Dimension, {{took note of}} a controversial theme: [...] "The romantic situation in this story is a very interesting, very odd one: it {{is nothing less than}} a mutual sexual interest between an engineer of thirty and a girl of twelve ('adorable' is Heinlein's word for her), that culminates in marriage after some hop-scotching around in time to adjust their ages a bit." [...] The novel [...] "worried and bothered" [...] John W. Campbell, who said [...] "Bob can write a better story, with one hand tied behind him, than most people in the field can do with both hands.

2500|$|Hesiod {{knew from}} the {{traditional}} poetry, such as the Iliad, and the heirloom bronze artifacts that abounded in Greek society, that before the use of iron to make tools and weapons, bronze had been the preferred material and iron was not smelted at all. He did not continue the manufacturing metaphor, but mixed his metaphors, switching over to {{the market value of}} each metal. Iron was cheaper than bronze, so {{there must have been a}} golden and a silver age. He portrays a sequence of metallic ages, but it is a degradation rather than a progression. Each age has less of a moral value than the preceding. Of his own age he says: [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> I were not any part of the fifth generation of men, but had died before it came, or had been born afterward." ...|$|E

2500|$|By then, Aderca's own {{literature}} was being assessed from an antisemitic standpoint in traditionalist circles. Const. I. Emilian, studying Romania's modernist scene with an ultra-nationalist bias, dismissed all of Aderca's texts as [...] "neurotic". The theme {{was taken up}} by Ovidiu Papadima in Sfarmă-Piatră, ridiculing Lovinescu as the unlikely patron of [...] "revolutionary ideas" [...] and of [...] "the Jews" [...] Aderca, Camil Baltazar, Benjamin Fondane, Ilarie Voronca, this being [...] "the illusion of a literary movement". Papadima campaigned for Aderca and H.

Network Ten writes: [...] "This Freudian Doc always seems to lose out to Brooke {{when it comes to}} matters of the heart. Taylor is as sophisticated and intelligent as they come, always able to analyze the problems of others, and sometimes even her own." [...] The writers wanted Taylor to retain a [...] "pristine" [...] and [...] "well-mannered" [...] personality, according to Tylo, to contrast her from rival Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) who was [...] "feisty and reckless", the different facets which attracted Ridge to each of them. Tylo criticized a storyline in 2000 where Ridge is tricked into sleeping with his mentally unstable high school lover Morgan DeWitt (Sarah G. Buxton), who becomes pregnant with his child.
