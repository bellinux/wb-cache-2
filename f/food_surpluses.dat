5|$|The {{population}} of China {{doubled in size}} during the 10th and 11th centuries. This growth {{was made possible by}} expanded rice cultivation in central and southern Song, the use of early-ripening rice from south-east and southern Asia, and the production of widespread <b>food</b> <b>surpluses.</b> The Northern Song census recorded a {{population of}} roughly 50 million, much like the Han and Tang dynasties. This data is found in the Standard Histories. However, it is estimated that the Northern Song had a population of some 100 million people, and 200 million {{by the time of the}} Ming dynasty. This dramatic increase of population fomented an economic revolution in pre-modern China. The expansion of the population, growth of cities, and the emergence of a national economy led to the gradual withdrawal of the central government from direct involvement in economic affairs. The lower gentry assumed a larger role in grassroots administration and local affairs. Appointed officials in county and provincial centers relied upon the scholarly gentry for their services, sponsorship, and local supervision.|$|E
25|$|Farming {{permitted}} far denser populations, {{which in}} time organized into states. Agriculture also created <b>food</b> <b>surpluses</b> that could support people not directly engaged in food production. The development of agriculture permitted {{the creation of}} the first cities. These were centres of trade, manufacturing and political power. Cities established a symbiosis with their surrounding countrysides, absorbing agricultural products and providing, in return, manufactured goods and varying degrees of military control and protection.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with the}} Rhodesias, Nyasaland in the 1940s lacked a {{developed}} system for producing and distributing <b>food</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Its estates did not grow food commercially for local consumption, as towns were few and small and transport was limited and expensive. It {{was left to}} the African smallholders to supply the domestic markets. Commercial maize growing in Malawi was not feasible without government support. Its Maize Control Board did little to promote smallholder maize growing and it aimed to market less than 5% of the estimated annual crop.|$|E
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{difficulty with}} Childe's {{theory is that}} agriculture does not automatically create a <b>food</b> <b>surplus.</b> We know this because many agricultural {{peoples of the world}} produce no such surplus. Virtually all Amazonian Indians, for example, were agricultural, but in aboriginal times they did not produce a <b>food</b> <b>surplus.</b> That it was technically feasible for them to produce such a surplus is shown by the fact that, under the stimulus of European settlers' desire for food, a number of tribes did raise manioc in amounts well above their own needs, for the purpose of trading. Thus the technical means for generating a <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> were there; it was the social mechanisms needed to actualize it that were lacking.|$|R

40|$|For {{many years}} {{the problem of}} food {{security}} has been addressed only in relation to developing countries, {{due to the fact}} that people in developed nations had a relatively abundant supply of food. This is not anymore true both because of the economic crisis and an increasing demand of food at the global level. Therefore, <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> in the <b>food</b> chain both at the production level and at household consumption could become a resource. In this respect, legal rules (e. g., the Good Samaritan Act in the United States) may provide incentives to economic agents for recovering <b>food</b> <b>surplus.</b> This paper examines in a comparative way legal remedies provided by United States and European Union to address <b>food</b> <b>surplus.</b> Some suggestions are provided to further improve the systems as well...|$|R
25|$|Wheat {{is widely}} {{cultivated}} as a cash crop because {{it produces a}} good yield per unit area, grows well in a temperate climate even with a moderately short growing season, and yields a versatile, high-quality flour that is widely used in baking. Most breads are made with wheat flour, including many breads named for the other grains they contain, for example, most rye and oat breads. The popularity of foods made from wheat flour creates a large demand for the grain, even in economies with significant <b>food</b> <b>surpluses.</b>|$|E
25|$|Agriculture is the {{cultivation}} and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants {{and other products}} used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development {{in the rise of}} sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created <b>food</b> <b>surpluses</b> that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural method.|$|E

The first recipient was Mabel McFiggin of Rochester, New York; the first retailer to redeem the stamps was Joseph Mutolo; and the first retailer caught violating program rules was Nick Salzano in October 1939. The program ended when the conditions that brought the program into being (unmarketable <b>food</b> <b>surpluses</b> and widespread unemployment) ceased to exist.|$|E

Current approaches to the topic – variously illustrated by the papers brought together in this special issue – not only question traditional approaches to <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> as a simple causal vector in social change (e. g. towards ‘complexity’); they also make the case that understanding how societies addressed common problems of shortage and abundance, climatic uncertainty and power relations in the past should inform discussion of future food security...|$|R
50|$|Class {{structures}} {{existed in}} a simplified form in pre-agricultural societies, but {{became much more}} complex and established following the establishment of permanent agriculture-based civilizations with a <b>food</b> <b>surplus.</b> Classism started to be practiced around the 18th century.|$|R
25|$|The {{first step}} towards civilization is {{the move from}} nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} to rooted agrarian society. Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: access to high-carbohydrate vegetation that endures storage; a climate dry enough to allow storage; and access to animals docile enough for domestication and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of crops and livestock leads to <b>food</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Surpluses free people to specialize in activities other than sustenance and support population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technologic innovations which build on each other. Large societies develop ruling classes and supporting bureaucracies, which in turn lead to the organization of nation-states and empires.|$|E
25|$|In Bangladesh, poor {{socioeconomic}} {{position was}} associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk, meat, poultry, and fruits. As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology, the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living {{in the developing world}} live in countries that produce <b>food</b> <b>surpluses.</b> The economist Amartya Sen observed that, in recent decades, famine has always been a problem of food distribution and/or poverty, as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world. He states that malnutrition and famine were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{view is that}} agricultural {{food production}} supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies {{led to the development}} of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. <b>Food</b> <b>surpluses</b> made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making. Jared Diamond (in The World Until Yesterday) identifies the availability of milk and/or cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) child and a younger child concurrently, whereas this was not possible previously. The result is that a population can significantly more-rapidly increase its size than would otherwise be the case, resources permitting.|$|E
40|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{scale of}} food waste in global food supply chains is attracting increasing attention {{due to its}} environmental, social and economic impacts. Drawing on interviews with food waste specialists, this study construes the boundaries between <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> and <b>food</b> waste, avoidable and unavoidable food waste, and between waste prevention and waste management. This study suggests that the first step towards a more sustainable resolution of the food waste issue is to adopt a sustainable production and consumption approach and tackle <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> and waste throughout the global food supply chain. The authors examine the factors {{that give rise to}} food waste throughout the food supply chain, and propose a framework to identify and prioritize the most appropriate options for prevention and management of food waste. The proposed framework interprets and applies the waste hierarchy in the context of food waste. It considers the three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, economic, and social), offering a more holistic approach in addressing food waste. Additionally, it considers the materiality and temporality of food. The food waste hierarchy posits that prevention, through minimization of <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> and avoidable <b>food</b> waste, is the most attractive option. The second most attractive option involves the distribution of <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> to groups affected by food poverty, followed by the option of converting food waste to animal feed. Although the proposed food waste hierarchy requires a fundamental re-think of the current practices and systems in place, {{it has the potential to}} deliver substantial environmental, social and economic benefits. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Food {{waste is}} a global problem with {{significant}} economic and environmental consequences. Food waste management approaches include production of biogas, animal feed and compost and <b>surplus</b> <b>food</b> redistribution. From a sustainability point of view, <b>surplus</b> <b>food</b> redistribution is the most favorable approach. <b>Surplus</b> <b>food</b> redistribution can be either direct (between suppliers of <b>surplus</b> <b>food</b> and charity food services) or indirect (Through Food banks). This paper is a case study on direct <b>surplus</b> <b>food</b> redistribution in ten cities in Norway. The study explores the logistics, embedded social relationships and volume of <b>surplus</b> <b>food</b> redistributed through charity food services. The {{results show that the}} logistics of direct redistribution in the cities included in this study are complex, efficient and formal. Direct <b>surplus</b> <b>food</b> redistribution in Norway is heavily dependent on the workforce of volunteers and personal relationships among the participating actors. Every day 3500 meals are made with ingredients from direct redistribution in the ten cities included in the study. In conclusion, the study suggest that current <b>surplus</b> <b>food</b> redistribution in the cities included in this study make a significant contribution to food waste reduction and <b>surplus</b> <b>food</b> redistribution should be considered as a strategy to reduce food waste.

40|$|In recent years, a {{wide range}} of {{organizations}} in developed countries have embarked on efforts to address the economic, environmental and social impacts of "food waste. " Based on more than 120 interviews and complementary observations in the United States and France, this paper examines how recent mobilizations impact the way <b>surplus</b> <b>food</b> is actually managed with respect to sustainable production and consumption (SPC). The analysis of multiple stakeholders' interests and motives complements a growing literature on food waste prevention and management focused on technical evaluations of "solutions. " Recent frameworks on <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> and waste establish one hierarchy of preferable categories of solutions: first, prevention (reducing surplus at the source), then recovery (reusing for human consumption) and finally recycling (feeding animals, creating energy or compost). Fieldwork results show that actors with different interests in food commodity chains actually develop competing solutions, both within and between three hierarchies based on environmental, social and economic goals. In the long term, the solutions they promote may therefore not achieve "win-win-win" benefits for all actors and at all scales. Drawing on a distinction between "weak" and "strong" sustainability, this paper argues that "strong" prevention based on holistic changes in the food system is the most sustainable solution to <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> and waste. It suggests that academics focus on strong <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> prevention, but also that advocates encourage government and corporate actors to differentiate between weak and strong actions to diffuse strong sustainability across organizations and countries...|$|R
25|$|Throughout the 1790s, {{the area}} near St. Louis {{expanded}} as small farmers sold their lands to the Cerres, Gratiots, Soulards, or Chouteaus in St. Louis. These farmers moved to outlying towns founded after St. Louis, including Carondelet (originally called Delor's Village or Vide Poche), {{which was founded}} in 1767 by an ex-naval officer near the mouth of the River Des Peres. The village in 1796 had 181 residents, and it normally produced <b>food</b> <b>surpluses</b> for the area. Another of the area villages was St. Charles, which was founded on the north bank of the Missouri about 20 miles northwest of St. Louis. Its population in 1800 was roughly 600.

50|$|All civilizations have {{depended}} on agriculture for subsistence. Grain farms {{can result in}} accumulated storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial fertilization, irrigation and crop rotation. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare. Grain surpluses have been especially important {{because they can be}} stored for a long time. A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides produce food for a living: early civilizations included soldiers, artisans, priests and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to <b>food</b> <b>surpluses,</b> such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and perhaps during the Mesolithic Natufian culture.
