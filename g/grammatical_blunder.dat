5000|$|Kipling's major {{work was}} Codex Theodori Bezæ Cantabrigiensis, Evangelia et Apostolorum Acta complectens, quadratis literis, Græco-Latinus. Academia auspicante venerandæ has vetustatis reliquias, summa qua potuit fide, adumbravit, expressit, edidit, Codicis historiam præfixit, notasque adjecit T. Kipling, Greek and Latin, 2 pts., Cambridge, 1793, printed at the {{university}} press. The impression was limited to 250 copies. This edition of the Codex Bezæ used types resembling the uncial characters of the original manuscript. It was criticised in the Monthly Review, new ser. xii. 241-6, and by Richard Porson in two notices in the British Critic, vol. iii. (1794); and the preface was attacked in a pamphlet entitled Remarks on Dr. Kipling's Preface to Beza. Part the first (London, 1793), by Thomas Edwards the vicar of Histon (no second part appeared). Errors in this edition and the bad latinity of the preface were mercilessly censured, {{so that in the}} slang of the university a [...] "Kiplingism" [...] came to be synonymous with a <b>grammatical</b> <b>blunder.</b> George Horne remarked that Kipling's work, although imperfect, was unfairly underrated. Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener, in the preface to his own edition of the Bezæ Codex Cantabrigiensis (Cambridge, 1864) defended Kipling's textual work, but not his adopted forms.|$|E
