The pattern in which this precipitation returns to its source in oceans and lakes is dependent upon many inter-related factors affecting both the precipitation and the physical route of return.

We evaluated the usefulness of soil penetration resistance, easily measured by a dynamic cone penetrometer, together with measurements of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> level fluctuations, as a cost-effective means to infer subsurface flow patterns. At our field site at Sleepers River, Vermont, penetration resistance was lowest in the surficial 10 to 30 cm, then typically increased to a local maximum at 60 to 80 cm, which we interpreted as the soil/till interface. Below this depth usually lies a zone of decreased resistance in the till, giving way to either a gradual or abrupt increase in resistance toward the bedrock surface at 1 to 4. 5 m depth. Penetration resistance had a weak but significant negative correlation with saturated hydraulic conductivity determined by bail tests (r 2 = 0. 25, p < 0. 05). At many wells, monthly <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> levels tended to cluster at or just above the resistant zone near the soil/till interface.

Pantano fault constitutes a line of hydrogeologic separation between the occurrence and utilization of groundwater in the Rincon Valley and the main Tucson basin. No known, comparable fault isolates the upper Tanque Verde Creek alluvium from downstream pumping effects. However, east of the confluence with Agua Caliente Wash, the highly permeable alluvial materials are much thinner, and serve to dampen such downstream effects. Therefore, the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> supporting the riparian areas within Rincon Mountain District are not directly connected to the Tucson basin aquifer.

These hydraulic parameters are best determined by calibration of these models. Collection of reliable data from heavily pumped <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> can be problematic. Another way to infer these hydraulic parameters is the simultaneous interpretation of different parts of a multiple pumping test using an inverse numerical model. Here, the drawdowns observed in the indirectly pumped aquifers allow us to deduce the vertical conductivities of the aquitards with an equivalent accuracy as the horizontal conductivities of the aquifers, When the hydraulic resistances of the aquitards are too large, it becomes impossible to induce observable drawdowns in the indirectly pumped aquifers, and the inverse model loses valuable input data. Observing vertical gradients in and over the aquitards in case of important vertical now can make up for this loss. These data allow us to estimate the specific discharges through the successive parts of the aquitard and hence their hydraulic resistances, This useful information allows us to consider all these hydraulic resistances in one group of hydraulic parameters during the simultaneous interpretation of the multiple pumping test using an inverse numerical model.

There has been a quantum jump in population during the last century without corresponding expansion of civic facilities resulting in deterioration of lakes and reservoirs, especially in urban and semi urban areas becoming sinks for the contaminants. The degradation of reservoir and lake catchments due to deforestation, stone quarrying, sand mining, extensive agricultural use, consequent erosion and increased silt flows have vitiated the quality of <b>water</b> stored in <b>reservoirs</b> and lakes. Infrastructure development, housing projects, and inflow of untreated wastewater into the water bodies have resulted in deterioration of urban and rural lakes and reservoirs. The paper discusses the physico-chemical and bacteriological studies carried out on surface and <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> in the <b>reservoir</b> catchment and the command areas. The results of analyses of water samples reveal that water is polluted at certain locations. The presence of total –Coliform and Faecal-Coliform in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> and <b>reservoir</b> and lake <b>water</b> at certain locations indicates that water is polluted with waste water. The nitrate level varies between 0. 6 ppm to 135. 8 ppm, and exceeds the drinking water standards at 10 locations in the catchment and command area. The suitability of water for irrigation is evaluated based on SAR, %Na, RSC and Salinity hazards. Most of the samples fall in the suitable range for irrigation purpose. The inflow of urban runoff into the surface water bodies has resulted in pollution of <b>reservoir</b> and <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> at certain locations. The paper also discusses the measures proposed to reduce pollution levels in the reservoir, its catchment and command area...|$|R
5000|$|Wetland {{hydrology}} {{is associated}} with the spatial and temporal dispersion, flow, and physio-chemical attributes of surface and <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> in its <b>reservoirs.</b> Based on hydrology, wetlands can be categorized as riverine (associated with streams), [...] (associated with lakes and reservoirs), and palustrine (isolated). Sources of hydrological flows into wetlands are predominantly precipitation, surface water, and groundwater. Water flows out of wetlands by evapotranspiration, surface runoff, and subsurface water outflow. Hydrodynamics (the movement of water through and from a wetland) affects hydro-periods (temporal fluctuations in water levels) by controlling the water balance and water storage within a wetland.|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is directed}} at developing a set of methodological tools for characterizing the protection and yield of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> In each method, geophysical observations are used for supplementing data from traditional measurements (e. g., well logs, specific capacity and pumping tests), and geostatistics, specifically cokriging and compound kriging for combining the different source of information. The manuscript is divided into four main sections. The first part describes a method for characterizing aquifer protective properties (e. g. thickness and continuity) of subsurface layers with low hydraulic conductivity. Data estimated from wells and derived from electrical resistivity measurements are used to map the thickness of a protective clay layer using cokriging. The second section presents a procedure for evaluating wellhead protection zones for existing wells by mapping the corresponding travel times. Travel times are calculated assuming a fixed protection zone around each well. In the third section, a methodology is developed for delineating areas for new wells where the yield for the wells {{and the effectiveness of}} protection zones around the wells are jointly considered criteria. The method has been developed for leaky aquifer settings and the effectiveness of a protection zone is characterized by the corresponding travel time. The 2 ̆ 7 best 2 ̆ 7 well locations are determined using composite programming, a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique. Section four presents an approach to observation network design for selecting the most appropriate location for water supply wells over an area. The method considers measurement network alternatives combining wells and geoelectric measurements. The best observation network is selected by jointly considering the estimation error and cost for each candidate network in a MCDM analysis. Each method is illustrated through examples using real data. ...|$|R

40|$|Tamil Nadu {{experiences}} recurrent droughts. Tamil literature {{also indicates}} that famine-like conditions prevailed during the Pandiyan Kingdom for nearly 12 years. The state normally benefits from northeast monsoon rainfall from October to December, unlike other regions of India, which are dominated by southwest monsoon rainfall. In general, four major parameters determine {{the nature and extent}} of drought conditions in Tamil Nadu: (1) rainfall, (2) <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> (3) <b>reservoir</b> levels, and (4) crop conditions. It is estimated that nearly 50 % of the districts in the state are drought-prone. The state receives nearly 80 % of its annual rainfall during the northeast monsoon, whereas it experienced below-normal rainfall in the southwest monsoon for 30 % of the years in the last 25 years. During the southwest monsoon period, water demand always exceeds rainfall, but the water deficit is quite low in the northeast monsoon period. Hence, due to severe water deficit, drought recurs during the southwest monsoon and also in summer months in Tamil Nadu...|$|R
40|$|Soil pH {{gradient}} is {{an indicator}} of microorganisms and bacteria population in root zones with effects on the growth of plants, such as grapevine (Fernandez-Calviño, 2010). The pH gradient analysis {{can be used to}} determine management strategies – root development and soil quality - to reach the most suitable balance for a specific vineyard. Custom built management strategies lead to high vineyard productivity and avoid undesirable environmental impacts caused by surplus-nutrient runoff into streams, <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and the micro-fauna population. However, the pH gradient in agricultural soil varies in a spatialtemporal way, making its studies difficult and timeconsuming. Given this scenario, the interpolation techniques have been used to build spatial maps of soil attributes by sampled locations values. Such spatial maps give the soil condition of whole agricultural field, allowing the estimation of non-sampled locations values. A common methodology of spatial interpolation is the kriging, a popular statistical method that is grounded within the geostatistics field. Exemplifying, the Figure 1 shows the 2 D maps of soil macronutrients spatial variability analyzed by kriging method (Cruvinel, 1999). The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the spatial variability of pH gradient in soil based on the use of geostatistical mapping obtained by pH measurements and semi-variogram models. For the analysis of the pH gradient, the soil samples were collected in 58 points considering three different horizons:~ 5 - 15 cm, ~ 15 - 25 cm, and ~ 25 - 35 cm depths. To minimize error the soil pH gradient analyses were duplicated in the vineyard soils and at laboratory. The preliminary results have shown the existence of a significant pH gradient with values in the top layers of soil lower than the bottom layers. Therefore the pH level from top layers was more acid than the bottom ones. This study is part of “Enometrica Project”, which is an ongoing research project on micro-climate monitoring and modelling in vineyards and orchards to positively influence crop management and resulting quality production...|$|R
40|$|Journal article"Spatially {{disaggregated}} {{estimates of}} over 131 streamflow, <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> and <b>reservoir</b> evaporation monthly time series in California {{have been created}} for 12 different climate warming scenarios for a 72 -year period. Such disaggregated hydrologic estimates of multiple hydrologic cycle components are important for impact and adaptation studies of California's water system. A statewide trend of increased winter and spring runoff and decreased summer runoff is identified. Without operations modeling, approximate changes in water availability are estimated for each scenario. Even most scenarios with increased precipitation result in less available water because of the current storage systems' inability to catch increased winter streamflow in compensation for reduced summer runoff. The water availability changes are then compared with estimated changes in urban and agricultural water uses in California between now and 2100. The methods {{used in this study}} are relatively simple, but the results are qualitatively consistent with other studies focusing on the hydrologies of single basins or surface water alone.
