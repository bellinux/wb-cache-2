25|$|Werfel {{planned a}} novel about a fictional Catholic saint's life in late seventeenth-century Venice titled Legends, with various subtitles: The Intercessoress of Animals, of Snakes, and of the Dead. Much of the {{research}} <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> would eventually inform The Song of Bernadette (1942), a novel he dedicated to Manon but also features elements of her character and appearance in both the character Bernadette and the apparition of the Blessed Virgin, which she calls the Lady in White {{as well as being}} a pagan term related to the Weisse Frauen of German folklore. Werfel also wrote a necrology about Manon's life for the Catholic journal Commonweal to explain the significance of his dedication, something he never did for other books. Other Werfel novels also feature characters modeled on Manon, notably the prophet Jeremiah's Egyptian bride-to-be in Hearken unto the Voice (1937) and the Bride in Werfel's last novel, Star of the Unborn (1946). Manon Gropius is also a minor character in the 2001 novel The Artist's Wife by Max Phillips, which is based on the life of Alma Mahler.|$|E
