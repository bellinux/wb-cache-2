5|$|Flight Unlimited III is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) flight simulator video game, {{in which the}} player pilots virtual reproductions of real-world planes. Players may control ten aircraft: the Lake Turbo Renegade, Stemme S10, Mooney Bravo, Fokker Dr.I, Beechjet 400A and five planes first included in Flight Unlimited II. Plane cockpits feature simulated flight instruments such as variometers and primary flight displays, and allow for both visual and <b>instrument</b> <b>navigation.</b> The main airspace is 10,000 square miles of Seattle terrain; eight other Western American states are modeled as well, albeit in less detail. The California scenery from Flight Unlimited II may be imported to expand the airspace. The player shares the game's skies with artificially intelligent (AI) planes. Real-time, interactive air traffic control monitors the player's actions and tries to prevent mid-air collisions. Before a flight, the player may select which types of weather to encounter. Weather conditions such as cold fronts and thunderstorms develop in real-time.|$|E
500|$|By December 1939, Johnson {{began his}} initial {{training}} at 22 EFTS (Elementary Flying Training School), Cambridge. He flew {{only three times}} in December 1939 and eight in January 1940, all as second pilot. On 29 February 1940, Johnson flew solo {{for the first time}} in Tiger Moth N6635. On 15 March and 24 April, his passed a 50-minute flight test followed by two night flights the following day. The chief flying instructor passed him on 6 May. He then moved to 5 FTS at Sealand before completing training at 7 OTU (Operational Training Unit) – RAF Hawarden in Wales flying the Miles Master N7454 where he earned his <b>instrument,</b> <b>navigation,</b> night-flying ratings and practised forced landings. After training was complete on 7 August 1940, Johnson received his [...] "wings" [...] and was immediately inducted into the General Duties Branch of the RAF as a pilot officer with 55 hours and 5 minutes solo flying.|$|E

5000|$|A pilot {{claimed that}} the {{aircraft}} involved in the accident, CN235, was an easy-to-control plane and well equipped.

If one of the indicators malfunctioned, a backup indicator could be used by the pilots.|$|E
5000|$|The term is {{originally}} from a 1930s airplane <b>instrument</b> <b>navigation</b> system, the AN (or [...] "four-course") range. Flying along {{the range and}} listening to the signal, the pilot knew he was over the transmitter and therefore at the only uniquely knowable point when the sound died. This region over the transmitter was known as the [...] "cone of silence." [...] This inverted instrument, signaling as it did the desired point by loss of sound, may have been Brooks' inspiration for the comic effect.|$|E

5000|$|Brownsville was {{historically}} {{the main}} terminal for air service between the United States and Mexico. In 1929, Pan American World Airways acquired a controlling stake in Mexicana de Aviación and began Ford Trimotor service between Brownsville and Mexico City, which was eventually {{extended to the}} Yucatan Peninsula to connect with Pan Am's Caribbean route network. On March 9, Charles Lindbergh inaugurated this service, landing at BRO after a five-hour, 38-minute flight from Mexico City. An event was held on site in Lindbergh's honor, with a crowd of over 20,000 greeting him upon his arrival. Among the attendees was Amelia Earhart, for whom the main {{street in front of}} the Airport is named. Brownsville became an early center for technical development in <b>instrument</b> <b>navigation</b> ("blind flying") due to the bad weather conditions that pilots encountered in the mountains over Mexico.|$|E

50|$|Normally, the Benghazi-Cairo route {{was flown}} eastwards along the Libyan coast until {{reaching}} {{the city of}} Sidi Barrani in Egypt, where the airway turned inland to the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) and Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) area located west of Lake Qarun. The entry to the Cairo terminal area was made on a north-easterly heading over a 71 NM km long path that separated Lake Qarun from the Cairo VOR. At 13:45 the Cairo traffic control (CTC) saw the aircraft approaching from the west. Permission was granted to land in runway 23. CTC saw the Boeing heading eastward towards the Suez Canal at 13:50. The crew was forced to rely on <b>instrument</b> <b>navigation</b> because of a sandstorm. Both instrument and navigational error caused the aircraft to go off course, entering airspace dominated by Israel when flying over the Sinai Peninsula. By this time the aircraft had been lost from the Egyptian air traffic control. The crew believed they were close to the destination airport and started the descent.|$|E
