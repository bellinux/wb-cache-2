40|$|Block {{failure is}} {{considered}} to be an important component of coastal retreat in permafrost regions. A comprehensive model is developed to study the effects of thermoerosional niche and <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> morphology on the stability of permafrost dominated coastal cliff against block failure. The model is formulated by coupling slope stability analysis with a time dependent progression of thermoerosional niches and the morphology of the nearby <b>ice</b> <b>wedges.</b> Model computations are initially performed for failure conditions for a given cliff height, frozen soil strength, ice content, water pressure in the active layer, thermoerosional niche depth and <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> morphology. Under these conditions block failures are found to be predominantly overturning failures and are governed by the tensile strength of frozen soil, thermoerosional niche depth and <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> location and depth. The effects of <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> are then examined by analyzing failure conditions for <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> of different locations and depths. For a given cliff height, strength and thermoerosional niche, block failure may occur at a range of different combinations of <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> locations and depths. Two stability nomograms are developed through repeated model calculations for range of cliff heights and frozen soil tensile strength. These nomograms can be used to determine the critical combinations of thermoerosional niche depth, <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> distance and <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> depth that lead to block collapse of a cliff of known height and soil strength. Some analytical expressions are also derived to determine potential block failure criteria along Arctic coasts. 海岸のブロック崩壊は、永久凍土地域における海岸侵食の重要なメカニズムの一つである。永久凍土からなる海岸壁のブロック崩壊に対する安定性と融解侵食ニッチおよびアイスウェッジの形態との関係を調べる包括的なモデルが開発された。このモデルは、斜面安定解析を融解侵食ニッチの発達と隣接するアイスウェッジの形態をカップリングさせて定式化された。はじめに、決められた海岸壁高、凍土強度、含氷率、活動層中の静水圧、融解侵食ニッチの奥行きおよびアイスウェッジの形態のもと、ブロック崩壊の条件についてモデル計算された。これらの条件下でのブロック崩壊の種類は主に転倒破壊で、凍土の引張強度、融解侵食ニッチの奥行き、アイスウェッジの位置と到達深度によって支配されていることがわかった。アイスウェッジの形態による影響は、その位置と到達深度の組み合わせを変えて破壊条件を解析して調べられた。決められた海岸壁高、凍土強度、融解侵食ニッチの奥行きの条件下では、アイスウェッジ位置と到達深度の組み合わせがある範囲にある場合にブロック崩壊が起こる。海岸壁高と凍土の引張強度がある範囲にある場合についてのモデル計算結果から、２つの安定性ノモグラムを作成した。これらのノモグラムを用いると、ブロック崩壊を引き起こす融解侵食ニッチの奥行き、アイスウェッジ位置と到達深度の組み合わせを決定することができる。北極海岸において、起こりうるブロック崩壊の条件を求めるいくつかの解析的数式についても導入された...|$|R

50|$|Active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> {{are those}} that are still {{evolving}} and growing. During each year, a layer of ice will be added if cracking occurs, but cracking need not occur every year to be considered active.

50|$|An <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> is a {{crack in}} the ground formed by a narrow or thin piece of ice that {{measures}} up to 3-4 meters in length at ground level and extends downwards into the ground up to several meters. During the winter months, the water in the ground freezes and expands. Once temperatures reach −17 degrees Celsius or lower, the ice that has already formed acts like a solid and expands to form cracks in the surface known as <b>ice</b> <b>wedges.</b> As this process continues over many years <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> can grow, up {{to the size of a}} swimming pool. <b>Ice</b> <b>wedges</b> usually appear in a polygonal pattern known as <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> polygons.

50|$|Erosion {{continues}} to sculpt the canyon walls, creating natural arches and other rock formations.

Mass wasting, often caused by <b>ice</b> <b>wedging</b> into cracks in the canyon walls, is another force that widens the valley. The Navajo Sandstone formation is easily eroded and {{is known to be}} very porous. Unstable geology is prevalent throughout the canyon, and occasional rockslides have formed impounded lakes in the canyon, the most recent of which was roughly 4,000 years ago. Owing to the extreme depth of the canyon, there are many springs fed by the surrounding groundwater, permitting water in the canyon to run year round.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation for}} frost weathering was volumetric expansion of freezing water. When water freezes to ice, its volume increases by nine percent. Under specific circumstances, this expansion {{is able to}} displace or fracture rock. At a temperature of -22 °C, ice growth {{is known to be}} able to generate pressures of up to 207MPa, more than enough to fracture any rock. For frost weathering to occur by volumetric expansion, the rock must have almost no air that can be compressed to compensate for the expansion of ice, which means it has to be water-saturated and frozen quickly from all sides so that the water does not migrate away and the pressure is exerted on the rock. These conditions are considered unusual, restricting it to a process of importance within a few centimeters of a rock's surface and on larger existing water-filled joints in a process called <b>ice</b> <b>wedging.</b>|$|E
50|$|Frost weathering, frost wedging, <b>ice</b> <b>wedging</b> or cryofracturing is the {{collective}} name for several processes where ice is present. These processes include frost shattering, frost-wedging and freeze-thaw weathering. Severe frost shattering produces huge piles of rock fragments called scree {{which may be}} located {{at the foot of}} mountain areas or along slopes. Frost weathering is common in mountain areas where the temperature is around the freezing point of water. Certain frost-susceptible soils expand or heave upon freezing as a result of water migrating via capillary action to grow ice lenses near the freezing front. This same phenomenon occurs within pore spaces of rocks. The ice accumulations grow larger as they attract liquid water from the surrounding pores. The ice crystal growth weakens the rocks which, in time, break up. It is caused by the approximately 10% (9.87) expansion of ice when water freezes, which can place considerable stress on anything containing the water as it freezes.|$|E

50|$|Ice has 10 percent greater volume than water, so it {{continues}} to exert pressure on the ground. Thermal expansion and contraction can cause cracks to develop in the permafrost.

The first four parameters, RQD (rock quality designation), Jn (joint set number), Jr (joint roughness number) and Ja (joint alteration number) are the same as in the Q-system. However, the frictional resistance pair Jr and Ja can apply, when needed, to individual sides of a potentially unstable wedges. Simply applied orientation factors (0), like (Jr/Ja)1x0.7 for set J1 and (Jr/Ja)2x0.9 for set J2, provide estimates of overall whole-wedge frictional resistance reduction, if appropriate. The Q-system term Jw is replaced with Jwice, and takes into account a wider range of environmental conditions appropriate to rock slopes, which are exposed to the environment indefinitely. The conditions include the extremes of erosive intense rainfall, <b>ice</b> <b>wedging,</b> as may seasonally occur at opposite ends of the rock-type and regional spectrum.

50|$|There {{are also}} {{disadvantages}} for stone veneer compared to natural stone: It {{is not as}} strong as natural stone; if a piece breaks, or if a piece is removed from the wall, then unless it is replaced, it shows significantly; it is not reusable as natural stones are. Furthermore, manufactured stone veneer has a larger waste factor than natural stone.Natural stone can be chipped, cut, and shaped to any size needed. The cut off pieces can be reused. While manufactured stone veneer can not be cut to fit because it exposes the undesirable inner concrete from which the manufactured stone is made of. The user ends up with areas that require a small cut fill piece that has exposed concrete edges.Also, manufactured stone contains lime nuggets which can leech out and stain the surface over time when exposed to water.Manufactured stone is not a naturally occurring product and, due to its cast origin and painted exterior, it is subject to color changes caused by exposure to the UV in sunlight and moisture. Manufactured stone is a porous product. It absorbs much more water than real stone and it will transfer the moisture through to the wall of the structure causing many of the same issues seen with improperly installed stucco. Being a porous product manufactured stone is subjected to <b>ice</b> <b>wedging</b> and freeze thaw problems. As water seeps into the manufactured stone and then freezes, chunks of the face will pop off leaving a rugged edge which looks similar {{to the edge of a}} broken sidewalk. Repair can be expensive as the entire piece of stone must be cut out and replaced. The repair also doesn’t stop the issue from re-occurring.|$|E

The results obtained by this study on the Ice Complex, a peculiar periglacial phenomenon, allowed the reconstruction of the climate history with a subdivision of a period of very cold winters (60 - 55 ka), followed by a long stable period of cold winter temperatures (50 - 24 ka), Between 20 ka and 11 ka, climate warming is indicated in stable isotope compositions, most probably after the Late Glacial Maximum. At that time, a change of the marine source of the precipitation from a more humid source to the present North AtIantic source region was assumed.

40|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>wedges</b> are {{the most}} {{abundant}} type of ground ice in the ice-rich permafrost deposits of the Northeast Siberian Arctic. They are formed by the periodic repetition of frost cracking and subsequent crack filling in spring, mostly by melt water of winter snow. <b>Ices</b> <b>wedges</b> can be studied by means of stable-water isotopes. Their isotopic composition is directly linked to atmospheric precipitation (i. e. winter snow) and, therefore, indicative of past winter climate conditions even though also genetic aspects, i. e. sublimation, melting and refreezing in the snowpack and the frost crack, {{have to be taken}} into account. Here we present stable-water isotope data of <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> at the Oyogos Yar coast of the Dmitry Laptev Strait (72. 7 °N, 143. 5 °E). The <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> from different stratigraphic units comprising pre-Eemian sediments, Middle Weichselian Ice Complex (Yedoma) sediments and Holocene themokarst (Alas) sediments were studied and sampled in 2002 and 2007. Stable-water isotopes were measured in the stable-isotope lab of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Potsdam, Germany. <b>Ice</b> <b>wedge</b> stable-water isotope data indicate substantial variations in Northeast Siberian Arctic winter climate conditions (δ 18 O) as well as shifts in the moisture generation and transport patterns (d excess) during the Late Quaternary, in particular between Glacial and Interglacial but also during the last centuries. <b>Ice</b> <b>wedges</b> of the pre-Eemian Kuchchugui and Bychchaguy Suites exhibit mean δ 18 O values of about - 30 ‰ and - 34 ‰, respectively, indicating cold to extreme cold winter temperatures. The latter represents the coldest conditions found in <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> at the Oyogos Yar coast. Mean d-excess values are about 3 ‰ and 6 ‰, respectively. Small <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> in Eemian sediments show distinctly warmer mean δ 18 O values of about - 24 ‰ and mean d-excess values of about 4 ‰.

40|$|Pleistocene Yedoma {{permafrost}} contains {{nearly a}} third of all organic matter (OM) stored in circum-arctic permafrost and is characterized by the presence of massive <b>ice</b> <b>wedges.</b> Due to its rapid formation by sediment accumulation and subsequent frozen storage, Yedoma OM is relatively well preserved and highly biologically available (biolabile) upon thaw. A better understanding of the processes regulating Yedoma degradation is important to improve estimates of the response and magnitude of permafrost carbon feedbacks to climate warming. In this study, we examine the composition of <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> and the influence of <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> thaw on the biolability of Yedoma OM. Incubation assays were used to assess OM biolability, fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize the OM composition, and potential enzyme activity rates to examine the controls and regulation of OM degradation.

The physical vulnerability of <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> upon thaw (causing irreversible collapse), combined with the composition of ice wedge-engrained OM (co-metabolizing old OM), underlines the particularly strong potential of Yedoma to generate a positive feedback to climate warming relative to other forms of non-ice wedge permafrost. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{first step}} for the {{application}} of stable isotope analyses of <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> for the correct paleoclimatic reconstruction supposes the study of the isotopic composition of modern <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> and their relationship with the isotopic composition of modern precipitation. The purpose of this research is to present, to analyze and to discuss new data on isotopic composition (d 18 O, dD, 3 H) of modern <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> obtained in the Laptev Sea region in 1998 - 99. Investigations were carried out at two sites: on Bykovsky Peninsula in 1998 and on Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island in 1999 and were based on the combined application of both tritium CH) and stable isotope (d 18 O, dD) analyses. Tritium analyses of the atmospheric precipitation collected during two field seasons show seasonal variations: high tritium concentration in snow (to a maximum of 207 TU) and low values of tritium concentration (< 20 TU) in rain. High tritium concentrations are also observed in the surface water, in suprapermafrost ground waters, and in the upper part of permafrost. High tritium concentrations range between 30 - 40 TU and 750 TU in the studied modern <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> (active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges),</b> which let us believe that they are of modern growth. Such high tritium concentrations in <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> can not be associated with old thermonuclear tritium because of the radioactive decay. High tritium concentrations found in the snow cover in 1998 / 99, in the active layer and in the upper part of permafrost give evidence of modern (probably the last decade) technogenic tritium arrival from the atmosphere on to the Earth surface in the region. The comparison of the isotopic composition (d 18 O, dD and d-excess) of active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> and modern winter precipitation in both sites shows: 1) the isotopic composition of snow correlates linearly with a slope close to 8. 0 and parallel to the GMWL at both sites; 2) the mean isotopic composition of active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> on Bykovsky Peninsula is in good agreement with the mean isotopic composition of modern snow; 3) the isotopic composition of active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> and snow on Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island are considerably different. There are low values of d-excess in all studied active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> (mean value is about 4. 8 per mil), while in snow, the mean value of d-excess is about 9. 5 per mil. Possible reasons for this gap are the following: 1) the modification of the isotopic composition in snow during the spring period; 2) changes in the isotopic composition of <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> due to the process of ice sublimation in open frost cracks during the cold period; 3) mixing of snowmelt water with different types of surface water during the spring period; 4) different moisture source regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of polygonal terrain on Mars underlain by ice heightens {{interest in the}} possibility that this water-bearing habitat may be, or may have been, a suitable habitat for extant life. The possibility {{is supported by the}} recurring detection of terrestrial microorganisms in subsurface ice environments, such as <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> found beneath tundra polygon features. A characterization of the microbial community of <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> from the high Arctic was performed to determine whether this ice environment can sustain actively respiring microorganisms and to assess the ecology of this extreme niche. We found that <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> samples contained a relatively abundant number of culturable cells compared to other ice habitats (? 10 5 CFU 2 ̆ 022 mL - 1). Respiration assays in which radio-labeled acetate and in situ measurement of CO 2 flux were used suggested low levels of microbial activity, though more sensitive techniques are required to confirm these findings. Based on 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, bacterial and archaeal <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> communities appeared to reflect surrounding soil communities. Two Pseudomonas sp. were the most abundant taxa in the <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> bacterial library (? 50...|$|R

40|$|The stable oxygen isotope {{composition}} of Late Holocene syngenetic <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> from the Erkutayakha River valley in the Yamal Peninsula {{and from the}} Adventdalen valley in Svalbard was studied. It was demonstrated that the studied <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> located 2000 km apart were formed during the last 2 - 3. 5 ka and continue to grow at present. Variations of δ 18 O values of the ice of both <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> do not exceed 2 - 3. 5 ‰. Based on the oxygen isotope variations is has been calculated that mean winter air temperatures did not change by more than 3 oC during the Late Holocene...|$|R
