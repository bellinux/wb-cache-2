5|$|Three endings exist. In the first, Maxim, possessed, {{has already}} bitten Lydie. With Maxim's defeat, <b>Juste</b> escapes the {{collapsing}} castle alone and curses {{his inability to}} save either friend. In the second, Maxim struggles against the possession and urges <b>Juste</b> to kill him. In his final moments, he thanks <b>Juste</b> for killing him and reveals that he had wished to save him from his fate as a Belmont. Outside the castle, Lydie awakens, unharmed, and tells <b>Juste</b> not to blame himself for Maxim's death. The third ending begins {{the same as the}} first, except that, during the fight, Maxim notices that <b>Juste</b> wore his bracelet and resists the possession. Dracula flees into a weakened form using the gathered remains and fights <b>Juste,</b> planning to use his blood to return himself to full power. Vanquishing him, <b>Juste</b> escapes the castle together with Maxim and Lydie, whose bite marks disappear by the time she regains consciousness. Outside the castle, the three resolve to return home.|$|E
5|$|<b>Juste</b> meets Maxim at {{a castle}} where Lydie {{is being held}} captive; after a brief talk, he leaves Maxim outside and begins to explore the castle. Within the castle, <b>Juste</b> {{encounters}} Death, who confirms that the castle is Dracula's. He then meets up with a dazed Maxim, whose memory is slowly returning to him, and they split up to cover more ground. While trekking through the castle, <b>Juste</b> notices that the castle sometimes has different atmospheres. He continues to encounter Maxim, but is baffled by how his friend seems to change personalities periodically. Regardless, {{in one of their}} meetings, Maxim reveals that he went on a journey to find and destroy the remains of Dracula, something Simon Belmont had previously done, but when he collected all six, his memory went blank.|$|E

5|$|The narrator, Charles, {{lives with}} his friend <b>Juste</b> in a large boarding-house {{populated}} almost entirely with students like themselves (Charles is studying law and <b>Juste</b> medicine). The sole exception is their middle-aged neighbor, Z. Marcas, of whom they see only momentary glimpses in the hall. They learn {{that he is a}} copyist, and living on an extremely small salary. When the students find themselves lacking the funds for tobacco, Marcas offers them some of his own. They become friends, and he tells them the story of his political career.|$|E
5|$|A few hip-hop dance shows {{appeared}} {{on television in}} the 1990s such as 1991's The Party Machine with Nia Peeples and 1992's The Grind. Several hip-hop dance shows premiered in the 2000s including (but not limited to) Dance Fever, Dance 360, The Wade Robson Project, MTV Dance Crew, America's Best Dance Crew, Dance on Sunset, and Shake It Up. In 2006, MTV France documented {{the creation of a}} dance crew for an original series called MTV Dance Crew. Viewers were able to see the crew from auditions to the selection of the final eight who were subsequently named Original Soul. Original Soul was coached by three professional choreographers who mentored them and helped refine their dancing. Over the course of 32 episodes they routinely participated in professional dance battles including the popping battle at <b>Juste</b> Debout, the Seven 2 Smoke battle at The Notorious IBE, and b-boy battles at Chelles Battle Pro. B-boy Lilou, b-boy crew Phase T, and promoter Bruce Ykanji (the founder of <b>Juste</b> Debout) all made appearances during the show.|$|E

5|$|Harmony of Dissonance {{occurs in}} the fictional {{universe}} of the Castlevania series; {{the premise of the}} series centers on the eternal conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Set fifty years after Simon Belmont vanquished Dracula's curse, Harmony of Dissonance focuses on his grandson <b>Juste</b> Belmont and his quest to rescue a kidnapped childhood friend.|$|E
5|$|On 2 November 2011, Charlie Hebdo was firebombed {{right before}} its 3 November issue was due; {{the issue was}} called Charia Hebdo and satirically {{featured}} Muhammad as guest-editor. The editor, Stéphane Charbonnier, known as Charb, and two co-workers at Charlie Hebdo subsequently received police protection. Charb was placed on a hit list by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula along with Kurt Westergaard, Lars Vilks, Carsten <b>Juste</b> and Flemming Rose after editing an edition of Charlie Hebdo that satirised Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist {{and primary}} player {{character}} is <b>Juste</b> Belmont, {{the grandson of}} Simon Belmont and descendant of Sypha Belnades, who {{at the age of}} sixteen, gained the Vampire Killer whip. Together with his amnesiac and injured best friend Maxim Kischine, he sets off to rescue his kidnapped childhood friend, Lydie Erlanger. While exploring the castle, he encounters a merchant who stumbled upon the castle and Death, Dracula's servant.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, David Harrison {{described}} a small Miniopterus {{from the island}} of Grande Comore as a subspecies, Miniopterus minor griveaudi, of the mainland African species M.minor. The name griveaudi honors Paul Griveaud, who collected the specimens on which Harrison based his description. This classification remained {{for the next few}} decades; in 1992, for example, Javier <b>Juste</b> and Carlos Ibáñez recognized five subspecies, including griveaudi, within M.minor, ranging from São Tomé to Madagascar. In their 1995 review of Madagascar bats, Randolph Peterson and colleagues recognized the small Malagasy Miniopterus as a separate species, Miniopterus manavi, with griveaudi as a subspecies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Juste</b> {{primarily}} attacks {{at close}} quarters using the series' traditional whip weapon, the Vampire Killer. It can be brandished to deflect projectile attacks, reminiscent of Simon Belmont's {{usage of the}} weapon in Super Castlevania IV. A variety of ranged sub-weapons—holy water, a dagger, a holy book, a cross, a gem, an axe, and a thunder gauntlet—are available, one {{of which can be}} carried at any given time and combined with one of the five spell books—Fire Book, Ice Book, Bolt Book, Wind Book, and the Summoning Tome—hidden throughout the castle to create a magical attack. Casting a spell renders the player character invincible for a moment.|$|E
5|$|Additional modes can be {{unlocked}} in the game. For Boss Rush Mode, {{the player}} {{is required to}} complete the game once and can then fight the bosses from the game in order {{with the number of}} bosses depending on the level of difficulty selected. Maxim Mode requires the player to finish the game with the best ending and allows the player to take control of Maxim. Unlike <b>Juste,</b> Maxim cannot equip items and can only use his sword and giant shuriken (sub weapon) as weapons. Maxim also has the ability to triple jump and cast certain spells by inputting certain combinations on the buttons. Finishing with the best ending also unlocks an option to listen to the music of the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{centre of}} the two fleets was divided by two {{separate}} squadrons of the British line: the forward division under admirals Benjamin Caldwell and George Bowyer and the rear under Lord Howe. While Howe in Queen Charlotte was engaging the French closely, his subordinates in the forward division were less active. Instead of moving in on their opposite numbers directly, the forward division sedately closed with the French in line ahead formation, engaging in a long distance duel which did not prevent their opponents from harassing the embattled Defence just ahead of them. Of all the ships in this squadron only HMS Invincible, under Thomas Pakenham, ranged close to the French lines. Invincible was badly damaged by her lone charge but managed to engage the larger <b>Juste.</b> HMS Barfleur under Bowyer did later enter the action, but Bowyer was not present, having lost a leg in the opening exchanges.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} in Korkoro {{are drawn from}} Sigot's anecdote. The film traces the Romani familias life during the war, from their disbelief at being forbidden to travel but also being rejected by others when they stay in one place, to their arrest, incarceration, liberation {{with the help of}} a local French mayor and a notary, their struggle to live in a non-nomadic way, and then final arrest before being sent to the Death Camps. The character Théodore Rosier is based on the notary in the anecdote. The other <b>Juste</b> character, Lise Lundi, is based on Yvette Lundy and an old teacher of Gatlif's from Belcourt in Algeria who was a communist and an aide with the Front de Libération Nationale (National Liberation Front).|$|E
5|$|Dismasted, Defence {{was unable}} to hold any of her various opponents to a {{protracted}} duel, and by 13:00 was threatened by the damaged Républicain moving from the east. Although Républicain later hauled off to join Villaret to the north, Gambier requested support for his ship from the fleet's frigates and was aided by HMS Phaeton under Captain William Bentinck. As Impétueux passed she fired on Phaeton, to which Bentinck responded with several broadsides of his own. Invincible, the only ship of the forward division of the British centre to engage the enemy closely, became embroiled in the confusion surrounding Queen Charlotte. Invincible's guns drove <b>Juste</b> onto the broadside of Queen Charlotte, where {{she was forced to}} surrender to Lieutenant Henry Blackwood in a boat from Invincible. Among the other ships of the division there were only minor casualties, although HMS Impregnable lost several yards and was only brought back into line by the quick reactions of two junior officers, Lieutenant Robert Otway and Midshipman Charles Dashwood.|$|E

25|$|Haiti elected its National Assembly in May 1946. The Assembly set 16 August 1946, as {{the date}} on which it would select a president. The leading {{candidates}} for the office—all of whom were black—were Dumarsais Estimé, a former school teacher, assembly member, and cabinet minister under Vincent; Félix d'Orléans <b>Juste</b> Constant, leader of the Haitian Communist Party (Parti Communiste d'Haïti—PCH); and former Garde commander Démosthènes Pétrus Calixte, who stood as the candidate of a progressive coalition that included the Worker Peasant Movement (Mouvement Ouvrier Paysan—MOP). MOP chose to endorse Calixte, instead of a candidate from its own ranks, because the party's leader, Daniel Fignolé, was only twenty-six years old—too young to stand for the nation's highest office. Estimé, politically the most moderate of the three, drew support from the black population in the north, {{as well as from}} the emerging black middle class. The leaders of the military, who would not countenance the election of <b>Juste</b> Constant and who reacted warily to the populist Fignolé, also considered Estimé the safest candidate. After two rounds of polling, legislators gave Estimé the presidency.|$|E
