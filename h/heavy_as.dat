5|$|Strapping Young Lad was a Canadian extreme metal band {{formed by}} Devin Townsend in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1994. The band {{started as a}} one-man studio project; Townsend played most of the {{instruments}} on the 1995 debut album, <b>Heavy</b> <b>as</b> a Really Heavy Thing. By 1997, he had recruited permanent members; this line-up, which consisted of Townsend on vocals and guitar, Jed Simon on guitar, Byron Stroud on bass, and Gene Hoglan on drums, lasted until the band's dissolution.|$|E

5|$|The German Type UB II design {{incorporated}} improvements over Type UB I boats, {{the first}} coastal submarines of the German Imperial Navy. Among these were twin engines and shafts for more redundancy during operations, a higher top speed, and larger torpedo tubes with double the complement of torpedoes. As a result, the UB II boats were {{nearly twice as}} <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> their predecessor UB I boats.|$|E

A career spanning best of album, entitled 1994–2006 Chaos Years, {{was released on}} March 31, 2008, with a bonus DVD of live performances {{and all of the}} band's music videos.|$|E
5|$|They have a {{moderately}} long single coat with no undercoat. Feathering of the fur {{appears on the}} chest, belly, ears and {{on the back of}} the legs. The coat is not as <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> that of a Cocker Spaniel but will require grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur. Docked tails were often used in working dogs, as poor blood flow left healing of the non docked tail difficult.|$|E
5|$|After {{performing}} {{in a number}} of heavy metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai's album Sex & Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on the solo album <b>Heavy</b> <b>as</b> a Really Heavy Thing released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time Japan's 10th Army was {{storming}} Yuhuatai, a rugged plateau situated {{directly in front of}} Zhonghua Gate on Nanking's southern side. The 10th Army's progress was slow and casualties were <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> Yuhuatai was built like a fortress of interlocking pillboxes and trenches manned by three Chinese divisions, including the German-trained 88th Division, though the Chinese were also apt to counterattack and some Japanese units were forced to spend more time defending than attacking. Close to every single man that the 88th Division had deployed on Yuhuatai was killed in action, including three of its four regimental commanders and both of its brigade commanders, but in the process the Japanese were made to suffer 2,240 casualties including 566 dead. Yuhuatai was finally overrun at noon on December 12.|$|E
5|$|Built to Brigham Young's design, the handcarts {{resembled a}} large wheelbarrow, with two wheels five feet (1.5m) in {{diameter}} and a single axle {{four and a half}} feet (1.4m) wide, and weighing 60 pounds (27kg). Running along each side of the bed were seven-foot (2.1 m) pull shafts ending with a three-foot (0.9m) crossbar at the front. The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled. Cargo was carried in a box about three feet by four feet (0.9m by 1.2m), with 8inch (0.2m) walls. The handcarts generally carried up to 250 pounds (110kg) of supplies and luggage, though they were capable of handling loads as <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> 500 pounds (230kg). Carts used in the first year's migration were made entirely of wood ("Iowa hickory or oak"); in later years a stronger design was substituted, which included metal elements.|$|E
5|$|South Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are {{primarily}} based on myths {{much older than}} the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He {{was said to have}} helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in Demir Kapija ("Iron Gate") with a stroke of his sabre. This drained the sea covering the regions of Bitola, Mariovo and Tikveš in Macedonia, making them habitable. After the earth was shaped, Marko arrogantly showed off his strength. God took it away by leaving a bag as <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> the earth on a road; when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his strength and became an ordinary man.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> a bird of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E
5|$|Australia were bowled out for 458 {{early on}} the fourth morning after the rest day, and England set about {{extending}} their lead, adding 129 for the first wicket, until both openers fell without further addition. In the meantime the workload on the Australian bowlers was <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> Ernie Toshack had broken down in the first innings and unable to participate further. Edrich and Denis Compton took the score to 232/2 until a late collapse saw England reach stumps at 362/8. England batted on for two overs on the final day, declaring at 365/8. Bill Johnston was the most successful bowler with 4/95. This left Australia a target of 404 {{in less than a}} day, which would require a world record runchase, and allowed Yardley to use the heavy roller to break up the pitch, making batting even harder for the tourists. Most observers predicted an easy England win on a deteriorating surface. Australia started slowly, and Bradman joined Morris at 57/1 with 347 runs still needed in 257 minutes. They put together a stand of 301 in only 217 minutes, aided by erratic bowling, several missed catches and stumpings to help Australia to a win by seven wickets with 15 minutes remaining. Morris made 182 while Bradman was unbeaten on 173. The England selectors were heavily criticised after the match for failing to include a leg spinner in the team to exploit the favourable conditions. For the third time in a row, the match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England.|$|E
5|$|The 2 RAR Machine Gun Platoon on Hill 111 again {{found itself}} heavily engaged, {{suffering}} five badly wounded. The Chinese {{had managed to}} establish an artillery forward observer on Hill 111 and US Marine casualties were particularly <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> a result. Eight critically injured Americans were subsequently evacuated through 2 RAR for urgent medical treatment. Small-arms fire continued to be exchanged between the US Marines and the Chinese {{for the next two}} hours, only subsiding by 03:00, with the Marines finally driving out the Chinese. D Company, 3 RAR was subsequently released and it returned to battalion's main defensive position. The Australian outpost section also succeeded in holding through the night and the following morning they found 35 Chinese dead around their positions. During the fighting Crockford had repeatedly exposed himself to Chinese fire, and had even run across no man's land to provide situation reports to the US Marine command post on Hill 111. He was later awarded the Military Medal for his actions. By dawn the only activity in front of The Hook were Chinese stretcher bearers collecting their wounded, which were subsequently allowed to do so unmolested by the Australians. In the US 1st Marine Division's sector the fighting had also ceased, while small groups of Chinese moved to reinforce their positions and were engaged with rifle and machine-gun fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as <b>heavy</b> <b>as</b> control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E
