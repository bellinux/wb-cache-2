5|$|It was {{the first}} US market Lexus with {{adaptive}} cruise control (called Dynamic Laser Cruise Control). It employed a lidar sensor and (unlike the laser ACC introduced in 1997 on the Celsior) was able to activate brakes for deceleration. However, because of laser technology limitations, it would <b>deactivate</b> in bad weather.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} episode, the Vorticon {{mothership}} has locked its X-14 Tantalus Ray cannons on eight of Earth's landmarks, and Keen journeys {{to the ship}} to find and <b>deactivate</b> each of the cannons. Keen does so by fighting more varied enemies and hazards and a Vorticon at each cannon's control. At {{the end of the}} episode, he discovers that the Vorticons are being mind-controlled by the mysterious Grand Intellect, who is actually behind the attack on Earth.|$|E

5|$|As Enterprise drifts in space, {{an unknown}} alien cruiser scans the ship, then docks with it. As {{part of an}} {{unconventional}} and criminal first contact, two Ferengi, Muk and Grish, board wearing breathing filters, and the crew {{appear to have been}} knocked unconscious. In Engineering, the two locate and <b>deactivate</b> a gas-machine that the Starfleet crew brought up from the surface of a nearby moon. Unknown to the intruders, Commander Tucker is still conscious and makes his way to Engineering and uses the ship's sensors to monitor the aliens as they plunder the ship.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1943, Lockwood had {{received}} enough reports from submarine officers to convince him the Mark 6 was significantly flawed. On 24 June 1943, he formally ordered all submarines operating out of Pearl Harbor to <b>deactivate</b> the magnetic influence feature. However, Christie was still committed to the exploder, and ordered Fremantle boats to continue using the influence feature. Submarines operating between the two commands were required to either enable or disable it, depending on which command area they were in. This difference of opinion strained {{relations between the two}} admirals.|$|E
5|$|EVE {{brings the}} plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's {{recordings}} of Earth and concludes {{that they must}} return. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive A113, issued to BnL autopilots after the corporation concluded years earlier that the planet could not be saved. He mutinies, tasering WALL-E and deactivating EVE and throwing them both down the garbage chute, then detaining McCrea. EVE automatically reactivates and helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector chamber; AUTO tries to close the chamber, crushing WALL-E when he struggles to keep it open, but McCrea is able to <b>deactivate</b> him and destroy GO-4, while EVE inserts the plant to activate the hyperjump.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} media-induced consumer activation level affects consumer response to highly energetic commercials. Over six studies, including a Hulu field experiment, the authors report that consumers who are experiencing a <b>deactivating</b> emotion (e. g., sadness induced by a movie) {{find it more}} difficult to watch highly energetic commercials compared with consumers who are not experiencing a <b>deactivating</b> emotion. As a result, consumers experiencing a <b>deactivating</b> emotion are less likely to watch highly energetic commercials and recall the advertiser compared with consumers who are not experiencing a <b>deactivating</b> emotion. The authors do not observe these effects when consumers experiencing a <b>deactivating</b> emotion watch commercials that are moderately energetic or when consumers do not experience a <b>deactivating</b> emotion. These findings suggest that when advertisers run commercials in a media context that induces a <b>deactivating</b> emotion (e. g., sadness, relaxation, contentment), they should avoid running highly energetic commercials (e. g., with upbeat, enthusiastic spokespeople). In addition, this research recommends that when advertisers are unable to determine the emotions induced by the media context, they should run commercials that are moderate in energy. The results of a metaanalysis across the present studies show that consumers experiencing a <b>deactivating</b> emotion will respond as much as 50 % more favorably to moderately energetic commercials compared with highly energetic commercials...|$|R
50|$|VAW-78 {{was set to}} be <b>deactivated</b> March 31, 2005. Before being <b>deactivated,</b> VAW-78 {{transferred}} some of its {{aircraft to}} VAW-77 to replace older E-2Cs in that squadron.|$|R
30|$|If {{the timer}} for <b>deactivating</b> Spine {{switches}} is on and Tdd is exceeded, the Spine Switch Controller calculates the number (min_num) of Spine switches {{that should be}} <b>deactivated</b> (as shown in lines 5 – 7 in Algorithm 5) and determines which Spine switches should be <b>deactivated.</b> The Spine Switch Controller sends the Spine switches’ ID to the Power Control Module to inform that the Spine switches should be <b>deactivated,</b> and sends the Spine switch’s ID to the Routing Module to inform that traffic {{is not to be}} distributed on those Spine switches.|$|R
5|$|Kriosian {{ambassador}} Briam (Tim O'Connor) {{comes on}} board the Enterprise with some cargo, ready for a peace ceremony with the Valtian. As the ship heads to the rendezvous, they save two Ferengi from a failing ship. Despite security being assigned, the Ferengi enter the cargo bay and <b>deactivate</b> the stasis field on Briam's cargo, revealing a young Kriosian woman named Kamala (Famke Janssen). With the Ferengi secured, it is revealed that she is an empathic metamorph who can sense what males around her desire and react appropriately. She was being brought as an arranged marriage to the Valtian representative. Kamala is generating pheromones that can affect males around her, which was why she was kept in stasis until the ceremony.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Chip MultiProcessors (CMPs) {{will have}} darksilicon or {{frequently}} <b>deactivated</b> areas in a chip, as technology continues to scale down, due to power dissipation. In this work we estimate {{the influences of}} <b>deactivated</b> cores on performance of network-on-chips (NoCs). Even when a chip has a two-dimensional mesh topology, a <b>deactivated</b> core that includes an on-chip router makes topology irregular. We thus assume that a topology-agnostic deadlock-free routing is used with a moderate number of virtual channels in such CMPs. Thorough cycle-accurate network simulations of a 2 -D mesh NoC, we found that (1) indeed a <b>deactivated</b> core degrades the performance to some extent in terms of throughput, but (2) latency is not increased or even reduced when a <b>deactivated</b> core {{is located in the}} corner of a mesh. Hence, we recommend choosing a corner core for deactivation to maintain the performance of NoCs. Keywords—Network-on-Chip, systems on chip, darksilicon. I...|$|R
