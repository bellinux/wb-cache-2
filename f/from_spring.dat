5|$|Fishers {{have been}} trapped since the 18th century. They have been popular with trappers {{due to the}} value of their fur, which has been used for scarves and neck pieces. The best pelts are from winter {{trapping}} with secondary quality pelts <b>from</b> <b>spring</b> trapping. The lowest-quality furs come from out-of-season trapping when fishers are moulting. They are easily trapped, and the value of their fur was a particular incentive for catching this species.|$|E
5|$|Ice ages {{during the}} Pleistocene brought a cooler and wetter pluvial climate {{to the region}} {{starting}} 2 to 3million years ago.

The nest, an open cup of twigs lined with rootlets and other fine material, is placed low in a dense bush or small tree. The female lays two greenish-blue eggs. However, details of nest-building, incubation times, parental care, fledging periods and number of broods are unknown.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{presented}} the analysis of basic physical and chemical parameters, alkalinity and acidity, the analysis of kations, anions, heavy metals, microbiological analysis and determination of uranium content in waters of Serbia <b>from</b> 10 <b>springs</b> of Arandjelovac region and 2 samples of bottled drinking water. It is done by different methods of analysis according to which conclusion about the content {{and the quality of}} these waters can be made. The pH value of analysed waters shows that waters <b>from</b> <b>springs</b> Maiden spring, Je?ovac, Vrelo and Svin?ine are slightly acid, while mineral waters <b>from</b> <b>springs</b> Aleksijevi?, Exploitation and Talpara are slightly basic. The sample <b>from</b> Olga’s <b>spring</b> has slightly lower pH value. According to Regulation on the hygiene of drinking water, conductivity should be less than 1000 μS/cm. This condition is fulfilled by waters <b>from</b> <b>springs</b> Aleksijevi?, Talpara (ordinary), Maiden and Olga’s spring, Svin?ine and water from city supply system. Springs Je?ovac and Vrelo have slightly increased conductivity, while springs Exploitation and Talpara have conductivity significantly above the allowed values (mineral). Analysed natural mineral waters contain only hydrogencarbonates (bicarbonate). According to the content of bicarbonate it was concluded that samples <b>from</b> <b>springs</b> Exploitation, Talpara (mineral), Vrelo and Svin?ine belong to the category of bicarbonate waters, as the content of hydrogencarbonate in these samples is higher than 600 mg/dm 3. Analysed mineral waters don’t show acidity towards methyl orange, which means that acidity of analysed waters comes from dissolved carbon acid...|$|R
5|$|The Liliaceae are ecologically diverse. Species of Liliaceae bloom {{at various}} times <b>from</b> <b>spring</b> to late summer. The {{colorful}} flowers produce large amounts of nectar and pollen that attract insects which pollinate them (entomophily), particularly bees and wasps (hymenopterophily), butterflies (psychophily) and moths (phalaenophily). The seeds are dispersed by wind and water. Some species (e.g. Scoliopus, Erythronium and Gagea) have seeds with an aril structure that are dispersed by ants (myrmecochory).|$|E

5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory in an area that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only <b>from</b> <b>spring</b> to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E

5|$|An {{incident}} in Žirmūnai's history {{that has been}} difficult to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a pontoon bridge across the River Neris, that was customarily set up <b>from</b> <b>spring</b> to autumn, collapsed due to the weight of a crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports. It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not fully connected at the time. There were witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The pontoon bridge was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{upstream}} from Casper, the North Platte bends to the south. The original trail proceeded several {{miles along the}} river to Red Buttes, where {{a bend in the}} river formed a natural amphitheater dominated by red cliffs on the hill above. The river was easier to ford here for those who were unwilling or unable to pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the waterless stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved <b>from</b> <b>spring</b> to spring across mostly alkaline soil and steep hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had crossed to the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common ink cap or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain <b>from</b> <b>spring</b> to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E

5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi is {{a species}} of mud crab that is native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It has also become {{established}} outside its native range, living in Swansea Docks since 1960, the Mediterranean Sea since the 1970s, the North Sea since 2007 and the Black Sea since 2010. It can reach a carapace width of , and has black tips to its unequal claws. It feeds on bivalves and barnacles, and is in turn eaten by predators including the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Eggs are produced <b>from</b> <b>spring</b> to autumn, the offspring reach sexual maturity the following summer, and individuals can live {{for up to two}} years. The closest relative of D.sayi is D.texanus, which lives in the Gulf of Mexico; the two species differ in subtle features of the genitalia and the last pair of walking legs.|$|E

5|$|However, {{by the end}} of the year, the United States {{had failed}} to achieve the {{objectives}} of Rolling Thunder, because North Vietnam continued to send its troops and military supplies down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which demonstrated that the North Vietnamese Government was not ready to quit the war. In response to domestic political pressure to do more, President Johnson shifted priority of the campaign to interdiction. From summer 1965 to the winter period of 1966–67, the campaign was aimed at degrading North Vietnam’s capability to infiltrate and send men into South Vietnam. Again, America’s shift towards interdiction also failed, and the Johnson administration was forced to change the priority of the bombing campaign. For the third phase of Rolling Thunder, which occurred <b>from</b> <b>spring</b> 1967 to early 1968, bombing operations were focused on industrial and transportation targets in and around Hanoi, Hai Phong and the buffer zone near the Chinese border.|$|E
