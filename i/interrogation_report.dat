5000|$|Dr Marilyn Mallory, {{a scholar}} {{familiar}} with the pontificates of Popes Pius XI and Pius XII rebutted Posner in a 2015 article in Inside the Vatican. Mallory asserts that the <b>Interrogation</b> <b>Report</b> of this selfsame 'Nogara' is found in The National Archives, London, where he is identified as one Bruno Nogara, a Venice school teacher who was arrested by the Allies in April 1945, an entirely different individual, which disproves Posner’s allegation. Faced with this evidence, Posner amended the paperback version of God’s Bankers, now stating on page 137, that there were in fact two Abwehr agents named Nogara: Bruno Nogara, whose <b>Interrogation</b> <b>Report</b> is found in The National Archives, London, and Branch Nogara, listed in Appendix C of the <b>Interrogation</b> <b>Report</b> of Reinhard Reme, Abwehr II Recruiter, found in the National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D.C. Posner argues that {{it is that the}} former, Bruno Nogara, who is listed as a member of Abwehr Unit 257 under Reichsstatthalter Hubert Pfannenstiel, while the latter, Branch Nogara, is listed under Abwehr Unit 254 commanded by Reichsstatthalter Ernst Schmidt-Burck; thus, there were two different Abwehr units under two different commanders and therefore two different Nogaras.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the news}} media may speak of [...] "spy satellites" [...] and the like, espionage is not a synonym for all intelligence-gathering disciplines.

Many HUMINT activities, such as prisoner <b>interrogation,</b> <b>reports</b> from military reconnaissance patrols and from diplomats, etc., are not considered espionage.
