40|$|Many {{applications}} {{rely on the}} kernel's {{ability to}} specialize and extend its functionality {{in order to achieve}} high performance and meet application-specific QoS requirements. However, general-purpose operating systems lack sufficient support for flexible and scalable event-based communication between user-level applications and kernel-level extensions. This presents problems especially for real-time applications, which typically require notification of events and response to events in a timely manner. This paper introduces <b>ECalls,</b> a lightweight, bidirectional user/kernel event delivery facility. <b>ECalls</b> not only supports the timely delivery of events, but it also reduces the cost and frequency of user/kernel boundary crossings. <b>ECalls</b> is a communication tool that allows (a) kernel extensions to register their offered services and (b) applications to register their interest in these services.

40|$|Operating system {{enhancements}} {{to support}} real-time and multimedia applications often include specializations and extensions of kernel functionality, {{as with the}} kernel HTTP daemon (k[URL] in Linux, for instance. To enable efficient and flexible interactions of such extensions with user-level functionality, we have developed <b>ECalls,</b> a lightweight, bidirectional kernel/user event delivery facility, which not only supports the timely delivery of events, but it also reduces the cost and frequency of kernel/user boundary crossings. <b>ECalls</b> is a communication tool that allows (a) kernel extensions to register their offered services and (b) applications to register their interest in these services. Using <b>ECalls,</b> applications use lightweight system calls to generate events, while kernel extensions raise real-time signals or invoke handler functions (residing in either user or kernel space), or they may use kernel threads to handle events on behalf of applications. <b>ECalls</b> can also influence the CPU scheduler such that a process with pending events is given preference over other processes. To demonstrate its utility, this paper implements an I/O event delivery mechanism using <b>ECalls.</b> This mechanism is shown to improve the performance of two applications: a distributed video player and a web server...|$|R

40|$|Distributed {{multimedia}} applications require {{support from}} the underlying operating system to achieve and maintain their desired Quality of Service (QoS). This {{has led to the}} creation of novel task and message schedulers and to the development of QoS mechanisms that allow applications to explicitly interact with relevant operating system services. However, the task scheduling techniques developed to date are not well equipped to take advantage of such interactions. As a result, important events such as position update messages in virtual environments may be ignored. If a CPU scheduler ignores these events, players will experience a lack of responsiveness or even inconsistencies in the virtual world. This paper argues that real-time and multimedia applications can benefit from coordinated schemes for CPU and event scheduling and we describe a novel event delivery mechanism, termed <b>ECalls,</b> that supports such coordination.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} examined {{memory for}} behaviors associated with attributional information.

40|$|When {{children}} and adults retrieve words during unconstrained recall, it is commonly supposed that words will present themselves to consciousness in decreasing order of memory strength, which means that their order of readout should be stronger [...] ~ weaker. In contrast, fuzzy-trace theory proposes a counterintuitive nonmonotonic relationship between order of readout and memory strength. This relationship, which we call cognitive triage, arises from the theory's interpretation f recall as a dynamic {{system in which the}} influences of three variables (memory strength, episodic activation, and output interference) must be balanced to maximize recall. Because fuzzy-trace theory anticipates ontogenetic variations in cognitive triage, we studied itdevelopmentally. A series of nine experiments produced several findings that were consistent with the theory's assumptions: Children ever <b>ecalled</b> stronger words before weaker words, doing the reverse instead; the priority of weaker words over stronger words in output queues was observed in the earliest phases of learning in both younger and older children; as learning progressed and children secured more reliable information about he relative memory strengths ofwords, a weaker [...] ~ stronger [...] ~ weaker ordering emerged, and it emerged more rapidly in older children; at criterion, when all items were recallable, the weaker ~ stronger [...] ~ weaker ordering was present at all age levels, although itwa...|$|R
