25|$|A 2014 {{retrospective}} {{longitudinal study}} showed that <b>firefighters</b> are at higher risk for certain types of cancer. <b>Firefighters</b> had mesothelioma, which is caused by asbestos exposure, at {{twice the rate of}} the non-firefighting working population.

The risk of bladder cancer may be present in female <b>firefighters,</b> but research is inconclusive as of 2014.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{mortality and}} cancer incidence of paid male Australian <b>firefighters</b> and of subgroups of <b>firefighters</b> by era of first employment, duration {{of employment and}} number and type of incidents attended. Methods: Participating fire agencies supplied records of individual <b>firefighters</b> including their job histories and incidents attended. The cohort {{was linked to the}} Australian National Death Index and Australian Cancer Database. SMRs and SIRs were calculated. <b>Firefighters</b> were grouped into tertiles by duration of employment and by number of incidents attended and relative mortality ratios and relative incidence ratios calculated. Analyses were carried out separately for full-time and part-time male <b>firefighters.</b> Results: Compared to the Australian population, there were significant increases in overall risk of cancer, for all paid <b>firefighters</b> SIR 1. 09 (95 % CI 1. 03 to 1. 14), in prostate cancer, full-time <b>firefighters</b> 1. 23 (95 % CI 1. 10 to 1. 37), part-time 1. 51 (1. 28 to 1. 77), and melanoma full-time 1. 45 (95 % CI 1. 26 to 1. 66), part-time <b>firefighters</b> 1. 43 (95 % CI 1. 15 to 1. 76). Kidney cancer was associated with longer service in internal analyses for paid <b>firefighters.</b> Prostate cancer was associated with longer service and increased attendance at fires, particularly structural fires for full-time <b>firefighters.</b> The overall risk of mortality was significantly decreased and almost all major causes of death were significantly reduced for paid <b>firefighters.</b> Conclusions: Male paid <b>firefighters</b> have an increased risk of cancer. They have reduced mortality compared with the general population, which {{is likely to be a}} result of a strong healthy worker effect and likely lower smoking rates among <b>firefighters</b> compared with the Australian population...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A fire {{breaks out}} on a graph and f <b>firefighters</b> protect f vertices. At each {{subsequent}} time step the fire spreads to all adjacent unprotected vertices and <b>firefighters</b> protect f unburned (and unprotected) vertices. On the strong grid, three <b>firefighters</b> cannot restrict the fire to one quadrant, but four <b>firefighters</b> suffice to contain the fire. Further, if the strong grid goes unprotected to time t = k when four <b>firefighters</b> arrive and begin protecting vertices, the fire can be contained by time t = 24 k + 7. 1. Introduction. As defined in [5], the firefighting problem is as follows: a fire breaks out at a vertex on a graph at time t = 0, then f <b>firefighters</b> protect f vertices. At each subsequent time step, the fire moves and then the <b>firefighters</b> move. A move for the fire is to spread to all unprotected neighbours of each burned vertex. A move for the <b>firefighters</b> is to protect any f vertices that are neithe...|$|R

40|$|CHDS State/LocalThe {{fire service}} {{is one of}} the premier {{emergency}} response agencies in the United States. As our nation strives to expand and enhance its homeland security efforts, <b>firefighters</b> have been recognized as an underutilized asset. The opportunity for <b>firefighters</b> to act as "first preventers" {{in the war on terrorism}} is unmatched by any other emergency response agency. This, coupled with the warrantless search provisions afforded <b>firefighters</b> by the Constitution, makes <b>firefighters</b> the logical choice for training and inclusion into an expanded terrorism awareness initiative. Expansion of the intelligence-gathering capabilities of first responders, specifically <b>firefighters,</b> will not be without difficulty. The lack of training and educational opportunities afforded <b>firefighters</b> in this area, the changes in firefighting culture, the status of <b>firefighters</b> as an integral part of the community, are all obstacles that must be addressed. <b>Firefighters</b> respond to homes and businesses with unprecedented frequency.

Trained <b>firefighters</b> will help shoulder some of the burden placed on law enforcement while the utilization of a current asset will put forth a new best practice for the safety of our communities.
