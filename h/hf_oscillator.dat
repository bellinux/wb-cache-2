These {{were followed by}} two solid-state receivers that did not use plug-in coils: the HRO-500 (October 1964 - 1972, 5 kHz - 30 MHz, and HRO-600 (1970-1972?, 16 kHz - 30 MHz). Breaking with tradition, the HRO-600 used a frequency counter instead of a micrometer tuning dial. Ironically, the HRO-600 used tubes for its digital frequency display and thus was, technically, no longer [...] "all solid-state" [...] as its predecessor, the HRO-500, had been.|$|E
40|$|The {{spectrum}} of electromagnetic waves emitted by an oscillator trapped in an external potential well is studied. It {{is assumed that}} the natural frequency of the oscillator {{is much greater than}} the frequency of oscillations in the potential well. We consider the quantum model of emission with regard to the recoil effect. The highest intensity of the absorption and emission lines is observed on the natural frequency of the oscillator when the recoil energy is equal to the energy of the quantum of low-frequency (LF) oscillations in the potential well. A certain decrease in the amplitude of the emission and absorption lines is noted caused by the oscillations of the potential well due to, for example, the presence of the phonon spectrum. The relaxation times of the oscillator LF motion in the potential well, resulted from the phonon emission, are estimated. It is concluded that these processes have no influence on the observed features of the emission and absorption of high-frequency photons. This model can be applied to description of the emission and absorption of gamma rays in the crystal structures even {{in the presence of the}} phonon spectrum on condition that the relaxation time of the LF movements in the potential well is greater than the lifetime of the <b>HF</b> <b>oscillator...</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the issues of}} designing the two-zone digital microwave sensors for the car alarm systems with high stability characteristics and capable of adaptation to external noise. The existing analog circuit-based microwave sensors for car alarm systems {{have a number of}} essential drawbacks: [...] high level of intrinsic noise to cause the "false" alarm of response sensors; [...] non-stable characteristics caused by the application of analog components at the environmental temperatures from - 30  tо + 60  С. This requires sensor readjustment during the transition from the summer season to the winter one, that is, essentially, hard to implement; [...] uneasy adjustment of a mounted sensor with variable resistors; [...] adjustment characterstic nonlinearity and high power consumption; [...] impossible to implement the auto-compensation and adjustment algorithms to the repetitive external actions. To overcome abovementioned drawbacks the paper offers a circuit of digital microprocessor-based (PIC 12 F 683 processor) sensor with <b>HF</b> <b>oscillator</b> running in pulse operation mode (pulse ratio 20). It allows 6 - 8 times decrease of power consumption up to 2. 1 mA and twice reduction of noise amplitude. Filters with useful output signal are of digital implementation. This enables us {{to reduce the number of}} electric components of sensor in half and to increase characteristics stability. For remote adjustment of sensor (with the key fob of car alarm or by GSM link) 16 gradations of sensitivity are entered for zones of warning and alarm. The reference levels of digital comparators at each gradation of sensitivity are so generated that the sensor has a linear adjustment characteristic (distance of movable object detection versus gradation number). An application of digital signal processing and sensor capability of data exchange with the main alarm module through the bus allows us to implement the original algorithm of automatic correction of sensitivity across the warning zone of sensor. It means that the sensitivity gradually decreases under repetitive external effects (downpour, passing cars in the streets with heavy traffic, etc.) and with returning to the level of preliminary adjustment as the intensity of external effects decreases. Circuit engineering solutions and algorithms of digital signal processing are implemented in line-produced sensors of car alarms with a trademark “Excellent” (Magic Ring Ltd). </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{publication}} 1, we reported {{the observation of}} discrete displacement of a nanomechanical oscillator in a normal mode frequency of f = 1. 5 GHz at a temperature of Tlow = 110 mK (kTlow ~ <b>hf),</b> whereas the <b>oscillator</b> displayed continuous displacement at a higher temperature of Thigh = 1000 mK (kThigh>> hf) according to the Hooke’s law, F ∝ kx. We argue that the oscillator at low temperatures (kBTlow ~ hf) displays discrete displacements between two localized states, and the data {{can be interpreted as}} transitions between two quantum states. Schwab et al. in their comment 2 on our publication argue against the interpretation of the data that the observed discrete displacement cannot be a signature of a quantum effect. We give a brief response to some of their questions wherever scientifically appropriate. We also assert that the comments are not scientifically justified, and the rhetoric is highly inappropriate. 1) “According to standard quantum mechanics, measurement of energy quanta …requires a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement scheme. ” This statement invalidates 100 years of quantum mechanics experiments, starting from discrete energy spectrum of atoms 3. Quantum mechanical experiments such as energy quantization and interference effectsa are routinely done without a QND scheme 3, 4, 10. The questionable conjecture of Schwab et al. is that the observation of discrete energy spectrum of a quantum system necessarily requires measurement of a specialized non-classical state with minimum uncertainty (via QND).
