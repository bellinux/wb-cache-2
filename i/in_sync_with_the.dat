5|$|Over {{the course}} of 2014, the {{phenomenon}} of indie games produced several variations of the genre. The game Jungle Rumble uses a mechanic where players drum on a touch screen to control the game. Different rhythms correspond with different verbs to control entities in an RTS like environment. The game Crypt of the NecroDancer uses a mechanic where the player controls the main character <b>in</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack's beat.|$|E
5|$|The Haber-Bosch {{method for}} synthesizing {{ammonium}} nitrate represented {{a major breakthrough}} and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints. It was first patented by German chemist Fritz Haber. In 1910 Carl Bosch, while working for German chemical company BASF, successfully commercialized the process and secured further patents. In the years after World War II, the use of synthetic fertilizer increased rapidly, <b>in</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> increasing world population.|$|E
5|$|During {{production}} Burtt had {{the opportunity}} to look at the items used by Jimmy MacDonald, Disney's in-house sound designer for many of their classic films. Burtt used many of MacDonald's items on WALL-E. Because Burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post-production, the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas, which Burtt found an unusual experience. He worked <b>in</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> animators, returning their animation after adding the sounds to give them more ideas. Burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character, but if he could not find one that worked, he would choose a dramatic and unrealistic noise. Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters, before he and Stanton pared it down to a distinct few for each robot.|$|E

50|$|Sel-Sync or Selective Synchronous {{recording}} is {{the process}} of selectively using audio tape record heads as play back heads so that new signals can be recorded on other tracks <b>in</b> perfect <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> existing tracks. Sel-sync recording dramatically changed the recording process allowing overdubbing of individual recorded tracks.|$|R
5|$|Even so, {{there is}} no {{shortage}} of criticism against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many critics argue that Beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely <b>in</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality is, these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E
5|$|German ethnologist Thomas Barthel, {{who first}} {{published}} the rongorongo corpus, identified three {{lines on the}} recto (side a) of tablet C, also known as Mamari, as a lunar calendar. Guy proposed {{that it was more}} precisely an astronomical rule for whether one or two intercalary nights should be inserted into the 28-night Rapanui month to keep it <b>in</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> phases of the moon, and if one night, whether this should come before or after the full moon. Berthin and Berthin propose that it is the text which follows the identified calendar which shows where the intercalary nights should appear. The Mamari calendar is the only example of rongorongo whose function is currently accepted as being understood, though it cannot actually be read.|$|E
5|$|Zoning {{and land}} use controversies, common {{throughout}} Bellaire's history, resulted in the 1977 recall of the mayor and three council members. The City of Bellaire voted against banning smoking in bars and restaurants on Monday January 15, 2007. Mayor Cindy Siegel and Pat McLaughlan, one council member, voted for the ban, while the other five members, including Peggy Faulk, voted against the ban. The National Restaurant Association asked Bellaire to consider adopting a smoking ban to put it <b>in</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> City of Houston, which adopted a similar ordinance in 2005. In December 2009 the city voted to ban texting while driving. Bans of texting while driving were passed in Bellaire and West University Place, Texas within hours of one another. In 2010 the city voted 5-2 to ban the feeding of cats on public property and establish a rule requiring {{the permission of the}} owner of a piece of private property in order to feed cats on private property. The city received negative e-mail feedback from various locations, including Switzerland.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} displays this {{consists of}} changing the frame rate of the produced signal in the video card (and <b>in</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> this, <b>the</b> displayed image on the display). This {{is limited by the}} clock speed of the video adapter and frame rate required of the program - for a given pixel clock speed, higher refresh rates require lower resolution or color depth, and higher frame rates require that the program producing the video recalculate the screen more frequently. For these reasons, refresh rates above 90-100 Hz to reduce flicker are uncommon on computers - these rates are sufficient to eliminate flicker.|$|R

25|$|Turntables allow DJs to play vinyl records. By {{adjusting}} the playback {{speed of the}} turntable, either by {{adjusting the}} speed knob, or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs can match the tempos of different records so their rhythms can be played together {{at the same time}} without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as beatmatching. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on turntables that keeps the record moving <b>in</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> turntable with a slipmat that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. Direct-drive turntables are the type preferred by DJs, with the Technics SL-1200 being the most popular model of turntables for DJs. Belt-drive turntables are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor does not like being slowed down, as it can stretch out the belt. Some DJs, most commonly those who play hip hop music, go beyond merely mixing records and use turntables as musical instruments for scratching, beat juggling, and other turntablism techniques.|$|E
25|$|Bernhardt {{was one of}} {{the first}} actresses to star in moving pictures. The first {{projected}} film was shown by the Lumiere brothers at the Grand Café in Paris on 28 December 1895. In 1900, the cameraman who had shot the first films for the Lumiere brothers, Clément Maurice, approached Bernhardt and asked her to make a film out of a scene from her stage production of Hamlet. The scene was Prince Hamlet's duel with Laertes, with Bernhardt in the role of Hamlet. Maurice made a phonograph recording at the same time, so the film could be accompanied by sound. The sound of the clashing wooden prop swords was not loud and realistic enough, so Maurice had a stage hand bang pieces of metal together <b>in</b> <b>sync</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sword fight. Maurice's finished two-minute film, Le Duel d'Hamlet, was presented to the public at the 1900 Paris Universal Exposition between 14 April and 12 November 1900. The short film became one of the most popular attractions of the Exposition. The sound quality on the disks and the synchronization were very poor, so the system never became a commercial success. Nonetheless, her film is cited as one of the first examples of a sound film.|$|E
