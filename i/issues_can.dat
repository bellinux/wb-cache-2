5|$|As {{the disease}} progresses, {{different}} medical <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> appear, such as oral and dental disease, pressure ulcers, malnutrition, hygiene problems, or respiratory, skin, or eye infections. Careful management can prevent them, while professional treatment is needed {{when they do}} arise. During {{the final stages of}} the disease, treatment is centred on relieving discomfort until death, often with the help of hospice.|$|E
5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E
5|$|The leading case, Anti-Vivisection Society, {{sets out}} a strict rule that {{charities}} cannot campaign politically. An illustration of its strictness is Bowman v Secular Society, {{where it was}} held that even when attempted changes to the law were ancillary to the main goals, it was still unacceptable. There is a dividing line; charitable trusts discussing political <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> be valid, as discussed by Hoffmann J obiter dicta in Attorney General v Ross. This line is considered by the Charity Commission in their official guidelines, which allow the Commission {{to look at the}} wider purpose of the organisation when deciding if it constitutes a valid charity.|$|E

5|$|The life {{expectancy}} of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> develop {{as a result of}} lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.|$|E

25|$|However, {{perceptions}} of medical tourism {{are not always}} positive. In places like the US, which has high standards of quality, medical tourism is viewed as risky.

25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{bedwetting}} {{children are more}} likely to have behavioral problems. For children who have developmental problems, the behavioral problems and the bedwetting are frequently part of/caused by the developmental issues. For bedwetting children without other developmental issues, these behavioral <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> result from self-esteem issues and stress caused by the wetting.|$|E

25|$|The {{violations}} of Bell's inequalities, due to quantum entanglement, provide near definitive demonstrations {{of something that}} was already strongly suspected: that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the classical picture of physics. Some earlier elements that had seemed incompatible with classical pictures included complementarity and wavefunction collapse. The Bell violations show that no resolution of such <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> avoid the ultimate strangeness of quantum behavior.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the advent}} of space {{stations}} that can be inhabited for long periods, exposure to weightlessness has been demonstrated to have some deleterious effects on human health.

Though these changes are usually temporary, long term health <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> result.|$|E

Kick Start offers individualised, case management support, from learning about healthy diets to learning how to swim or join the gym.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} beaver-related {{flooding}} issues that people encounter {{are caused by}} blocked road culverts or freestanding beaver dams. Beaver-related flooding <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> usually be resolved with properly designed and installed water control devices, also known as flow devices. Flow devices are either specially designed pipes installed through beaver dams, or pipe and/or fence systems that protect road culverts from being blocked. The beneficial effects of beavers on stream flow, riparian habitat, salmon and trout, and wetland creation can be sustained with application of these inexpensive technologies, which require little maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Environmental <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> include erosion, {{formation}} of sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, and contamination of soil, groundwater and surface water by chemicals from mining processes. In some cases, additional forest logging {{is done in}} the vicinity of mines to create space for the storage of the created debris and soil. Contamination resulting from leakage of chemicals can also affect the health of the local population if not properly controlled. Extreme examples of pollution from mining activities include coal fires, which can last for years or even decades, producing massive amounts of environmental damage.|$|E

25|$|When a {{real-world}} airline is {{created in the}} image of a virtual airline, legal <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> arise out of copyright violations. In 2003, a real world airline, Qantas Airways Ltd, announced a new low-cost carrier by the name of Jetstar Airways. However, a virtual airline named Jetstar International Airlines already existed, complete with a web site. As part of their startup promotion, Qantas sold 100,000 airline tickets at a discount price, and the virtual airline's web site was swamped with would-be customers, job-seekers, and prospective vendors. The virtual airline sued Qantas, claiming that Qantas stole the virtual airline's livery and trademark. The matter was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{heritage}} face {{threats from}} a variety of sources on a daily basis, from thieves, vandals, and pests; to pollution, humidity, and temperature; to natural emergencies and physical forces; to all kinds of light. Effects stemming from these <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> be treated and sometimes reversed with interventive conservation after the damage has occurred. However, many of the sources of danger mentioned above are controllable, and others are at least predictable. Collections care strives to mitigate the occurrence of damage and deterioration through research and the implementation of procedures which enhance the safety of cultural heritage objects and collections. The areas of particular concern with regard to the sources of damage include: environmental conditions, collections maintenance, museum integrated pest management, emergency response, and collections management.|$|E
25|$|Linear {{programming}} {{is a widely}} used field of optimization for several reasons. Many practical problems in operations research can be expressed as linear programming problems. Certain special cases of linear programming, such as network flow problems and multicommodity flow problems are considered important enough to have generated much research on specialized algorithms for their solution. A number of algorithms for other types of optimization problems work by solving LP problems as sub-problems. Historically, ideas from linear programming have inspired many of the central concepts of optimization theory, such as duality, decomposition, {{and the importance of}} convexity and its generalizations. Likewise, linear {{programming is}} heavily used in microeconomics and company management, such as planning, production, transportation, technology and other issues. Although the modern management issues are ever-changing, most companies would like to maximize profits or minimize costs with limited resources. Therefore, many <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> be characterized as linear programming problems.|$|E
