Additionally, the fruit bodies have about 30mg of ergosterol peroxide per 100g of <b>dried</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Ergosterol peroxide is a steroid derivative {{with a wide}} spectrum of biological activity, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, and cytotoxicity to various tumor cell lines grown in laboratory culture.|$|E
5|$|A {{comparative}} study of the amino acid composition of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis to have the highest total amino acid content, about 2.3g per 100g of <b>dried</b> <b>mushroom.</b> This total includes {{a full complement of}} 20 essential and nonessential amino acids.

5|$|The {{composition}} of the volatile flavour compounds of Suillellus luridus consists largely of linoleic acid, with smaller proportions of 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid methyl ester, and heptadecanoic acid.

The main fatty acids of the mushroom include linoleic acid (53.4% of total fatty acids), oleic acid (24.1%), and palmitic acid (10.2%). Arginine is the free amino acid found in the highest concentration (96.9μM per gram of dry weight), followed by glutamine (9.7) and alanine (8.2).|$|E

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{mentioned}} by French mycologist Roger Heim in 1956 based on material collected by American ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson in Paso de Cortés, {{on the slopes}} of Popocatépetl mountain in Mexico. Heim originally named the species as a variety of Psilocybe mexicana; limited to <b>dried</b> <b>mushroom</b> material for analysis, he only described the spores, which he explained were [...] "relatively longer and narrower than that of Psilocybe mexicana". A year later, Heim renamed the fungus Psilocybe aztecorum and officially described it, in addition to several other Mexican Psilocybe taxa. Some of these mushrooms, including P.aztecorum, were illustrated in the popular American weekly magazine Life ("Seeking the Magic Mushroom"), in which Wasson recounted the psychedelic visions that he experienced during the divinatory rituals of the Mazatec people, thereby introducing psilocybin mushrooms to Western popular culture.|$|E

Guzmán also indicates contemporary ceremonial usage by Mixe and Zapotec people. Paul Stamets, in his Psilocybe Mushrooms of the World, rates the psychoactive potency of the mushroom as [...] "moderately active", and reports psilocybin levels of 0.6% (milligrams per gram of <b>dried</b> <b>mushroom),</b> and psilocin of 0.1%. In comparison, Stamets indicates that the commonly cultivated species P.cubensis contains 0.63% and 0.60% (psilocybin and psilocin), while the widespread P.semilanceata has 0.98% and 0.02%.

500|$|The {{nutritional}} {{components of}} R.virescens mushrooms have been characterized. Fresh mushrooms contain about 92.5% moisture. A [...] sample of <b>dried</b> <b>mushroom</b> (100gdw) has 365 kcal (1527 kilojoules). Carbohydrates {{make up the}} bulk of the fruit bodies, comprising 62% of the dry weight; 11.1% of the carbohydrates are sugars, the large majority of which (10.9%) is mannitol. The total lipid, or crude fat, content makes up 1.85% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The proportion of fatty acids (expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids) are 28.78% saturated, 41.51% monounsaturated, and 29.71% polyunsaturated. The most prevalent fatty acids include: palmitic acid, 17.3% of total fatty acids; stearic acid, 7.16%; oleic acid, 40.27%; and linoleic acid, 29.18%. Several bioactive compounds are present in the mushroom. One hundred grams (dry weight) contains 49.3 micrograms (µg) of tocopherols (20.0µg alpha, 21.3µg beta, and 8.0µg gamma) and 0.19 milligrams (mg) of the carotenoid pigment lycopene. There are 4.46g of organic acids per 100g of dry mushrooms, including oxalic acid (0.78g), malic acid (2.71g), citric acid (0.55g), and fumaric acid (0.23g). Mushrooms have 22.6mg/100gdw of the phenolic compound 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 15.8mg/100gdw of cinnamic acid.|$|E
500|$|Like other boletes, porcini can be dried {{by being}} strung {{separately}} on twine and hung {{close to the}} ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placing them in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer {{on top of a}} boiler or hot water tank. Another method is drying in an oven at [...] for two to three hours, then increasing the temperature to [...] until crisp or brittle. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. Importantly for commercial production, porcini retain their flavour after industrial preparation in a pressure cooker or after canning or bottling, and are thus useful for manufacturers of soups or stews. The addition of a few pieces of dried porcino can significantly add to flavour, and they are a major ingredient of the pasta sauce known as carrettiere (carter's sauce). The drying process is known to induce the formation of various volatile substances that contribute to the mushroom's aroma. Chemical analysis has shown that the odour of the <b>dried</b> <b>mushroom</b> is a complex mixture of 53 volatile compounds.|$|E
