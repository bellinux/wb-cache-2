40|$|With rapid {{advances}} in digital information processing systems, {{and more specifically}} in digital image processing software, {{there is a widespread}} development of advanced tools and techniques for digital image forgery. One of the techniques most commonly used is the Copy-move forgery which proceeds by copying a part of an image and pasting it into the same image, in order to maliciously hide an object or a region. In this paper, we propose a method to detect this specific <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit.</b> Firstly, the color image is converted from RGB color space to YCbCr color space and then the R, G, B and Y-component are splitted into fixed-size overlapping blocks and, features are extracted from the R, G and B-components image blocks on one hand and on the other, from the DCT representation of the R, G, B and Ycomponent image block. The feature vectors obtained are then lexicographically sorted to make similar image blocks neighbors and duplicated image blocks are identified using Euclidean distance as similarity criterion. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can detect the duplicated regions when {{there is more than one}} copy move forged area in the image and even in case of slight rotations, JPEG compression, shift, scale, blur and noise addition.

5000|$|The fourth {{level of}} Tawhid {{pertains}} to the oneness of lordship and of the governance {{of the world and}} man. This oneness of lordship has two aspects: creative governance (tadbir takwini), and religious governance (tadbir tashrii). At last oneness in worship, that is God alone is to be worshipped. Tawhid or Monotheism is the belief in one God or in God's Essential Oneness. Motahari states that this level of Tawhid refers to the practice, being and becoming, i.e. bringing man into unity, the other levels of Tawhid are [...] "seeing" [...] but this level of Tawhid is [...] "going". According to Islam, every choice of an orientation, ideal or a spiritual qibla is a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> worship. He adds that Tawhid in practice is the individual's growing unified through worship of God alone by means <b>of</b> rejecting all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> worship (such as worship of carnal desires, money or prestige) and in society's growing unified through worship of God alone by means of rejecting discrimination and injustice.So attaining to happiness is through attaining unity and attaining unity is through worshiping the Truth. He further adds that to worship other than God is Shirk of Lordship, it is a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> practice,too. Shirk in practice has levels, some of them are evident and some are very hidden which Muhammad points to it in a hadith progress of shirk is more hidden than the passage of an ant over a stone on a dark night." [...] The least <b>of</b> this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> shirk is the love of injustice and the hate of justice, is religion anything other than loving and hating for God. According to the Quran, every act of obedience to an order is worshiping.|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo verificar a autenticidade de bebidas alcoólicas (whisky, vodka, conhaque de gengibre, etc.) enviadas para análise ao Instituto Adolfo Lutz no período de 1993 a agosto de 1999. Devido à presença no mercado {{nacional de}} bebidas alcoólicas clandestinas, principalmente aquelas com alto valor agregado, foi realizado o monitoramento através da análise de composição química destas bebidas. Normalmente estes produtos são elaborados com álcool, água, aroma e corante caramelo e que por falta de controle dessas matérias-primas, podem oferecer risco potencial à saúde humana pela presença de metanol. A técnica empregada na análise dos componentes secundários e metanol das amostras foi realizada através da cromatografia em fase gasosa com {{detector}} de ionização de chama. Observou-se que em 608 amostras de bebidas alcoólicas analisadas, 391 eram falsificadas e dentre estas 2 apresentaram teores de metanol acima do limite tolerado (200 mg/ 100 mL de álcool anidro) pela legislação em vigor. Os resultados obtidos sugerem uma grande persistência em se produzir bebidas alcoólicas falsificadas. Desta forma, é muito importante estar sempre monitorando estes produtos e identificando os diferentes tipos de falsificações existentes no país. This work aimed at verifying {{the authenticity of}} alcoholic beverages (whisky, vodka, ginger spirit, etc.) sent for analysis by the Instituto Adolfo Lutz, São Paulo from 1993 to August 1999. The chemical composition of these drinks was studied {{because of the presence}} of illicit alcoholic beverages on the national market, especially those with a high commercial value. These products are usually elaborated with alcohol, water, flavor and caramel coloring. Since there is no control over these raw materials, these drinks could offer a potential risk to human health {{because of the presence of}} methanol. The method employed in the analysis of congeners and methanol in alcoholic products was gas-liquid chromatography with flame ionization detector. It was observed that 391 of the 608 samples of alcoholic beverages analyzed, were <b>counterfeit,</b> and 2 <b>of</b> them presented levels of methanol above the limit tolerated by the Brazilian legislation (200 mg/ 100 mL absolute alcohol).

40|$|The {{argument}} {{begins with}} the widely accepted proposition that science and technology had a crucial part {{to play in the}} legitimisation of Western colonialisms in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It then sets out to examine the implications of this in terms of the interaction of science, technology and the commodity production of cane sugar in Asia’s largest and best-known sugar colony — the Netherlands Indies (Indonesian) island of Java. It demonstrates that cane sugar in Java was indeed the site of technological revolution and of a scientific approach to production which Western contemporaries saw as asserting their superiority over, and justifying their domination of, the East. From a broadly postcolonial perspective, the colonial binaries inherent in discourse <b>of</b> this <b>kind</b> were a good deal more ambiguous than its contemporary practitioners were inclined to allow. Indeed, a discourse which seems otherwise to have been Manichaean in the severity of its social distinctions, was significantly subverted by the collateral existence of fissures within the apparent monolith of an industrial structure based on Western technology and science. That structure was not self-sustaining, and although it was possible to marginalise the once-dominant Asian element in the industry, Java sugar nonetheless had to accommodate within its managerial and technical structure large numbers of people of part-European, part-Asian ethnic background. It did this by accepting a colonial construction of the European which was particular to Java, and which embraced large numbers of Eurasians as well as Dutch expatriates. The language of difference, inherent in the notion of a Manichaean divide, rested, in short, on a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> discursive <b>counterfeit,</b> which was an indispensable condition for the persistence of scientific and technological production.
