50|$|In early 1955 the Anti-Imperialist <b>Front</b> {{joined the}} Independence <b>Front</b> (a {{coalition}} of opponents to az-Zahari, including the Umma Party). Through {{the participation of}} the Anti-Imperialist <b>Front,</b> the Independence <b>Front</b> gained more influence in urban areas as workers' and students' movements became active in the Independence <b>Front.</b> The Anti-Imperialist <b>Front</b> broke away from the Independence <b>Front</b> in September 1955. In November 1955 the Independence <b>Front</b> tried to oust al-Azhari through a vote in the House of Representatives. The Anti-Imperialist <b>Front</b> refused to support this action, and Hassan at-Taheer Zarouq abstained from voting. The Anti-Imperialist <b>Front</b> explained its position that it struggled for principles, rather against any particular individuals. Instead, the Anti-Imperialist <b>Front</b> called for a national unity government. This move alienated the Anti-Imperialist <b>Front</b> from both the government and the other opposition forces.|$|R

5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} <b>fronted</b> position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be <b>fronted</b> when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E

40|$|The Pathfinder AVHRR {{sea surface}} {{temperature}} (SST) data from 1985 – 1996 were processed with the Cayula-Cornillon edge detection and declouding algorithms. The following 11 <b>fronts</b> were distinguished: West Kamchatka, TINRO Basin, North and South Shelikhov Bay, North, West, Shantar, East Sakhalin, Central, Kashevarov Bank and Soya <b>fronts.</b> The large-scale pattern of these <b>fronts</b> {{is consistent with}} the dominant cyclonic circulation of the Okhotsk Sea. The West <b>Front,</b> TINRO Basin <b>Front,</b> Central <b>Front</b> and Shelikhov Bay <b>Fronts</b> have not been identified before. The West Kamchatka and TINRO Basin <b>fronts</b> form a double <b>front</b> observed in winter only. The North <b>Front</b> continues farther west than it was known, up to 146 °E, where it likely connects to the West <b>Front,</b> which often joins the Shantar <b>Front.</b> The latter extends from Shantar Islands to Sakhalin Bay where the Amur River Plume interrupts a nearly continuous line of <b>fronts</b> around the northern and western Okhotsk Sea. The Amur discharge feeds the East Sakhalin <b>Front</b> that follows the shelf break, branches eastward at 48 °N and 46 °N, and eventually merges with Soya <b>Front,</b> which exits the sea via Vries Strait. The 48 °N branch of the East Sakhalin <b>Front</b> seems to join the Central <b>Front,</b> which in turn merges with the TINRO Basin <b>Front,</b> thus forming the southern limb of the sea-wide frontal pattern. The Kashevarov Bank <b>Front</b> likely consists of three separate <b>fronts</b> around the namesake bank, St. Iona Island and Iona Bank. <b>Fronts</b> are seasonally persistent: they emerge and disappear in certain seasons in the same locations. Dominant frontogenetic mechanisms in the Okhotsk Sea are tidal mixing, water mass formation and advection, river discharge, and wind upwelling. Most <b>fronts</b> are generated owing to tidal mixing. <b>Front</b> genesis in the marginal ice zone and around polynyas is likely important; although these processes have not yet been investigated by in situ measurements...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards <b>fronted</b> by a four-board-high fence which was <b>fronted</b> with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E
