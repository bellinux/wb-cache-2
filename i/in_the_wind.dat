5|$|The Air Gates play a {{vital role}} in the Red Bull Air Race, but must also fulfill complex and {{contradictory}} demands. They have to be delicate enough to burst apart the instant they are touched by an aircraft and sturdy enough to remain stationary in all weather conditions, including stormy weather and strong winds. The early cylindrical pylons fulfilled the first criterion but proved to be too unstable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Umaga and Jeff Hardy for the WWE Intercontinental Championship.

Umaga avoided the move and charged Hardy in the corner. Umaga then performed a Samoan Spike and pinned Hardy after to win the match.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} the forest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> River Range is the primary destination for mountain climbers. Nine of the highest 10 peaks in Wyoming are here, and the mountains are primarily of granitic rock with countless cliffs and sheer rock walls. The Cirque of the Towers is particularly popular as it has numerous peaks within a relatively short distance of each other. Two particular climbs on the peaks in the cirque are considered amongst the finest climbing adventures available in the U.S. The Absaroka Range also attracts climbers but not of a technical nature since the rocks are not considered solid enough for good anchoring points. For the tallest peaks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> River Range, the entire summiting effort will take even experienced climbers many days due to the inaccessibility {{of the region and}} complexity of the climbing effort.|$|E

5|$|Weather fronts are {{boundaries}} between two masses of air of different densities, or different temperature and moisture properties, which normally are convergence zones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> field {{and are the}} principal cause of significant weather. Within surface weather analyses, they are depicted using various colored lines and symbols. The air masses usually differ in temperature and may also differ in humidity. Wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries.|$|E

5|$|For a short stretch, the Colorado {{watershed}} {{meets the}} drainage basin of the Snake River, {{a tributary of}} the Columbia River, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> River Range of western Wyoming. Southwest of there, the northern divide of the Colorado watershed skirts the edge of the Great Basin, bordering on the closed drainage basins of the Great Salt Lake and the Sevier River in central Utah, and other closed basins in southern Utah and Nevada. To the west in California, the Colorado River watershed borders on those of small closed basins in the Mojave Desert, the largest of which is the Salton Sea drainage north of the Colorado River Delta. On the south, the watersheds of the Sonoyta, Concepción, and Yaqui rivers, all of which drain to the Gulf of California, border that of the Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Gannett Glacier, on the {{northeast}} slope of Gannett Peak, is the largest single glacier in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. It has reportedly lost over 50percent of its volume since 1920 with 25percent of that occurring between the years 1980–1999. Upper Fremont Glacier has been studied {{more than any other}} glacier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> River Range. Scientist have obtained ice cores from the Upper Fremont Glacier and found that there have been measurable changes in the atmosphere over the past several hundred years. The Upper Fremont Glacier and the Quelccaya Ice Cap in the Andes of South America both show nearly identical atmospheric records, which indicate a global linkage of atmospheric conditions over time.|$|E

5|$|In 1873 Busch {{returned}} {{several times}} to Munich, and {{took part in the}} intense life of the Munich Art Society as an escape from provincial life. In 1877, in a last attempt to be a serious artist, he took a studio in Munich. He left Munich abruptly in 1881, after he disrupted a variety show and subsequently made a scene through the effects of alcohol The 1878 nine episode illustrated tale Eight Sheets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> describes how humans behave like animals when drunk. Busch's biographer Weissweiler felt the story was only superficially funny and harmless, but was a study on addiction and its induced state of delusion.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 at the {{beginning}} of the Second World War the College's records were moved to Thornbury Castle in Gloucestershire, the home of Major Algar Howard (the Norroy King of Arms). Meanwhile, on 10 and 11 May 1941 the College building was almost consumed by fire, which had already levelled all the buildings to the east of the College on Queen Victoria Street. The building was given up for lost, when a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> saved it. At the end of the war, all of the records were returned safely to the College.|$|E
5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues. The engineers {{did not realize that}} the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> tunnel would not allow the helicopter to move relative to the rotor, as it did in flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of the rotor pitching motion. The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, the rotor oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive breakup of the helicopter.|$|E

Later, Mulder digs up Mr. Matthews' casket and finds it filled with roots, his body missing. When Lisa's aunt, Linda, arrives at Karin's house to retrieve her niece, she is attacked and killed by an unseen force as tree branches sway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> above her. Karin enters the root cellar, and is revealed {{to be the source}} of the male voice Lisa heard earlier, due to her having Dissociative personality disorder brought on by abuse from her own father.|$|E
5|$|Swaying {{behaviour}} is practised by highly cryptic {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon and the stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum. These animals resemble vegetation with their coloration, strikingly disruptive body outlines with leaflike appendages, {{and the ability to}} sway effectively like the plants that they mimic. E. tiaratum actively sways back and forth or side to side when disturbed or when there is a gust of wind, with a frequency distribution like foliage rustling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> This behaviour may represent motion crypsis, preventing detection by predators, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two, and has accordingly also been described as a form of motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The {{battles of}} zduhaći were furious. They were {{accompanied}} by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees and whipped up dust. In Montenegro, it was considered dangerous to throw stones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> because that might knock out an eye of a zduhać, who would kill the culprit. A fighting zduhać was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket, while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhać; he should hit and not get hit. The victorious band of zduhaći would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes. The harvest in the coming season would thus be excellent for the victors and poor for the defeated zduhaći.|$|E

40|$|Two planar winding {{structures}} {{have been}} built to compare the characteristics of traditional and alternating <b>winding</b> methods. <b>The</b> alternating <b>winding</b> method reduces <b>the</b> potential difference of adjacent conductors, thus reducing substantially <b>the</b> self-capacitance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winding.</b> Measurements confirmed that the two inductors have similar equivalent inductance and low-frequency series resistance. However, <b>the</b> alternating <b>winding</b> method has a higher self resonant frequency. It is also evident that the reduction of self-capacitance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> not only increased the operating bandwidth of the device but also reduced the power losses of the inductor at high frequency. © 2010 The Institution of Engineering and Technology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
