5|$|The {{result was}} a {{sequence}} of innovative but unpopular <b>financial</b> <b>measures.</b> John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total {{during the reign of}} the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied {{in the absence of any}} actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including the planned town of Liverpool, and charters were sold for markets across the kingdom and in Gascony. The king introduced new taxes and extended existing ones. The Jews, who held a vulnerable position in medieval England, protected only by the king, were subject to huge taxes; £44,000 was extracted from the community by the tallage of 1210; much of it was passed on to the Christian debtors of Jewish moneylenders. John created a new tax on income and movable goods in 1207 – effectively a version of a modern income tax – that produced £60,000; he created a new set of import and export duties payable directly to the crown. John found that these measures enabled him to raise further resources through the confiscation of the lands of barons who could not pay or refused to pay.|$|E
5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various <b>financial</b> <b>measures</b> that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

25|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have designed numerous ways to measure performance {{and continue to}} do so at an increasing rate. Evidence for this observation can be found by tracking changes in performance measures over time. In the 19th century, companies measured their performance via industry-specific output and cost measures, such as newspaper circulation. By the 1920s, companies also began utilizing accounting-based returns measures, such as return on investment. And the 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of purely <b>financial</b> <b>measures</b> of performance relating information on dividends and return on equity. This dependence on performance measures has not diminished in recent years – on the contrary, the number of metrics that exist is growing at an even more accelerated rate. Today, in addition to <b>financial</b> <b>measures,</b> organizations examine nonfinancial metrics regarding leadership, information, planning, human resource utilization, and customer satisfaction. This proliferation in performance measurements has led to corresponding growth in the performance measurement industry – there has been a notable {{increase in the number of}} personnel {{and organizations}} devoted to examining performance-related metrics, such as certified public accountants and financial analysts.|$|E

25|$|An {{increasing}} number of economists and international commerce theorists have suggested that economic discrimination goes far {{beyond the bounds of}} individuals or businesses. The largest scale forms of economic discrimination, and the widest ranging, affect entire nations or global regions. Many consider that an open world economic system (globalization), which includes world bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), places countries at risk by practicing explicitly discriminatory techniques such as bilateral and regional bargaining, as well as asymmetrical trade balances and the maintaining of cheap force labor. Trade policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are often regarded as <b>financial</b> <b>measures</b> serving to economically oppress third world nations.|$|E

500|$|It was the {{prevailing}} wisdom that the House of Lords could not amend money bills, since only the House of Commons {{had the right}} to decide upon the resources the monarch could call upon. This did not, however, despite the apparent contradiction, prevent it from rejecting such bills outright. In 1860, with the repeal of the paper duties, all money bills were consolidated into a single budget. This denied the Lords the ability to reject individual components and the prospect of voting down the entire budget was seemingly unpalatable. It was only in 1909 that this possibility became a reality.

40|$|Purpose: Against a {{background}} of a customization imperative embraced by manufacturing firms in industrialised nations and the concomitant call for more balanced performance measurement systems (PMS), this study seeks to examine the mediating role of both non-financial and <b>financial</b> performance <b>measures</b> {{in the relationship between}} a firm 2 ̆ 7 s strategic orientation of flexible manufacturing and organisational performance. Design/methodology/approach: A path-analytical model is adopted using questionnaire data from 84 Australian manufacturing firms. Findings: The results indicate that, first, firms emphasising a flexible manufacturing strategy utilise non-financial as well as financial performance measures; second, these performance measures are associated with higher organisational performance; and third, there is a positive association between a firm 2 ̆ 7 s strategic emphasis on flexible manufacturing and organisation performance via non‐financial and <b>financial</b> performance <b>measures.</b> Practical implications: While there is agreement on the beneficial role of non-financial performance measures in supporting strategic priorities associated with customization strategies, equivocal research results have emerged on the role of <b>financial</b> performance <b>measures</b> in this context. The study underscores the importance of both non‐financial and <b>financial</b> performance <b>measures</b> in this context. Originality/value: The paper reinstates the value of <b>financial</b> performance <b>measures</b> for firms pursuing customization type strategies and adds to one 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of PMSs by exploring the intervening role of such systems in linking flexible manufacturing strategy to organisation performance...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: I use an {{experiment}} {{to examine how}} accurate versus inaccurate relative incentive weights on multiple measures that lead bottom-line financial results (i. e., lead measures) affects managerial performance. The experiment has three types of incentive contracts which reward different combinations of performance measures: only a lag <b>financial</b> <b>measure</b> (ONLYLAG), two lead measures and a lag <b>financial</b> <b>measure</b> (LEADLAG), or only two lead measures (ONLYLEAD). I find that adding lead measures to an incentive contract with only a lag measure (LEADLAG versus ONLYLAG) increases performance when the two lead measures have accurate relative weights, but does not decrease nor increase performance when the two lead measures have inaccurate relative weights. Hence, the addition of lead measures at best benefits performance when the relative weights on lead measures are accurate, and at worst does not harm performance when the relative weights on lead measures are inaccurate. I also find that removing the lag measure from the incentive contract (ONLYLEAD versus LEADLAG) increases performance when the two lead measures have accurate relative weights, but decreases performance when the two lead measures have inaccurate relative weights. The {{results suggest that the}} dysfunctional effect of having lead measures with inaccurate relative weights i...|$|R

However, Waring said that she would not have denied Muldoon confidence or supply.

2500|$|The cantonal {{constitution}} was rewritten in 2011. Before that, the constitution dates mainly from 1876, but was revised in 1898. Under the 1876/98 constitution, the legislature (Kantonsrat) {{is composed of}} members elected by {{a portion of the}} population and holds office for four years. Originally, each member of the Kantonsrat represented 600 people or a fraction thereof over 200 people. As the population has increased while the number of members has remained fixed at about 100, this has changed. , the 13 municipalities with the smallest population each elect one member of the Kantonsrat. The other 87 seats are divided between the remaining 17 municipalities based on population. The executive (Regierungsrat) consists of seven members who are elected by a popular vote, and hold office for four years. The two members of the federal Standerat and the four (three until 2003) of the federal Nationalrat are also chosen by a popular vote.
