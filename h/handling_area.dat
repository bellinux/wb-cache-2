5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like the flue stack and coal <b>handling</b> <b>area)</b> and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same contractors and suppliers as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that timespan had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{identification}} of Listeria spp. in food <b>handling</b> <b>areas</b> {{is of great}} concern to health surveillance agencies, and their control is often hampered by {{the ability of the}} bacteria to grow and maintain themselves even under adverse conditions. The present study aimed to isolate and identify Listeria spp. in the food <b>handling</b> <b>areas</b> of 10 retail food stores in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Eighty-six swab samples were collected from equipment, utensils and surfaces used for processing ready-to-eat meat products. The Dry and Wet Swabbing Methods (3 M™ Quick Swabs) and 3 M™ Petrifilm™ Plates were used to identify Listeria spp. Contamination by Listeria monocytogenes was confirmed by the Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). The hygienic and sanitary conditions of the food <b>handling</b> <b>areas</b> of each store were also assessed. Listeria spp. was isolated in eight stores (80 %). Of the 86 swab samples analyzed, 27 (31. 2 %) [confidence interval 21. 81 % to 42. 30 %] were positive for Listeria spp. and only one (3. 7 %) was confirmed as Listeria monocytogenes. The main contamination sites were the floor (50. 0 %), the plastic cutting board (42. 9 %) and the knife (40. 0 %). None of the hygienic and sanitary conditions assessed {{in the present study were}} associated with contamination by Listeria spp. (p = 0. 700). It was concluded that Listeria spp. was widely distributed in the retail food stores studied, being a possible risk factor for public health...|$|R
