A 16 T class superconducting magnet has been developed with a special coil configuration; one of the component coils produces a magnetic field the direction of which is opposite {{to that of the}} other coils. Thus, a large magnetic field gradient occurs, creating a magnetic force large enough to levitate water and hinder convection. This magnet system is operated in persistent mode, which is adequate for a rather time-requesting crystallization process of proteins. Preliminary experiments have shown that the protein crystallization process is substantially retarded in the magnetic force field...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} {{theory of}} magnetism, introduced by Faraday, is now looked upon by all physicists as correct. The older theory which assumes {{the existence of}} magnetic fluids covering {{the ends of the}} magnet is in some cases mathematically simpler, and is for this reason often made use of. This, however, is apt to breed confusion as to {{the true nature of the}} induction or polarization in any given case. The difficulty Tyndall experienced in accepting Faraday 2 ̆ 7 s views as to diamagnetism, is accounted for by the fact that he was thinking in terms of the fluid theory, while Faraday was considering the magnetic polarization in the <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>substance.</b> The object of this paper is to insist again upon the distinction between these two theories, and at the same time to consider some points in the induction theory itself. A number of diagrams will be described which illustrate the different aspects of the induction theory. They show how the molecules of the magnet are supposed to be polarized, and how this polarization is continued in the surrounding ether. The tubes of force, or 2 ̆ 2 polarization tubes, 2 ̆ 2 and the equipotential surfaces are drawn in each case according to Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s method. The figures must be revolved about the horizontal axis, so that the lines drawn will trace out, some the bounding surfaces between the tubes, and others the equipotential surfaces...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} an apparatus {{that makes it}} possible to observe and study magnetically levitated drops of superfluid helium. The force on a <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>substance</b> in a magnetic field is proportional to the gradient of the square of the magnetic field B. For the magnetic force on helium to be equal to the gravitational force on Earth, it is necessary for the product of B with the field gradient dB/d z to be 21. 5 T(exp 2) /cm. In addition, in order for the magnetic field to provide a stable trap, the value of B(exp 2) must increase in all directions in the horizontal plane that passes through the point where the field/field gradient product in the vertical direction has the critical value of 21. 5 T(exp 2) /cm. A specially designed superconducting magnet that meets these specifications has been installed in a large helium dewar with optical access. Helium drops levitated by the magnet can be viewed along the axis of the solenoid. The sample chamber within the bore of the magnet is thermally isolated from the magnet and helium reservoir. Its temperature can be varied between 4 and 0. 5 K, {{the lower part of the}} range being reached using a He- 3 refrigerator. Liquid helium can be injected into the magnetic trap using a small capillary. Once a drop is contained in the trap it can be held there indefinitely. With this apparatus we have conducted a number of different types of experiments on helium drops so as to gain information necessary for performing experiments in space. With magnetically levitated drops we are limited to working with drops of 1 cm. or less in diameter. The shape of the drops larger than a few mm diameter can be distorted by the profile of the magnetic field. The study of phenomena such as the initial motion of the surfaces of two drops as they just make contact, requires the use large drops to resolve the behavior of interest. We have performed a detailed investigation of the shape oscillations of superfluid drops...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis an account or the {{original}} investigations on {{several aspects of}} the dia-and paramagnetism has been given. In the introduction, the results obtained in the present investigations have been briefly discussed {{in the light of}} recent theoretical and experimental work on the subject. 1. During the course of these investigations, the want and accurate {{and at the same time}} quick method for the measurement or the diamagnetic susceptibility of solids and liquid was felt. Gouy's balance was found to be suitable for the purpose. It was modified by enclosing the usual tube inside another tube the inner tube, containing a paramagnetic substance permanently sealed in it, served also as a stopper to the outer tube, which contained the <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>substance.</b> Care was taken that the combined pull was always in the downward direction. This balance. has been fully described in details in chapter I 2. The Magnetic moments of Co++ and Ni++ ions, obtained by the study of pure organic salts, have been found to more or less lie between the two values calculated by the Boss-stoner and the Van vleck formulae, which goes to indicate that there is a partial quenching of the orbital moment. These small variation between the ionic moment values shown by different salts give some idea of the extent, to which the orbital moment is quenches. In the case of cupric copper, both simple and complex compounds have been studied. The complete agreement with the Boss-Stoner value shows the complete absence of any contribution due to the orbital moment. These results are presented in chapters II & III. 3. The method developed by Bhatnagar and his pupils on the assumption that diamagnetic values are completely additive, has been used to calculated the ionic susceptibility of rubidium as well as cuprous ion from the study of their inorganic salts, ions are yet available. The mean ionic susceptibilities and the ionic radii obtained in these two cases compare favourably with those of other workers. The results are given in Chapters IV and V. In the cases of rubidium salts, it has also been found out that temperature has practically no influence on the diamagnetism of the salts in either the dissolved or the solid state. In conformity with the Weidman additive law, the effect of concentration of the salt dissolved in water on the diamagnetic susceptibility has been found to be linear over the range of concentrations studied. The ionic susceptibility of the crystalline state. 4. The low values observed in the case of magnetic susceptibility of cuprous and cobaltous cyandies are more likely in the magnetic measurements or for want of purity of the of the compounds. Thiocyanates studies have susceptibility comparable with those of the other compounds. 5. In Chapter VI and VII are given the atomic susceptibilities constants for monovalent iodine, tetravalent silicon, pentavalent phosphorous, di- and tetravalent sulphur as obtained by using pascalâ€™s atomic susceptibility constants. These compare favourably with the theoretical values of Pauling, Salter and Angus. 6. In chapter VIII, the condition for successful working on the Bauer and Piecardâ€™s U-tube apparatus, in which complicate arise at higher temperatures due to change in the â€˜wettingâ€™ conditions, have been worked out. Neither classical nor quantum theories suggest that diamagnetism should be anything but indo-pendent of temperature. In a number of the common aromatic liquids that have been studied, it has been found that the diamagnetism of aromatic liquids is, in general, independent of temperature. The slight increase observed at higher temperature can be ascribed to the fact that the atmosphere above the menisci of the liquid assumed to the air in calculations must necessarily contain a large percentage of the vapour of the liquid. During the course of further investigations on aliphatic and aromatic iodides, the reverse phenomenon, namely a decrease in diamagnetic with the rise of temperature, has been observed. The anomalous behaviour of iodine in compounds of this type may be responsible for the decrease in diamagnetism at higher temperatures. 7. In Chapter IX, it has been shown that the vapors of when heated above 700 oC, thereby establishing that the become ground paramagnet state of S 2 as well as Se 2 molecules is 3 âˆ‘. On the other hand tellurium vapour remains diamagnetic upto 1100 oC. For working with Te 2 vapour still higher temperatures are need and the electri furnace employed in the present investigation were conducted, spectroscopical investigations had so far not been able to bring about a decision as to whether the ground states of Se 2, Te 2 Seo etc are 1 âˆ‘ or 3 âˆ‘. similar experiments with metallic thallium, given in chapter X, have shown that its vapour become paramagnetic; but at about 1000 oC, it attacks the envelope and again becomes diamagnetic. The diamagnetism at room temperature is associated with the polyatomic solid state and the paramgnetism, with the monoatomic vapour. 8. In chapter XI, a set up for a modified form of Deckerâ€™s balance with arrangements for working at different temperatures is described. Aromatic liquids, organic iodides and rubidium salts in the dissolved state have been investigated on this balance. 9. The authorâ€™s Bhatangar, F. R.

40|$|In 1846, Michael Faraday {{found that}} {{permanent}} magnets could cause candle flames to deform into equatorial disks. He {{believed that the}} change in flame shape {{was caused by the}} presence of charged particles within the flames interacting with the magnetic fields. Later researchers found that the interaction between the flame ions and the magnetic fields were much too small to cause the flame deflection. Through a force analysis, von Engel and Cozens showed that the change in the flame shape could be attributed to the diamagnetic flame gases in the paramagnetic atmosphere. Paramagnetism occurs in materials composed of atoms with permanent magnetic dipole moments. In the presence of magnetic field gradients, the atoms align with the magnetic field and are drawn into the direction of increasing magnetic field. Diamagnetism occurs when atoms have no net magnetic dipole moment.

40|$|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a {{convenient}} and noninvasive means {{for studying the}} internal structure of <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>substances.</b> The extraction of length scale information in liquid NMR spectroscopy is largely limited to sizes below the diffusion length (^ 50 microns).

This thesis examines the extraction of length-scale information from a relatively complex two-phase liquid system, specifically a poly-disperse oil/water emulsion. Theory is developed and then compared to experimental results, with good agreement. Simple scaling laws are identified which provide a simple means of using the technique for length scale measurements.

40|$|Diamagnetism {{prevails}} in the microworld. We have described mechanisms of macroscopic paramagnetism and macroscopic diamagnetism occurrence from microscopic diamagnetism. Magnetism exists {{both in the}} macroworld and in the microworld. In the microworld magnetism manifests itself as intrinsic magnetism of any and all microobjects. Microworld objects consist of neutrons, protons and electrons. Self-magnetic fields of these microobjects are not central. That is why they are described by magnetic moment vectors μn, μр and μе.

In addition, we verified that high gradient magnetic fields do not interfere with regular cellular activities. Previous results have established that: (1) intracellular magnetophoresis is possible; and (2) HGMF lead to root curvature. In order to investigate whether HGMF affect the assembly and/or organization of structural proteins, we examined the arrangement of microtubules in roots exposed to HGMF. The cytoskeletal investigations were performed with fomaldehyde-fixed, nonembedded tissue segments that were cut with a vibratome. Microtubules (MTs) were stained with rat anti-yeast tubulin (YOL 1 / 34) and DTAF-labeled antibody against rat IgG. Microfilaments (MFs) were visualized by incubation in rhodamine-labeled phalloidin.

40|$|In {{regard to}} magnetism, all {{substances}} may {{be divided into}} three classes, namely, ferro-, para-, and diamagnetic. Ferro-and para- magnetic substances offer less resistance (reluctance) to the lines of force of the magnetic field than the air, therefore the lines of force tend {{to be drawn into}} the substance. A sliver of such material tends to turn so that its long axis is {{in the direction of the}} field. In a heterogeneous field the material will be moved toward the stronger part of the field. These character-istics are easily observed in iron, but the motion of paramagnetic substances is so slight that it can be detected only by microscopic methods. <b>Diamagnetic</b> <b>substances,</b> contrary to the first two classes, offer more reluctance to the magnetic field than does the air. A sliver of such material tends to turn across the lines of force, and to be forced out of a heterogeneous field. Of the few papers proving an influence of a magnetic field upon living organisms, the most extensive refer to protoplasmic streaming. If this is an electrical phenomenon, it should be affected by a magnet. After several investigators had failed to find an effect, Ewart (1903) by using a stop-watch and an ocular micrometer, finally detected a retardation of the rate of stream-ing. He also found that certain elongated plant cells were paramagnetic; they swung in the direction of the applied mag-netic field. Ssawostin (1930 a) confirmed Ewart's findings, using algae. He could accelerate or retard the rate of streaming, depending upon the direction of the applied field. He attributed retarda-tion to friction between the protoplasm and the cell walls...|$|R
40|$|Static {{and dynamic}} {{magnetic}} fields {{have been used}} to control convection in many materials processing applications. In most of the applications, convection control (damping or enhancement) is achieved through the Lorentz force that can be tailored to counteract/assist dominant system flows. This technique has been successfully applied to liquids that are electrically conducting, such as high temperature melts of semiconductors, metals and alloys, etc. In liquids with low electrical conductivity such as ionic solutions of salts in water, the Lorentz force is weak and hence not very effective and alternate ways of flow control are necessary. If the salt in solution is paramagnetic then the variation of magnetic susceptibility with temperature and/or concentration can be used for flow control. For thermal buoyancy driven flows this can be accomplished in a temperature range below the Curie point of the salt. The magnetic force is proportional to the magnetic susceptibility and the product of the magnetic field and its gradient. By suitably positioning the experiment cell in the magnet, system flows can be assisted or countered, as desired. A similar approach can be extended to <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>substances</b> and fluids but the required magnetic force is considerably larger than that required for paramagnetic substances. The presentation will provide an overview of work to date on a NASA fluid physics sponsored project that aims to test the hypothesis of convective flow control using strong magnetic fields in protein crystal growth. The objective is {{to understand the nature of}} the various forces that come into play, delineate causative factors for fluid flow and to quantify them through experiments, analysis, and numerical modeling. The seminar will report specifically on the experimental results using paramagnetic salts and solutions in magnetic fields and compare them to analytical predictions. Applications of the concept to protein crystallization studies will be discussed. The use of strong magnetic fields for terrestrially simulating variable gravity environments and applications supporting the NASA Exploration Initiative will also be briefly discussed...|$|R
