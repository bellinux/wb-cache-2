This vector contains the complete bovine papilloma virus genome, a ColE 1 replication origin and a <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> conferring resistance to kanamycin in bacteria and G 418 in eukaryotic cells. A high number of G 418 R colonies are obtained after transfer of pCGBPV 9 into mouse C 127 cells.

This yeast also remains an interesting biotechnological model for the industrial production of value-added metabolites. The recent whole-genome sequencing of the C. guilliermondii ATCC 6260 reference strain provides an interesting resource for elucidating new molecular events supporting pathogenicity, antifungal resistance and for exploring the potential of yeast metabolic engineering. In the present study, we designed an efficient transformation system for C. guilliermondii wild-type strains using both nourseothricin- and hygromycin B-resistant markers. To demonstrate the potential of these drug-resistant cassettes, we carried out the disruption and the complementation of the C. guilliermondii FCY 1 gene (which encodes cytosine deaminase) known {{to be associated with}} flucytosine sensitivity in yeast.

An efficient method for targeted gene disruption has been developed. Cells with substitution of exogenous sequences into a chromosomal locus were enriched, by a factor of 100, using a positive genetic selection that specifically selects for homologous recombination at the targeted site. The selection is based on the conditional expression of a <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> by virtue of in-frame gene fusion with the target gene.

40|$|Parasexual genetic {{analysis}} of Candida albicans utilized the <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> that conferred resistance to mycophenolic acid. We cloned and sequenced the IMH 3 r gene from C. albicans strain 1006, which was previously identified as resistant to mycophenolic acid (MPA) (A. K. Goshorn and S. Scherer, Genetics 123 : 213 – 218, 1989). MPA is an inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase, an enzyme {{necessary for the}} de novo biosynthesis of GMP. G. A. Kohler et al. (J. Bacteriol. 179 : 2331 – 2338, 1997) {{have shown that the}} wild-type IMH 3 gene, when expressed in high copy number, will confer resistance to this antibiotic. We demonstrate that the IMH 3 r gene from strain 1006 has three amino acid changes, two of which are nonconservative, and demonstrate that {{at least two of the}} three mutations are required to confer resistance to MPA. We used this gene as a <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> in clinical isolates of C. albicans and Candida tropicalis. We also identified the presence of autonously replicating sequence elements that permit autonomous replication in the promoter region of this gene. Finally, we found the excision of a φ-type long terminal repeat element outside the IMH 3 open reading frame of the gene in some strains. We used the IMH 3 r allele to disrupt one allele of ARG 4 in two clinical isolates, WO- 1 and FC 18, thus demonstrating that a single ectopic integration of this <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> is sufficient to confer resistance to MPA...|$|E
40|$|The {{maintenance}} of mobile DNA sequences in clonal organisms {{has been seen}} as a paradox. If selfish mobile sequences spread through genomes only by overreplication in transposition, then sexuality is necessary for their spread through populations. The persistence of bacterial transposable elements without obvious <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> has previously been explained by horizontal transfer. However, advantageous insertions of mobile DNAs are known in bacteria. Here we model {{maintenance of}} an otherwise selfish mobile DNA element in a clonal species in which selection for null mutations occurs during one of two temporally alternating environments. Large areas of parameter space permit maintenance of mobile DNAs where, without selection, they would have gone extinct. Horizontal transfer diminishes, rather than enhances, mean copy number. In finite populations, effective population sizes are greatly reduced by selective sweeps, and mean copy number can be increased as the reduced variance in copy number results in reduced selection...|$|R

However, {{this is not}} possible in species for which <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> for genetic studies are unavailable. To overcome the limitation in <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> for the dermatophyte Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii (anamorph: Trichophyton mentagrophytes), we adapted the flippase (FLP) recombinase-recombination target (FRT) site-specific recombination system from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> recycling system for this fungus. Taking into account practical applicability, we designed FLP/FRT modules carrying two FRT sequences {{as well as the}} flp gene adapted to the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans (caflp) or a synthetic codon-optimized flp (avflp) gene with neomycin resistance (nptII) cassette for one-step marker excision. Both flp genes were under control of the Trichophyton rubrum copper-repressible promoter (PCTR 4). Molecular analyses of resultant transformants showed that only the avflp-harbouring module was functional in A. vanbreuseghemii. Applying this system, we successfully produced the Ku 80 recessive mutant strain devoid of any <b>selectable</b> <b>markers.</b> This strain was subsequently used as the recipient for sequential multiple disruptions of secreted metalloprotease (fungalysin) (MEP) or serine protease (SUB) genes, producing mutant strains with double MEP or triple SUB gene deletions. These results confirmed the feasibility of this system for broad-scale genetic manipulation of dermatophytes, advancing our understanding of functions and networks of individual genes in these fungi...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{improvement}} of industrial yeast strains is restricted by {{the availability of}} <b>selectable</b> transformation <b>markers.</b> Antibiotic resistance markers have to be avoided for public health reasons, while auxotrophy markers are generally not useful for wine yeast strain transformation because most industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains are prototrophic. For this work, we performed a comparative study of the usefulness of two alternative <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> in both episomic and centromeric plasmids. Even though the selection for sulfite resistance conferred by FZF 1 - 4 resulted in {{a larger number of}} transformants for a laboratory strain, the p-fluoro-DL-phenylalanine resistance conferred by ARO 4 -OFP resulted in a more suitable selection marker for all industrial strains tested. Both episomic and centromeric constructions carrying this marker resulted in transformation frequencies close to or above 103 transformants per µg of DNA for the three wine yeast strains tested.

Expression of a <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> {{driven by the}} thyroglobulin promoter was also inhibited. Somatic cell hybridization of transformed and differentiated thyroid cells resulted in extinction of thyroglobulin {{gene expression}}. When transformed cells carrying a <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> driven by the thyroglobulin promoter were fused to differentiated cells and expression of this marker was selected, we obtained stable hybrid cell lines expressing both the endogenous and the exogenous thyroglobulin promoters. Although the expression of v-ras remained unchanged compared with expression in the parental transformed cells, transformation was suppressed in the hybrid cell lines. The other thyroid differentiation markers, iodide uptake and thyroid-stimulating hormone-dependent growth, were inhibited in all the hybrids tested. We show that activity of the thyroglobulin promoter correlates {{with the presence of}} a thyroid nuclear factor that binds the promoter at position - 60 from the transcription start site. Loss of this factor accompanies the extinction of thyroglobulin gene expression in hybrids selected for expression of a non-thyroid-specific promoter...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe yeast, Candida guilliermondii, {{has been}} widely studied due to its biotechnological {{interest}} {{as well as its}} biological control potential. It integrates foreign DNA predominantly via ectopic events, likely through the well-known non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway involving the Ku 70 p/Ku 80 p heterodimer, Lig 4 p, Nej 1 p and Lif 1 p. This phenomenon remains highly deleterious for targeted gene knock-out strategies that require the homologous recombination process. Here, we have constructed a ku 70 mutant strain derived from the ATCC 6260 reference strain of C. guilliermondii. Following a series of disruption attempts of various genes (FCY 1, ADE 2 and TRP 5), using several previously described <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> (URA 5, SAT- 1 and HPH#), we demonstrated that the efficiencies of homologous gene targeting in such a NHEJ-deficient strain was very high compared to the wild type strain.

40|$|We {{describe}} a general strategy for cloning mammalian genes whose downregulation {{results in a}} selectable phenotype. This strategy is based on expression selection of genetic suppressor elements (GSEs), cDNA fragments encoding either specific peptides that act as dominant inhibitors of protein function or antisense RNA segments that efficiently inhibit gene expression. Since GSEs counteract the gene from which they are derived, {{they can be used}} as <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> for the phenotype associated with downregulation of the corresponding gene. A retroviral library containing random fragments of normalized (uniform abundance) cDNA expressed in mouse NIH 3 T 3 cells was used to select for GSEs inducing resistance to the anticancer drug etoposide. Three GSEs were isolated, two of which are derived from unknown genes and the third encodes antisense RNA for the heavy chain of a motor protein kinesin. The kinesin-derived GSE induces resistance to several DNA-damaging drugs and immortalizes senescent mouse embryo fibroblasts, indicating that kinesin is involved in the mechanisms of drug sensitivity and in vitro senescence. Expression of the human kinesin heavy-chain gene was decreased in four of four etoposide-resistant HeLa cell lines, derived by conventional drug selection, indicating that downregulation of kinesin represents a natural mechanism of drug resistance in mammalian cells...|$|R

Insertion of the AcMNPV apoptosis suppressor gene (p 35) into the genome of p 35 -deletion mutants inhibited premature host cell death and increased virus yields up to 1200 -fold at low multiplicities in Spodoptera frugiperda (SF 21) cell cultures. When placed under control of an early virus promoter, the bacterial neomycin resistance gene (neo) restored multiplication of AcMNPV in the same cells treated with concentrations of the antibiotic G 418 that inhibited wild-type virus growth greater than 1000 -fold. The selectivity of these dominant markers was compared by serial passage of recombinant virus mixtures. After four passages, the proportion of p 35 -containing virus increased as much as 2, 000, 000 -fold relative to deletion mutants, whereas the proportion of neo-containing viruses increased 500 -fold relative to wild-type virus under G 418 selection. The strength and utility of p 35 as a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> was further demonstrated by the construction of AcMNPV expression vectors using polyhedrin-based transfer plasmids that contain p 35. Recombinant viruses with foreign gene insertions at the polyhedrin locus accounted for 15 to 30 % of the transfection progeny. The proportion of desired viruses was increased to greater than 90 % by linearizing the parental virus DNA at the intended site of recombination prior to transfection. These results indicate that p 35 and neo facilitate the selection of baculovirus recombinants and that p 35, in particular, is an effective marker for the generation of AcMNPV expression vectors...|$|R
40|$|Xylose {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{fermentable}} sugars present in cellulosic biomass, second only to glucose. However, Saccharomyces spp., the best sugar-fermenting microorganisms, are not able to metabolize xylose. We developed recombinant plasmids that can transform Saccharomyces spp. into xylose-fermenting yeasts. These plasmids, designated pLNH 31, - 32, - 33, and - 34, are 2 μm-based high-copy-number yeast-E. coli shuttle plasmids. In addition to the geneticin resistance and ampicillin resistance genes that serve as <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>markers,</b> these plasmids also contain three xylose-metabolizing genes, a xylose reductase gene, a xylitol dehydrogenase gene (both from Pichia stipitis), and a xylulokinase gene (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae). These xylose-metabolizing genes were also fused to signals controlling gene expression from S. cerevisiae glycolytic genes. Transformation of Saccharomyces sp. strain 1400 with each of these plasmids resulted in the conversion of strain 1400 from a non-xylose-metabolizing yeast to a xylose-metabolizing yeast that can effectively ferment xylose to ethanol and also effectively utilizes xylose for aerobic growth. Furthermore, the resulting recombinant yeasts also have additional extraordinary properties. For example, the synthesis of the xylose-metabolizing enzymes directed by the cloned genes in these recombinant yeasts does not require the presence of xylose for induction, nor is the synthesis repressed by the presence of glucose in the medium. These properties make the recombinant yeasts able to efficiently ferment xylose to ethanol and also able to efficiently coferment glucose and xylose present in the same medium to ethanol simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{transforming}} Tetrahymena {{has been established}} earlier, but its application has been limited {{because of the lack}} of <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> other than the rRNA-encoding DNA (rDNA). Mutations in the yeast ribosomal protein L 29 gene (CYH 2) are known that confer cycloheximide resistance. We have cloned and sequenced the homologue of this gene from both a wild-type and a cycloheximide-resistant (ChxA) strain of Tetrahymena. Surprisingly, a comparison shows that the ChxA mutation is not present in the CYH 2 homologue. We therefore created the yeast mutations in the Tetrahymena gene by site-directed mutagenesis and used them to transform Tetrahymena either with or without linking to an rDNA vector. All clones transformed by the rDNA vector also became resistant to cycloheximide when the rDNA contained the engineered mutant genes. Without the rDNA vector, the mutant genes transform approximately 1 % of injected cells to become resistant to cycloheximide. DNA analysis indicates that transformation occurs by replacement of the host sequence and not by random integration of the injected sequence. The replacement occurs to some but not all copies of this gene in the polyploid macronuclear genome. Thus, transformation in Tetrahymena occurs by specific sequence replacement, and the injected mutant genes can serve as <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> transformation <b>markers</b> in this organism...|$|R

Hygromycin B {{is the most common}} <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> used in the molecular manipulation of Histoplasma capsulatum in the generation of knockout strains of H. capsulatum or as a marker in mutant strains. hph-expressing organisms appear to have no defect in long-term in vitro growth and survival and have been successfully used to exploit host-parasite interaction in short-term cell culture systems and animal experiments. We introduced the hph gene as a selectable marker together with the gene encoding green fluorescent protein into wild-type strains of H. capsulatum. Infection of mice with hph-expressing H. capsulatum yeast cells at sublethal doses resulted in lethality. The lethality was not attributable to the site of integration of the hph construct into the genomes or to the method of integration and was not H. capsulatum strain related. Death of mice was not caused by altered cytokine profiles or an overwhelming fungal burden. The lethality was dependent on the kinase activity of hygromycin phosphotransferase. These results should raise awareness of the potential detrimental effects of the hph gene...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background An {{available}} whole genome sequence for Aspergillus flavus {{provides the}} opportunity to characterize factors involved in pathogenicity and to elucidate the regulatory networks involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis. Functional analysis of genes within the genome is greatly facilitated by the ability to disrupt or mis-express target genes and then evaluate their result on the phenotype of the fungus. Large-scale functional analysis requires an efficient genetic transformation system {{and the ability to}} readily select transformants with altered expression, and usually requires generation of double (or multi) gene deletion strains or the use of prototrophic strains. However, <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>markers,</b> an efficient transformation system and an efficient screening system for transformants in A. flavus are absent. Results The efficiency of the genetic transformation system for A. flavus based on uracil auxotrophy was improved. In addition, A. flavus was shown {{to be sensitive to the}} antibiotic, phleomycin. Transformation of A. flavus with the ble gene for resistance to phleomycin resulted in stable transformants when selected on 100 μg/ml phleomycin. We also compared the phleomycin system with one based on complementation for uracil auxotrophy which was confirmed by uracil and 5 -fluoroorotic acid selection and via transformation with the pyr 4 gene from Neurospora crassa and pyrG gene from A. nidulans in A. flavus NRRL 3357. A transformation protocol using pyr 4 as a <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> resulted in site specific disruption of a target gene. A rapid and convenient colony PCR method for screening genetically altered transformants was also developed in this study. Conclusion We employed phleomycin resistance as a new positive <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> for genetic transformation of A. flavus. The experiments outlined herein constitute the first report of the use of the antibiotic phleomycin for transformation of A. flavus. Further, we demonstrated that this transformation protocol could be used for directed gene disruption in A. flavus. The significance of this is twofold. First, it allows strains to be transformed without having to generate an auxotrophic mutation, which is time consuming and may result in undesirable mutations. Second, this protocol allows for double gene knockouts when used in conjunction with existing strains with auxotrophic mutations. To further facilitate functional analysis in this strain we developed a colony PCR-based method that is a rapid and convenient method for screening genetically altered transformants. This work will be of interest to those working on molecular biology of aflatoxin metabolism in A. flavus, especially for functional analysis using gene deletion and gene expression. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of these experiments {{was to develop}} strategies for creation and identification of recombinant mutant Epstein-Barr viruses (EBV). EBV recombinant molecular genetics has been limited to mutations within a short DNA segment deleted from a nontransforming EBV and an underlying strategy which relies on growth transformation of primary B lymphocytes for identification of recombinants. Thus, mutations outside the deletion or mutations which affect transformation cannot be easily recovered. In these experiments we investigated whether a toxic drug resistance gene, guanine phosphoribosyltransferase or hygromycin phosphotransferase, driven by the simian virus 40 promoter can be recombined into the EBV genome and can function to identify B-lymphoma cells infected with recombinant virus. Two different strategies were used to recombine the drug resistance marker into the EBV genome. Both utilized transfection of partially permissive, EBV-infected B 95 - 8 cells and positive selection for cells which had incorporated a functional drug resistance gene. In the first series of experiments, B 95 - 8 clones were screened for transfected DNA that had recombined into the EBV genome. In the second series of experiments, the transfected drug resistance marker {{was linked to the}} plasmid and lytic EBV origins so that it was maintained as an episome and could recombine with the B 95 - 8 EBV genome during virus replication. The recombinant EBV from either experiment could be recovered by infection and toxic drug selection of EBV-negative B-lymphoma cells. The EBV genome in these B-lymphoma cells is frequently an episome. Virus genes associated with latent infection of primary B lymphocytes are expressed. Expression of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA- 2) and the EBNA- 3 genes is variable relative to that of EBNA- 1, as is characteristic of some naturally infected Burkitt tumor cells. Moreover, the EBV-infected B-lymphoma cells are often partially permissive for early replicative cycle gene expression and virus replication can be induced, in contrast to previously reported in vitro infected B-lymphoma cells. These studies demonstrate that <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> can be inserted into the EBV genome, are active {{in the context of the}} EBV genome, and can be used to recover recombinant EBV in B-lymphoma cells. This system should be particularly useful for recovering EBV genomes with mutations in essential transforming genes...|$|R

40|$|We have {{isolated}} mutants of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) which carry a <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> <b>marker</b> {{inserted into}} the third exon of the gene encoding two membrane proteins, TP 1 and TP 2 (or LMP 2 A and LMP 2 B), which are expressed in latently infected, growth-transformed B cells. One of the mutants also acquired a 260 -bp deletion beginning in the first intron a few base pairs from the terminal repeats and removing most of the second TP exon, including the initial coding sequences of TP 2. These EBV mutants transform human B cells in culture, and the transformed B-cell clones carrying them release EBV at approximately normal frequencies...|$|E
40|$|The <b>dominant</b> <b>selectable</b> Kanr <b>marker,</b> which confers geneticin {{resistance}} in yeast, is extensively used for PCR based disruption of genes in functional analysis studies in laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We {{have developed a}} gene disruption cassette, which incorporates the Kanr marker, and direct repeat sequences designed from the target gene to enable the deletion of the gene without the introduction of added DNA sequences. We report on the disruption of the HO gene as a test case, using the hodr-Kanr-hodr cassette. The cassette was shown to integrate at the HO locus and the Kanr marker excised by recombination between the two direct repeat sequences. The disruption/excision event resulted in the removal of one direct repeat and the coding sequence of the gene, and hence in this case loss of HO function, {{with the introduction of}} no foreign or additional sequences, including the Kanr marker. Having been derived from the target site, the remaining direct repeat sequence is native sequence in its native location. This design template {{has the potential to be}} adapted to other genes, and as such will be of advantage in instances such as the optimization of strains by recombinant DNA technology where the retention of minimal or no foreign sequences is desired.

50|$|Positive <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> are <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> that confer {{selective}} {{advantage to the}} host organism. An example would be antibiotic resistance, which allows the host organism to survive antibiotic selection.|$|R
50|$|Negative <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> are <b>selectable</b> <b>markers</b> that {{eliminate}} or inhibit {{growth of}} the host organism upon selection. An example would be thymidine kinase, which makes the host sensitive to ganciclovir selection.|$|R
