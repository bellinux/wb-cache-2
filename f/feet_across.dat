5|$|Wallingford Castle was {{probably}} built by Robert D'Oyly between 1067 and 1071. Robert had married Wigod's daughter Ealdgyth, and ultimately inherited {{many of his}} father-in-law's lands. The wooden castle {{was built in the}} north-east corner of the town, taking advantage of the old Anglo-Saxon ramparts, with the motte close to the river overlooking the ford, and required substantial demolition work {{to make room for the}} new motte-and-bailey structure. Unusually, it appears that the castle was constructed on top of high-status Anglo-Saxon housing, probably belonging to former housecarls. The motte today is 60 metres (197 <b>feet)</b> <b>across</b> and 13 metres (43 feet) high. Robert endowed a sixteen-strong college of priests within the castle, which he named St Nicholas College.|$|E

25|$|PLLs are ubiquitous—they tune clocks {{in systems}} several <b>feet</b> <b>across,</b> {{as well as}} clocks in small {{portions}} of individual chips. Sometimes the reference clock may not actually be a pure clock at all, but rather a data stream with enough transitions that the PLL is able to recover a regular clock from that stream. Sometimes the reference clock is the same frequency as the clock driven through the clock distribution, other times the distributed clock may be some rational multiple of the reference.|$|E
25|$|The {{detonation}} {{turned the}} TNT into {{a mass of}} highly pressurized gas and produced a large fireball and mushroom shaped cloud. The resulting crater was 240 <b>feet</b> <b>across</b> and within minutes partially filled with water. Unexpectedly, the crater also had a central updraft similar to moon craters which resulted in much speculation by the scientists. Many target objects were moved and damaged by the overpressure blast, especially the heavy rockets, and two M113 armored personnel carriers were flipped on their side. After the test, a full {{cross section of the}} crater was excavated to analyze the effects below ground.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, {{disabled}} UC Irvine medical professor Robin Eckert sued Depp {{and three}} security firms, {{claiming to have}} been attacked by his bodyguards at a concert in Los Angeles in 2011.

She argued in court that, as the security guards' direct manager, Depp failed to intervene, {{even though he did}} not actively take part in the battery. In October 2012, it was decided that Eckert could seek compensation and punitive damages from Depp, with a trial date set for August 12, 2013. Depp ultimately settled with Eckert for an undisclosed sum.|$|E
25|$|The {{prominent}} cartouch on the 1955 addition {{became a}} symbol of the Titche-Goettinger company and can be found {{in other areas of the}} building. It is made of solid Indiana limestone and stands 28 feet high by 26 <b>feet</b> <b>across,</b> covering part of the building's fifth, sixth and seventh floors. The design was created by the architectural firm of Thomas Jameson and Merrill. The center portion is topped by a star signifying the Lone Star State and Titche's place in it. On each side of the star are live oak leaves mixed in with cactus blossoms. Below the star on the left is a scale indicating full measure and value. On the right, a ship indicating the world of commerce. Nine cotton bolls are indicative of Texas farm life and the textile industry, and on the right are the initials of the store.

25|$|The {{test was}} {{performed}} at 11:00 MST on August 9, 1968 at the Watching Hill blast {{range of the}} Defence Research Establishment Suffield, a permanent facility {{able to carry out}} large HE test up to 500 tons operated by the Defence Research Board. The charge was constructed of 31,676 blocks of TNT of various sizes mainly the 12x12x4 inch typically used in HE tests. Unlike previous 500-ton tests however, the charge was built as a sphere tangent to the ground, which would make it smaller in diameter than the 500-ton hemispheres but equal in yield. Detonation was accomplished with CE/TNT boosters placed in the center. The sphere was supported by styrofoam rings and blocks and once completed resembled a hemisphere atop a cylinder. After detonation, the flame front reached the charge surface in approximately half a second and produced a fireball and destructive overpressures. Debris up to ¾ inch in diameter continued to rain down for almost 8 minutes after detonation in the vicinity of ground zero. The resulting crater measuring 270 <b>feet</b> <b>across</b> filled rapidly with water and was subsequently excavated for studying the ground effects.|$|E

25|$|By 1961 a {{final plan}} for the new system {{was sent to the}} boards of {{supervisors}} of each of the five counties. The system's initial plans were for three branches traversing the San Francisco Bay and connecting Concord in the east, Richmond in the northeast, Fremont in the southeast; a crossing of the Golden Gate connecting San Francisco to Novato in the northwest; and a final branch running along the Peninsula from Palo Alto. However, in April 1962 San Mateo County opted out, citing high costs, existing service provided by Southern Pacific commuter trains, and concerns over shoppers leaving their county for stores in San Francisco. This left Daly City (still in San Mateo County, but only a few <b>feet</b> <b>across</b> the county line) as the southwest terminus. Marin County followed soon thereafter in May, being forced out of the BART district due to engineering objections from {{the board of directors of}} the Golden Gate Bridge and fear that Marin voters would not approve the bonds, which had to win more than 60% approval. The withdrawal also resulted in the cancellation of the Geary Subway section of the system. The BART plans were finally approved by the voters of the three remaining participating counties in November 1962.|$|E
25|$|A {{pit latrine}} {{generally}} {{consists of three}} major parts: {{a hole in the}} ground, a slab or floor with a small hole, and a shelter. The shelter is often known as an outhouse. The pit is typically at least 3meters (10feet) deep and 1m (3.2 <b>feet)</b> <b>across.</b> The World Health Organization recommends they be built a reasonable distance from the house balancing issues of easy access versus that of smell. The distance from groundwater and surface water should be as large as possible to decrease the risk of groundwater pollution. The hole in the slab should not be larger than 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) to prevent children falling in. Light should be prevented from entering the pit to reduce access by flies. This may require the use of a lid to cover the hole in the floor when not in use. When the pit fills to within 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) of the top, it should be either emptied or a new pit constructed and the shelter moved or re-built at the new location. Fecal sludge management involves emptying pits as well as transporting, treating and using the collected fecal sludge. If this is not carried out properly, water pollution and public health risks can occur.|$|E
25|$|Nest {{building}} in India commences {{during the peak}} of the monsoon with most of the nests initiated during September – November, with few new nests built afterwards until January. They nest in large and isolated trees on which they build a platform. The nest is large, as much as 3 to 6 <b>feet</b> <b>across</b> and made up of sticks, branches and lined with rushes, water-plants and sometimes with a mud plaster on the edges. Nests may be reused year after year. The usual clutch is four eggs which are dull white in colour and broad oval in shape, but varies from one to five eggs. The exact incubation period is not known but is expected to be about 30 days. The chicks hatch with white down which is replaced by a darker grey down on the neck within a week. The scapular feathers emerge first followed by the primaries. The young birds make a chack sound followed by a repeated wee-wee-wee calls. Adult birds take turns at the nest and when one returns to relieve the other, they perform a greeting display with open wings and an up and down movement of the head. Food is brought for the young chicks by the adults and regurgitated onto the nest platform. Adults stop feeding the young at the nest and begin to show aggression towards the chicks after they are about 3 or 4 months old. The young birds may stay on nearby for about a year but disperse soon. Typically one to three chicks fledge from successful nests, but up to five chicks fledge in years with high rainfall. The number of stork pairs that succeed in raising chicks, and the average size of fledged broods, are related to monsoonal and post-monsoon rainfall, improving in years with higher rainfall.|$|E
