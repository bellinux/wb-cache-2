5|$|After much deliberation, Raskolnikov sneaks into Alyona Ivanovna's apartment, {{where he}} murders {{her with an}} axe. He also kills her half-sister, Lizaveta, who <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> stumble upon {{the scene of the}} crime. Shaken by his actions, Raskolnikov manages to steal only a handful of items and a small purse, leaving much of the pawn-broker's wealth untouched. Raskolnikov then flees and, due to a series of coincidences, manages to leave unseen and undetected.|$|E
5|$|As the One Point Five fleet {{enters the}} Solar System, the Nine Limbeds orbit and observe Earth in cigar-shaped craft, {{sparking}} numerous UFO sightings. A Grand Galactic member, who <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be passing by, stops {{to observe the}} effects of Silent Thunder {{and returns to the}} Grand Galactic collective, who immediately suspend the One Point Fives's destruct orders pending further investigation.|$|E
5|$|Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are {{originally}} German names, {{which might}} {{indicate that the}} poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime and what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> him later seem to be taken from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.|$|E

50|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have claimed that}} people think good things are more likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them than to others, whereas bad events were less likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them than to others.But others {{have pointed out that}} prior work tended to examine good outcomes that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be common (such as owning one's own home) and bad outcomes that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be rare (such as being struck by lightning).Event frequency accounts for a proportion of prior findings of comparative optimism. People think common events (such as living past 70) are more likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them than to others, and rare events (such as living past 100) are less likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them than to others.|$|R
5|$|Bumblebee is {{the name}} of a {{prominent}} character in the Transformers franchise. His name denotes his black-on-yellow vehicle paint job, directly referencing the bee genus because of its black and yellow stripes. Bumblebee is also the name of an automotive racing stripe that wraps around the grill instead of down the centre of the vehicle; it can be found mainly on Chevrolet Camaros (which <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be the Transformers Autobot's most popular vehicle mode).|$|E
5|$|Climate {{research}} on live coral species {{is limited to}} a few studied species. Studying Porites coral provides a stable foundation for geochemical interpretations that is much simpler to physically extract data in comparison to Platygyra species where the complexity of Platygyra species skeletal structure creates difficulty when physically sampled, which <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be one of the only multidecadal living coral records used for coral paleoclimate modeling.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{promoted}} officer Ali Khan (Uday Chopra) and Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan) {{are introduced}} to Shonali Bose (Bipasha Basu), a special officer assigned to investigate Mr. A's case, who also <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be a former classmate of Jai.

5|$|Other {{characters}} {{developed by}} Barbery {{in the novel}} include Kakuro Ozu, the cultured Japanese businessman, and Manuela, a Portuguese cleaner. Ozu, a tenant, shares Paloma's fascination with Renée's masked intelligence and brings {{her out of her}} shell (and also <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> set the entire book in forward motion), while Manuela is responsible for cleaning the apartments' toilets and is Renée's only real friend.|$|E
5|$|Some eye defects may {{naturally}} {{change for}} the better with age or in cycles (ophthalmologist Stewart Duke-Elder suggested that this is what happened with Aldous Huxley). A cataract when first setting in sometimes results in much improved eyesight for a short time.

5|$|The more marine species, such as petrels, auks and gannets, {{are more}} {{restricted}} in their habits, but are occasionally seen inland as vagrants.

5|$|As the town, where Hamasaki {{is sitting}} on the bench, starts to rain, the {{atmosphere}} where Hamasaki is the doll starts to rain as well. Just after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki looking at the now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing the doll to fall on the ground and its strings become tangled. This <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings attached to her. Hamasaki, sitting on the bench, starts to cry and sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who finishes day dreaming about the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E
5|$|Bayona {{cut parts}} of the script, {{including}} {{the outcome of the}} other orphanage children, because he wanted to focus on the character of Laura and what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> her. To create the film as he wanted, Bayona had to double both the film's budget and the amount of filming time. To accomplish this, Bayona received help from fellow film director Guillermo del Toro, whom he had met at Festival de Cine de Sitges when del Toro was presenting his film Cronos (1993). Del Toro offered to co-produce the film as soon as he learned about it. For the rest of his crew, Bayona worked with his regular team that he worked with on commercials and music videos.|$|E

5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> encounter.|$|E
5|$|Jack {{realizes that}} his boss Don Geiss (Rip Torn) is hinting {{that he will}} retire and {{believes}} that he, Jack, is a definite candidate to take over Don's job, as the CEO of General Electric. Jack's only other opposition is Devon, who has returned from the west coast, only now with a fiancée who <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot), Don's daughter. Upon returning, Devon, who is secretly gay, finds out from Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) about Jack's secret heart attack. At a gathering at Don's house, the pair face off against one another during a game of football.|$|E

Mr. Lim, who <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be nearby, tries {{to protect his}} son, but suffers head trauma after being pushed down the stairs. He is taken to a hospital, {{critically}} injured. On his deathbed, Mr. Lim tells Chengcai that he loves him {{and that he should}} pursue his talent for fighting and then die. Witnessing this scene, the principal is touched and allows Chengcai to return to school. The boy eventually becomes an internationally recognised martial artist.|$|E
