50|$|The {{helicopter}} rotor {{is powered}} by the engine, through the transmission, to the rotating mast. The mast is a cylindrical metal shaft that extends upward from—and is driven by—the transmission. At {{the top of the}} mast is the attachment point for the rotor blades called the hub. The rotor blades are then attached to the hub, and the hub can have 10-20 times the drag of the blade. Main rotor systems are classified according to how the main rotor blades are attached and move relative to the main rotor hub. There are three basic classifications: hingeless, teetering, and fully articulated, although some modern rotor systems use a combination of these classifications. A rotor is a finely tuned rotating mass, and different subtle adjustments reduce vibrations at different airspeeds. The rotors are designed to operate at a <b>fixed</b> <b>RPM</b> (within a narrow range of a few percent), but a few experimental aircraft used variable speed rotors.|$|E

This thesis deals with the finding of the best air-fuel ratio to be input into the Engine Control Unit (ECU) so that the ECU can manage the engine properly. Simulation of experiment of effect of variable AFR at variable manifold pressure for <b>fixed</b> <b>RPM</b> is run using GT-Power software. Hence a modified single cylinder diesel engine to run on CNG is studied and parameters are taken from the engine to be input into the template library of GT-Power software.

As for the air-fuel ratio (AFR), the range is from 12. 5 to 21. The results obtained from the simulation are viewed using GT-Post. The data are then transfer to Microsoft Excel to plot out the graph. From the graph, the best AFR is determined and input into the AFR table of Megatune software and burn into the ECU. Result shows that the engine operate well on lean mixture for all condition.

The tensile properties of the surface composites increased with the increase in the volume percentage of the Al 2 O 3 particles.

Results showed that the grain size profile was independent of feed speed and the hardness values decreased by increase in feed speed. Increase in feed speed led to a slight improvement of yield strength and ultimate tensile strength, associated to continuous spring-like morphology of stir bands acting as a strengthening structure. However, ductility reduces considerably from 57 to 27 %. Moreover, it is observed that during tensile test, fracture cracks originate exactly adjacent to the stir bands...|$|R

40|$|Resale Price Maintenance is a {{vertical}} contract {{in which a}} manufacturer sets the retail price. Traditional motivations for RPM are that it can avoid double marginalisation and provide incentives for complementary service provision. This paper explores a new and complementary role for Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) {{as part of a}} price skimming strategy. <b>RPM</b> <b>fixes</b> the price path in dynamic markets. I argue that fixing the price path can improve upon price skimming strategies by providing commitment to future prices. Using a legislation change that deemed RPM illegal as a natural experiment, the effect of RPM as a commitment device is analysed empirically in two steps. First, using detailed and comprehensive retail sales data from the Norwegian book market, I show that in the absence of RPM, price skimming falters. Prices fall faster over the lifecycle and demand shifts from consumers buying early at high prices to later at lower prices. I then turn to quantify the dynamic effects of RPM. A distinction is made between two effects of RPM: it both eliminates price competition between retailers and coordinates prices over time. To separate out the price discrimination effect, I estimate a dynamic demand model and evaluate the returns to counterfactual vertical contracts in a dynamic oligopoly equilibrium model at the estimated parameters. ...|$|R

The experiments are conducted with two surface conditions: smooth walls and 45 ?? angled ribbed walls. The channel aspect ratios include 4 : 1, 2 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 4. Four Reynolds numbers are studied: 5000, 10000, 25000 and 40000. The rotation speed is <b>fixed</b> at 550 <b>rpm</b> for all tests, and for each channel, two channel orientations are studied: 90 ?? and 45 ?? or 135 ??, {{with respect to the}} plane of rotation. Rib turbulators are placed on the leading and trailing walls of the channels at an angle of 45 ?? to the flow direction. The ribs have a 1. 59 by 1. 59 mm square cross section, and the rib pitch-to-height ratio (P/e) is 10 for all tests. The effects of the local buoyancy parameter and channel aspect ratio on the regional Nusselt number ratio are presented. Pressure drop data are also measured for both smooth and ribbed channels in rotating and non-rotating conditions. The results show that increasing the local buoyancy parameter increases the Nusselt number ratio on the trailing surface and decreases the Nusselt number ratio on the leading surface in the first pass for all channels. However, the trend of the Nusselt number ratio in the second pass is more complicated due to the strong effect of the 180 ?? turn. Results are also presented for this critical turn region of the two-pass channels. In addition to these regions, the channel averaged heat transfer, friction factor, and thermal performance are determined for each channel. With the channels having comparable Nusselt number ratios, the 1 : 4 channel has the superior thermal performance because it incurs the least pressure penalty. In this study, the author is able to systematically analyze, correlate, and conclude the thermal performance comparison with the combination of rotation effects on five different aspect ratio channels with both smooth walls and rib turbulated walls...|$|R

Subsequently, the influence of stirring speed, temperature and reaction time on biodiesel yield and biodiesel quality was studied, by applying the randomized factorial experimental design with ANOVA (F-test at p = 0. 05), and using the optimum values previously found for methanol to seed ratio and KOH catalyst level. Most experimental runs conducted at 50 °C resulted to high biodiesel yields, while stirring speed and reaction time did not give significantly effect. The highest biodiesel yield (87 % with a fatty acid methyl ester purity of 99. 7 %) was obtained with a methanol to seed ratio of 6 : 1, KOH catalyst of 0. 075 mol/L in methanol, a stirring speed of 800 rpm, a temperature of 50 °C, and a reaction time of 5 h. The effects of stirring speed, temperature and reaction time on biodiesel quality were not significant. Most of the biodiesel quality obtained in this study conformed to the Indonesian Biodiesel Standard...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the feasibility of extracting total gypenosides (TGP) from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GP) by using batch and semi-continuous hot pressurized fluids extractions. Extraction conditions ranged from 50 to 1000 psig, 333 to 433 K, 0. 5 to 3 hr, 5 to 10 mL/min, addition of 0 % to 95 % ethanol, and solvent to solid ratio using 50 g GP/L~ 200 g GP/L. Agitation speed was <b>fixed</b> at 200 <b>rpm</b> to free of mass transfer resistance. Experimental results indicated that hot water under suitable pressures (i. e. 50 psig) enhanced the extracted amount of gypenosides, but temperature was the major effect on extracting gypenosides from GP. When semi-continuous hot pressurized water extracted GP at 200 psig, 373 K, 10 mL/min, 3 hours, and the ratio of 200 g /L (GP/ Extractor Volume), {{the recovery of the}} gypenosides(106. 7 mg/g GP) was 65. 1 % of that obtained by using EtOH Soxhlet extraction for 24 (Check!!!) hours. However, a semi-continuous 60 % ethanol extraction of GP obtains the 100 % recovery of total gypenosides. Finally, absorption purification using Amberlite XAD 7 -HP resin revealed that 96. 1 % recovery, 86. 5 % purity and 82. 7 %, 83. 2 % of solids containing TGP, could be obtained respectively for the pressurized water extract and the 60 % ethanol extract. The enhancement of the purification was over three times. 本研究探討壓力流體提取絞股藍(GP) 中的總皂苷之可行性，並與傳統的索氏萃取進行比較。壓力流體的實驗範圍為壓力： 50 psig~ 1000 psig、溫度： 333 K~ 433 K、時間： 0. 5 ~ 3 hr、流速： 5 ~ 10 mL/min、共溶劑： 0 %~ 95 %乙醇水溶液和溶固比為每升槽體積投物 50 g至 200 g絞股藍粉。攪拌速率固定在 200 rpm以排除質傳阻力。研究結果顯示，批次壓力水在 200 psig、 373 K、溶固比 50 g GP/L和 1 hr內，其絞股藍總皂苷的回收率為 40. 6 % (66. 0 mg/g GP) ；半連續式壓力水萃取條件為流速 10 mL/min、萃取壓力 200 psig、萃取溫度 373 K、溶固比 200 g GP/L和萃取時間 3 hr，其絞股藍總皂苷的回收率為 65. 1 %(106. 7 mg/g GP) 。若改以共溶劑(60 %乙醇水溶液) 作為流體，於半連續式條件下，其絞股藍總皂苷 100 %回收。壓力水絞股藍萃出液經Amberlite XAD 7 -HP吸附樹脂純化後，可得 96. 1 wt%的絞股藍總皂苷回收率和純度 86. 5 %的結晶，純度為萃出液乾糙的 3. 62 倍，總產率為 39 %。壓力 60 %乙醇水溶液的絞股藍萃出液經乾糙後之水溶液經相同樹脂純化後，可得 82. 7 %的絞股藍總皂苷回收率和純度 83. 2 wt%的結晶，純度為萃出液乾糙的 3. 18 倍，總產率為 81. 5 %。中文摘要 Ⅰ 英文摘要 Ⅱ 目 錄 Ⅲ 表 目 錄 Ⅵ 圖 目 錄 Ⅶ 第一章 緒論 1 第一節 前言 1 第二節 研究動機 4 第三節 研究方向 5 第二章 文獻回顧 6 第一節 壓力水發展與應用 6 第二節 絞股藍簡介 9 一、絞股藍 9 二、皂苷簡介 9 三、絞股藍皂苷的生理活性 13 第三章 實驗部分 14 第一節 原料與藥品 14 一、原料 14 二、藥品 14 第二節 儀器設備 17 一、壓力水萃取設備 17 二、高效液相層析儀(HPLC) 18 三、其他 19 第三節 實驗方法與步驟 20 一、索式萃取 20 二、壓力水萃取 20 三、分離纯化 22 四、分析方法 27 五、抑癌細胞實驗 29 第四章 結果與討論 32 第一節 索式萃取 32 第二節 壓力流體萃取 34 一、批次壓力水萃取 34 二、半連續式壓力流體萃取 41 三、分離纯化 49 四、抑癌細胞實驗 50 第五章 結論 54 第六章 參考文獻 5...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{dimension}} and multiplying functional aspect of engineering product is {{a mark of}} a modern technology product. Therefore, research of micro machining and smart material {{is an important step}} to develop the future manufacturing process. Layered manufacturing is one of the propective process of it. Research of powder deposition is a key of developing multi material micro fabrication. This research was implemented in four steps including materials preparation and characterization, design and manufacturing experiment apparatus, wall friction-flow ability test and design-manufacturing MMMF machine including the mechanical, electronics and software system. The research was initiated by study observation to find information about characteristic of fine powder and method of reducing the cohesiveness. By sieving process, powder was separated into 4 particle sizes including - 34, 34 - 60, 60 - 74, 74 - 104 micron. Particle shapes were observed using optical microscope. Wall friction test was performed to observe the effect of wall surface roughness, particle size and material powder on mass flow characteristic, by Jenike method. Flow ability test was carried out to yield the powder flow consistency by varying the particle sizes, models of screw feeder geometry, installing blender mechanism, reducing the particle cohesiveness and the wall friction test parameters (powder quantity in hopper and wall surface roughness). For these experiments, rotation of the screw feeder was <b>fixed</b> at 236 <b>rpm.</b> By plotting the experimental data, the optimum parameter of powder mass flow can be determined and it was tested by varying rotation of the screw feeder. The experimental results show that the mass flow characteristic is affected by wall surface roughness and particle size. Effect of powder quantity in hopper can be eliminated by installing blender mechanism; it can also reduce the compaction of the powder around nozzle orifice so that the mass flow can be increase. Mass flow characteristic is also affected by hopper angle, in which the optimal angle is achieved at 25. 67 o (by variation of 20. 6 o, 22. 62 o and 25. 67 o). Powder mass flow was caused dominantly by stimulating rotation of the screw feeder, it is not by helicoidal surface of the screw feeder. Powders trapped in helicoidal slot drive around particle caused by geometric interlocking. However, increasing screw feeder diameter is an effective way to increase the mass flow of smaller particle size (in this chase smaller than 60 micron). Preheating process gives the effective method to increase the mass flow, particularly for small particle (smaller than 60 micron). By considering these parameters, mass flow capacity can be arranged effectively by controlling rotation of the screw feeder. ...|$|R
