500|$|Film critic James Berardinelli cited this as his {{favourite}} Bond film, writing [...] "Only From Russia with Love avoids {{slipping into}} the comic book realm of Goldfinger and its successors while <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> sampling of the familiar Bond formula (action, gadgets, women, cars, etc.). From Russia with Love is effectively paced and plotted, features a gallery of detestable rogues (including the ultimate Bond villain, Blofeld), and offers countless thrills".|$|E
500|$|Mark Kermode {{writing for}} The Observer awarded the film {{four out of}} five stars, lauding Thompson's {{performance}} as [...] "impeccable", elaborating that [...] "Thompson dances her way through Travers' conflicting emotions, <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> fully rounded portrait of a person who is hard to like but impossible not to love." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune felt similarly, writing: [...] "Thompson's the show. Each withering put-down, every jaundiced utterance, lands with a little ping." [...] In regard to the screenplay, he wrote that [...] "screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith treat everyone gently and with the utmost respect." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film three out of four stars and equally commended the performances of the cast.|$|E
500|$|Mabel Tolkien was {{received}} into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her Baptist family, which stopped all {{financial assistance to}} her. In 1904, when J.R.R. Tolkien was 12, his mother died of acute diabetes at Fern Cottage in Rednal, which she was renting. She was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with diabetes mellitus type 1 could live without treatment—insulin would not be discovered until two decades later. Nine years after her death, Tolkien wrote, [...] "My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, {{and it is not}} to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith." ...|$|E

500|$|The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom {{applauded the}} {{differences}} between the characters in Storybrooke and their fairytale counterparts; she felt that this narrative device would help prevent viewers from getting frustrated if Snow and Charming grew further apart in one land but closer in the other. Prudom also enjoyed the writers' decision to make David [...] "indecisive and, as a result, also somewhat selfish," [...] while James is ready to leave his fiance for Snow. Prudom concluded that the episode [...] "expertly combined all the elements that make Once Upon a Time one of the most addictive and heartfelt new shows of the season, blending emotion, mystery and narrative thrust while <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> deeper understanding of our favorite characters. I hope the next batch of episodes can keep up the momentum established this week." ...|$|E

The painting, an oil on canvas [...] high and [...] wide, portrays {{a woman and a}} man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea. When the painting was put up for sale in 2012, the auction house catalogue stated that it had been owned by William Ride, former director of the Western Australian Museum. It reported:The current owners assert that Professor Ride always understood the figures in the picture were Sir John Winthrop Hackett, (then owner of The West Australian newspaper, well known business man and philanthropist, whose gift allowed the construction of the impressive University of Western Australia buildings and St. George's Residential College) and his new wife, Deborah Vernon Hackett".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez {{said she}} liked the pairing of Poehler and Theroux, but found [...] "Leslie's House" [...] slower than {{previous}} episodes, and felt the comedic talents of Ansari and Offerman were underused. Matt Fowler of IGN praised the episode for its use {{of a wide range}} of characters to provide humor, saying [...] "Everyone got a chance to shine in this episode. They all took turns <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> laugh and 'Leslie's House' was a tremendous example of this series firing on all cylinders." [...] Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode's satirical bent about elected officials. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club favorably compared [...] "Leslie's House" [...] to [...] "Dinner Party", an episode of The Office, the other comedy series created by Parks co-creator Greg Daniels. However, he said [...] "Leslie's House" [...] was different in that her friends were willing to attend her party and help her out, whereas in the Office episode, the characters did not want to attend the dinner party held by protagonist Michael Scott. Heisler said the fact that the characters liked each other so much in Parks and Recreation differentiated itself from the other series in a positive way.|$|E

For a start, how about <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> [...] that isn't derivative and self-indulgent?" [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website opined that I'm Going to Tell You a Secret would find a divided audience and how one reacted to the documentary was a reflection of how one viewed Madonna. [...] "Fans like me {{will be able to}} essentially ignore the self-serving moments and enjoy the tour elements. We'll also like the glimpse behind the curtain at Madonna on the road," [...] he added. This view was shared by a reviewer from Lexington Herald-Leader who confessed that he did not enjoy the documentary except the live performances, since he saw Madonna only as an [...] "entertainer" [...] and not as a [...] "preacher".|$|E
500|$|In India, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{met with}} polarised {{reactions}} from film critics. While certain critics praised the visual richness and {{the performances of}} the cast, certain others were negative about the lengthy run time and criticised the script strength and inconsistencies. Khalid Mohamed of The Times of India applauded the film and reviewed, [...] "K3G is the complete commercial banquet delivered with fabulous finesse by Karan Johar. So, go indulge yourself. Cry your heart out and surprisingly, you'll feel life's finally alive and kicking in Mumbai's dream world." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars. He praised the emotional sequences, {{as well as the}} choreography, production design, costumes, and cinematography. He added that Karan Johar was the real star, for creating many memorable sequences. Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood gave the film 8 out of 10 stars, saying [...] "Dharma Productions has kept its promise in <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> lovable film to remember in coming times." [...] He pointed out several flaws in the script, but added that the positive aspects of the film managed to outweigh the negative ones. He quoted, [...] "K3G is one heck of an entertainer and was worth the wait". In the film review section of his book Bollywood: An Insider's Guide, Fuad Omar showered overwhelming praise on the film and called it a [...] "masterpiece from the first frame to the last". In summary he said, [...] "Overall Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... is without a doubt the most enthralling, entertaining, emotional and complete vision and definition of Hindi cinema I have ever seen. It is simply the perfect Hindi film." ...|$|E
500|$|Collider.com's Chris Cabin also {{praised the}} first seven episodes of the season, giving it four stars, and saying that the series [...] "finds {{overwhelmingly}} sincere and effective traces of humanity in a genre that has been hard-pressed to feel overtly pre-conceived in its political, societal, and philosophical ideas." [...] He said Daredevil, like Jessica Jones, [...] "feels like a show that is constantly evolving, and consistently searching for challenges." [...] Cabin also felt that [...] "the show’s use of sound and image to infer or suggest {{as much as any}} line of dialogue...continues to set this series apart from its half-measured kin." [...] He added that the season [...] "goes to great lengths to make the stakes of" [...] the moral and ethical issues, as seen by pitting Daredevil's methods against the Punisher, [...] "intensely involving and thrilling," [...] while also praising the action sequences of the season and the [...] "streamlined focus on character in the writing", claiming that [...] "none of the [...] films have even an iota of the seductive intimacy and heart of this show." [...] Dennis Perkins writing for The A.V. Club awarded the season a [...] "B+", missing D’Onofrio’s [...] "towering menace as Wilson Fisk", but feeling that Bernthal and Yung [...] "make Castle and Elektra an effective season-long two-pronged assault on Matt Murdock’s heroic identity, which gives Daredevils supporting characters a clearer purpose as well." [...] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler, after reviewing all the episodes of season two individually, gave the season a 9.3 out of 10, saying that it [...] "excelled at both action and story while <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> more complex and layered season than the first....Gone was a notable 'main villain', but instead we were given fantastic performances by not only the main cast but by newcomers Jon Bernthal and Elodie Yung." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Writing for The Buffalo News, Alan Pergament rated the episode three stars out of five, describing it as [...] "moody" [...] but [...] "muddled and confusing". Pergament noted that [...] "the suspense of the premiere actually {{is enhanced by}} all the summer speculation about the future role of Gallagher", and felt that Morgan and Wong were [...] "trying to bring [...] "Millennium" [...] into [...] "X-File" [...] territory". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a A−, finding that it allows the series to [...] " [...] a corner, from a serial killer show with stained-glass window overtones, to a show that revels in those overtones, a show that plays in age-old symbols with a decided taste of the weird". VanDerWerff also felt that a monologue delivered by O'Quinn {{was an example of}} Morgan and Wong's best writing, and that the actor's delivery was the key to keeping the scene serious in tone. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, noting that it [...] "starts Season 2 off in high style". Gibron found that the episode [...] "has a nice sense of internal adventure to it, <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> chance to learn more about our main players while setting the groundwork for some certified surreality to come". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "The Beginning and the End" [...] two-and-a-half stars out of five. Shearman felt that the episode had [...] "an overwritten quality", citing the Polaroid Man's dialogue as the main example of this; he also believed that the development of Catherine Black as a character seemed poorly executed, with the character lacking enough depth to [...] "retain the audience's sympathies".|$|E
500|$|The {{first part}} of the finale {{received}} critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of IGN thought it [...] "fantastic," [...] because it was [...] "a great story that leads us into one hell of a conclusion to the season," [...] and that it [...] "right away [...] us the deepest, most exciting look into the alternate universe we've seen so far." [...] He rated it 9.0/10. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly and MTV's Josh Wigler agreed on this last point, with Tucker noting the first part [...] "was a complete success and a blast at <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> fully lived-in alternate universe." [...] Noel Murray of The Onions The A.V. Club graded the first part with an A−, calling it [...] "a fun, exciting episode that nicely set up next week's finale". Isler, Wigler, and Murray loved the return of the Cortexifan subjects; Murray docked the episode a half point, explaining [...] "I love the idea of Olivia & The Cortexifanatics so much that I'm bummed Fringe burned through the group so quickly." [...] Critic Andrew Hanson, writing for the Los Angeles Times, noted that because of the parallel universe focus, the first part felt like the following season's premiere. He praised the opening scene, and believed the scenes between Peter and his mother helped [...] "ground the episode. They might be out of pace with the action and drama pouring out of every other moment, but there was weight and emotion. Bravo Joshua Jackson and Orla Brady. Bravo." [...] Ken Tucker noted that the scenes with Peter and his true mother indicated [...] "a great, humantistic use of a sci-fi trope". MTV's Josh Wigler praised Torv's performance, but wished the two-part finale was not broken up, explaining [...] "I could have easily tuned in for another several hours. Heck, I could watch an entire parallel series focused solely on the alternate universe!" ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{process may}} not be wholly gradual, but new {{evidence}} shows that the passage into new stages is more gradual than once thought.

As a result, transitions between stages can seem to be rapid and radical, but oftentimes the child has grasped one aspect of the new stage of cognitive functioning but not addressed others. The bulk of the time spent in a new stage consists of refining this new cognitive level; however it does not always happen quickly.
