40|$|The {{relationship}} between enhancement of H^- negative ion volume production {{and behaviors of}} fast primary electros are studied. Trajectories of fast primary electrons are calculated numerically, including collisional effects with hydrogen molecules. Taking into account our experimental study, following two main targets are discussed: (1) Effect of field intensity of the magnetic filter (MF) and a <b>filament</b> <b>position</b> on active region of fast primary electrons, and (2) combination effect of the field intensity of the MF and the <b>filament</b> <b>position</b> for controlling behaviors of fast electrons. Active region of fast electrons depends strongly on the field intensity of the MF and <b>filament</b> <b>position.</b> Therefore, spatial distributions of ionization and vibrational excitation collision points are also changed {{in the same manner}} although number of vibrational excitation collision points is lower than that of ionization collision points due to longer mean free path. According to the results and discussions including transport of produced vibrationally excited molecules and H^- ions, for enhancement of H^- production, it is desired that fast electrons should approach the MF position and move into the downstream region as deep as possible without destruction of H^- ions. To realize these conditions, good combination between <b>filament</b> <b>position</b> and the intensity of the MF should be required...|$|E

The flow is considered as linear and irrotational everywhere except inside a very thin cylindrical core region around the vortex filament. In the outside region, a velocity potential is introduced that must be multivalued, and it is shown how to compute this scalar potential if the motion of the vortex filament is prescribed. To find the motion of this singularity in an external potential flow, a variational principle involving a volume integral that must exclude the singular region is considered. A functional of the external potential and vortex <b>filament</b> <b>position</b> is obtained whose extrema give equations to determine the sought-after evolution. Thus, a generalization of the Biot-Savart law to flows with constant sound speed at low Mach number is obtained...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMicroscope {{images of}} {{fluctuating}} biopolymers contain {{a wealth of}} information about their underlying mechanics and dynamics. However, successful extraction of this information requires precise localization of <b>filament</b> <b>position</b> and shape from thousands of noisy images. Here, we present careful measurements of the bending dynamics of filamentous (F-) actin and microtubules at thermal equilibrium with high spatial and temporal resolution using a new, simple but robust, automated image analysis algorithm with subpixel accuracy. We find that slender actin filaments have a persistence length of ∼ 17 μm, and display a q− 4 -dependent relaxation spectrum, as expected from viscous drag. Microtubules have a persistence length of several millimeters; interestingly, there is a small correlation between total microtubule length and rigidity, with shorter filaments appearing softer. However, we show that this correlation can arise, in principle, from intrinsic measurement noise that must be carefully considered. The dynamic behavior of the bending of microtubules also appears more complex than that of F-actin, reflecting their higher-order structure. These results emphasize both the power and limitations of light microscopy techniques for studying the mechanics and dynamics of biopolymers...|$|E

Quantitative image analysis permitted computation of the principal values and orientations of Lagrangian strain from 3 -D high-resolution fluorescence intensity distributions that described intermediate <b>filament</b> <b>positions.</b> Spatially localized peaks in intermediate filament strain were repositioned after onset of shear stress.

For this purpose, at JET a code is employed that computes the flux map in real time simply by interpolating the magnetic measurements. A simple plasma model has been developed to help the fitting procedure and to improve the boundary reconstruction while keeping the high computational speed. The plasma presence is taken into account by using a set of filamentary currents placed inside the vacuum vessel. The <b>filament</b> <b>position</b> remains fixed during the plasma evolution and the current moment method has been chosen to {{determine the amount of}} current flowing in the filaments.

40|$|Isotope {{effect on}} H^-/D^- volume {{production}} is studied by measuring both VUV emission and negative ion density in the source. In a double plasma type source, under some discharge conditions, extracted D^- currents are {{nearly the same}} as H^- currents, although VUV emission intensity (corresponding to production of vibrationally excited molecules) in D_ 2 plasmas is slightly lower than that in H_ 2 plasmas. Considering the factor √ due to mass difference, D^- ion density in the extraction region of the source is higher than H^- ion density. In another experiment with a rectangular arc chamber, axial distributions of H^-/D^- ion densities in the source are measured directly using a laser photodetachment method. Relationship between H^-/D^- production and plasma parameter control with using a magnetic filter (MF) is discussed. Furthermore, relative intensities of extracted negative ion currents are discussed compared with the negative ion densities in the source.

40|$|AbstractUsing atomic force microscopy, we {{examined}} the contribution of cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) to thick-filament length and flexural rigidity. Native thick filaments were isolated from the hearts of transgenic mice bearing a truncation mutation of cMyBP-C (t/t) that results in no detectable cMyBP-C and from age-matched wild-type controls (+/+). Atomic force microscopy images of these filaments were evaluated with an automated analysis algorithm that identified <b>filament</b> <b>position</b> and shape. The t/t thick-filament length (1. 48 ± 0. 02 μm) was significantly (P < 0. 01) shorter than +/+ (1. 56 ± 0. 02 μm). This 5 %-shorter thick-filament length in the t/t was reflected in 4 % significantly shorter sarcomere lengths of relaxed isolated cardiomyocytes of the t/t (1. 97 ± 0. 01 μm) compared to +/+ (2. 05 ± 0. 01 μm). To determine if cMyBP-C contributes to the mechanical properties of thick filaments, we used statistical polymer chain mechanics to calculate a per-filament-specific persistence length, an index of flexural rigidity directly proportional to Young's modulus. Thick-filament-specific persistence length in the t/t (373 ± 62 μm) was significantly lower than in +/+ (639 ± 101 μm). Accordingly, Young's modulus of t/t thick filaments was ∼ 60 % of +/+. These results provide what we consider a new understanding for the critical role of cMyBP-C in defining normal cardiac output by sustaining force and muscle stiffness...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} with {{experiments and}} novel mapping {{the structure of}} a hexagonally ordered filament bundle that is held near its ends and progressively twisted around its central axis. The filaments are free to slide relative to each other and are further held under tension-free boundary conditions. Measuring the bundle packing with micro x-ray imaging, we find that the filaments develop the helical rotation Ω imposed at the boundaries. We then show that the observed structure is consistent with a mapping of the <b>filament</b> <b>positions</b> to disks packed on a dual non-Euclidean surface with a Gaussian curvature which increases with twist. We further demonstrate that the mean inter-filament distance is minimal on the surface which can be approximated by a hemisphere with an effective curvature K_eff = 3 Ω^ 2. Examining the packing on the dual surface, we analyze the geometric frustration of packing in twisted bundles and find the core to remain relatively hexagonally ordered with inter-filament strains growing from the bundle center, driving the formation of defects at the exterior of highly twisted bundles.

40|$|We aim at {{investigating}} the morphology, kinematic and helicity {{evolution of a}} loop-like prominence during its eruption. We use multi-instrument observations from AIA/SDO, EUVI/STEREO and LASCO/SoHO. The kinematic, morphological, geometrical, and helicity evolution of a loop-like eruptive prominence are studied {{in the context of}} the magnetic flux rope model of solar prominences. The prominence eruption evolved as a height expanding twisted loop with both legs anchored in the chromosphere of a plage area. The eruption process consists of a prominence activation, acceleration, and a phase of constant velocity. The prominence body was composed of left-hand (counter-clockwise) twisted threads around the main prominence axis. The twist during the eruption was estimated at 6 pi (3 turns). The prominence reached a maximum height of 526 Mm before contracting to its primary location and partially reformed in the same place two days after the eruption. This ejection, however, triggered a CME seen in LASCO C 2. The prominence was located in the northern periphery of the CME magnetic field configuration and, therefore, the background magnetic field was asymmetric with respect to the <b>filament</b> <b>position.</b> The physical conditions of the falling plasma blobs were analysed with respect to the prominence kinematics. The same sign of the prominence body twist and writhe, as well as the amount of twisting above the critical value of 2 pi after the activation phase indicate that possibly conditions for kink instability were present. No signature of magnetic reconnection was observed anywhere in the prominence body and its surroundings. The filament/prominence descent following the eruption and its partial reformation at the same place two days later suggest a confined type of eruption. The asymmetric background magnetic field possibly played an important role in the failed eruption. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, in press in A&...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine whether there are evolutionary trade-offs among populations isolated to different salinities in nature with regards to mitochondria rich (MR) cell production. We expected differences among populations in MR cell abundances due to the energy requirements needed to maintain and produce these cells. Eggs from three populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were hatched and reared for 10 weeks and then the fish were put into one of two salinity challenges: either 0. 4 ppt freshwater or 35 ppt saltwater for 13 days. The populations consisted of one isolated to freshwater, one isolated to saltwater, and one that is anadromous. Mitochondria rich cells were characterized by the categorization scheme of Lee et al. (1996) as either deep hole (ion secreting cells), shallow basin (potential transitional cell type), or wavy convex (ion absorptive cells). Scanning electron microscopy was used to determine cell densities. There were strong salinity effects for deep hole cells as they were absent in freshwater and present in salt, and wavy convex cells which were nearly absent in saltwater but abundant in fresh, however there were no differences in cell densities of any cell type between populations. This indicates that either the populations never lost their ability to osmoregulate in different salinities or that measuring cell abundances is not an effective way to measure osmoregulatory ability. Analyses were also conducted on the along <b>filament</b> <b>position</b> of MR cells, and we found that cell densities were significantly lower at the base and the tip of the filament. We also found that in freshwater, MR cells are more abundant toward the distal half of the filament and in saltwater, MR cells are more abundant toward the proximal half...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHerschel {{has shown}} that {{filamentary}} structures are ubiquitous in star-forming regions, in particular in nearby molecular clouds associated with Gould's Belt. High dynamic range far-infrared imaging of the Musca cloud with SPIRE and PACS reveals at least two types of filamentary structures: (1) the main ~ 10 -pc scale high column-density linear filament; and (2) low column-density striations {{in close proximity to}} the main filament. In addition, we find features with intermediate column densities (hair-like strands) that appear physically connected to the main filament. We present an analysis of this filamentary network traced by Herschel and explore its connection with the local magnetic field. We find that both the faint dust emission striations and the plane-of-the-sky (POS) magnetic field are locally oriented close to perpendicular to the high-density main <b>filament</b> (<b>position</b> angle ~ 25 - 35 °). The low-density striations and strands are oriented parallel to the POS magnetic field lines, which are derived previously from optical polarization measurements of background stars and more recently from Planck observations of dust polarized emission. The position angles are 97 ± 25 °, 105 ± 7 °, and 105 ± 5 °. From these observations, we propose a scenario in which local interstellar material in this cloud has condensed into a gravitationally-unstable filament (with "supercritical" mass per unit length) that is accreting background matter along field lines through the striations. We also compare the filamentary structure in Musca with what is seen in similar Herschel observations of the Taurus B 211 / 3 filament system and find that there is significantly less substructure in the Musca main filament than in the B 211 / 3 filament. We suggest that the Musca cloud may represent an earlier evolutionary stage in which the main filament has not yet accreted sufficient mass and energy to develop a multiple system of intertwined filamentary components.

Structural models of the hook have revealed how its flexibility is expected to arise from dynamic changes in the distance between monomers in the helical lattice. In particular, each of the 11 protofilaments that comprise the hook is predicted to cycle between short and long forms, corresponding to the {{inside and outside of}} the curved hook, once each revolution of the motor when the hook is acting as a universal joint. To test this, we genetically modified the hook so that it could be stiffened by binding streptavidin to biotinylated monomers, impeding their motion relative to each other.

40|$|Cryoconite is {{a matrix}} of sediment, {{biogenic}} polymer and a microbial community that resides on glacier surfaces. The phototrophic component of this community is well adapted to this extreme environment, including high light stress. Photoacclimation of the cryoconite phototrophic community on Longyearbreen, Svalbard, was investigated using in situ variable chlorophyll fluorescence. Rapid light curves (RLCs) and induction–recovery curves were used to analyse photosystem II quantum efficiency, relative electron transport rate and forms of downregulation including non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and state transitions in cyanobacteria. Phototrophs used a combination of behavioural and physiological photochemical downregulation. Behavioural downregulation is hypothesised to incorporate chloroplast movement and cell or <b>filament</b> <b>positioning</b> within the sediment matrix in order to shade from high light, {{which resulted in a}} lack of saturation of RLCs and hence overestimation of productivity. Physiological downregulation likely consisted of biphasic NPQ, comprising a steadily induced light-dependent form and a light-independent NPQ that was not reversed with decreasing light intensity. State transitions by cyanobacteria were the most likely physiological downregulation employed by cyanobacteria within the mixed phototroph community. These findings demonstrate that cryoconite phototrophs combine multiple forms of physiological and behavioural downregulation to optimise light exposure and maximise photosynthetic productivity. This plasticity of photoacclimation enables them to survive productively in the high-light stress environment on the ice surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of any simulation of atmospheric tracers using low-resolution winds relies {{on both the}} dominance of large spatial scales in the strain and time dependence that results in a cascade in tracer scales. Here, a quantitative study on the accuracy of such tracer studies is made using the contour advection technique. It is shown that, although contour stretching rates are very insensitive to the spatial truncation of the wind field, the displacement errors in <b>filament</b> <b>position</b> are sensitive. A knowledge of displacement characteristics is essential if Lagrangian simulations are {{to be used for}} the inference of airmass origin. A quantitative lower estimate is obtained for the tracer scale factor (TSF) : the ratio of the smallest resolved scale in the advecting wind field to the smallest “trustworthy” scale in the tracer field. For a baroclinic wave life cycle the TSF = 6. 1 ± 0. 3 while for the Northern Hemisphere wintertime lower stratosphere the TSF = 5. 5 ± 0. 5, when using the most stringent definition of the trustworthy scale. The similarity in the TSF for the two flows is striking and an explanation is discussed in terms of the activity of potential vorticity (PV) filaments. Uncertainty in contour initialization is investigated for the stratospheric case. The effect of smoothing initial contours is to introduce a spinup time, after which wind field truncation errors take over from initialization errors (2 – 3 days). It is also shown that false detail from the proliferation of finescale filaments limits the useful lifetime of such contour advection simulations to 3 σ− 1 days, where σ is the filament thinning rate, unless filaments narrower than the trustworthy scale are removed by contour surgery. In addition, PV analysis error and diabatic effects are so strong that only PV filaments wider than 50 km are at all believable, even for very high-resolution winds. The minimum wind field resolution required to accurately simulate filaments down to the erosion scale in the stratosphere (given an initial contour) is estimated and the implications for the modeling of atmospheric chemistry are briefly discussed...|$|E

The minimum nitrogen volume fraction in the fuel stream needed to ensure suppression for all strain rates in microgravity {{was measured to be}} 0. 855 ± 0. 016, associated with the turning point, which occurred at a global strain rate of 15 s− 1. This value was higher than the analogous value in normal gravity. Flame temperature measurements were attained in the high-temperature region of the flame (T> 1200 K) using visible emission from a SiC <b>filament</b> <b>positioned</b> axially along the burner center-line. The suppression and temperature measurements were used to validate a two-dimensional flame simulation developed here, which included buoyancy effects and finite-rate kinetics. The simulations yielded insight into the differences between microgravity and normal gravity suppression results and also explained the inadequacy of the one-dimensional model results to explain the microgravity suppression results...|$|R
40|$|Active gels are a {{class of}} biologically-relevant {{material}} containing embedded agents that spontaneously generate forces acting on a sparse filament network. In vitro experiments of protein filaments and molecular motors have revealed a range of non- equilibrium pattern formation resulting from motor motion along filament tracks, {{and there are a}} number of hydrodynamic models purporting to describe such systems. Here we present results of extensive simulations designed to elucidate the microscopic basis underpinning macroscopic flow in active gels. Our numerical scheme includes thermal fluctuations in <b>filament</b> <b>positions,</b> excluded volume interactions, and filament elasticity in the form of bending and stretching modes. Motors are represented individually as bipolar springs governed by rate-based rules for attachment, detachment and unidirectional motion of motor heads along the filament contour. We systematically vary motor density and speed, and uncover parameter regions corresponding to unusual statics and dynamics which overlap but do not coincide. The anomalous statics arise at high motor densities and take the form of end-bound localized filament bundles for rapid motors, and extended clusters exhibiting enhanced small-wavenumber density fluctuations and power-law cluster-size distributions for slow, processive motors. Anomalous dynamics arise for slow, processive motors over a range of motor densities, and are most evident as superdiffusive mass transport, which we argue is the consequence of a form of effective self-propulsion resulting from the polar coupling between motors and filaments.

40|$|In {{growing plant}} cells, the {{combined}} {{activities of the}} cytoskeleton, endomembrane, and cell wall biosynthetic systems organize the cytoplasm and define the architecture and growth properties of the cell. These biosynthetic machineries efficiently synthesize, deliver, and recycle the raw materials that support cell expansion. The precise roles of the actin cytoskeleton in these processes are unclear. Certainly, bundles of actin <b>filaments</b> <b>position</b> organelles and are a substrate for long-distance intracellular transport, but the functional linkages between dynamic actin filament arrays and the cell growth machinery are poorly understood. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) “distorted group” mutants have defined protein complexes that appear to generate and convert small GTPase signals into an Actin-Related Protein 2 / 3 (ARP 2 / 3) -dependent actin filament nucleation response. However, direct biochemical knowledge about Arabidopsis ARP 2 / 3 and its cellular distribution is lacking. In this paper, we provide biochemical evidence for a plant ARP 2 / 3. The plant complex utilizes a conserved assembly mechanism. ARPC 4 is the most critical core subunit that controls the assembly and steady-state levels of the complex. ARP 2 / 3 in other systems {{is believed to be}} mostly a soluble complex that is locally recruited and activated. Unexpectedly, we find that Arabidopsis ARP 2 / 3 interacts strongly with cell membranes. Membrane binding is linked to complex assembly status and not {{to the extent to which}} it is activated. Mutant analyses implicate ARP 2 as an important subunit for membrane association...|$|R

We report experimental data on the cross-flow migration, bending, and buckling of extremely deformable hydrogel nanofilaments conveyed by an oscillatory flow into a microchannel. The changes in migration velocity and filament orientation {{are related to the}} flow velocity and the <b>filament's</b> initial <b>position,</b> deformation, and length. The observed migration dynamics of hydrogel filaments qualitatively confirms the validity of the previously developed worm-like bead-chain hydrodynamic model. The experimental data collected may help to verify the role of hydrodynamic interactions in molecular simulations of long molecular chains dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Cytokinesis {{separates}} replicated chromosomes and cytoplasm {{into two}} daughter cells. In animal cells, this {{is achieved by}} {{the formation of a}} cleavage furrow that bisects the mitotic (or meiotic) spindle. It is known that the mitotic apparatus defines the cell cleavage plane. However, {{it is not clear how}} the mitotic apparatus initiates the cleavage furrow. Each part of the mitotic apparatus; namely asters, central spindle (microtubule arrays and the spindle midzone), and chromosomes, has been found capable of inducing a cleavage furrow in certain cell types. Yet it is uncertain which part is the essential source of the signal and whether all parts act in concert. This thesis systematically examines in grasshopper spermatocytes 1) which spindle constituent is the essential source of furrow signal; 2) the impact of microtubules on distribution of actin <b>filaments</b> and <b>positioning</b> of cell cleavage relative to spindle reorganization; 3) the independent role of the spindle midzone relative to microtubules in furrow initiation and ingression. These examinations combine micromanipulation with digital-enhanced polarization microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy, in which mitotic spindles in living cells are mechanically dissected and rearranged as desired as well as microfixed to evaluate and propose models for cell cleavage. This thesis has come to the conclusion that none of structural constituents of the spindle apparatus is essential for cell cleavage induction except microtubules. First, furrow induction occurs regardless of a particular spindle constituent, so long as sufficient microtubules are present to form bipolar arrays. Second, microtubules continuously dictate distribution of actin <b>filaments</b> and <b>positioning</b> of cell cleavage. Asymmetric alterations of spindle microtubules dynamically affect the location of the spindle midzone, distribution of actin <b>filaments,</b> and ultimately <b>position</b> of the cleavage furrow in cells containing a bipolar spindle, monopolar spindle, or half-spindle. Third, actin filaments are distributed to the furrow region by microtubule-mediated transport, but organized by the midzone, which is essential for furrow ingression, but not initiation. These results suggest that during post-anaphase spindle assembly, actin filaments are excluded by bipolar microtubule arrays to the equatorial cell cortex where they bundle into a contractile ring with cytokinetic factors...|$|R

40|$|Procedure to {{identify}} the plasma current and its position with hall sensors in real time is presented for long-pulse operation. Hall sensors are installed around the vacuum vessel of QUEST on the atmospheric side. With this procedure, plasma current is treated as a <b>filament</b> current <b>positioned</b> in the vacuum vessel. The plasma current and its position are calculated by the intensities of hall sensor signals and its ratios, respectively. The validity and noise immunity of this procedure is checked numerically. With hall sensor signals, the plasma current and its position are calculated experimentally in real time, and the calculation results correspond well to the results with a rogowski coil and flux loops. Drift errors do not occur with hall sensors, and this procedure is suitable for long-pulse operation...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{experimental}} and numerical investigations of femtosecond pulse propagation locally {{disturbed by the}} turbulent flow field of a hot-air blower. The experiments show that turbulence may shorten the collapse/filamentation distance and induce the onset of multiple filaments. This is supported by numerical simulations indicating that the high frequency part of the turbulence spectrum (inner scale below three millimeters) plays a significant role. The experiments were carried out with a Ti:Sapphire CPA laser system delivering 10 mJ, 80 fs pulses with a repetition rate up to 100 Hz. The corresponding peak power is 125 GW which is about 20 times the critical power for self-focusing in air. The perpendicular flow of a hot-air blower was used to generate strong local turbulence in the laser optical path with a structure parameter of the refractive index Cn 2 of 5  10 - 10 m- 2 / 3. The transverse intensity profile was measured at various distances from the compressor output using a CCD camera that records the light scattered by a glass diffuser. For each position along the laser propagation axis, 100 shots were recorded with and without turbulence in the optical path. The number of filaments and the <b>filament</b> <b>positions</b> in the transverse plane were determined for each shot and statistically analyzed. The measurements are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the pulse propagation starting from the measured intensity profile right behind the laser. Our nonlinear propagation equation comprises diffraction and self-focusing due to the optical Kerr effect. The defocusing effect of plasma generated by tunnel/multiphoton ionization is taken into account. The flow field of the hot-air blower is represented by a Kolmogorov phase screen capable of consistently handling high and very low frequencies of the turbulence spectrum. Thus, turbulence scales reaching from the millimeter range to centimeters or, if necessary, even up to several tens of meters can be simultaneously considered. ...|$|R
2500|$|One {{filament}} {{is located}} at {{the focal point of the}} reflector. The other filament is shifted axially and radially away from the focal point. In most 2-filament sealed beams and in 2-filament replaceable bulbs of type 9004, 9007, and H13, the high-beam filament is at the focal point and the low-beam filament is off focus. For use in right-traffic countries, the low-beam <b>filament</b> is <b>positioned</b> slightly upward, forward and leftward of the focal point, so that when it is energized, the beam is widened and shifted slightly downward and rightward of the headlamp axis. Transverse-filament bulbs such as the 9004 can only be used with the filaments horizontal, but axial-filament bulbs can be rotated or [...] "clocked" [...] by the headlamp designer to optimize the beam pattern or to effect the traffic-handedness of the low beam. The latter is accomplished by clocking the low-beam filament in an upward-forward-leftward position to produce a right-traffic low beam, or in an upward-forward-rightward position to produce a left-traffic low beam.|$|R
