40|$|A <b>harmonised</b> <b>system</b> for the {{certification}} of horticultural products {{with reference to}} environmental and worker-welfare standards has recently been launched by major European retail chains. The scheme includes integrated crop and pest management best practices as well as worker-welfare standards. The EUREPGAP scheme will now be recognised as {{the certification}} baseline. There are also plans to extend the EUREPGAP scheme to other products such as meats and grains, although these are only at an early stage. Comment: ACP suppliers not meeting these standards could find themselves squeezed out of major components of the EU retail market with consequent effects on the prices received for their products. While retail chains are working with existing suppliers to help them meet the new standards, these new standards could {{make it more difficult}} for new ACP suppliers to enter the EU market profitably.

30|$|For {{assessing}} {{the economic impact}} of product recovery and remanufacturing in France, Ferrer and Ayres (2000) incorporated the remanufacturing sector in a harmonised industry-by-industry matrix. This <b>harmonised</b> <b>system</b> was adjusted to consider different demands in labour, energy, primary materials, and inputs from others economic sectors. They assumed that the manufacturing and remanufacturing final demand in physical values were equivalent; however, remanufacturing products have a lower price value. They quantified the impacts of the new sector in terms of market share and labour increase.|$|R

40|$|The present article {{provides}} an overview of the Globally <b>Harmonised</b> <b>System</b> of Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Chemicals (GHS) and its implementation in Brazil. Although Classification and Packaging {{is beyond the scope of}} the responsibility of academic chemists, labelling of chemicals used in academic laboratories will be required by the competent authorities to ensure the safety of students and staff. Therefore, academic teachers and researchers responsible should be familiarised with the GHS principles outlined here and at least be able to label, by applying these principles, mixtures of substances previously classified by the competent authorities...|$|R
5000|$|The CLP Regulation (for [...] "Classification, Labelling and Packaging") is a European Union {{regulation}} from 2008, which aligns the European Union {{system of}} classification, labelling and packaging of chemical substances and mixtures to the Globally <b>Harmonised</b> <b>System</b> (GHS). It {{is expected to}} facilitate global trade and the harmonised communication of hazard information of chemicals and to promote regulatory efficiency. It complements the 2006 Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation (EC No 1907/2006) and replaces the current system contained in the Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC) and the Dangerous Preparations Directive (1999/45/EC).|$|R
5000|$|The {{increasing}} {{emphasis of}} modern ATM is on interoperable and <b>harmonised</b> <b>systems</b> that allow an aircraft {{to operate with}} the minimum of performance change from one airspace to another. ATC systems have traditionally been developed by individual States that concentrated on their own requirements, creating different levels of service and capability around the world. Many Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) do not provide an ATC service that matches the capabilities of modern aircraft, so ICAO has developed the Aviation System Block Upgrade (ASBU) initiative in order to harmonise global planning of technology upgrades.|$|R
40|$|Typically {{hundreds}} of different chemical products stored in small flasks which cannot accommodate labels {{large enough to}} bear all information required by the Globally <b>Harmonised</b> <b>System</b> of Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Chemicals (GHS) are used in academic laboratories. To overcome this restriction Brazilian legislation permits communication {{of the dangers of}} chemical products to trained laboratory workers/students by alternative means. Here we describe an alternative label system, developed by the German Social Accident Insurance (DGUV), which allows hazard communication to trained workers/students via a labelling system, using pictograms and highly condensed hazard statements to alert about dangerous chemical products...|$|R
50|$|The Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (CLP) {{introduces}} a globally <b>harmonised</b> <b>system</b> for classifying and labelling chemicals into the EU. This worldwide system {{makes it easier}} for workers and consumers to know the effects of chemicals and how to use products safely because the labels on products are now the same throughout the world. Companies need to notify ECHA of the classification and labelling of their chemicals. So far, ECHA has received over 5 million notifications for more than 100 000 substances. The information is freely available on their website. Consumers can check chemicals in the products they use.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the expected}} changes in external tariffs and imports in Poland after accession to the European Union. We find that around 14 % of all manufacturing commodity {{groups in the}} <b>Harmonised</b> <b>System</b> will experience tariff reductions of over 10 percentage points, while for agricultural goods tariff comparisons are complicated by very different tariff systems and may be overrated since applied tariffs are often lower than those committed. Based on gravity estimates we also find that only few - relatively narrowly defined commodities - will experience import growth rates of above 20 %. More widely defined sensitive commodities are subject to a much smaller but still important import growth...|$|R

It co-ordinateed the EU risk assessment programmes that covered the risks posed by existing substances and new substances to workers, consumers and the environment. It also developed guidance documents and tools {{in support of the}} REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) Regulation, the Testing Methods Regulation, the Globally <b>Harmonised</b> <b>System</b> of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), the notification of new substances, the information exchange on import and export of dangerous substances, the development and harmonisation of testing methods and the authorisation of biocides.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The EU Standards Database collates European {{standards}} {{for agricultural products}} and textiles/clothing over the period 1995 - 2003, and maps them to the <b>Harmonised</b> <b>System.</b> For each product-year combination, counts are given both {{of the number of}} standards and of the number of pages of standards. In general, rapid growth is observed both in the number and average length of standards. The proportion (roughly 50 %) of EU standards implementing ISO standards remains stable over the sample period, suggesting that harmonisation within the Union does not necessarily mean harmonisation with international practice. However, considerable heterogeneity is observed across sectors. Some suggestions for future research are presented, focussing on both the trade impacts of standards and their political economy determinants...|$|R

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMIn {{terms of}} the SADC Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP), the main {{objective}} of the community is to achieve a monetary union {{through the creation of}} a regional central bank by 2016 and adoption of a single currency by 2018 in a systematic and progressive manner. The envisaged monetary union in the SADC is premised on a number of economic and financial regulations aimed at stimulating efforts by member states to achieve deeper forms of regional integration. The latter imperatives include a <b>harmonised</b> payment <b>system</b> as well as a corporate governance system among others. Nonetheless it is surprising how the pace of the process has been very subpar taking into consideration that it is the year 2015 and there has been no clear carved out legislation in any form which deals with the aspect of corporate governance raises concerns. This study serves as not only a reminder but also gives guidelines to taking progressive steps towards <b>harmonised</b> <b>systems</b> of law to ensure the efficient running of companies in SADC. This study is predicated upon other successful systems and the lessons that SADC could make use of as examples in creating a robust system of laws to ensure good corporate governance and in the long run the fulfilment of the concept of a monetary union...|$|R
