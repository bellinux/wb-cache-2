In this study, two Sauternes wines were investigated by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and gas chromatography-pulsed flame photometric detector (GC-PFPD) after XAD 2 and thiol-specific extractions. Most polyfunctional thiols (3 -sulfanylpropyl acetate, 2 -sulfanylethyl acetate, 3 -methyl- 3 -sulfanylbutanal, etc.) proved to be completely degraded after 2 years of bottle aging in a cellar. Only 3 -sulfanylhexan- 1 -ol was still found in aged samples at concentrations above its threshold value. Most other key odorants found in the young noble rot wine were still detected 5 - 6 years after harvest: varietal aroma (alpha-terpineol), sotolon, fermentation alcohols (3 -methylbutan- 1 -ol and 2 -phenylethanol) and esters (<b>ethyl</b> butyrate, <b>isobutyrate,</b> hexanoate, and isovalerate), and oak maturation-related compounds (guaiacol, vanillin, eugenol, beta-damascenone, trans-non- 2 -enal, beta-methyl-gamma-octalactone, gamma-nonalactone, and furaneol), as well as three newly identified aromas exhibiting interesting cake, honey-like, and dried apricot odors: homofuraneol, theaspirane, and gamma-decalactone. Interestingly, abhexon, never mentioned in sweet wines before, was found to be synthesized during bottle aging. An optimized extraction method allowed us to quantify this honey/spicy compound at levels close to its threshold value (up to 7 mug/L after 5 - 6 years), thus suggesting a key role of this strong odorant in old Sauternes wines...|$|R

In control studies the same analyses were carried out in newborns from untreated rats. At birth (day 0), treated animals exhibited a proliferated, pleiomorphic peroxisomal population (higher Vv, NA and D, and a spread distribution of profile diameter with respect to the controls). In the subsequent two days, many peroxisomes disappeared (decrease of Vv and NA to values even lower than controls), with a persisting high pleiomorphism (no change of D and diameter distribution) in residual ones. Starting from day 3, and up to day 6, larger peroxisomes were no longer detectable in test animals, and a significant, not pleiomorphic proliferation took place (D and diameter distributions strictly comparable to the controls and progressively increasing Vv and NA). The correlation analysis validated these morphological results, from which it can be surmised that the postnatal peroxisome recovery period consists of a destructive phase followed by a proliferative one.

Geometry optimizations and frequency calculations {{of all of the}} species involved, as well as the hindrance potential descriptions for reactants and transition states, have been performed with the Moller-Plesset (MP 2) method using the 6 - 311 G(d,p) basis set. A validation of all of the connections between transition states and local minima was performed by intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations. Electronic energies for all of the species are reported at the CCSD(T) /cc-pVTZ level of theory in kcal mol(- 1) with the zero-point energy corrections. The CCSD(T) /CBS (extrapolated from CCSD(T) /cc-pVXZ, in which X = D, T, Q) was used for the reactions of methyl ethanoate + HO 2 radicals as a benchmark in the electronic energy calculations. High-pressure limit rate constants, in the temperature range 500 - 2000 K, have been calculated for all of the reaction channels using conventional transition state theory with asymmetric Eckart tunneling corrections. The 1 -D hindered rotor approximation has been used for the low frequency torsional modes in both reactants and transition states.

Here, the plasma polymerization of three structurally related ester precursors, <b>ethyl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (EIB), methyl isobutyrate (MIB) and ethyl trimethylacetate (ETMA) is compared at low and high pressure. In moving from a low pressure to higher pressure regime, significant changes in the plasma chemistry and resulting plasma polymer deposit were observed with much higher retention of chemical functionality at the higher pressure observed. Until now these changes would have been attributed to a decrease in the energy/molecule, however we show by direct measurement of the chemistry and physics of the plasma that there is fundamental shift in the properties of the plasma and surface interactions which explain the results. At low pressure (a regime) precursor fragmentation and neutral deposition dominate resulting in poor functional group retention. Increasing the pressure such that the sheath region close to surfaces becomes collisional (g regime) favours production of protonated precursor ions which retain functionality and dominate the deposition process rather than radical species.

In the urban environment, RPW behavioural responses, evaluated over six biweekly observations on pheromone- and molasses- baited traps, showed that more adults were caught by traps supplemented with ethyl propionate and ethyl acetate than by traps supplemented with only ethyl propionate.

40|$|Extraction of {{relevant}} information from highly complex environments {{is a prerequisite}} to survival. Within odour mixtures, such information is contained in the odours of specific elements or in the mixture configuration perceived as a whole unique odour. For instance, an AB mixture of the element A (<b>ethyl</b> <b>isobutyrate)</b> and the element B (ethyl maltol) generates a configural AB percept in humans and apparently in another species, the rabbit.

Taking advantage of the newborn rabbit's ability to learn odour mixtures, we combined behavioural and pharmacological tools to specifically eliminate elemental memory of A and B after conditioning to the AB mixture and evaluate consequences on configural memory of AB. The amnesic treatment suppressed responsiveness to A and B but not to AB. Two other experiments confirmed the specific perception and particular memory of the AB mixture. These data demonstrate the existence of configurations in certain odour mixtures and their representation as unique objects: after learning, animals form a configural memory of these mixtures, which coexists with, but is relatively dissociated from, memory of their elements.

40|$|International audienceOrganisms are {{surrounded}} throughout life by chemically complex odors. How individuals process an odorant within a mixture or a mixture {{as a whole}} is a key question in neuroethology and chemical senses. This question is addressed here by using newborn rabbits, which can be rapidly conditioned to a new stimulus by single association with the mammary pheromone. After conditioning to ethyl maltol (odorant B), pups behaviorally respond to B and an A'B' mixture (68 / 32 ratio) but not to <b>ethyl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (odorant A) or an AB mixture (30 / 70 ratio). This suggests elemental and configural perception of A'B' and AB, respectively. We then explored the neural substrates underlying the processing of these mixtures with the hypothesis that processing varies according to perception. Pups were pseudoconditioned or conditioned to B on postnatal day 3 before exposure to B, A'B' or AB on day 4. Fos expression was not similar between groups (mainly in the olfactory bulb and posterior piriform cortex) suggesting a differential processing of the stimuli that might reflect either stimulus complexity or conditioning effect. Thus, the ratio of components in A'B' vs AB leads to differential activation of the olfactory system which may contribute to elemental and configural percepts of these mixtures. In addition, together with recent behavioral data, this highlights that configural perception occurs even in relatively immature animals, emphasizing the value of the newborn rabbit for exploration of odor mixture processing from molecules to brain and behavior...|$|E
40|$|International audienceElemental and configural {{olfactory}} perception allows {{interaction with the}} environment from very early in life. To evaluate how newborn rabbits can extract and respond to information from the highly complex chemical surroundings, and how experience acts on this sensory, cognitive and behavioural capability, we ran a study in four steps including a total of eight experiments. We mainly used a binary AB mixture comprising <b>ethyl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (component A) and ethyl maltol (component B), previously shown as a bearer of blending properties; in rabbit pups (as in human adults), the mixture elicits a weak configural perception, i. e. the perception of a configural odour different from the odours of the components. First, a repeated exposure to one component of AB led to a more elemental perception of this mixture; conversely, a repeated exposure to AB facilitated its configural processing. Second, similar impact of experience did not appear with a non-blending AC mixture (ethyl isobutyrate-guaïacol). Third, repeated exposure to AB impacted not only the perception of AB, but also {{and in the same}} way the perception of the AC mixture sharing one component, and reciprocally. However, facilitation to perceive one mixture in one mode (configural/elemental) was not generalized to a mixture sharing no components with the experienced mixture [AB versus DE (damascenone and vanillin) ]. Thus, experience contributes to the neonatal perception of odour mixtures and adds plasticity to the perceptual system. However, this impact remains dependent on the chemical composition of the mixtures...|$|E

Only acetaldehyde, diethoxy- 1, 1 -ethane, and sotolon {{have been described as}} key odorants. In the present work, three wines (vintages 2002 and 2003) were investigated by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and gas chromatography–olfactometry (GC-O) aroma extract dilution analysis. The goal was to assess the relative impact of varietal, fermentation, and oak-barrel compounds by using two complementary extraction procedures. No grape terpenoids were found after the long barrel aging (6 years and 3 months). On the other hand, two candy/fruity esters issued from yeast exhibited high flavor dilution factor (FD) values: <b>ethyl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (64 – 1024) and ethyl isovalerate (128 – 1024). As expected, many oak-related odorants were found in the XAD 2 flavor extracts, mainly homofuraneol [2 -ethyl- 4 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 3 (2 H) -furanone] (cotton candy, FD = 16 – 256) and cis-β-methyloctalactone (butter, woody, FD = 256). Most probably issued from oxidation of the grape constituent theaspirane, an exceptional grenadine odor was perceived by GC-O up to dilution 64 – 1024. Chemical oxidation experiments and GC–high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) allowed us to identify it as 4 -hydroxy- 7, 8 -dihydro-β-ionone (RICPsil 5 CB = 1373), a hydrolysis-derived product of dihydrodehydro-β-ionone. With an extraction dedicated to hydrophilic compounds, the key role of sotolon was confirmed (112 – 387 μg/kg; FD = 256 – 1024). This procedure enabled us to also evidence its ethyl analogue, abhexon (31 – 74 μg/kg; FD = 64 – 256) ...|$|E
40|$|Interacting {{with the}} mother during the daily nursing, newborn rabbits {{experience}} her body odor cues. In particular, the mammary pheromone (MP) contained in rabbit milk triggers the typical behavior which helps to localize and seize the nipples. It also promotes the very rapid appetitive learning of simple or complex stimuli (odorants or mixtures) through associative conditioning. We previously showed that 24 h after MP-induced conditioning to odorants A (<b>ethyl</b> <b>isobutyrate)</b> or B (ethyl maltol), newborn rabbits perceive the AB mixture in a weak configural way, i. e., they perceive the odor of the AB configuration {{in addition to the}} odors of the elements. Moreover, after conditioning to the mixture, elimination of the memories of A and B does not affect the memory of AB, suggesting independent elemental and configural memories of the mixture. Here, we evaluated whether configural memory persistence differs from elemental one. First, whereas 1 or 3 -day-old pups conditioned to A or B maintained their responsiveness to the conditioned odorant for 4 days, those conditioned to AB did not respond to the mixture after the same retention period. Second, the pups conditioned to AB still responded to A and B 4 days after conditioning, which indicates stronger retention of the elements than of the configuration when all information are learned together. Third, we determined whether the memory of the elements competes with the memory of the configuration: after conditioning to AB, when the memories of A and B were erased using pharmacological treatment, the memory of the mixture was extended to day 5. Thus, newborn rabbits have access to both elemental and configural information in certain odor mixtures, and competition between these distinct representations of the mixture influences the persistence of their memories. Such effects certainly occur in the natural context of mother-pup interactions and may contribute to early acquisition of knowledge about the surroundings...|$|E

A {{comprehensive}} knowledge of the insect olfactory system {{is essential for the}} development of efficient semiochemical-based control methods. The olfactory sensilla are located particularly on the antennae, and these can detect plant volatiles that provide important cues for the insects in the search for their host plants. To date, the fine structure of P. archon antennal sensilla studies and their role in host-plant perception have not been investigated in great detail. Using light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy, the antennae of both sexes of P. archon are described here in detail, according to the different types, quantities and distributions of the sensilla. Six types of sensilla were identified. The most widespread are sensilla trichoidea, sensilla basiconica and sensilla auricilica, which are associated with olfactory function. These have cuticular shafts characterised by numerous pores, and they are innervated by two or three sensory neurons. Sensilla coeloconica, sensilla chaetica and sensilla ampullacea are associated with olfactory or olfactory-thermoreception, mechano-gustatory, and thermo-hygroreception functions, respectively. Moreover, the role of P. archon antennae in locating of the host palms was evaluated using electroantennograms, to monitor responses to ester and terpene compounds previously identified as volatiles of damaged/fermenting palm tissues.

The resulting three levels of nitrogen were: Control 450 mg/L YAN, 600 mg/L YAN and 700 mg/L YAN. Half the wines were subjected to a short-term artificial ageing (6 weeks at 30 ° C) and then aged at 8 ° C for 8. 5 months. The remainder were naturally aged for 10 months at 8 ° C. The chemical composition of the treatment wines was investigated. Standard wine composition parameters were determined (e. g. alcohol, titratable acidity, residual sugar). HS-SPME-GC-MS methods were used to measure specific volatile fatty acids, esters and sulphides. A sensory panel of wine professionals {{was used to determine}} if there were sensory differences between the wine treatments. Statistical analysis on the chemical data using MANOVA, principal component analysis, and canonical variate analysis showed the following results: a) esters concentrations tended to decrease with nitrogen addition with the exception of ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, hexyl acetate and ethyl 2 methyl butanoate. Conversely, artificially aging the wines significantly increased the concentration of four esters and decreased hexyl acetate; b) fatty acid concentrations decreased with nitrogen addition with the exception of decanoic acid, which significantly increased. Artificial aging of the wines caused a significant increase in decanoic acid concentration; c) dimethyl sulphide (DMS) decreased across the DAP amendments, however DMS and methanethiol both increased with artificial aging. Multidimensional scaling analysis of the sensory data showed the participants could differentiate that the wines had age related differences. Any sensory effects from variations in DAP addition were not able to be perceived either because the variation was to subtle or overwhelmed by the more obvious differences caused by the artificial aging. The aged wines were described as more “mature”, “reduced”, “jammy” with less “floral, fruity” on the nose. Significant increases in the fatty acid decanoic acid with aging seems to be partially responsible for the maturity characteristics. PLSR results correlated it to the “spicy” characteristics.

40|$|The {{first step}} of odor {{detection}} and discrimination of structurally diverse odorants depends of their interactions with olfactory receptors (ORs) [1], whereas the perception of odors quality results from a combinatorial coding [2], whose identification still remains a major challenge. Recently, Martinez-Mayorga et al. demonstrated that odor description can be successfully analyzed using a metric approach by performing a descriptive analysis of the Flavor Base database ([URL] version 2010) [3]. The current version Flavor Base (9 th edition, 2013) {{is one of the}} largest collections of flavor molecules (4226 molecules). We extracted 3508 molecules for which the described odors result from an orthonasal perception and identified 251 odor descriptors present in at least 5 molecules. The 3508 odorant molecules and the 251 descriptors have been used to create a matrix whose each element was converted into binary values: 1 when the descriptor appears in odor description, 0 otherwise [3]. We performed an in silico study involving correspondence analysis of odor descriptors and hierarchical clustering, showing the existence of several odor groups. We focused on three odor descriptors associated in several descriptions: “strawberry”, “caramellic” and “pineapple”. Indeed, previous investigations on the perception of a mixture including specific proportions of <b>ethyl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (strawberry-like odor) and ethylmaltol (caramel-like odor) have revealed that this specific mixture was especially judged as more typical of a pineapple odor than the individual components [4 - 8]. Assuming that molecules sharing a same odorant quality possess common structural molecular property [9]), our assumption was that molecule sharing strawberry, caramel or pineapple odor should also share several common structural characteristics. To test this hypothesis, we used Common Feature Pharmacophore Generation protocol (HipHop) implemented in Discovery Studio 2. 1 (Accelrys Inc.) [10] to generate pharmacophore hypotheses. We selected 7 molecules described as “strawberry”, 6 molecules as “caramel” and 6 molecules as “pineapple” and then performed HipHop Pharmacophore Generation on each subset separately. A pharmacophore comparison leads to obtain a good mapping of these three pharmacophore models, putting forward a common spatial arrangement of chemical features. Bibliography: [1] L. Buck, R.

This thesis investigates the effects of altering grapevine UV-B exposure and water availability on wine aroma compounds, focussing {{on the role of}} AAs in the process. Pinot noir vines growing in the Lincoln University vineyard and own-rooted, potted Pinot noir vines growing in a glasshouse were use in this study. In the glasshouse, different UV-B (+UV and -UV) and irrigation (+W and -W) treatments were established from veraison. A field trial water deficit treatment was not able to be put in place due to rainfall events, but fully exposed fruit (LR) was compared to fruit shielded from UV-B using PETG screens erected over the fruiting zone (PETG) and fruit shielded from full sun using shadecloth (SC). As small amounts of fruit were available for this study, micro-vinifications of 160 g and 100 g for the field and glasshouse study, respectively, were applied. HPLC analysis of wine AAs indicated UV-B radiation significantly decreased total AA concentrations and most individual AAs by a range of 41 % to 93 %. Water deficit in the glasshouse study increased total and some individual AAs by a range of 56 % to 90 %. This provided a good basis on which to investigate impacts of fruit AAs on wine aroma compounds. SPME-GCMS analysis of wine showed that concentrations of higher alcohols, fatty acids, esters and norisoprenoids were related to the consumption of AAs during yeast fermentation. From the pattern of results it can be concluded that direct catabolism of AAs into aroma compounds is less likely than their having an indirect effect on aroma compounds formation during alcoholic fermentation. As relationships exist between AA consumption during fermentation and wine aroma compounds, the effects of UV-B and irrigation treatments on aroma compounds (via affecting grape AAs) deserved additional investigation. In the glasshouse trial higher alcohols, fatty acids, esters, monoterpenes and C 13 -norisoprenoids were affected. +UV decreased the concentration of phenylethyl alcohol, hexanoic acid, ethyl acetate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>isobutyrate,</b> ethyl butanoate, ethyl isovalerate, ethyl hexanoate, and ethyl decanoate, and isoamyl acetate in wine, but did not affect isoamyl alcohol. UV-B exposure increased the concentration of linalool and decreased that of citronellol. On the other hand, water deficit in the glasshouse experiment increased most esters. For the field experiment β-damascenone in wines was unaffected by LR and PETG, but decreased by SC. Principal Components Analysis showed distinct separation of treatments: for example -UV-W tended to be more dominated by compounds related to fruity and floral aromas. These results suggest sunlight (and thus UV-B) exposure and water deficit have direct effects on fruit AAs, which leads to significant differences in some wine aroma compounds. Moreover, UV-B radiation and water deficit combined had interactive effects on wine aromas. Based on these results, water deficit could amplify the positive effects of UV-B exclusion on the formation of aroma compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} of odor {{perception}} is an interaction between odorants and olfactory receptors (ORs) [1]. It is now accepted that the main strategy used by Humans to perceive thousands of odors results from a combinatorial coding [2]. Moreover, odors we perceived in our environment are mainly the result of mixtures of odorants; however, the processes involved remain poorly understood [3]. In previous studies performed in the CSGA of Dijon[4, 5], the perception of a mixture of specific proportions of <b>ethyl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (Et-iB, strawberry-like odor) and ethyl maltol (Et-M, caramel-like odor) was investigated in comparison with a reference (allyl hexanoate, Al-H, pineapple-like odor) chosen to evoke an odor close to the one expected in the mixture. The binary specific mixture of Et-iB and Et-M was judged as more typical of a pineapple odor than the individual components, whereas Al-H constitutes a good pineapple odor reference. Assuming that combinations of activated ORs encode odor qualities and that molecules sharing a same odorant quality possess common structural molecular property [6, 7], our assumption was that molecules sharing strawberry, caramel or pineapple odor should also share several common structural characteristics. We used Common Feature Pharmacophore Generation protocol (Discovery Studio 4. 1, Biovia) to generate pharmacophore hypotheses [8]; {{the maximum number of}} generated hypothesis for each run was set to 10. In our study, the pharmacophoric features considered are hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) and hydrophobic regions (HY). On the one hand, pharmacophore generation performed with the three molecules allowed to obtain 10 hypotheses, and the best model is made up of 2 HY and 2 HBA. On the other hand, the best models obtained on each molecule (all conformers in a range 0 - 20 kcal/mol) are made up of at least 1 HY and 2 HBA. Side-by-side comparisons of pharmacophores reveal inter-features distance commonalities. By performing three tests by mapping of each molecules pair on the pharmacophore of the third molecule, we obtained good fit values for mapping of Et-M and Al-H on Et-iB model (3. 9 - 2. 3; the smallest values correspond to the mapping of Et-M conformers) and for mapping of Et-iB and Al-H on Et-M model (2. 8 - 2. 5; the smallest values correspond to the mapping of Et-iB conformers). Conversely, none of Et-M conformers and only half of Et-iB conformers map on Al-H model and fit values do not exceed 2. Taken together, these results suggest that a common binding site could exist for the three molecules, and Al-H could also bind on sites of Et-iB and Et-M. This is in good accordance with the schema of combinatorial coding [2], that is to say that each of the odor quality results from activation of a pattern of ORs. The existence of an intersection of these ORs patterns supports the hypothesis that molecules involved in a mixture that elicits an emergent odor, recognize a common set of ORs. References 1.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Wine {{volatile}} {{composition is}} one of the most important constitutes of wine quality, and it is greatly influenced by number of factors. The studies herein were conducted to evaluate the grape and wine aroma affected by different vine nutrient status, vigor and crop levels of Oregon Pinot noir. In the first study, aroma potentials in early and late maturity Pinot noir grapes were investigated in two consecutive vintages. The grape samples were hydrolyzed under acidic conditions and the released odorants were studied by aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA). Forty-nine main odor-active compounds were detected in the AEDA. The odorants released with high flavor dilution values were 1 -hexanal, β-damascenone, guaiacol and vanillin, together with C₆ aldehydes and alcohols, 4 -vinylguaiacol, 4 -vinylphenol and 1 -octen- 3 -one. The concentrations of aroma-active compounds were further quantitated by SPME-GC-MS and SBSE-GC-MS. Comparing with early harvest grapes, late harvest grapes released more β-damascenone, vanillin, 4 -vinylguaiacol and 4 -vinylphenol in both years according to both AEDA and quantitation results, suggesting they were important aroma compounds that contribute to the characteristic of mature Pinot noir grapes. The second study evaluated the volatile composition of grape berries subjected to varying levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) supply. Pinot noir grapevines were grown in a pot-in-pot system for three years (beginning when they were 4 -years-old) and fertigated with either complete nutrition (Control) or with reduced levels of either N, P, or K supply while holding all other nutrients constant. Nitrogen was varied from 7. 50 mM total N supply (Control) to 1. 13 mM in five discreet treatments, while P and K supply were each varied in four discreet treatments with the lowest rate of 0 mM during fertigation events. Aroma volatiles in berries were determined in each year using SPME-GC-MS technique. Results showed that reducing N supply resulted in lower concentrations of C₆ compounds and total β-damascenone in berries across all three years. Low N supply had little impact on monoterpenes. Reducing N supply resulted in higher bound form α-terpineol in two of the three years. Compared to P and K, N supply showed a more profound influence on the volatile profiles of the grape berries, indicating the important role of N in the biosynthesis of berry volatile and volatile precursors. The volatile composition of resulting wines from the same study was also investigated. Results showed that reducing N supply increased the total phenolic content in wine across all years. N supply has a profound impact on wine volatiles with the greatest effect on yeast-derived esters and higher alcohols. In general, reducing N supply decreased straight-chain esters and many straight chain alcohols, but increased the branched-chain esters, and phenethyl ester and phenethyl alcohol in wine across all years. The effect of N supply on monoterpenes in wine was not consistent from year to year. Low N wines also had reduced levels of volatile sulfur compounds in 2 of 3 years. Compared to the Control, reducing N and K supply resulted in lower quantities of total β-damascenone across all years. Altering P supply did not have reproducible effects on wine volatiles from year to year. The third study investigated the composition of Pinot noir wines produced from vines with varying vegetative vigor levels and two crop levels over three vintages (2011, 2012, and 2013) in the cool climate viticulture region of western Oregon. Wine was produced from grapes grown with two inter-row floor management treatments (tilled or grass) and two crop levels, including full crop and half crop achieved through cluster thinning. Crop thinning treatments didn’t alter the wine volatile composition. Certain wine volatiles were affected by the vineyard floor management treatments. Wines produced from grapes grown in the Grass treatment (lower vigor) had higher levels of grape-derived compounds such as α-terpineol, β-citronellol, vitispirane and TDN compared to wines produced from the Tilled treatment. Wines from Grass treatment also had higher isoamyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, isoamyl acetate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>isobutyrate,</b> ethyl isovalerate, and phenethyl acetate but lower levels of linalool, 1 -propanol and 1 -octanol. A subproject of this study investigated the carotenoid breakdown and C₁₃-norisoprenoids synthesis in Pinot noir grapes from vines of differing vigor and crop levels (yield). Carotenoid degradation and C₁₃-norisoprenoid synthesis during berry development with different vine balance was monitored from véraison to harvest in year 2013. Our data suggests that vineyard floor management had a greater influence than did cluster thinning on carotenoids composition in grapes. Grape berries from Tilled treatment vines have higher carotenoids and C₁₃-norisoprenoids than the grapes from Grass treatment vines. Multivariance analyses also showed some interactions between the vineyard floor treatments and cluster thinning treatments on the composition of carotenoids and C₁₃-norisoprenoids...|$|E
