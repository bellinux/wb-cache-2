50|$|Popular {{styles of}} ring enhancers include wrap rings and insert rings. A Ring Wrap {{is a single}} band, {{contoured}} to fit around a solitaire diamond ring, displaying additional diamonds {{on both sides of}} the center stone. This type of enhancer literally wraps around the solitaire diamond, without completely encircling the center stone. An <b>insert</b> <b>ring</b> is usually a split, double band which provides a gap between the two bands for the diamond solitaire ring to slide into. With this style of enhancer, accent stones frequently completely encircle the center stone.|$|E
50|$|When {{selecting}} a ring enhancer, {{it is necessary}} to know both {{the size and shape of}} the solitaire diamond worn in conjunction with the enhancer. The shape of the enhancer must conform to the original ring and allow the center stone to fit properly into the wrap or <b>insert.</b> <b>Ring</b> wraps displaying subtle curves are suitable for round diamond center stones. Pointed ring inserts are better suited for marquise or oval shaped diamonds. When {{selecting a}} wrap ring, consider choosing a similar metal to that of the engagement ring. In some instances, the wrap ring is soldered to the engagement ring to ensure a snug fit. A big advantage of having both rings made from the same metal type is that the rings will be easier to re-size or repair, if needed. Women with short fingers often use a wedding ring enhancer as their wedding band. Women with long fingers find it easier to wear both a wedding band and a ring enhancer. All of these considerations are important in order for the two rings to blend seamlessly together.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe failure {{analysis}} of an <b>insert</b> <b>ring</b> of a burner in a 156 MW gas turbine made of 20 Cr 32 Ni 1 Nb alloy is presented. Normally, the useful service life of these parts under ideal conditions is about 30, 000 h. However, more likely fracture and failure could {{be observed in}} 5000 -h inspections, {{which resulted in the}} early and premature replacement of these parts. Microstructural changes of the alloy were carefully examined after utilization by means of optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). An increase of Nb element in carbides and dissolution of secondary interdendritic carbides after 5000 h of operation were observed. The studies indicate that the most damaging factors are the adverse working conditions and thermal stresses...|$|E

40|$|Slow-light {{components}} are attractive for many practical applications, such as narrow linewidth lasers and optical delay line. Characteristics {{of a novel}} slow-light reflector, which is composed of a fiber resonator and an extremely low reflectivity fiber Bragg grating (LRFBG), are proposed and analyzed theoretically and experimentally. Due to the light recirculating propagation in the fiber resonator by using a low split ratio coupler, the LRFBG <b>inserted</b> <b>ring</b> provides not only high reflectivity, but also an enlarged group delay, which shows a good slow-light property. In our research, the effective reflectance up to unity can be obtained when the FBG reflectivity and coupler split ratio reach to the critical values for lossless cases. Double peak resonant effects are also observed when the reflectivity of FBG {{is larger than the}} critical value. A supernarrow-linewidth fiber laser using the proposed slow-light reflector as its output cavity mirror is built experimentally to verify the analyzed results. It is believed that the proposed slow-light component will have some good applications due to the merits of compactness and low cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{competition}} between objects that roll on a ramp is an activity used {{frequently in the}} basic levels to challenge students’ previous ideas. From {{the perspective of the}} study of the dynamics of rotating objects, this is to show to the students the effect of the distribution of mass on their movement in order that the students infer or discover that an object with lower rotational energy will win the race. On the other hand, it is to highlight that the acceleration of rolling objects does not depend on their radios and their masses. In this work, a critique of the approach the textbooks have on this problem is presented and the ideas, students revealed as predictions in an activity of Predict – Observe – Explain, are reported. Students only made use of their previous ideas related to friction, mass and weight. They were essentially unable to identify the distribution of mass as a decisive cause in the movement of different rolling objects (<b>inserted</b> <b>rings</b> competing with another parallel ring and a <b>ring</b> with an <b>inserted</b> cylinder) ...|$|R
40|$|In this {{experimental}} investigation {{convective heat}} transfer, friction factor, and thermal enhancement characteristics of straight circular duct fitted with circular <b>ring</b> <b>insert</b> of constant heat flux boundary condition under fully developed laminar flow is presented.

Inserts of different pitch to diameter ratios of 6. 25, 8. 33, 12. 5, and 16. 67 with center core rod were used for this investigation. The circular <b>ring</b> <b>insert</b> shows a superior thermal performance than plain tube.
