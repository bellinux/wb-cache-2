5000|$|The 18000 lbf kN to 19000 lbf kN thrust -218B engine version {{shares a}} 98% {{commonality}} {{with the existing}} engine, with changes designed to reduce NOx, improve durability, and reduce noise levels by 3 dB. The 218B could be certified in early to mid-1996. The new engine, dubbed the [...] "8000", was to feature a new fan of increased diameter (by 1.7 in), extended <b>exhaust</b> <b>cone,</b> a larger LP compressor, a new annular burner, and a new LP turbine and mixer. The initial thrust rating would be around 21700 lbf kN. A launch decision on the new engine was expected by mid-1994, but never occurred. The MD-80 Advanced was also to offer a new flight deck instrumentation package and a completely new passenger compartment design. These changes would be available by retrofit to existing MD-80s, and was forecast to enter service by July 1993.|$|E
50|$|Key to the engine's {{working cycle}} was an axial {{compressor}} of then-unique construction. Most German engines {{of the era}} had the stators {{do all of the}} actual compression, with the rotors speeding up the air for them to compress. In the HeS 30, the rotor and stators shared compression about 50-50, a design originally provided by Rudolph Friedrich of Junkers. Overall the engine had a five-stage compressor providing air at a compression ratio of 3:1 to ten flame cans, which powered a single-stage turbine. The turbine was also unique for the era, using a set of guide vanes that were adjustable for various operating speeds. Like most German axial engines, the engine also included a variable-geometry <b>exhaust</b> <b>cone</b> to lower back pressure when starting, but used an electric starter motor instead of the Riedel two-stroke, opposed-twin piston engine built into the BMW 003, Jumo 004 and the later HeS 011 engine designs for startup needs.|$|E
40|$|The {{mounting}} bolt hole of aircraft engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>cone</b> was found cracked in the weld area. <b>Exhaust</b> <b>cone</b> material is Į/ȕ titanium (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) alloy. The cracked section will be repaired by welding to restore its function. The purpose {{of this research is}} to evaluate the effect of post weld heat treatment (PWHT) on ductility, grain size, and shear strength of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V plates (0. 063 in. thickness) welded by gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) using commercial purity (CP) titanium wire electrode (AMS 4951 H). The weld quality was evaluated by non-destructive and destructive tests, using the acceptance criteria of AWS D 17. 1 and AWS B 2. 1 as references. The effect of PWHT was examined by preparing two weld specimens: with and without PWHT at 620 oC. Non-destructive inspection by dye penetrant and x-ray radiography tests revealed that the weld in these two specimens is free from surface and internal defects. Weld specimen without PWHT is brittle and failed during fillet break test, whereas PWHT specimen is ductile and pass the same test. Metallography observation was conducted to measured grain size of base metal and heat affected zone (HAZ). The average grain size of PWHT specimen is 18. 40 m on base metal and 36. 80 m on HAZ, and for non-PWHT specimen is 26. 85 m on base metal and 52. 10 m on HAZ. Using Hall-Petch approach, the yield strength is calculated about 920 MPa on the base metal of PWHT specimen, which result in the shear strength of about 531 MPa. Under static loading, the shear stress on the outer surface of <b>exhaust</b> <b>cone</b> due to exhaust gas is about 38 MPa, whic...|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} to feature an 11-stage axial {{compressor}} enclosed in a sheet-steel casing and a 2-stage, air-cooled turbine. It was proposed that an air-bleed {{system should be}} installed after the fifth compressor stage to supply compressed air, if needed. The RLM ordered ten pre-production examples of the 109-012 to be built at Dessau for testing, where several parts for the engines were already completed including nine <b>exhaust</b> <b>cones.</b> In December 1944, the RLM issued an order to Junkers calling for the firm to cease development on the 109-012, and further design work was moved to several other firms. By {{the end of the}} war, only one mock-up had been completed.|$|R
40|$|Ultra high {{temperature}} ceramic coatings (UHTCs) have a potential use as thermal protection systems in rocket <b>exhaust</b> <b>cones,</b> insulating tiles {{for the space}} shuttle, and engine components. The porous ceramic coatings require a sealing strategy with ceramic nanoparticles to enhance the corrosion resistance and prevent the formation of thermally grown oxides (TGO) at the ceramic/metallic interface. In this context, we report a simple, yet highly versatile sol–gel process to seal the pores in alumina coating with silica nanoparticles. Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) was used as sol–gel precursor. Polysilicate molecules are likely formed inside the coating pores during the sol–gel process. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization tests were performed to measure the corrosion resistance of alumina coatings before and after treatment with TEOS. A significant enhancement of the corrosion resistance of alumina coating was performed via post-treatment with sol–gel silica which perfectly sealed the open pores and voids in alumina coatings.

40|$|Multilayer ceramic {{coatings}} {{that incorporate}} mullite, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and ultra-high temperature zirconium diboride (ZrB 2) are suited for thermal protection systems in rocket <b>exhaust</b> <b>cones,</b> insulating tiles {{for the space}} shuttle, engine components and ceramic coatings that are embedded into the windshield glass of many airplanes. The coatings were plasma sprayed simultaneously on roughened mild steel cylinder where ZrB 2 was firstly deposited followed by mullite and YSZ coatings. A net-shape multilayer ceramic cylinder has been formed by chemical dissolution of the metallic cylinder in acidic medium. The net-shape multilayer ceramics can be simulated with metallic structure and used as a burner for a scramjet engine. The SEM micrographs showed the typical lamellar structure of plasma sprayed coatings. Cracks were evident at the lamella boundaries due to thermal stresses of ZrB 2 and YSZ. ANSYS version 12. 1 was used to perform the finite element analysis of the TBC. A theoretical modeling for the time to mullite melting at different heat fluxes (1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5 W/mm 2) was investigated. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Four failed {{components}} of an aeroengine {{were sent to}} the laboratory for determining the modes of fracture. Examination of the failed components revealed that ring sealing expansion and support ring sealing front have fractured at high temperatures under static overload, whereas the adaptor special G 1 ‘A’ failed by fatigue due to deficiency in welding. The sub-assembly ring sealing <b>exhaust</b> <b>cone</b> front was found free from any mechanical damages except for some minor rub marks at one location on the knurled region. A thin layer of metal deposition was observed over a sector of this ring...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Cleveland altitude wind tunnel to determine the operational characteristics of the I- 40 jet-propulsion engine over a range of pressure altitudes from 10, 000 to 50, 000 feet and ram-pressure ratios from 1. 00 to 1. 76. Engine operational data were obtained with the engine in the standard configuration and with various modifications of the fuel system, the electrical system, and the combustion chambers. The effects of altitude and airspeed on operating speed range, starting, windmilli. ng, acceleration, speed regulation, cooling, and vibration of the standard and modified engines were determined, and damage to parts was noted. Maximum engine speed was obtainable at all altitudes and airspeeds wi th each fuel-control system investigated. The minimum idling speed was raised by increases in altitude and airspeed. The lowest minimum stable speeds were obtained with the standard configuration using 40 -gallon nozzles with individual metering plugs. The engine was started normally at altitudes as high as 20, 000 feet {{with all of the}} fuel systems and ignition combinations except one. Ignition at 70, 000 feet was difficult and, although successful ignition occurred, acceleration was slow and usually characterized by excessive tail-pipe temperature. During windmilling investigations of the engine equipped with the standard fuel system, the engine could not be started at ram-pressure ratios of 1. 1 to 1. 7 at altitudes of 10, 000, 20, 000 and 30, 000 feet. When equipped with the production barometric and Monarch 40 -gallon nozzles, the engine accelerated in 12 seconds from an engine speed of 6000 rpm to 11, 000 rpm at 20, 000 feet and an average tail-pipe temperature of 11000 F. At the same altitude and temperature, all the engine configurations had approximately the same rate of acceleration. The Woodward governor produced the safest accelerations, inasmuch as it could be adjusted to automatically prevent acceleration blow out. The engine speed was held constant by the Woodward governor and the Edwards regulator during simulated dives and climbs at constant throttle position. The bearing cooling system was satisfactory at all altitudes and airspeeds. The engines operated without serious failure, although the <b>exhaust</b> <b>cone,</b> the tail pipe, and the airplane fuselage were damaged during altitude starts...|$|E

2500|$|The road racing {{version of}} the XR-750 used an {{aluminum}} oil tank, had a [...] fiberglass fuel tank, and a fiberglass fairing which included extra heat shielding to protect the rider's left leg when riding in a tuck position. On the top center of the fuel tank was a leather pad with a round cutout for the left-side fuel filler cap. Like the dirt tracker, it used a Ceriani fork and Girling shocks, two 36mm Mikuni carburetors and tuned dual reverse <b>cone</b> <b>exhaust.</b> Instrumentation consisted of a Smiths tachometer.|$|R

40|$|There is current {{interest}} in the impact of particles in fire smoke on the toxic hazards in fires and {{on the health of}} fire fighters. The exposure of people in fires to PM is over 1000 times that in ambient air and the role of breathing high PM in fires in fire deaths and impairment of escape from fires is unknown, as there are very few measurements of particle mass and size in fires. The exposure period would typically be 30 minutes and longer for fire fighters. The cone calorimeter is a standard piece of laboratory fire test equipment for heat release and smoke production measurements, by obscuration. It has been adapted by the authors to enable the measurement of toxic gas species using a heated Gasmet FTIR. This was used alongside the Cambustion DMS 500 particle size equipment to determine the particle size distribution. The FTIR measurements were made on the raw gas emissions from the chimney from the fire compartment and the DMS 500 measurements were on the diluted <b>exhaust</b> on the <b>cone</b> calorimeter. The experiments were carried out with an air box around the test specimen to simulate a compartment fire with a fixed ventilation rate. The ventilation rate used simulated an air starved fire typical of the conditions in a modern energy efficient house. The cone calorimeter was operated at 35 MW/m 2 radiant flux and the ignition delay was 29 s. The HRR was 90 kW/m 2 throughout the flaming combustion period. The combustion conditions were very rich with high CO and aldehyde emissions. The cone calorimeter dilutes the products from the chimney of the fire using ambient air and the dilution ratio was about 100 at the particulate measurement point. The particle size distribution showed a classic nuclei and cumulative mode distribution with the nuclei peak at 20 nm and the cumulative mode peak at 200 nm. There was a high 20 nm peak during the ignition delay, indicating a vaporised aerosol of high MW compounds from the wood, which were analysed using the FTIR. 20 nm Particles continued to be produced 1 x 1011 /cc for the 1400 s burning period of the pine wood samples and continued to be produced in the char burning phase. The 200 nm cumulative mode particles were produced at 1 x 109 /cc throughout the flaming combustion and then fell to < 1 x 108 /cc in the smouldering phase of the fire. The size distributions were quite different than those from biomass wood stoves and from modern diesels engines, although they had some similarity with old dirty diesels of the 1980 s. The FTIR analysis showed a large peak in CO (4 %) and THC (6 %) at around 800 – 1200 s in the fire. There was no equivalent dramatic change in the particle number in this time period, other than a small fall in the number of 20 nm particles and {{rise in the number of}} 200 nm particles. This work shows that fine particle emissions are likely to be a strong health effect in fires, as they are much higher than in diesel exhausts...|$|R
