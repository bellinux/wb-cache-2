25|$|Red giant branch {{stars have}} another issue for {{detecting}} planets around them: while planets around these stars {{are much more}} likely to transit due to the larger size, these transit signals are hard to separate from the main star's brightness light curve as red giants have frequent pulsations in brightness with a period of few hours to days. This is especially notable with subgiants. In addition, these stars are much more luminous and transiting planets block much smaller percentage of light coming from these stars. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> planets can completely occult a neutron star or a white dwarf which would be easily detectable from Earth. However, due to their small sizes, chance of a planet aligning such a stellar remnant is extremely small.|$|E

Tolkien dismissed critics' direct comparisons to Wagner, telling his publisher, [...] "Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases." [...] According to Humphrey Carpenter's biography of Tolkien, the author held Wagner's interpretation of the relevant Germanic myths in contempt. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> sense, some critics [...] hold that Tolkien's work borrows so liberally from Wagner that Tolkien's work exists {{in the shadow of}} Wagner's. Others, such as Tom Shippey and Gloriana St. Clair, [...] attribute the resemblances to the fact that Tolkien and Wagner have created homologue works based in the same sources. However, Shippey and other researchers have written on an intermediary position, stating that both the authors, indeed, used the same source materials but that Tolkien was, in fact, indebted to some of the [...] original developments, insights and artistic uses made upon those sources that first appeared in Wagner, and sought to improve upon them.|$|E

In order to understand the mechanism and efficiency of resource utilization in intercropping of maize (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max), a field experiment was conducted as factorial on the bases of randomized complete block design of three patterns with three replications. Three cropping patterns were maize monocropping (A), 2 rows maize and 2 rows soybean intercropping (C) and 2 rows maize and 4 rows soybean intercropping (D). Our studies showed that compared with monocropping, <b>the</b> temperature <b>in</b> intercropping was a little higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daytime, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nighttime, <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> results were observed; <b>the</b> relative humidity <b>in</b> intercropping was lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daytime, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nighttime, <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> results were observed; <b>the</b> light intensity <b>in</b> intercropping was markedly higher than that <b>in</b> monocropping. <b>The</b> yield components of maize in intercropping, including thousand kernel weight, yield per plant and leaf area were increased than that in monocropping.
