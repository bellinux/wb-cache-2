500|$|The flitch {{trials were}} revived in the Victorian era after the {{publication}} of Ainsworth's novel in 1854 which proved to be tremendously popular. [...] Ainsworth aided the reinstitution by himself donating two <b>flitches</b> for the first of the revived ceremonies in 1855. [...] They have been held ever since {{in one form or another}} except for a gap caused by the World Wars. [...] The first ceremony after World War II was held in 1949, despite rationing still being in force. [...] The modern trials are held every fourth year on leap years; the next one is planned for 2020. [...] The event is organised by the Dunmow Flitch Trials Committee who employ a counsel to cross-examine the applicants in an attempt to save the bacon for the sponsors who donated it. [...] The trial is decided by a jury.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century, Denmark's main food export was grain to the UK, {{but it was}} outcompeted by the United States and Russia {{and began}} to switch to pigs and butter from dairy herds. [...] From 1840 to 1870 grain was almost half of Denmark's exports, but by 1900 this had fallen to under 3 per cent. [...] Denmark {{exported}} bacon to the United Kingdom from at least 1847, when <b>flitches</b> of bacon were specially prepared for the English market, but had no large-scale production until 1864, when the Second Schleswig War made export of live pigs to Hamburg, where up to then they had been slaughtered and cured, impossible and Denmark was forced to do this locally. [...] However, export to the UK only became significant after Germany, to whom Denmark had been exporting since the Middle Ages, erected trade barriers to (1879), and finally banned (1887), the import of live pigs. [...] The lost German market amounted to almost 300,000 pigs per year and Denmark desperately needed {{to find a new}} market. [...] The Danish imports were welcomed in the UK; the growth in population following the Industrial Revolution meant that the country was no longer self-sufficient in food, but there was an increasing demand from a more affluent working class. [...] At the time, British workers on average pay consumed bacon two to three times a week, and bacon and eggs became the traditional British breakfast. [...] This had previously been quite unaffordable for the working class. [...] By the end of the 19th century, 90% of Danish pig exports went to the UK and accounted for 20% of total Danish exports. [...] This made Denmark the main supplier to the UK, replacing the U.S. which previously held that position. [...] Danish Bacon still had more than 25% of the UK market in the 1980s.|$|E

In that common form it is sometimes referenced as a steel <b>flitch</b> beam. Further alternating layers of wood and steel can be used to produce an even stronger beam. The metal plate(s) within the beam are known as <b>flitch</b> plates.|$|R

From the result, 13 different species, which are the most prominent <b>flitched</b> logs in the market, were randomly selected and measurements were taken on individual species. This was represented in the table 2 (Species A – M) and 10 planks were selected and dimensional measurement i. e. length, breadth and thickness were taken and recorded. Four species A, G, H and J with mean volume of 58788. 76 cm 3, 62168. 83 cm 3, 50609. 61 cm 3 and 62377. 77 cm 3 respectively were discovered to have different variations from the conventional volume of 56633. 69 cm 3. Also, nine different lumber species were considered under the conventional dimension of 28316. 85 cm 3 (i. e. 5. 08 cm x 15. 24 cm x 365. 76 cm). The study also revealed that C, F, K and L <b>flitched</b> dimensions were greater than the conventional dimension.

40|$|Although {{eddy current}} losses in <b>flitch</b> plates of large power {{transformers}} may form {{a small part}} of total transformer losses, they are important because they can appear concentrated in a small area and cause hazardous hot-spots. An analytical method to calculate <b>flitch</b> plate eddy loss is a very useful practical guide to a transformer designer, but for high power transformers, a more accurate analysis by techniques such as the finite element method (FEM) is desirable. A series of 2 -D FEM simulations, using a statistical technique-orthogonal array design of experiments, have been carried out to find the effect of various factors on the losses in a mild steel <b>flitch</b> plate. The procedure for carrying out the experiments and the results obtained thereof are presented. The more involved analysis of slotted <b>flitch</b> plates, has been done using 3 -D FEM. Loss and eddy current patterns in mild steel and stainless steel <b>flitch</b> plates have been studied. In both cases, the effect of the number of slots and dot length on the losses is discussed. Effect of slots on eddy current pattern is explained. Results of simulation of laminated <b>flitch</b> plate are presented. The eddy loss distribution obtained by 3 -D FEM electromagnetic analysis is used in 3 -D FEM thermal analysis to estimate temperature rise of the pitch plate Verification of 3 -D FEM analysis has been done by measurement of temperatures on a slotted mild steel <b>flitch</b> plate of a 33 MVA, single phase, 220 / 132 / 11 kV autotransformer.

Thomasin, as she had expected, was not visible, and Eustacia recollected that a light had shone from an upper window when they were outside--the window, probably, of Thomasin's room. A nose, chin, hands, knees, and toes projected from the seat within the chimney opening, which members she found to unite in the person of Grandfer Cantle, Mrs. Yeobright's occasional assistant in the garden, and therefore one of the invited.

In short they robbed and rioted; the police could make no head against them; there was no military force; the whole district was in their possession: and hearing that a battalion of the Coldstreams were coming down by a train, the Bishop ordered all railroads to be destroyed, and if the Hell-cats had not been too drunk to do his bidding and he too tipsy to repeat it, {{it is probable that}} a great destruction of these public ways might have taken place.|$|E
