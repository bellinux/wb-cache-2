5|$|Following the June 29, 1889 elections, several {{suburban}} townships {{voted to}} be annexed to the city, which offered better services, such as improved water supply, sewerage, and fire and police protection. Hyde Park Township, however, had installed new waterworks in 1883 {{just north of}} 87th Street. Nonetheless, the majority of voters in 1889 supported annexation {{perhaps because of the}} city’s water system for fire prevention or because of the belief that township government <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> unwieldy. After the 1889 annexation Chicago was able to leverage efficiencies as the largest United States city in area and second largest in population.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, Baith Israel {{merged with}} Degraw Street's Talmud Torah Anshei Emes Synagogue, a growing {{congregation}} that <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> large for the row {{house in which}} it held services. Talmud Torah Anshei Emes's membership was mostly made up of Eastern European Jews, who were stricter in their observances than Baith Israel's mostly German-origin membership; to accommodate them, a special all-men section of pews was designated at the front left of the sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{congregation}} {{could still be}} assured of the required quorum of ten men for the minyan during the week, as local businessmen attended the morning and evening prayers before opening and after closing their shops. By 1996, however, the membership was down to around two dozen, and Spiegel began holding services in the small social hall in the basement, as the main sanctuary <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> expensive to maintain.|$|E
5|$|Late Registration is {{the second}} of Kanye West's planned four education-themed studio albums. Following the major success of The College Dropout, the album reveals his {{progression}} in writing lyrics and an incorporation of {{a wider range of}} musical styles. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, {{due in part to the}} acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1936–37 season, the Rangers signed Johnson {{to serve}} as the {{defensive}} coach while he continued to play. He appeared in 35 games but scored no points. Seeing little playing time, and having an offer to coach a minor league team, Johnson requested that the Rangers give him his outright release following the season. Believing that he <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> slow to play, the team agreed. He subsequently signed with the New York Americans, with whom he played one final NHL season in 1937–38.|$|E
5|$|Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich {{appointed}} Kemp {{to head a}} {{tax reform}} commission, (the Kemp Commission), in response to voter concern that the tax code <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> complicated. Kemp championed many issues including the flat tax, which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions, such as mortgage interest, but it remained fairly general. Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates, both Steve Forbes and Phil Gramm proposed the flat tax.|$|E
5|$|According to Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond, {{the series}} <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> grueling and {{complicated}} for modern gamers, and its popularity had suffered relative to Ubisoft flagship franchises such as Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. The Toronto studio hoped {{to introduce the}} franchise to a broader audience, while remaining tactical and hardcore for long-term series fans. It introduced a perfectionist mode, significantly increasing the game's difficulty by removing some of Fisher's abilities. The team also introduced accessible, action-oriented gameplay segments which would suit new players, crafting open-ended levels which could be reached with different approaches to broaden the variety of play. The developers re-worked the controls to increase gameplay fluidity, allowing players to automatically leap over objects and traverse a simplified environment.|$|E

5|$|Being a free city, Sélestat {{attracted}} settlers {{from the}} region who sought protection, freedom and a thriving economic environment. The first city wall, which <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> constricting, was replaced in 1280, and a third wall had to be erected in the 16th century as the city grew. At {{the end of the}} Middle Ages, the population was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000. It was then the fourth largest Alsatian town after Strasbourg (18,000), Colmar and Haguenau (6,000 each). The local economy reached its zenith around 1500. It was centered on shipping and trade (mainly hay, cereals, wine, fish, glass, iron and salt). As the road network was poor and dangerous, goods transited via the Ill river.|$|E
5|$|By 1957 {{the synagogue}} sanctuary, {{which had been}} {{designed}} for 350 families, <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> small to accommodate Temple Israel's over 1,100 member families. In addition, since the 1950s Memphis's Jewish community had been steadily moving from the downtown, where Temple Israel's Poplar Avenue building was located, to the eastern suburbs; by 1957 {{over half of the}} members, and three-quarters of those with children in the congregational school, lived there. School attendance increased rapidly, and the student body soon outgrew its 1951 building. The school had to split attendance in 1959, with the younger children attending on Saturday and the older ones on Sunday, and by 1961, 780 children were enrolled. In the early 1960s, Temple Israel began holding weekday classes at Beth Sholom, which was closer to most members.|$|E
5|$|By May 1942, Conant {{felt that}} the S-1 Committee <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> unwieldy. It had not met since the March meeting. When he needed expert advice in May, he had called upon a smaller group, and he {{recommended}} that this supervise the OSRD work, mainly the technical and contractual aspects of the project, while the Army handled engineering, construction and site selection. Procurement was an OSRD responsibility, but it could turn to the Army for help in case of difficulties. Bush obtained the president's approval for this, and on June 19, 1942, he abolished the S-1 Section {{and replaced it with}} the S-1 Executive Committee. Conant was appointed as its chairman, and Briggs, Compton, Lawrence, Eger Murphree, and Urey as its other members.|$|E

WSF owned passenger-only vessels between 1985 and 2009, but after discontinuing its two passenger-only routes in the 2000s, WSF has sold its passenger-only ferries to other operators.|$|R

5|$|Constructed {{and opened}} in 1906 {{to replace the}} Muntz Street ground, which <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> small to meet the club's needs, the {{original}} St Andrew's could hold an estimated 75,000 spectators, housed in one grandstand and a large uncovered terrace. The attendance record, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341, was set at a 1939 FA Cup tie against Everton. During the Second World War, St Andrew's suffered bomb damage and the grandstand, housing a temporary fire station, burned down in an accidental fire. In the 1950s, the club replaced the stand and installed floodlights, and later erected a second small stand and roofed over the open terraces, but there were few further changes.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, former classmate Tuomas Holopainen invited Turunen to {{join his}} new {{acoustic}} mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, Emppu Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice. Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually {{came to the conclusion}} that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a metal band.|$|E
5|$|St Gwenllwyfo's Church is a 19th-century parish church {{near the}} village of Dulas, in Anglesey, north Wales. It was built between 1854 and 1856 to replace an earlier church in the parish, also {{dedicated}} to St Gwenllwyfo, which needed repair and <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> small for its congregation. The new church was built nearer to the Llys Dulas estate, whose owner contributed £936 towards the total cost of £1,417, rather than near the area where many of the parishioners lived. In 1876, Sir Arundell Neave (who had married into the family that owned Llys Dulas) donated 27 panels of 15th and 16th-century stained glass that had once belonged to a Flemish monastery.|$|E

5|$|Bok tried {{twice to}} flee from slavery {{at the age}} of 14. The first {{instance}} happened early one morning after he had been sent out with the cattle. Bok blindly ran down a road for several miles before he was captured by one of Giemma's fellow militia members. Giemma's peer returned Francis to the Giemma's compound, where he was beaten with a bullwhip. Bok attempted to escape once again just two days later, when he fled in the opposite direction of his previous escape. He once again fled for several miles, this time keeping to the forest. He stopped for water at a local stream crossing, where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to be there as well. Giemma forced Francis back to his home, this time promising to kill him. Francis was beaten again, but Giemma chose not to kill him, as Francis <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> valuable to the family as a slave.|$|E
5|$|Considering its inexperience, Savige's 17thInfantry Brigade {{was given}} a {{complicated}} role in the Battle of Bardia. While the 2/6thInfantry Battalion made a demonstration on the right, the 2/5thInfantry Battalion, reinforced by part of the 2/7thInfantry Battalion, attempted to follow up the 16thInfantry Brigade's attack, with {{the remainder of the}} 2/7th in reserve. The brigade had to move in four directions at once. The plan soon went wrong, as the 2/5th in particular suffered a series of mishaps. By nightfall, Colonel Frank Berryman, the divisional chief of staff, had reached the conclusion that the 17thInfantry Brigade <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> tired and disorganised for further effort. This was only partly due to enemy action; the rest was attributable to Berryman's own plan, which had dispersed the brigade and provided it with inadequate armoured and, in the final stages, artillery support. Savige also bore some of the blame, for failing to ensure that his subordinates understood and carried out the plan.|$|E
5|$|Convinced that Khiêm was {{involved}} in the plot, Khánh had him exiled to Washington as ambassador, and eased General Dương Văn Minh out of the political scene, thereby removing the other two nominal members of the ruling triumvirate. However, concerned that Kỳ and Thi <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>too</b> powerful, Khánh had Phát and Đức acquitted at their military trial in an attempt to use them as political counterweights. Despite his survival, the coup was seen by the historian George McTurnan Kahin as the start of Khánh's ultimate political decline. Due to the intervention of Kỳ and Thi, Khánh was now indebted to them, and in an attempt to maintain his power in the face of increasing military opposition, he tried to court support from Buddhist civilian activists, who supported negotiations with the communists to end the Vietnam War. As the Americans were strongly opposed to such policies, relations with Khánh became increasingly strained and he was deposed in February 1965 with US connivance.|$|E
