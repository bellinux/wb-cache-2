50|$|The {{most common}} {{use of the}} Mikveh is the {{practice}} of immersion after menstruation, miscarriage, or childbirth. This <b>immersion</b> <b>marks</b> {{the end of a}} period of sexual separation, and the woman's rejoining with her husband. It is also required that a woman immerse before her wedding. Some men use the Mikvah regularly, either daily, weekly, or before Yom Kippur. This is especially true in Hasidic circles. It is also required for Conversion into Orthodox Judaism for both sexes.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of marking age- 0 lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, pectoral fin rays with a stable strontium isotope was evaluated. Age- 0 lake sturgeon were reared in water spiked with 0 (control), 25, 50, or 100 μg L- 1 86 SrC 03 for 10 and 24 d; fish from each treatment group were retained {{for up to}} 120 d post-labeling to assess mark retention. Enriched isotope marks imparted to fin rays were distinct from fin ray 88 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of control fish immediately following marking, with the 100 μg L- 1 86 SrCO 3 treatments consistently yielding {{the highest rate of}} marking success (83 - 92 %). Lower marking success (25 - 69 %) was observed with the 25 and 50 μg L- 1 86 SrCO 3 treatments. Isotopic marks in fin rays were retained for 120 d post-labeling. <b>Immersion</b> <b>marking</b> of juvenile fish pectoral fin rays with distinct strontium isotope ratios is possible and does not require sacrificing fish to check for marks...|$|R
40|$|Dermal spicules (or ‘ossicles’) of cultured sea {{cucumbers}} can be fluorescently marked with tetracycline and calcein for sea ranching and restocking but optimal immersion conditions are unknown. Lethal and non-lethal effects, and {{the efficacy of}} marking spicules in juvenile sandfish (Holothuria scabra), were examined under different immersion conditions. Fluorescence brightness {{and the proportion of}} marked spicules generally increased with concentration and duration of immersion. Frequency of burial (an indicator of stress) in sandfish increased with both fluorochromes at concentrations above 50 mg L− 1. Growth in the two weeks post-marking was unaffected at immersion concentrations of 50 and 100 mg L− 1 compared to controls, but appeared inhibited by immersion in solutions of 200 and 400 mg L− 1 of tetracycline or calcein. Sequential marking by tetracycline (yellow) and calcein (green), in either order, showed that calcein was deposited in a higher proportion of spicules. Three other fluorochromes with disparate colors, alizarin complexone, calcein blue and xylenol orange, also marked sandfish spicules and expanded the variety of dichromic combinations. Both tetracycline and calcein fluoresced more brightly when juveniles were marked at 26 or 30 °C than at 21 °C, and this low temperature appears also to reduce the proportion of spicules marked by tetracycline. Our findings show that seawater temperature should be regulated for ex situ <b>immersion</b> <b>marking.</b> The behavioral and biological sensitivities of sandfish demand care in administering the fluorochromes. Fluorochrome immersion at 100 mg L− 1 for 24 h at ≥ 26 °C provides a practical compromise between minimizing the fitness of released juveniles and ensuring the efficacy of the markers for studies on the growth and survival of {{sea cucumbers}} stocked in the wild...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the level of}} proficiency in the minority language, Spanish, {{of students in the}} final years of a two-way <b>immersion</b> program at <b>Mark</b> Twain Elementary School in Houston, Texas. The level of proficiency of these two-way immersion students was gauged by comparing their oral narratives to those produced by the monolingual Spanish speakers in Eugenia Sebastian and Dan I. Slobin's 1994 study, "Development of Linguistic Forms: Spanish. " The Spanish-dominant and native English-Spanish bilingual students in the program were found to have a high level of proficiency in Spanish. However, the English-dominant students in the program have not attained a native-like proficiency in Spanish. Thus, the program, while beneficial for both native and non-native Spanish speakers, is still somewhat lacking in its linguistic education of non-native Spanish speakers...|$|R
40|$|A {{non-lethal}} method providing growth tags is {{a precondition}} for many in-vivo experiments investigating growth of marine invertebrates. This study determines the effectiveness of Calcein, Alizarin Red and Strontium chloride hexahydrate in marking Argentinean surf clams (Donax hanleyanus) under controlled conditions. Wild specimens, collected from Faro Querandi (Buenos Aires province, Argentina), were taged using different concentrations of each stain and several <b>immersion</b> periods. After <b>marking,</b> animals were reared in an aquaculture system to allow growth. Mortality, body condition and growth rate were measured for 20 days to assess {{the effects of the}} treatments. To detect the incorporated marks, shells were cut and sections analyzed using scanning electron microscopy for Strontium chloride hexahydrate and fluorescence microscopy for Calcein and Alizarin Red. Results demonstrate that Calcein was the best growth marker as it provides a long-lasting, readily detected fluorescent mark {{that can be used to}} measure shell growth accurately, even at low concentrations and immersion periods. In addition, marking with Calcein did not affect survivorship or growth and thus is considered to be the best stain evaluated for Donax hanleyanus...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a series of}} osmotic induction procedures for marking golden perch Macquaria ambigua with calcein and alizarin red S (ARS), evaluated the factors that influenced mark quality, and tested for any effects on fish growth and mortality. Three aspects of the marking protocols were considered: immersion time in a 5 % salt solution (0, 5, or 10 min), immersion time in the fluorescent dye (5 or 10 min), and concentration of the dye (low or high). Quantitative estimates of mark intensity using photographs of marked fish were made with image analysis software. Although there were some significant interactions between factors, salt immersion was generally the primary determinant of mark intensity, followed by dye concentration and dye <b>immersion</b> time. Fish <b>marked</b> with calcein did not have higher mortality rates than unmarked fish and had significantly higher growth rates. The highest-exposure ARS treatments resulted in higher mortality and lower growth rates than for unmarked fish. Following this result, a lower-exposure ARS marking protocol was tested, which resulted in no detectable effects on mortality or growth rates while still producing high-quality marks. Although further study of the long-term retention of marks under field conditions is required to understand the limitations of the chemical marking methods examined in this study, our results suggest that the methods would greatly enhance our knowledge of the outcomes of fish stocking.

40|$|Abstract: Periods {{of growth}} from {{symmetric}} feed:fast regimes (i. e., days fed {{followed by the}} same number of days fasted) may increase the uptake of oxytetracycline (C 22 H 24 N 2 O 9. HCL[OTC]) compounds in fishes; however, little empiri-cal data exists. Therefore, we experimentally determined if such feeding regimes influenced the concentration of OTC in-corporated in muscle and skeletal (e. g., otoliths) tissues. Individually-reared female and batch-reared (male and female), age- 1 yellow perch Perca flavescens were subjected to one of four experimental feeding regimes: control (i. e., fed daily), D 2 (i. e., 2 d feed, 2 d deprivation), D 6, or D 12 symmetrical feed:fast regimes. Following several feeding cycles on these feeding regimes, fish were submersed in a 600 mg/L buffered OTC solution; otoliths and muscle tissue were excised and processed to determine OTC uptake via mark quality and concentrations. Ranked otolith scores (mark quality) were sig-nificantly lower for the D 2 feeding regime than control, D 6, and D 12 scores for both individual and batch trials suggesting that frequent food deprivation restricts osteogenesis, while daily or extended feeding periods contribute to osteogenesis. In batch-reared fish, total OTC and 4 -epioxytetracycline peak concentrations in muscle tissue did not significantly differ among treatments but were significantly greater for smaller individuals within treatments suggesting that the OTC uptake and elimination response is mechanistically related to higher gill ventilation volume and gastric ingestion rate of small fish providing increased chemical assimilation and decreased clearing time following OTC <b>immersions.</b> Increased otolith <b>mark</b> quality derived from such feeding protocols may be of particular interest to fisheries managers conducting stoc...|$|R
40|$|Extract] This {{volume is}} the first ever {{large-scale}} Dictionary of the Galo language of Arunachal Pradesh, North East India. It is, however, a very preliminary work. Official recognition of the Galo language has only been completed in 2008, and the first Galo language textbooks will only be introduced into schools in Galo-dominated areas of Arunachal Pradesh in 2009. Both this Dictionary and the mentioned textbooks are based on Galo Script, which itself was only finalized and adopted by the Galo Welfare Society in 2008. All of the Compilers of this Dictionary have completed whatever work they could in their spare time only, trying to approximate {{in the space of}} only two or three years what teams of professional lexicographers often spend ten to fifteen years to complete with full dedication. Accordingly, there are certain to be large numbers of mistakes herein, and/or other points which are unclear and should have been clarified, for which the Compilers can only apologize in advance and beg for our readers' patience and understanding. A serious difficulty which we are only beginning to address concerns dialect variation within the Galo language. While most of the Compilers of this Dictionary speak `Laree Galo, the variety of Galo spoken mainly around the Baasar area, there is in fact a large number of Galo dialects and subdialects, which are spoken widely throughout West Siang District, Upper Subansiri District, and East Siang District in Arunachal Pradesh. A full survey of all Galo dialects would take many years of constant effort, and while we have begun this survey, it is nowhere close to completion at the present time of writing. Therefore, we have chosen to base this Edition of the Dictionary on the `Laree dialect of Galo, although we have also included a certain number of Puugoo Galo words where this was possible. We intend to expand the number of Galo dialects that we are able to include in the dictionary; however, we hope to do this in a systematic manner. Therefore, it will take additional time and we must beg apologies from speakers of Galo whose pronunciation and vocabulary is not well-represented in this Edition. Research Background: This volume {{is the first}} ever large-scale Dictionary of the Galo language of Arunachal Pradesh, North East India, based on original <b>immersion</b> fieldwork by <b>Mark</b> Post. Official recognition of the Galo language has only been completed in 2008, and the first Galo language textbooks will only be introduced into schools in Galo-dominated areas of Arunachal Pradesh in 2009. Both this Dictionary and the mentioned textbooks are based on Galo Script, which itself was only finalized and adopted by the Galo Welfare Society in 2008. This work is an additional outcome of Post's PhD which received an award from the Association for Linguistic Typology, as the best thesis. The authors of the dictionary also include members of the Galo -speaking community. Research Contribution: The main contribution to the field is {{that this is one of}} the most comprehensive dictionaries of ant Tibeto-Burman language of north-east India. This first ever dictionary of Galo is focussed on one major dialect of this language, with cross-dialectal comparisons, etymologies and examples. The dictionary contains a concise description of the language which makes an important contribution to our knowledge of its complicated linguistic system. This book sets new standards for dictionary-making of languages with no written tradition, and the involvement of linguists and community members in creating an important resource. Research Significance: The significance of this book lies in its importance in documentation and analysis of Galo, and other Tibeto-Burman languages which have not been documented. This dictionary has already been used as a model for dictionary-making of languages with no written tradition, and is widely used in the community programs for language maintenance. Its further significance lies in the ways in which cultural information and insights are reflected in the lexicon...|$|R
