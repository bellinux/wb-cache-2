[...] The next time you go up any mountain, look at the loose broken stones with which the top is coated, just {{underneath}} the turf. What has broken them up but frost? Look again, as stronger proof, at the talus of broken stones--screes, as they call them in Scotland; rattles, as we call them in Devon--which lie along the base of many mountain cliffs. What has brought them down but frost? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> country folk {{they will tell you}} whether I am right or not. If you go thither, not in the summer, but just after the winter's frost, you will see for yourselves, by the fresh frost-crop of newly-broken bits, that I am right. Possibly you may find me to be even more right than is desirable, by having a few angular stones, from the size of your head to that of your body, hurled at you by the frost- giants up above. If you go to the Alps at certain seasons, and hear the thunder of the falling rocks, and see their long lines--moraines, as they are called--sliding slowly down upon the surface of the glacier, then you will be ready to believe the geologist who tells you that frost, and probably frost alone, has hewn out such a peak as the Matterhorn from some vast table-land; and is hewing it down still, winter after winter, till some day, where the snow Alps now stand, there shall be rolling uplands of rich cultivable soil.|$|E

Those that stayed on past two jumps usually got injured. Many of the bull's 127 wins were very well the result of cowboys letting him win.
