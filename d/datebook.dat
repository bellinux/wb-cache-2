5|$|The {{day after}} Cleave's article {{appeared}} in the Evening Standard, Beatles press officer Tony Barrow offered <b>Datebook,</b> a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple pop music and producing more intellectually challenging work. As <b>Datebook</b> was a socially progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalization of marijuana, {{it seemed like a}} suitable vehicle to carry this information.|$|E
5|$|The remark {{originates}} from {{an interview}} conducted by journalist Maureen Cleave, who included the statement in a March 1966 {{article for the}} London Evening Standard, which drew no public reaction at the time. When <b>Datebook,</b> a US teen magazine, quoted Lennon's comments five months later in August, extensive protests {{broke out in the}} Southern United States. Some radio stations stopped playing Beatles songs, their records were publicly burned, press conferences were cancelled, and threats were made. The controversy coincided with the group's US tour in August 1966, and Lennon and Brian Epstein attempted to quell the dispute at a series of press conferences. Some tour events experienced disruption and intimidation, including a picketing by the Ku Klux Klan.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{as soon as}} they {{returned}} home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. [...] "Christianity will go," [...] Lennon had said. [...] "It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me." [...] The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine <b>Datebook</b> printed it five months later – {{on the eve of the}} group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American [...] "Bible Belt". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused <b>Datebook</b> of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, [...] "If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it." [...] Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: [...] "If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry." ...|$|E

500|$|Epstein was so {{concerned}} by the reaction that he considered cancelling the group's upcoming US tour, believing they would be seriously harmed in some way. He then flew to the US and {{held a press conference}} in New York City, where he publicly criticised <b>Datebook,</b> saying the magazine had taken Lennon's words out of context, and expressed regret on behalf of the group that [...] "people with certain religious beliefs should have been offended in any way". Epstein's efforts had little effect, as the controversy quickly spread beyond the borders of the US. In Mexico City there were demonstrations against the group, and a number of countries, including South Africa and Spain, made the decision to ban the Beatles' music on national radio stations. The Vatican issued a public denouncement of Lennon's comments.|$|E
500|$|Lennon's quote was {{featured}} in a 3 July article in The New York Times Magazine and provoked no reaction. In late July, when <b>Datebook</b> republished the interviews, editor Art Unger put Lennon's quote [...] "I don't know which will go first—rock 'n' roll or Christianity!" [...] on the cover. Also on the cover was a quote from Paul McCartney regarding America: [...] "It's a lousy country where anyone black is a dirty nigger!" [...] In Birmingham, Alabama, WAQY DJ Tommy Charles heard about Lennon's remarks from his coworker Doug Layton, and was immediately incensed, saying, [...] "That does it for me. I {{am not going to}} play the Beatles any more". Charles and Layton asked for listeners' views on Lennon's comment and the response was overwhelmingly negative. Charles later stated, [...] "We just felt it was so absurd and sacrilegious that something ought to be done to show them that they can't get away with this sort of thing". Al Benn, who was the bureau manager for United Press International News, heard the WAQY show and immediately filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major news story in The New York Times on 5 August. Over twenty other stations followed WAQY's lead with similar announcements. Some stations in the Deep South went further, organising demonstrations with bonfires, drawing hordes of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records and other memorabilia.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{tremendous}} {{success of the}} 1970s and 1980s, things changed quickly for Oldsmobile and by the early 1990s the brand had lost {{its place in the}} market, squeezed between other GM divisions, and with competition from new upscale import makes Acura, Infiniti and Lexus.

For 1995, Oldsmobile introduced the Aurora, which would be the inspiration for the design of its cars from the mid-1990s onward. The introduction of the Aurora marked as General Motors' catalyst to reposition Oldsmobile as an upscale import fighter. Accordingly, Oldsmobile received a new logo based on the familiar [...] "rocket" [...] theme. Nearly all the existing model names were gradually phased out: the Cutlass Calais in 1991, the Toronado and Custom Cruiser in 1992, the Ninety-Eight and Ciera (formerly Cutlass Ciera) in 1996, Cutlass Supreme in 1997, and finally the Eighty-Eight and Cutlass (which had only been around since '97) in 1999.

In support of the book, Fried embarked upon a train tour along the old Santa Fe route from Chicago to Los Angeles, visiting many of the classic mid- and southwestern cities where Harvey establishments thrived from the late 19th century well into the 20th. He was also interviewed by Melissa Block of NPR's All Things Considered, and the book won accolades from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal upon its release — the second of which complimented Fried's [...] "crisp prose and delightful detail" [...] and praised the book as [...] "sweeping social history populated with memorable characters."

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{project is}} an ethnographic history of "homes of capital," merchant homes located in port-cities of Gujarat {{in various states}} of splendor and decrepitude, which continue to mark a long history of Indian Ocean cross-cultural trade and exchange. Located in western South Asia, Gujarat is a terraqueous borderland, connecting the western and eastern arenas of the Indian Ocean {{at the same time as}} it connects territorial South Asia to maritime markets. Gujarat's dynamic port-cities, including Rander, Surat and Bombay, were and continue to be home to itinerant merchants, many with origins and investments around the littoral from Arabia to Southeast Asia. I argue that rather than a point of origin or return, Gujarat's merchants [...] many of whom are themselves itinerants from Arabia, Persia and Northwest India [...] produce and produced Gujarat as a place of arrival and departure: as a crucible of mobility. Gujarat's merchant homes offer a model of transregional engagement produced through the itineraries of merchants who continue to see the regions bordering the Indian Ocean as an extension of their homes. While historians have generally studied these merchants through the bureaucratic archival records of imperial trade-companies, my project examines the yet-unexplored archives that collect around historic merchant homes. Curated by a current generation of merchant families who continue to ply old routes at the same time as they forge new ones, merchant homes offer a way to study oceanic connections from the inside-out and capital in cultural terms. Drawing on a rich array of collective and personal ethnographic and historical materials within homes, including architectural form; material objects; private journals, <b>datebooks</b> and travelogues; visual media; and merchant memory, my project brings into view a mercantile space-time on ocean's edge. Though emerging from concrete ethnographic and historical materials that cast powerful light on Gujarati merchant mobility in the British Empire over the course of the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century, my account of "homes of capital" pursues mercantile imaginings across long tranches of time routed through the political economic transformations of the period stretching between the tenth and twelfth centuries. I argue that these non-linear imaginings structured by oceanic mobility exist in the interstices of imperial, colonial and post-colonial state space. 	 Placing merchant imaginings at the center of my analysis, my dissertation argues that the Indian Ocean was and continues to be a key spatial and temporal motivator of mercantile life. My project makes explicit the terms of this intimacy through a "chronotopic" study of merchant homes across Gujarat. Homes of capital in its broadest sense also include mercantile buildings like bridges, libraries, funerary sites, mosques and community centers, which, when linked together, created shaded pathways across the region in the face of an emergent colonial state centered on Bombay. In doing so I also reveal a more capacious mercantile subject, showing how new kinds of nineteenth-century circulations of Gujarati-language texts across merchant libraries, reading rooms and homes were embedded in and shaped a longue durée oceanic topography. My project documents the range of visual, material, textual and affective modes from within this topography through which merchants gave and give form to such a terraqueous region. Dissertatio...|$|R
