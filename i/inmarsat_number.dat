50|$|The 070 {{service is}} based on the {{principle}} of a flexible virtual telephone number. Depending on the telecommunications service provider, these numbers are able to be remotely commanded, by Web, SMS or IVR to route calls to most international destinations, including mobiles. They are similar to follow-me numbers, but are able to be controlled remotely and push calls to the desired destination. For example, the UK number +44 70 0585 0070 is routed to an <b>Inmarsat</b> <b>number,</b> so that a subscriber can be reached anywhere on Earth just as if they were still in the United Kingdom. For the telephone numbering plan context of 070 numbers see Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom.|$|E
