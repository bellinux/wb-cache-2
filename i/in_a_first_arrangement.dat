Secondly, {{the effects of the}} fluidization conditions, such as the particle size, superficial gas velocity and freeboard pressure on the membrane permeate flow rate have been measured. The membrane permeation rates from the fluidized bed could be well described by taking into account the local pressure drop over the membrane, where the local pressure inside the fluidized bed was evaluated as the hydrostatic head using the average bed porosity...|$|R

Uygur also noted that he talked with Al Jazeera after the company bought Current, reaching a mutual agreement not to continue with the television broadcast due to the change in ideological tone that Al Jazeera America would maintain. However, members of The Young Turks on-air contributing staff, such as Michael Shure (who served as a political and general assignment contributor), Cara Santa Maria (part of TechKnow) and Ben Mankiewicz (who worked as a movie critic), regularly appeared on Al Jazeera America. The Young Turks also maintain a partnership with Al Jazeera's digital channel AJ+, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>first</b> announced <b>in</b> March 2015.|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the effects of choosing among alternatives for five children <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of experiments. <b>In</b> the <b>first,</b> <b>a</b> concurrent-chains <b>arrangement</b> was used to assess all participant’s preferences for choice making. Initial link selections resulted in access to terminal links in which the completed task resulted (a) the choice of identical reinforcers (choice), (b) the delivery of an identical reinforcer (no-choice), or (c) no reinforcer delivered (control). One of the five participants showed an initial preference for choice, the others had either an inconsistent preference or were indifferent. Additional evaluations were conducted (Experiments 2 and 4) to demonstrate whether preference for choice could be established by either increasing variability of the stimuli, or by increasing the number of stimuli from which to choose. Choice-link selections increased for one participant when more items were available from which to choose and for another participant when the items from which to choose varied. Experiment 3 and 5 quantified the value of the opportunity to choose using progressively increasing schedule requirements during the choice terminal link for the three children who demonstrated a preference for choice. All three children continued to select the choice link even when the schedule requirements in the choice link were much higher than that in the no-choice link...|$|R
40|$|The {{sterilisation}} of {{the packaging}} material {{is the essential}} step in aseptic food processes to ensure safely packed products, which are microbiologically stable throughout their shelf life. Today, gaseous hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) {{in the range of}} several volume percent and at elevated temperature is the preferred sterilant due to its strong microbicidal efficiency and its decomposition in environment-friendly products, namely water vapour and oxygen. In order to obtain a high degree of sterility, the initial H 2 O 2 concentration has to be high enough and uniformly distributed over the package's inner surface. To ensure that the packaging surface is thoroughly treated by H 2 O 2, a gas sensor is required that detects the present H 2 O 2 concentration on selected locations of the package's surface while it is sterilised. The present thesis describes the realisation and characterisation of thin-film gas sensors based on an “on chip” differential set-up for monitoring the H 2 O 2 gas concentration during the sterilisation of the packaging material. The differential set-up contains a catalytically active sensor segment, where H 2 O 2 decomposes <b>in</b> <b>an</b> exothermic reaction causing a temperature increase towards a passive sensor segment, where a surface reaction is inhibited. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> sensor <b>arrangement,</b> thin-film thermopiles have been fabricated on a single silicon chip, respectively, and their response behaviour has been characterised in H 2 O 2 atmosphere. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> further arrangement, thin-film resistances have been built up as temperature-sensitive transducer platform on a silicon chip. On this platform, different catalytically active materials – platinum black, palladium and manganese oxide – have been tested with regard to their response against H 2 O 2, wherein all of them showed a linear response characteristic, but manganese oxide posseses the highest sensitivity. Furthermore, three temperature-stable polymeric materials – fluorinated ethylene propylene, perfluoralkoxy and epoxy-based SU- 8 photoresist – have been tested for the encapsulation of the sensor surface in terms of their chemical inertness against H 2 O 2. Therein, all of them have shown a high resistivity against H 2 O 2 underlining their suitability for sensor passivation. Within the frame of this work, the sensor set-up has further been realised on a thin polyimide foil because of its high temperature endurance, its chemical stability and particularly, its low thermal conductivity allowing an improved thermal separation of the active and passive sensor segment. As a result, the sensitivity of the polyimide-based sensor was strongly increased compared to the concentration-dependent response of the silicon-based sensors. Microbiological experiments with bacterial spores of Bacillus atrophaeus have demonstrated that the microbicidal effectiveness of the sterilisation process depends on the present H 2 O 2 concentration in first order {{as well as on the}} contact time between the item that has to be sterilised and the gaseous H 2 O 2. By means of sensor measurements conducted at the same time, a correlation model between the microbial inactivation kinetics and the sensor response was established that allows to use the sensor not only for concentration measurements, but also for the quantification and control of the degree of the package's sterility. In order to determine the present H 2 O 2 concentration spatially resolved over the package surface during the short sterilisation cycle, a wireless sensor electronic based on the industrial ZigBee standard was developed. The sensor electronic contains a remote unit, which is connected to one of the calorimetric gas sensors fixed on a test package, and an external base unit connected to a laptop computer. For real-time measurements, a novel sensor read-out strategy was established, wherein the sensor response is measured within the short sterilisation time and correlated with both the present H 2 O 2 concentration as well as the microbicidal effectiveness. As a result, this kind of “intelligent” package represents a novel instrumentation to monitor the package sterilisation in aseptic food processes under real-time conditions...|$|R
