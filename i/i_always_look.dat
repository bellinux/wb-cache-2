500|$|Known as {{an outspoken}} player, Hull earned a {{reputation}} {{on and off the}} ice for speaking bluntly and without regard for whom it might offend. [...] He chastised his own fans in 1992 – later backtracking – when they booed Adam Oates following Oates' trade request, calling them [...] "losers" [...] and stating he wanted to rip one particular fan's head off. Hull was a consistent critic of the NHL's defensive, [...] "clutch and grab" [...] era of the late 1990s, raising the ire of commissioner Gary Bettman in 1998 when he said [...] "I wouldn't pay to watch. It's boring. The whole style of the game is terrible. There's no flow. When a guy like [...] Lemieux leaves the game and tells you why he's leaving, and you don't address it, that's stupid. But the players don't say crap. That's why <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>look</b> like the big mouth." ...|$|E
500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer and the San Jose Mercury News both {{commented on}} the {{fundamental}} problem that Springsteen seemed to be facing on the tour. [...] The former said [...] "Bruce Springsteen may well have miscalculated {{earlier this year when}} he released Working on a Dream, one of the most hopeful and downright happy sounding albums of his career just as a cratering economy was rendering the songs of struggle and strife that are his stock in trade more resonant than they have sounded in years." [...] The latter said, [...] "As Don Rumsfeld might say, you don't go on tour with the album you wish you had, you go on tour with the album you've got. So Springsteen faces the tough task of hyping a new romantic pop record while simultaneously offering hope and support to a wounded nation – not an easy task." [...] Rolling Stone voiced a similar theory. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that [...] "If there was a disappointment, it was that Springsteen didn’t make a stronger case for his latest album, Working on a Dream. I’m not a fan of the album, but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>look</b> forward to how the singer reinvents his studio work on the stage. In this case, however, he barely touched the new material ..." [...] Views on one, the early-in-show, eight-minute [...] "Outlaw Pete" [...] – one of the few new material centerpieces – varied considerably.|$|E

5000|$|Slovan Bratislava coach Leopold Šťastný {{was famous}} for {{creating}} nicknames for his players, and so Popluhár became known in Slovak football circles as 'Bimbo'. [...] "I was called this because <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>looked,</b> and indeed was, good-natured, and I would never hurt anybody", recalls Popluhár.|$|R
2500|$|Nico Amarca of Highsnobiety {{magazine}} wrote [...] "over {{the course}} of her now 10-year career, [...] has undergone {{one of the most significant}} aesthetic metamorphoses the world has ever seen". Her image and fashion has changed several times with different hairstyles since the release of her third album. She commented that as a child she [...] "used to watch her [...] get dressed" [...] and that her love and admiration for fashion started with her mom. When putting together her own wardrobe she stated, [...] "It's become more about taking a risk ... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>look</b> for the most interesting silhouette or something that's a little off." [...] Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian wrote that [...] "Rihanna's wardrobe is the most talked-about, influential and dissected in pop right now" [...] and that whatever she wears [...] "is immediately reproduced on the high street, because it sells". Country singer Miranda Lambert admires Rihanna's fashion and style stating, [...] "I don't necessarily get inspired by the whole no-bra thing, but I love that you never know what she's going to wear. It always keeps you guessing, which makes her sassy and interesting." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'So it will,' said Sophy, mournfully, 'I am {{sure it is}} to me. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> {{forward to}} Gilbert's going to Talloon, and seeing the dear old bearer, and taking all my {{presents}} there, but you see, of course, mamma, he cannot bear to go--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I've been {{hungry and}} cold, but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> after my horse, and so, when I struck a cow country I could whirl in and earn some money. It don't {{take much to}} keep me when I'm on the trail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> to {{make the}} young gentleman pay up handsome, if so be the old gentleman went off the hooks. And if so be he and I should go off {{together}} like, why you'd carry on, of course. You'll have the proofs, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I always {{watch the}} people," [...] she said. [...] "Wherever I am, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>look</b> {{out of the}} window. I have always hoped--that I might see Augustus again that way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "To be sure. But it's such {{a comfort}} being {{where you can}} see the Advertiser the same morning. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>look</b> at the Weather Report the first thing. I like to know what the weather is going to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How could I? Oh, I {{might have}} loved you, if I'd been fortunate--if I'd {{deserved}} it. But I never thought, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> up to you--you {{are so far}} above me!" [...] She lifted her face to him in agony. [...] "I'm sorry--I'm sorry for you--I'll never forgive myself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it isn't like Heneage. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> {{upon him}} as a man without nerves, a man who would carry through any purpose he set himself to, without going to pieces about it. Shows how {{difficult}} it is to understand the most obvious of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You perplex me, Arnold," [...] {{she said}} thoughtfully. [...] "I do not {{understand}} your position in the matter. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> upon you as a somewhat indolent person. Yet I find you now taking any amount of trouble in a matter which really does not concern you at all. Whence all this good-nature?" ...|$|R

60|$|There is no animal more graceful in its movements, handsomer {{in shape}} and color, or more bloody and ferocious in its nature, than the Royal Bengal tiger.

6000|$|... "What a good {{light that}} gives! I {{can see it}} as I go home every night, and it burns up here like a beacon. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>look</b> for it, and it hardly ever fails to be burning. Sort of cheers up the way, you know, when I'm tired or low in my mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, upon my word, I envy you, Arthur; I do, indeed," [...] said Bertram, looking round his cousin's room at Balliol as {{they sat}} down to pass an evening quietly together. [...] "This was what <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> forward to, as you did also; you have {{obtained}} it, I have forsworn it." ...|$|R
60|$|But I cannot but say, that <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> {{upon this}} {{particular}} respect {{to be the}} effect of more than ordinary regard the great king of Sweden always showed me, rather than any merit of my own; and the veneration they all had for his memory, made them continue to show me all the marks of a suitable esteem.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{walked down}} to the depot {{to keep an eye on}} the outfit and see that they didn't locate any land or scare the cow ponies hitched in front of Murchison's store or act {{otherwise}} unseemly. Luke was away after a gang of cattle thieves down on the Frio, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> after the law and order when he wasn't there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, aye, sir; {{that may}} be true, as a rule, but I never knew a craft found after a third look for her. Everything seems to go by thirds in this world, sir; and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>look</b> upon a third chase as final. Now, sir, there are three classes of admirals, and three sets of flags; a ship has three masts; the biggest ships are three-deckers; then there are three planets----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the sight}} of that star which brings a story into my mind," [...] said he. [...] "I do not know its name.

Yet {{at this time of the}} year <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>look</b> out for it, and I never fail to see it burning in the same place. But it seems to me that it is redder and larger than it was.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>look</b> {{back to that}} {{lunch with}} a sort of aching regret. It was the lunch of a lifetime, and I wasn't in a fit state to {{appreciate}} it. Subconsciously, if you know what I mean, I could see it was pretty special, but I had got the wind up to such a frightful extent over the ghastly situation in which young Bingo had landed me that its deeper meaning never really penetrated. Most of the time I might have been eating sawdust for all the good it did me.|$|E

60|$|I do {{not know}} how other men feel towards those they have met abroad, but to me there seems a kind of tie {{established}} between all who have met together in a foreign country, as if we had met in a state of pre-existence, and were talking over a life that has ceased: but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>look</b> forward to renewing my travels; and though you, I think, are now stationary, if I can at all forward your pursuits there as well as here, I shall be truly glad in the opportunity.|$|E
60|$|That {{submerged}} {{and isolated}} curriculum {{did not even}} join on to living interests where it might have done so. We were left absolutely to the hints of the newspapers, to casual political speeches, to the cartoons of the comic papers or a chance reading of some Socialist pamphlet for any general ideas whatever about the huge swirling world process in which we found ourselves. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>look</b> back with particular exasperation to the cessation of our modern history at the year 1815.

6000|$|... "I wish," [...] said Henrietta, {{very well}} pleased with her companion, [...] "I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were {{intimate}} with Dr Shirley.

6000|$|... "Well, well, {{back on the}} frontier," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, in his hearty way. [...] "Glad to {{see you at the}} fort again.
