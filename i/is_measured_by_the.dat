5|$|Beer is {{measured}} and assessed by bitterness, by strength and by colour. The perceived bitterness <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> International Bitterness Units scale (IBU), defined in co-operation between the American Society of Brewing Chemists and the European Brewery Convention. The international scale was a {{development of the}} European Bitterness Units scale, often abbreviated as EBU, and the bitterness values should be identical.|$|E
5|$|A country's {{external}} wealth <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{value of}} its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E
5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on {{the direction of the}} appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E

5|$|Radial {{velocity}} <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{doppler shift}} of the star's spectral lines, and is given in units of km/s. The proper motion of a star, its parallax, is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-arc seconds (mas) per year. With knowledge of the star's parallax and its distance, the proper motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. Stars with high rates of proper motion {{are likely to be}} relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.|$|E
5|$|The LIRGs that host {{hydroxyl}} megamasers may {{be distinguished}} {{from the general population}} of LIRGs by their molecular gas content. The majority of molecular gas is molecular hydrogen, and typical hydroxyl megamaser hosts have molecular gas densities greater than 1000cm−3. These densities are among the highest mean densities of molecular gas among LIRGs. The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers also have high fractions of dense gas relative to typical LIRGs. The dense gas fraction <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ratio of the luminosity produced by hydrogen cyanide (HCN) relative to the luminosity of carbon monoxide (CO).|$|E

25|$|The {{absolute}} {{value for the}} exposure time required depends on how sensitive to light the medium being used <b>is</b> (<b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> film speed, or, for digital media, by the quantum efficiency). Early photography used media that had very low light sensitivity, and so exposure times had to be long even for very bright shots. As technology has improved, so has the sensitivity through film cameras and digital cameras.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} {{unemployment}} {{in an economy}} <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> unemployment rate, the percentage of workers without jobs in the labour force. The labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs. People who are retired, pursuing education, or discouraged from seeking work {{by a lack of}} job prospects are excluded from the labour force. Unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes.|$|E

Not all systems have an online ruby fluorescence system for in situ measuring. However, being able to monitor the pressure within the chamber while the DAC is being sealed is advantageous – ensuring the desired pressure is reached (or not over-shot). Pressure <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shift in the laser induced luminescence of rubies {{in the sample}} chamber.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} the index is to {{demonstrate}} the loss of human development due to inequalities between men and women. The three categories are measured with the following metrics. Reproductive health <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> maternal mortality rate and the adolescent fertility rate. Empowerment is indicated by the share of parliamentary seats held by each sex and secondary and higher education levels of each sex. Finally, the labor market aspect of the GII is measured by women's participation rate in the workforce. Mathematically, it is the approximated loss of human development to women due to inequality.|$|E
25|$|From pentane to octane the alkanes {{are highly}} {{volatile}} liquids. They {{are used as}} fuels in internal combustion engines, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes knocking, than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> octane rating of the fuel, where 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) has an arbitrary value of 100, and heptane has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{efficiency}} {{of a system}} or device that converts energy <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ratio {{of the amount of}} useful energy put out by the system ("output energy") to the total amount of energy that is put in ("input energy") or by useful output energy {{as a percentage of the}} total input energy. In the case of fuel cells, useful output energy is measured in electrical energy produced by the system. Input energy is the energy stored in the fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel cells are generally between 40–60% energy efficient. This is higher than some other systems for energy generation. For example, the typical internal combustion engine of a car is about 25% energy efficient. In combined heat and power (CHP) systems, the heat produced by the fuel cell is captured and put to use, increasing the efficiency of the system to up to 85–90%.|$|E

25|$|Water is a polar molecule, {{where the}} centers of {{positive}} and negative charge are separated; so molecules will align with an electric field. The extensive hydrogen bonded network in water tends to oppose this alignment, and the degree of alignment <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> relative permittivity. Water has a high relative permittivity of about 80 at room temperature; because polarity shifts are rapidly transmitted through shifts in orientation of the linked hydrogen bonds. This allows water to dissolve salts, as the attractive electric field between ions is reduced by about 80–fold. Thermal motion of the molecules disrupts the hydrogen bonding network as temperature increases; so relative permittivity decreases with temperature to about 7 at the critical temperature. At 205°C the relative permittivity falls to 33, the same as methanol at room temperature. Thus water behaves like a water / methanol mixture between 100°C and 200°C. Disruption of extended hydrogen bonding allows molecules to move more freely (viscosity, diffusion and surface tension effects), and extra energy must be supplied to break the bonds (increased heat capacity).|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{resolution}} of an fMRI study refers {{to how well}} it discriminates between nearby locations. It <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> size of voxels, as in MRI. A voxel is a three-dimensional rectangular cuboid, whose dimensions are set by the slice thickness, the area of a slice, and the grid imposed on the slice by the scanning process. Full-brain studies use larger voxels, while those that focus on {{specific regions of interest}} typically use smaller sizes. Sizes range from 4 to 5mm to 1mm. Smaller voxels contain fewer neurons on average, incorporate less blood flow, and hence have less signal than larger voxels. Smaller voxels imply longer scanning times, since scanning time directly rises with the number of voxels per slice and the number of slices. This can lead both to discomfort for the subject inside the scanner and to loss of the magnetization signal. A voxel typically contains a few million neurons and tens of billions of synapses, with the actual number depending on voxel size and the area of the brain being imaged.|$|E
25|$|Fusion {{splicing}} is {{done with}} a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|E
