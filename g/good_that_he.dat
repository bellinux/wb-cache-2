5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so <b>good</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E

Compiled in Iceland in the 13th century, but based on much older Old Norse poetry, the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda contain numerous references {{to the death of}} Baldr as both a great tragedy to the Æsir and a harbinger of Ragnarök. Although he was loved by all gods and more physical beings, he was so handsome, generous, and <b>good</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> gave off light simply by the purity of his character.|$|E

25|$|In 1959, Schell {{acted in}} the role of a defense {{attorney}} on a live TV production of Judgment at Nuremberg, a fictionalized re-creation of the Nuremberg War Trials, in an edition of Playhouse 90. His performance in the TV drama was considered so <b>good</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and Werner Klemperer were the only members of the original cast selected to play the same parts in the 1961 film version. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor, which was the first win for a German-speaking actor since World War II.|$|E
25|$|In 1935 Geary {{was in such}} deadly form on fiery or sticky pitches {{early in}} the season that, despite {{injuries}} hampering him later, he was second in the averages to Hedley Verity and took 11 for 40 in one match against Sussex. In his second benefit match the following year, Geary produced his best bowling since 1929 on a broken pitch with an amazing 7 for 7 and 13 for 43 in the match. His last two seasons in 1937 and 1938 saw him decline with the ball on improved Leicester pitches, but his batting in 1938 was so <b>good</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> averaged over 30 - far above any previous season - and hit three centuries.|$|E
25|$|Bader's {{aggressive}} energy found a {{new lease}} of life at St Edward's School, where he received his secondary education. During his time there, he thrived at sports. Bader played rugby and often enjoyed physical battles with bigger and older opponents. The then Warden (or Headmaster), Henry E. Kendall, tolerated Bader's aggressive and competitive nature. At one point, he made him a prefect despite what others saw as a strong streak of conceit in the boy. Fellow RAF night fighter and bomber pilots Guy Gibson and Adrian Warburton also attended the school. In later life, Bader was deemed to be so <b>good</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was invited to play a trial (or friendly game) with the Harlequins, {{but it is not}} clear whether he actually played.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the next}} two years, Voce and Larwood practised this {{modified}} form of leg theory for Nottinghamshire, causing severe problems for opposing batsmen. Although Voce was somewhat slower than Larwood, his line, from left-arm over the wicket, and the steeper bounce that he obtained from his height, made him formidable enough and the batsmen got no relief when facing him. Voce took 123 wickets for 19.29 each in 1931, and with 136 for 16.87 each in 1932, he was chosen {{as one of the}} Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1933. His bowling was so <b>good</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> regained his Test place and, with Larwood, was named for the 1932–1933 English tour of Australia, to be captained by Jardine. The bowlers implemented Jardine's tactic, bowling fast and short at the Australian batsmen, with Voce inflicting several bruising injuries. The Australian media dubbed the tactic 'Bodyline'. This resulted in severe ill-feeling between the cricket teams, and the countries.|$|E

Fuller, however, [...] "stole the show". He stated that only a new trade, or [...] "a new engine tending to the furtherance of a trade that never was used before; and that {{for the good of the}} realm, the King may grant him a monopoly patent for some reasonable time until the subjects may learn the same, in consideration of the <b>good</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> doth bring by his invention, otherwise not".

Visibility was poor by now, and rain periodically fell. The laager received no word from Wilson until about 21:00, when Sergeant-Major Judge and Corporal Ebbage arrived from across the river to tell Forbes that Wilson had found Lobengula's tracks, and followed him for [...] Wilson regarded the chances of taking the king alive as so <b>good</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was going to remain {{north of the}} river overnight.

500|$|The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler {{said the}} episode was [...] "just {{about as good}} as it gets", with several great moments {{revolving}} around Nick Offerman's deadpan comedic delivery. Heisler also said making the police department part of the script was a good way to better flesh out Pawnee and its townspeople. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell praised the performances of Offerman and Aubrey Plaza, and referred to Tammy as Pawnee's equivalent of Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons Springfield. Kandell also liked that the episode [...] "had heart" [...] because the Tammy subplot was resolved by Ron standing up for Tom. TV Squad writer Joel Keller said the episode did not reach the level of the original [...] "Ron and Tammy", but that [...] "it still had more than enough funny, cringeworthy and downright gross moments to be very satisfying". He declared Mullally [...] "one of the best sitcom creations this side of Colonel Flagg on M*A*S*H".

500|$|Mars co-wrote [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine of The Smeezingtons. The three co-produced {{the song}} with Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, and Emile Haynie.

Levine {{aforementioned}} that some parts in the song are not instruments as Mars said they needed [...] "a dep-dep-dep-dep sound". Later, Levine told Mars to [...] "sing it into the microphone", where he chopped it up, and despite sounding like an instrument, the sounds are really Mars' voice. The song's composition relies mainly on a [...] "guitar-worthy groove guitar, a soaring sing-along chorus and sexual innuendo galore". It finds Mars singing a confession of a relationship that is so <b>good</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> repeats to his love [...] "Your sex takes me to paradise", a verse inspired by Halle Berry [...] "You make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven for too long/ Can I just stay here, {{spend the rest of my}} days here?" [...] he sings. During his Google Hangout on the day of the song's release, Mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from the track. Mars picked the phrase [...] "But swimming in your water is something spiritual," [...] and said that the single's exploration of feeling and being in love fits into the [...] "sensual, sensual and sensual" [...] theme of the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike. Gaming's Edge described Raynor as an [...] "almost prototypical action movie figure" [...] with a [...] "healthy dose of arrogance" [...] who despite always {{attempting to do}} the morally right thing invariably ends up with [...] "the worst end of the deal" [...] due to circumstances beyond his control.
