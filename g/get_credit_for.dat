25|$|Because offsets {{provide a}} revenue stream for the {{reduction}} of some types of emissions, they can in some cases provide incentives to emit more, so that emitting entities can later <b>get</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> reducing emissions from an artificially high baseline. This is especially the case for offsets with a high profit margin. For example, one Chinese company generated $500 million in carbon offsets by installing a $5million incinerator to burn the HFCs produced by the manufacture of refrigerants. The huge profits provided incentive to create new factories or expand existing factories solely {{for the purpose of}} increasing production of HFCs and then destroying the resultant pollutants to generate offsets. Not only is this outcome environmentally undesirable, it undermines other offset projects by causing offset prices to collapse. The practice had become so common that offset credits are now no longer awarded for new plants to destroy HFC-23.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the PGA Tour Policy Board {{approved}} {{a change in}} the number of players that will make the cut. The cut will continue to be low 70 professionals and ties, unless that results in a post-cut field of more than 78 players. Under that circumstance, the cut score will be selected to make a field as close to 70 players as possible without exceeding 78. Players who are cut in such circumstances but who have placed 70th or worse will <b>get</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> making the cut and will earn official money and FedEx Cup points. This policy affected two of the first three events with cuts, the Sony Open in Hawaii and the Buick Invitational. In late February, the Policy Board announced a revised cut policy, effective beginning with the Honda Classic. The new policy calls for 36-hole cut to the low 70 professionals and ties and, if that cut results in more than 78 players, a second 54-hole cut to the low 70 professionals and ties. Those who do not survive the 54-hole cut are designated as MDF (made the cut, did not finish).|$|E

5000|$|Hora ot naroda (Хора от народа) is {{the fifth}} and final album by Bulgarian rock band Hipodil. Released on 4 December 2000, the album had guest vocalists because Svetoslav Vitkov moved to the US as a gastarbeiter, so they {{recruited}} vocalists for some tracks from other Bulgarian rock bands (most notably Petur Stanoev - Pesho and Nikolai Yordanov - Kolio Gillan from Kontrol). Svetlio himself had already recorded lead vocal tracks for the tracks [...] "Drugo nyama" [...] and [...] "Partizani", and appears as a backing vocalist in [...] "Choveche".

500|$|Along with Beastie Boys, 3rd Bass, and House of Pain, Ice {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} white rappers to attain major success. Chuck D has credited Ice as a regional breakthrough, stating [...] "He broke through in the mid-South, in a Southern area in Texas, in something that was kind of indigenous to that hip-hop culture down there. He just doesn’t <b>get</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> it." [...] In 1991, 3rd Bass released a single called [...] "Pop Goes the Weasel", and in the lyrics comparing Ice unfavorably to Elvis Presley. The song's music video featured Henry Rollins as Ice, who is depicted as being assaulted by 3rd Bass. Ice responded to [...] "Pop Goes the Weasel" [...] with his 1992 song [...] "The Wrath". Del tha Funkee Homosapien referred to Ice in the lyrics of [...] "Pissin' on Your Steps", which appeared on his 1991 debut album I Wish My Brother George Was Here. Similar to 'Pop Goes the Weasel', the song negatively makes a connection between Ice and Elvis, while saying Ice alongside MC Hammer are mocking hip hop by being commercial. Vanilla Ice answered back to most of his critics in the song [...] "Hit 'em Hard".|$|E
500|$|The 17th was {{deployed}} for the Battle of the Somme in July. It {{was engaged}} {{on the first}} day of the Somme, 1 July, where it supported the capture of Fricourt and lost 1,155 men killed or wounded. Following this, it was involved in the capture of Contalmaison and the capture of Mametz, and had taken a total of 4,771 casualties by the time it was relieved on 11 July. Many of these casualties stemmed from an unsuccessful attack on the [...] "Quadrangle Trench Support" [...] on 7 July; the division had captured the main trench system on 5 July and Pilcher ordered it to pause and prepare for a subsequent assault. However, he was over-ruled by higher command, who forced an attack the next night – which failed – followed by a daylight attack on 7 July, which Pilcher strongly protested but eventually acquiesced in. He ordered an attack with the minimal number of men necessary, assuming it would inevitably be doomed to failure and high casualties, which outraged his superiors. Pilcher later wrote that [...] "It is very easy to sit a few miles in the rear and <b>get</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> allowing men to be killed in an undertaking foredoomed to failure, but the part did not appeal to me and my protests against these useless attacks were not well received." ...|$|E

2500|$|Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) {{are also}} {{sometimes}} treated as carbon offsets, although the concepts are distinct. Whereas a carbon offset represents {{a reduction in}} greenhouse gas emissions, a REC represents a quantity of energy produced from renewable sources. To convert RECs into offsets, the clean energy must be translated into carbon reductions, typically by assuming that the clean energy is displacing an equivalent amount of conventionally produced electricity from the local grid. This is known as an indirect offset (because the reduction doesn't {{take place at the}} project site itself, but rather at an external site), and some controversy surrounds the question of whether they truly lead to [...] "additional" [...] emission reductions and who should <b>get</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> any reductions that may occur.

2500|$|This {{judicial}} ruling meant that Lee de Forest was now legally {{recognized in the}} United States as the inventor of regeneration. However, much of the engineering community continued to consider Armstrong to be the actual developer, with de Forest viewed as someone who skillfully used the patent system to <b>get</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> an invention {{to which he had}} barely contributed. Following the 1934 Supreme Court decision, Armstrong attempted to return his Institute of Radio Engineers (present-day Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Medal of Honor, which had been awarded to him in 1917 [...] "in recognition of his work and publications dealing with the action of the oscillating and non-oscillating audion", but the organization's board refused to let him, stating that it [...] "strongly affirms the original award". The practical effect of de Forest's victory was that his company was free to sell products that used regeneration, for during the controversy, which became more a personal feud than a business dispute, Armstrong tried to block the company from even being licensed to sell equipment under his patent.|$|E
