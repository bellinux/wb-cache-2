60|$|It may be well to mention, parenthetically, that in {{defending}} his alleged law of progression {{from the general}} to the special, M. Comte somewhere comments upon the two meanings of the word general, and the resulting liability to confusion. Without now discussing whether the asserted distinction can be maintained in other cases, it is manifest {{that it does not}} exist here. In sundry of the instances above quoted, the endeavours made by M. Comte himself to disguise, or to explain away, the precedence of the special over the general, clearly indicate that the generality spoken of is of the kind meant by his formula. And it needs but a brief consideration of the matter to show that, even did he attempt it, he could not distinguish this generality, which, as above proved, frequently comes last, from the generality which he says always comes first. For {{what is the nature of}} that mental process by which objects, dimensions, weights, times, and the rest, are found capable of having their relations expressed numerically? It is the formation of certain abstract conceptions of unity, duality and multiplicity, which are applicable to all things alike. It is the invention of <b>general</b> <b>symbols</b> serving to express the numerical relations of entities, whatever be their special characters. And what is the nature of the mental process by which numbers are found capable of having their relations expressed algebraically? It is just the same. It is the formation of certain abstract conceptions of numerical functions which are the same whatever be the magnitudes of the numbers. It is the invention of <b>general</b> <b>symbols</b> serving to express the relations between numbers, as numbers express the relations between things. And transcendental analysis stands to algebra in the same position that algebra stands in to arithmetic.|$|E

The system uses the structural pattern recognition technique for modeling symbols {{by a set of}} straight lines referred to as segments.

When the system had some stored models for each symbol (an average of 97 models/symbol), the rejection rate was 16. 1 % and the recognition rate was 83. 9 % of which 95 % was recognized correctly.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} possible inspiration and exchange of art tendencies among symbolist artists and early Czech avant-garde group The Eight. Symbolism was a literary and artistic style, most manifesting {{at the end}} of the 19 th century, both in the European and in the Czech environment. Artists starting to form their art at the beginning of the 20 th century had not verbally reflect the symbolism, but there are some ties. Work aims to follow these links. On the basis of the division of the different levels between symbolisms, the works of the Eight were compared in the context of European or Czech symbolism, or in the context of works, in which we can find signs of <b>general</b> <b>symbols.</b> Several parallels were find out, most of them concerned an indirect line of inspiration among artists. Most often, young artists were inspired by themes of European symbolism, but there also exist examples of works based on a specific domestic environment. There are also works in which the symbols traditionally used in art appear. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|This {{lead alloy}} badge from the British Museum {{represents}} a medieval hood repurposed as a sack for a harvest of cherries. It measures 38 by 30 millimetres and was cast integrally with its pin and clasp in a three-part mould. When first made, {{it would have}} shone like silver. Badges were purchased in their millions by pilgrims between the late twelfth and early sixteenth centuries, as attractive, wearable and cheap souvenirs of their visits to holy sites. By the later Middle Ages badges were also worn as <b>general</b> <b>symbols</b> of devotion, as livery insignia, and as humorous or amorous tokens; which of these categories the “hood of cherries” badge falls into is debatable.
