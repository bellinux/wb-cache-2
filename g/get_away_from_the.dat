5|$|The story's {{main part}} {{takes place in}} {{what seems to be}} a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term {{previous}} to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> explosion before collapsing.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{near the}} mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her step-father, whom she had longed to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from.</b> <b>The</b> step-father wanted to trade her since she would have been sold for a great sum of money, but as they were {{crossing}} the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in, and they were drenched. The step-father, enraged, tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river. Before being drowned in the river, she was transformed into a dolphin, and swam away from her abusive step-father, who also fell in and was transformed into a porpoise.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Moo, You Bloody Choir saw Richards {{expected}} by record label Sony BMG {{to produce a}} quality follow-up. He denied being under significant pressure, though {{the persistence of the}} label—"Richo, have you got a single? Do you have singles? Please, do you have singles?"—was noted. Much of the writing for Augie March's fourth album took place while touring the United States, which Richards argued minimised the band's opportunities to be creative. In 2008, Augie March began recording Watch Me Disappear at Neil Finn's Auckland studios; they also recorded in Melbourne, Sydney, and Los Angeles. The band worked primarily in New Zealand to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> distraction of Melbourne, their hometown, thus allowing them to focus solely on recording.|$|E

5|$|Working prolifically in cinema, in 1979 Lansbury {{appeared}} as Miss Froy in The Lady Vanishes, {{a remake of}} Alfred Hitchcock's famous 1938 film. The following year she appeared in The Mirror Crack'd, another film based on an Agatha Christie novel, this time as Miss Marple, a sleuth in 1950s Kent. Lansbury hoped to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> depiction of the role made famous by Margaret Rutherford, instead returning to Christie's description of the character; in this she created a precursor to her later role of Jessica Fletcher. She was signed to appear in two sequels as Miss Marple, but these were never made. Lansbury's next film was the animated The Last Unicorn (1982), for which she provided {{the voice of the}} witch Mommy Fortuna.|$|E
5|$|By 1985, Bobby and Pam {{realize that}} they want to be together. Bobby proposes, Pam accepts and they spend the night together. The next day, Bobby is tragically cut down by a car driven by her half-sister, Katherine Wentworth, and dies hours later, leaving Pam heartbroken. Pam goes on to make {{television}} history by dreaming Bobby's death. Pam awakes and finds Bobby in the shower, alive and well. Pam receives good news {{at the end of the}} 1986–1987 season finale: she is finally able to conceive a baby, after confirming that there would be no health risks involved. However, she never gets that chance. While calling her husband to tell him the good news, she is in a massive auto accident where she hits an oil tanker and is severely burned in a subsequent fire. While recovering from her burns, she decides to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ewings and everyone else, including her son, disappear and divorce Bobby for a second time.|$|E
5|$|As {{development}} continued, id Software hired {{their former}} Softdisk liaison Kevin Cloud {{as an assistant}} artist, and moved the company out to Mesquite, Texas, near where Apogee was located. Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their royalty rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, ScubaVenture, so that id could focus on Wolfenstein. The game {{was intended to be}} released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode. Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day, using {{a modified version of the}} Commander Keen 2D map editor, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs. Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> noise.|$|E

5|$|Tara and Madison Rayne {{had their}} first match against each other since the break–up of their {{partnership}} on the May 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, where Tara teamed with Mickie James and Ms. Tessmacher against Rayne, Sarita and Rosita. Tara won the match for her team by pinning Rosita, after Rayne, who avoided her former partner throughout the match, sacrificed her in order to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ring. Tara and Rayne faced each other again on the July 14 episode of Impact Wrestling, where Tara was victorious after distracting Rayne with her tarantula. On the July 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, Tara and Ms. Tessmacher, later named TnT, defeated Mexican America (Rosita and Sarita) to win the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship. Tessmacher and Tara made their first title defense on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, defeating Mexican America in a rematch. On the September 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, Tara was defeated by her former partner Madison Rayne in a match to determine {{the third and final}} challenger for the TNA Knockouts Championship at Bound for Glory. On the November 3 episode of Impact Wrestling, Tara and Tessmacher lost the Knockouts Tag Team Championship to Gail Kim and Madison Rayne. On the January 26, 2012 episode of Impact Wrestling, Tara defeated Mickie James and Velvet Sky in a three-way match to earn a match for the Knockouts Championship. On February 12 at Against All Odds, Tara was unsuccessful in her title challenge against Gail Kim.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{good reviews}} of their sophomore effort, lack of {{commercial}} success {{led to the}} band splitting up, with Estrada leaving to join Captain Beefheart's Magic Band, although he has given other reasons for quitting the band, such as to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles pollution and the L.A. city life.|$|E
25|$|Unhappy with Muller, the French {{government}} appointed Lecourbe the new {{commander of}} the Army of the Rhine on 25 September 1799. Since Lecourbe was fighting Suvorov at the time, Massena did not release him until early October. Muller desired to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> army, so the temporary command was offered to the senior general Colaud, who refused it. Finally, Ney reluctantly accepted the acting command.|$|E

25|$|The Crossing of the Rhine in 405/6 brought unmanageable {{numbers of}} German and Alan barbarians (perhaps some 30,000 warriors, 100,000 people) into Gaul. They {{may have been}} trying to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Huns, who about this time {{advanced}} to occupy the Great Hungarian Plain. For the next few years the barbarian tribes who had crossed the Rhine wandered in search of food and employment, while Roman forces fought each other in the name of Honorius and a number of competing claimants to the imperial throne.|$|E
25|$|We {{have too}} many Jews in the towns. They are needed on the Polish border because in these areas Hebrews alone perform trade. As soon as you <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> frontier, the Jews become a disadvantage, they form cliques, they deal in {{contraband}} and get up to all manner of rascally tricks which are detrimental to Christian burghers and merchants. I have never persecuted anyone from {{this or any other}} sect; I think, however, it would be prudent to pay attention, so that their numbers do not increase.|$|E
25|$|Osgood and {{her husband}} {{reconciled}} in 1846, and moved to Philadelphia {{for a short time}} to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scandal. Although she was ill, she continued to write. She was confined to her room because of her illness by 1847, when her daughters were eleven and eight years old; much of her poetry from this period reflects her concern for them. Her husband, having difficulty making money as a painter, left her again in 1849 to join the California Gold Rush. He returned shortly before her death.|$|E

25|$|Author Edgar Allan Poe {{spent the}} last years of his life (1846 to 1849) in the Bronx at Poe Cottage, now located at Kingsbridge Road and the Grand Concourse. A small wooden {{farmhouse}} built around 1812, the cottage once commanded unobstructed vistas over the rolling Bronx hills to the shores of Long Island. Poe moved there to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan city air and crowding in hope that the then rural area would be beneficial for his wife's tuberculosis. It was in the Bronx that Poe wrote one of his most famous works, Annabel Lee.|$|E
25|$|Immigration and {{industrialization}} {{caused a}} major increase in New York City's {{population in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the summertime, many of these newer residents began looking for places to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hot city and the densely populated tenements they lived in. The city's own parks and beaches were often overcrowded. Automobiles became more affordable, and by 1917 there were more cars than horses in the city. Drivers began taking to low-quality roads in search of parks outside the city, but were often disappointed after long drives to find {{that most of those}} parks were closed to nonresidents.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{settlement}} in the Livingston Manor area began in 1882 when what was then known as the New York and Oswego Midland Railroad built a depot there. Local farmers could ship their produce to New York City. Some German Jews who had emigrated to the United States {{found their way to}} the Catskills and developed dairy farms. The railroad provided access to the region for city residents who wanted to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> summer heat, leading some farmers and residents to get into the resort and summer camp business. Many resort facilities discriminated against Jews, refusing them as guests.|$|E

25|$|Magneto {{appears in}} X-Men Legends voiced by Tony Jay. Like the other {{characters}} in the game, he appears in his Ultimate costume, though his personality and his relationship with Xavier is more similar to his 616 incarnation. Mystique frees him from the U.S.S. Arbiter and he escapes to Asteroid M where he gives a televised transmission for any mutant who wants to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Genetic Research and Security Organization (GRSO) {{to head to the}} Mount. When confronted by the X-Men, he fights them alongside Mystique and Sabretooth. After the defeat, Magneto and his Brotherhood get away.|$|E
25|$|The first series, Ben, a dentist, and Susan, {{the worst}} cook in the world, are {{certainly}} loving, caring parents; {{they just have}} a problem showing it. Ben seems to be confused {{as to how much}} time and money his kids demand from him. Susan has to juggle motherhood, a career, and a husband and hasn't enough time to manage everything, including improving her cooking skills. Nick is always working on his next hair-brained scheme to keep him amused. Janey, like any normal teenage daughter, feels that her parents are seriously embarrassing whilst Michael keeps his head in his books to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> noise.|$|E
25|$|In the 1984 presidential {{election}} the Democrats had nominated Walter Mondale, a traditional New Deal-type liberal as their candidate. When Mondale {{was defeated in}} a landslide, party leaders became eager {{to find a new}} approach to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1980 and 1984 debacles. After Bush's image was affected by his involvement on the Iran-Contra scandal much more than Reagan's, and after the Democrats won back control of the U.S. Senate in the 1986 congressional elections following an economic downturn, the party's leaders felt more optimistic about having a closer race with the GOP in 1988, although probabilities from winning the presidency were still marginal with the contemporary climate of prosperity.|$|E
