5|$|In <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> {{the late}} 1880s were {{a period of}} growth in the Orange Free State. Agriculture picked up, and the railway system became an {{important}} source of income as well. Reitz was instrumental in the modernisation of farming, propagating new techniques and a scientific approach to the prevention of plagues. Here Reitz showed himself the agriculturalist and model farmer his father had been before him.|$|E
5|$|The {{winter of}} 1946–1947 was a harsh European winter {{noted for its}} effects in the United Kingdom. It caused severe hardships in <b>economic</b> <b>terms</b> and living conditions. There were massive {{disruptions}} of energy supply for homes, offices and factories. Animal herds froze or starved to death. People suffered from the persistent cold, and many businesses shut down temporarily. When warm weather returned, the ice thawed and flooding was severe in most low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maritime}} fur trade on native Hawaiians {{was similar to that}} of the North West Coast natives, but more powerfully transformative. The Hawaiians were generally receptive to Western incursion and settlement. The rise of King KamehamehaI and the unification of the islands under his rule were made possible in part by the effects of the maritime fur trade and its larger Pacific scope. The influx of wealth and technology helped make the new Kingdom of Hawaii relatively strong, in political and <b>economic</b> <b>terms.</b> Many non-native foodstuffs were introduced to the Hawaiian Islands during the early trading era, including plants such as beans, cabbage, onions, squash, pumpkins, melons, and oranges, as well as cash crops like tobacco, cotton, and sugar. Animals introduced included cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. Due to its high fertility Oahu became the most important of the islands. By the 1820s the population of Honolulu was over 10,000. The native Hawaiian population suffered waves of epidemic disease, including cholera. The availability of alcohol, especially grog and gin, led to widespread boozing and an increased use of traditional kava intoxication. These health issues, plus warfare related to the unification of the islands, droughts, and sandalwooding taking precedence over farming all contributed to an increase in famines and a general population decline. By 1850 the native population had dropped by perhaps 50%.|$|E

5000|$|Absentee {{landlord}} is an <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> for {{a person}} who owns and rents out a profit-earning property, but does not live within the property's local <b>economic</b> region. The <b>term</b> [...] "absentee ownership" [...] was popularised by economist Thorstein Veblen's 1923 book of the same name, Absentee ownership.|$|R
50|$|Hedonic damages, an <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> of art, {{refers to}} loss of {{enjoyment}} of life damages, the intangible value of life, {{as distinct from}} the human capital value or lost earnings value.|$|R
25|$|In <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> {{the postwar}} years 1945-70 brought {{high levels of}} {{prosperity}} as the automobile industry had its most prosperous quarter-century.|$|E
25|$|Brecht's {{interest}} in historical materialism {{is evident in}} the play's definition of contemporary morality and altruism in social and <b>economic</b> <b>terms.</b> Shen Te's altruism conflicts with Shui Ta's capitalist ethos of exploitation. The play implies that economic systems determine a society's morality.|$|E
25|$|In <b>economic</b> <b>terms</b> as well, the {{government}} was faced with mounting instability. The government formulated a five-year economic development plan, although it was unable to act on it prior to being overthrown. The Second Republic saw the hwan lose half of its value against the dollar between fall 1960 and spring 1961.|$|E
5000|$|Pink Money, {{the pink}} pound or pink dollar is an <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> {{which refers to}} the {{spending}} power of the LGBT community. Advertising agencies sometimes call the gay market the pink economy.|$|R
50|$|Expenditure cascades is an <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> {{coined by}} {{researcher}} Robert H. Frank. It describes changes in purchasing and consumption behaviour which ripple through {{the levels of}} income in response to changes in income inequality.|$|R
50|$|Ryot (alternatives: raiyat, rait or ravat) was {{a general}} <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> used {{throughout}} India for peasant cultivators but with variations in different provinces. While zamindars were landlords, raiyats were tenants and cultivators, and served as hired labour.|$|R
25|$|In <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> {{pollution}} from fossil fuels {{is regarded as}} a negative externality. Taxation is considered one way to make societal costs explicit, in order to 'internalize' the cost of pollution. This aims to make fossil fuels more expensive, thereby reducing their use and the amount of pollution associated with them, along with raising the funds necessary to counteract these factors.|$|E
25|$|Georgescu {{argues that}} the {{relevance}} of thermodynamics to economics stems from the physical fact that man can neither create nor destroy matter or energy, only transform it. The usual <b>economic</b> <b>terms</b> of 'production' and 'consumption' are mere verbal conventions that tend to obscure that nothing is created and nothing is destroyed in the economic process — everything is being transformed.|$|E
25|$|The Mauryas valued certain forest tracts in {{strategic}} or <b>economic</b> <b>terms</b> and instituted curbs and control measures over them. They regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation. They employed some of them, the food-gatherers or aranyaca to guard borders and trap animals. The sometimes tense and conflict-ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the Mauryas to guard their vast empire.|$|E
50|$|Trade {{diversion}} is an <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> {{related to}} international economics in which trade is diverted {{from a more}} efficient exporter towards a less efficient one by {{the formation of a}} free trade agreement or a customs union.|$|R
50|$|Capital outflow is an <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> {{describing}} capital flowing out of (or leaving) {{a particular}} economy. Outflowing capital {{can be caused}} by any number of economic or political reasons but can often originate from instability in either sphere.|$|R
50|$|Bimetallism is the <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> for a {{monetary}} standard {{in which the}} value of the monetary unit is defined as equivalent to certain quantities of two metals, typically gold and silver, creating a fixed rate of exchange between them.|$|R
25|$|The {{impact of}} cyanobacterial blooms has been {{assessed}} in <b>economic</b> <b>terms.</b> In December 1991, the world’s largest algal bloom occurred in Australia, where 1000nbsp&km of the Darling-Barwon River was affected. One million people-days {{of drinking water}} were lost, and the direct costs incurred totalled more than A$1.3 million. Moreover, 2000 site-days of recreation were also lost, and the economic cost was estimated at A$10 milliobn, after taking into account indirectly affected industries such as tourism, accommodation and transport.|$|E
25|$|Ross's life resembled {{prominent}} Anglo-Métis in {{the northern}} United States and Canada. Scots and English fur traders in North America were typically men of social status and financial standing who married high-ranking Native American women. Both sides believed these were strategic alliances, helping the Native Americans and the traders. They educated their children in bi-cultural and multilingual environments. The mixed-race children often married and rose to positions of stature in society, both in political and <b>economic</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
25|$|The steel frames become {{inefficient and}} uneconomic for supertall {{buildings}} as usable floor space is reduced for progressively larger supporting columns. Since about 1960, tubular designs {{have been used}} for high rises. This reduces the usage of material (more efficient in <b>economic</b> <b>terms</b> – Willis Tower uses a third less steel than the Empire State Building) yet allows greater height. It allows fewer interior columns, and so creates more usable floor space. It further enables buildings to take on various shapes.|$|E
50|$|Cyclical {{asymmetry}} is an <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> {{which describes}} any large imbalance in economic factors that occur due to purely cyclical reactions by a market or nation. This can include employment rates, debt retention, interest rates, bond strengths, or stock market imbalances.|$|R
50|$|The <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> that {{corresponds}} to Net Material Product in Russian is Национальный доход (literally: national income). None of the accepted meanings of national income in English matches the meaning in Russian, and Net Material Product was introduced into English usage as the best alternative.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the debate}} played out, the free-market {{politicians}} turned to attacking {{the political parties}} which were in power in the Australian states, and public sector medium enterprises {{came to be seen}} as inefficient. The <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> [...] "current account deficit" [...] was in vogue.|$|R
25|$|Pay-to-play {{was cited}} {{as a cause of}} major damage {{to the quality of the}} New York comedy scene. In <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> a pay-to-play {{strategy}} elevates those people who can afford to perform for nothing, or can afford to pay for their stage-time, which has nothing to do with their quality as an act. The pay-to-play promoter is able to profit from the goodwill and desire to perform of the acts, while discouraging appearances by those who cannot afford to perform without payment.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{responses}} to the uncertainties of global warming is to adopt a strategy of sequential decision making. This strategy recognizes that decisions on global warming need to be made with incomplete information, and that decisions in the near term will have potentially long-term impacts. Governments might choose to use risk management as part of their policy response to global warming. For instance, a risk-based approach can be applied to climate impacts which are difficult to quantify in <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> e.g., the impacts of global warming on indigenous peoples.|$|E
25|$|Common {{examples}} of public goods include: defence, public fireworks, lighthouses, {{clean air and}} other environmental goods, and information goods, such as official statistics, software development, authorship, and invention. Some goods, like orphan drugs, require special governmental incentives to be produced, but can't be classified as public goods since they don't fulfill the above requirements (non-excludable and non-rivalrous.) Law enforcement, streets, libraries, museums, and education are commonly misclassified as public goods, but they are technically classified in <b>economic</b> <b>terms</b> as quasi-public goods because excludability is possible, but they do still fit some {{of the characteristics of}} public goods.|$|E
50|$|Dead {{capital is}} an <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> related to {{property}} which is informally held {{that it is}} not legally recognized. The uncertainty of ownership decreases the value of the asset and/or the ability to lend or borrow against it. These lost forms of value are dead capital.|$|R
50|$|Trade {{creation}} is an <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> related to international economics in which trade flows are redirected {{due to the}} formation of a free trade area or a customs union. The issue was firstly brought into discussion by Jacob Viner (1950), together with the trade diversion effect.|$|R
50|$|Oxford {{theoretical}} physicist David Deutsch {{has adopted}} the <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> fungible {{to describe the}} physical nature of quantum particles and universes within the quantum multiverse, where, {{by virtue of being}} identical in all respects, different particles chaotically divide or combine as a result of physical interactions from a common fungible fund in superposition.|$|R
25|$|Reuse is {{the action}} or {{practice}} of using something again, whether for its original purpose (conventional reuse) or to fulfil a different function (creative reuse or repurposing). It should {{be distinguished from}} recycling, which is the breaking down of used items to make raw materials for the manufacture of new products. Reuse – by taking, but not reprocessing, previously used items – helps save time, money, energy, and resources. In broader <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> it can make quality products available to people and organizations with limited means, while generating jobs and business activity {{that contribute to the}} economy.|$|E
25|$|Cattle ranches, or estancias, for {{beef and}} hides were {{typically}} quite large (over 10km²) and were {{concentrated in the}} north and east. Dairying was concentrated in the department of Colonia. Because ranching required little labor, merely a few gauchos, the interior lacked a peasantry and large towns. Despite being sparsely populated, however, the interior was relatively urbanized in that the capital of each department usually contained about half the inhabitants. Social and economic development indicators were lowest for the departments along the Brazilian border to the northeast. Government attempts to encourage agricultural colonization by means of land reform in the interior had largely failed in <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> as had the promotion of wheat production. One exception, rice, most of which was produced in the east, had become a major nontraditional export in recent years.|$|E
25|$|In <b>economic</b> <b>terms</b> the {{division}} of the Three Kingdoms reflected a reality that long endured. Even during the Northern Song dynasty, 700 years after the Three Kingdoms period, it was possible to think of China as being composed of three great regional markets. (The status of the northwest was slightly ambivalent, as it had links with the northern region and Sichuan). These geographical divisions are underscored {{by the fact that the}} main communication routes between the three main regions were all man-made: the Grand Canal linking north and south, the hauling-way through the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River linking southern China with Sichuan and the gallery roads joining Sichuan with the northwest. The break into three separate entities was quite natural and even anticipated by such political foresight as that of Zhuge Liang (see Longzhong Plan).|$|E
50|$|Economic miracle is an {{informal}} <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> {{commonly used to}} refer to a period of dramatic economic development that is entirely unexpected or unexpectedly strong. The term has been used to describe periods in the recent histories of a number of countries, often those undergoing an economic boom, or described as a tiger economy.|$|R
5000|$|As an <b>{{economic}}</b> <b>term,</b> [...] "eurosclerosis" [...] has later {{been used}} more broadly {{to refer to}} overall economic stagnation. According to Paul Krugman and the US Federal Reserve (see chart to the left), at least one alleged victim of Eurosclerosis (France) has gone from having a lower employment than the US in 1999, to a significantly higher employment rate following the Great Recession.|$|R
50|$|Peng’s Coefficient is an <b>economic</b> <b>term</b> {{which refers}} to the {{proportion}} of an individual’s spending on culture- and spirit-related products or services, such as books, movie, opera, concert, travelling, training and so forth, to her/his total expenditure. Peng’s Coefficient is inversely proportional to Engel’s Coefficient, because the more proportion people spend on food, the less proportion on culture and spirit.The concept was named after its creator Peng Bing from China.|$|R
