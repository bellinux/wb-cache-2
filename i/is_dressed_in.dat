5|$|Another figure, to {{the right}} of Małachowski, is being carried; he is Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha (5), marshal of the Lithuanian {{confederation}} and the second Sejm marshal. He <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> more traditional Polish clothing. Between Małachowski and Sapieha, the head of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz (6), a well-known writer, is visible. He appears to be carrying Sapieha. The other figure carrying Sapieha, to his right, is Michał Zabiełło (7).|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} of a powerful and alert patriarch. The painting is set at a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid across his upper body to suggest physical presence.|$|E
5|$|Satan preaches from {{a raised}} earth mound and <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> {{clerical}} clothing {{that may be}} a soutane. He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E
50|$|At Eurovision, Proeski {{created an}} ethno {{sound on the}} Istanbul stage. The {{performance}} contained elaborate choreography and dancers who wore very little clothing. Tose <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> white, while the backing vocals <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> black. The performance contained attention grabbing shots, which placed Macedonia in the 14th position.|$|R
5000|$|Episode 6: The catwalk was {{all about}} embodying {{specific}} emotions brought out by the clothing.

5|$|The two copper statues, each {{standing}} 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, flank the obelisk which {{rises to}} a masonry soldier statue, {{instead of the}} typical apex of an obelisk. The figure atop the granite obelisk is a mustached American Civil War soldier dressed in a long coat, a cape, and a cap. In the figure's right hand he holds the handle of his sword and the sword's tip rests {{in front of his}} right foot. In the soldier's left hand is a flag. Below the apex of the obelisk, on the memorial's base, are two additional sculpted figures, a Union infantry soldier and a Union cavalry soldier. The Union infantryman <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> a cap, long coat, and a cape, much like the figure atop the obelisk. The Union cavalryman, standing {{on the east side of}} the base, <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> a brimmed hat and short jacket.|$|E
5|$|Béart {{is given}} an {{ethereal}} quality by Lubtchansky's cinematography and lighting, and she subtly portrays Marie's detachment and vulnerability. In {{the latter part}} of the film Béart <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> grey and looks tired and wan, showing Marie's ageing and angst. Béart says she made deliberate use of silence in playing the part. Radziwiłowicz's performance allows the viewer to sympathise with Julien despite the character's initial dislikeable nature. Brochet as Madame X has a cool ease and grace.|$|E
5|$|Francis's disciple, {{secretary}} and confessor Brother Leo acts as eyewitness. He <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> sombre colours and rendered {{in a more}} compact manner than Francis; crouched as if sunk into the pictorial space in the far right of the panel. His form is highly geometric and voluminous. His cord belt curves down to end next to that of Francis, symbolising the continuity between the Order's founder and his successors. Leo's posture seems to indicate mourning, although {{he appears to be}} resting or asleep.|$|E

5|$|Portrait of Maria Portinari {{is a small}} c. 1470–72 tempera and oil on wood {{painting}} by Hans Memling. It portrays Maria Maddalena Baroncelli, about whom very little is known. She is aged about 14 years old, and depicted shortly before her wedding to the Italian banker Tommaso Portinari. Maria <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> the height of late fifteenth-century fashion, with a long black hennin with a transparent veil and an elaborate jewel studded necklace. Her headdress is similar and necklace identical to those in her depiction in Hugo van der Goes's later Portinari Altarpiece (c. 1475), a painting {{that may have been}} partly based on Memling's portrait.|$|E
5|$|The film {{returns to}} the opening scene. Tommy breaks down in tears but stops crying when, upon {{catching}} sight of a mirror, he sees the image of Marty standing behind him. He finishes dressing for the fight and, as {{he walks to the}} ring, hears Stephanie calling to him. He turns to her; they smile. He resumes his walk to the ring and the camera pulls back to reveal that he <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> Marty's old ring robe in tribute.|$|E
5|$|The scene {{changes to}} a beach-like bar {{equipped}} with cabanas and sand scattered through the floor. Each girl <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> beach draps and dance {{with a man}} as the scene interchanges with Fetty Wap's rap verse. A product placement for the app Friendable with the group's invitation is shown. The girls perform a dance routine in-sync as Normani and Dinah are shown individually dancing near a rock and on the sand. The video ends with each making a pose as the cinematic black bars close.|$|E

5|$|Actor Rishi Kapoor was {{subsequently}} cast as Rauf Lala, an underworld Don. Kapoor, {{who had never}} played a completely negative character in his entire career, was initially hesitant to sign the film. In an interview with Daily News and Analysis he stated that when Malhotra had offered him the role, he considered {{it to be a}} joke and thought that he would be the reason for the film's failure. Kapoor subsequently insisted on a test look before principal photography could begin, so that he could comfortably fit into the Muslim character of Lala, who wears kohl in his eyes, a karakul cap and <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> traditional kurta-pajamas. While shooting for the action sequences, Kapoor suffered several bad falls and bruises, but continued shooting and was thereby praised by co-star Hrithik Roshan for his professionalism.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are visible}} in stalls. Behind {{them is a}} {{crumbling}} wall with three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning against the wall, looking into the shed. Two are positioned {{to the left and}} two to the right; in each pair one <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> red and an other in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E
5|$|Hope shows {{its central}} {{character}} alone, {{with no other}} human figures visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith. She <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> classical costume, based on the Elgin Marbles; Nicholas Tromans of Kingston University speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen to evoke the ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of Christian tradition. Her pose is based on that of Michelangelo's Night, in an intentionally strained position. She sits on a small, imperfect orange globe with wisps of cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background. The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, as if by starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer {{is the source of}} light. Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition of shapes, creating a shimmering and dissolving effect more typically associated with pastel work than with oil painting.|$|E

5|$|In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 {{animated}} {{adaptation of}} The Lord of the Rings, which corresponds to The Fellowship of the Ring {{and part of}} The Two Towers, Saruman is voiced by Fraser Kerr. He has only one major scene—his attempt to persuade Gandalf to join him. He appears again briefly before the battle of Helm's Deep, speaking to his army. The character <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> red and is called 'Saruman' and 'Aruman' at different points. Smith and Matthews suggest {{that the use of}} 'Aruman' was intended to avoid confusion with 'Sauron'. The 1980 Rankin/Bass TV animated version of The Return of the King begins roughly where Bakshi's film ends but does not include Saruman's character.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{become more}} complex as the player progresses, {{introducing}} different mechanics and {{new types of}} enemies. Each enemy type <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> a unique colour, allowing the player to recognise their movement patterns. Some enemies remain static or rotate on a single node, while others will patrol the board along a specific route. Later stages may require the player to collect keys located {{on the board and}} unlock doors that block access to the level objective. Trapdoors connect one location on the board to another and allow the player to move between them during a turn. Some nodes contain potted plants, the player will not be detected while occupying these nodes. Coloured disguises can be found and equipped to let the player walk past an enemy type of that colour without being detected. There are throwable objects that are used to disrupt and change enemy behaviour patterns. Firearms can also be found on certain levels, they are used to shoot targets or obstacles from a distance.|$|E
5|$|The John Dory, {{though of}} uninviting appearance, is {{considered}} by some persons as the most delicious fish that appears at table; in the general estimation, however, it ranks next to the turbot, but it is far less abundant in our waters, and is not commonly to be procured of sufficient size for a handsome dish, except in some few parts of our coast which are celebrated for it. It may easily be known by its yellow gray colour, its one large dark spot on either side, the long filaments on the back, a general thickness of form, and its very ugly head. It <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> the same manner, and served usually with the same sauces as a turbot, but requires less time to boil it. The fins should be cut off before it is cooked.|$|E

5|$|The half-length {{portrait}} shows Maria Portinari (born Maria Maddalena Baroncelli in 1456) in a three-quarter view {{turned to}} the left. She has somewhat Nordic features, and <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> the high fashion then found {{at the apex of}} Flemish and Italian high society. She is placed against a flat, opaque, dark background, with her hands clasped in prayer. In Memling's early portraits the backgrounds tend to be plain, as was invariably the case in the work of Jan van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden, and favored within Burgundian court circles. In contrast, Memling's later portraits are set within rich interiors or against landscapes framed by columns, such as in his Portrait of Benedetto Portinari, a fact that has assisted in dating his work.|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> a red garment, {{as opposed to the}} swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds of her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The saints are {{identifiable}} from Latin inscriptions {{lining the}} borders of the imitation bronze frame, which is original. Van der Paele is identifiable from historical records. He <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> the finery of a medieval canon, including white surplice, as he piously reads from a book of hours. He is presented to Mary by Saint George, his name saint, who holds aloft his metal helmet in respect. Saint Donatian, dressed in brightly coloured vestments, stands to the left. The panel is noted for the finery of clothing, including exquisite representations of furs, silks and brocades, and the elaborate and detailed religious iconography. The Virgin's throne is decorated with carved representations of Adam and Eve, prefigurations of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus, and scenes from the Old Testament. The painting is lined with a series of inscriptions which comment on the saints, and include van Eyck's signature.|$|E
