5000|$|CPCs {{have been}} criticized for {{deceptive}} advertising. Some falsely advertise abortion services, attracting clients who wish to have an abortion. In the 1980s, investigative reporters from the Arizona Republic, the San Francisco Chronicle and CBS News, among others, filed stories about CPCs attracting women by offering free pregnancy tests but then presenting them with religious arguments and scare tactics against abortion. CPCs may intentionally locate near, and look like, abortion clinics; critics have also objected to CPCs' use of rhetoric and advertising language similar to those of abortion providers, such as [...] "Plan Your Parenthood" [...] or a directory listing under [...] "abortion services" [...] or [...] "clinics". These, they say, may mislead pregnant women seeking abortion into contacting a CPC. In particular, the advertising approach of the Pearson Foundation, which assists local groups establishing CPCs, has been criticized by some other pro-life groups, including Birthright International, another CPC operator. The foundation recommends that a center seek out women who want abortions through [...] "neutral" [...] advertising, and refuse to answer questions that would reveal that they provide neither abortion services nor referrals to abortion services. Pearson, identified by some as the founder of the first CPC, said that a woman [...] "has no right to information" [...] that will allow her to have an abortion. In Ireland, where abortion is illegal except when pregnancy endangers the mother's life and women often travel to the United Kingdom to end their pregnancies, [...] "rogue" [...] CPCs, in contrast to government sponsored pregnancy centers, may falsely give the impression in their advertising that they refer women to Britain for abortions or otherwise provide <b>information</b> <b>for</b> <b>women</b> seeking to travel for abortion.|$|E

Methods A participatory design was used and the information was evaluated in seven stages by researchers, professional experts and users. All steps of the development process were noted in an online logbook. Results The information developed gradually and its contents were reviewed by nurse-midwives, nurses and physicians specializing in different key areas including diabetes care, paediatrics, obstetrics and breastfeeding, a clinical dietician and mothers with type 1 diabetes. The draft was reviewed in regard to its cultural suitability and the information material was adjusted to meet quality criterions. Finally, the text was adapted for a lay audience. Conclusions Using participatory design required time and resources, however; it proved a functional way of producing appropriate information for the target group. </p...|$|E

However, lifetime risks of breast cancer in individual BRCA 1 / 2 mutation carriers have been confusing to apply in clinical decision-making.

Recently, Begg and colleagues estimated cancer risks in a population-based study of BRCA 1 / 2 mutation carriers. Here, we discuss the clinical decisionmaking implications of this research in the context of risk factors that may influence risk estimates in BRCA 1 / 2 mutation carriers.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} informational and {{behavioural}} factors, that affect women’s participation {{in physical activity}} (PA) and body weight changes during perimenopause. Methods: An environmental scan of online health websites to determine availability and quality of <b>information</b> <b>for</b> <b>women</b> about body weight changes during transition to menopause. An interpretive descriptive qualitative study of women age 40 – 60 to explore factors influencing their PA. Descriptive and inductive qualitative analysis were used. Results: Six of 52 websites (11. 5 %) contained information specific to perimenopausal women, with one site citing evidence. For 26 women interviewed, the most common enabling factors were daily structure, positive feelings, and accountability; while common barriers were disruptions in daily structure, competing demands, and self - sacrifice. Conclusions: There {{is a lack of}} information regarding body weight changes for perimenopausal women. Perimenopausal women attribute their PA participation to psychosocial factors, and not the physiology of menopause. ...|$|E

The analysis explores how collective action can bring about structural change to oppressive gender norms.

The findings show that MBUP is promoting social change and women’s rights in certain ways, namely in creating social awareness in women, access to <b>information</b> <b>for</b> <b>women,</b> and active citizenship in women.
