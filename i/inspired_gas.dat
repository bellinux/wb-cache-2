40|$|Background: Perioperative {{hypothermia}} {{can develop}} easily during shoulder arthroscopy, because cold irrigation can directly influence core body temperature. The authors investigated whether active warming and humidification of <b>inspired</b> <b>gases</b> reduces falls in core body temperature and allows redistribution of body heat in patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery under general anesthesia. Methods: Patients scheduled for arthroscopic shoulder surgery {{were randomly assigned}} to receive either room temperature <b>inspired</b> <b>gases</b> using a conventional respiratory circuit (the control group, n = 20) or <b>inspired</b> <b>gases</b> humidified and heated using a humidified and electrically heated circuit (HHC) (the heated group, n = 20). Results: Core temperatures were significantly lower in both groups from 30 min after anesthesia induction, but were significantly higher in the heated group than in the control group from 75 to 120 min after anesthesia induction. Conclusions: In this study the use of a humidified and electrically heated circuit did not prevent core temperature falling during arthroscopic shoulder surgery, but it was found to decrease reductions in core temperature from 75 min after anesthesia induction.

METHODS: We conducted a short-term 20 -hour study and a long-term 10 -week randomized crossover study comparing a heated humidifier (HH) to a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) in children with established tracheos-tomies. Subjects were assessed for clinical events, clinical examination findings, airway cytokine levels, and airway secretion viscoelasticity. RESULTS: For the short-term study, 15 children were recruited; for the long-term study, 14 children were recruited. Children using the HH had de-creased respiratory examination score (P <. 001) but no change in clinical events over the short term. There was a decrease in acute clinical events (P. 008) in the long-term study. No differences were found in airway secretion viscoelasticity results or cytokine levels in either study, but these sample numbers were limited. CONCLUSIONS: Over 20 hours use, HH, compared to HME, improved work of breathing. Over a longer 10 week treatment period HH resulted in decreased adverse clinical events.

The system for controlling the end-tidal gas composition is based on a principle described by Swanson and Bellville (J. Appl.

Methods: Ninety patients scheduled for general surgery were randomised to receive a fresh gas flow of 1. 0, 3. 0 or 6. 0 lmin 1 with or without HMEs in a circle anaesthesia system. Relative humidity, absolute humidity, temperature of <b>inspired</b> <b>gases</b> and body temperatures were measured during 120 min of anaesthesia. Results: The inspiratory absolute humidity levels with HMEs were 32. 73. 1, 32. 11. 1 and 29. 21. 9 mg H 2 O l 1 and 26. 62. 3, 22. 63. 0 and 13. 02. 6 mgH 2 O l 1 without HMEs after 120 min of anaesthesia with 1. 0, 3. 0, or 6. 0 l min 1 fresh gas flows (P< 0. 05, between with and without HME).

Is the <b>inspired</b> <b>gas</b> temperature at the airway opening, as expected and set on the humidifier, around 378 C?We aimed to measure temperature at the airway opening and compare this with the circuit temperature. This was an observational study in a neonatal intensive care unit. Twenty-five mechanically ventilated infants were studied. All had humidifiers with chamber temperature set at 368 C and the circuit temperature set at 378 C. Two temperature probeswere inserted and rested at the circuit-exit andat theairwayopening, and temperaturesweremeasured for 2 min ineach infant. At this time, the circuit temperature was also noted. The mean (SD) temperature at the airway opening in infants nursed in incubators was 34. 9 (1. 2) 8 C, compared with radiant warmers where the mean (SD) was 33. 1 (0. 5) 8 C. The mean (SD) difference in temperature from the circuit temperature probe to the airway opening was greater under radiant warmers, with a mean (SD) drop of 3. 9 (0. 6) 8 Ccomparedwith amean (SD) drop of 2. 0 (1. 3) 8 C in the incubators.
