5|$|In the United States, a {{historic}} district {{is a group}} of buildings, properties, or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within {{a historic}} district are normally divided into two categories, contributing and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size: some <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> of structures, while others have just a few.|$|E
5|$|Zeus used {{mechanically}} steered radars, {{like the}} Nike SAMs before it, {{limiting the number}} of targets it could attack at once. A study by the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) calculated that the Soviets had a 90 percent chance of successfully hitting a Zeus base by firing only four warheads at it. These did not even have to land close in order to destroy the base; an explosion within several miles would destroy its radars, which were very difficult to harden. If the Soviets did <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> of missiles, they could easily afford to use some to attack the Zeus sites.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} paired {{cerebral}} organs, sacs whose only openings {{are to the}} outside. Others species have unpaired evertible organs {{on the front of}} their heads. Some have slits {{along the side of the}} head or grooves obliquely across the head, and these may be associated with paired cerebral organs. All of these are thought to be chemoreceptors, and the cerebral organs may also aiding osmoregulation. Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors. On their head some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect light but not form an image. Most nemerteans have two to six ocelli, although some <b>have</b> <b>hundreds.</b> A few tiny species that live between grains of sand have statocysts, which sense balance.|$|E

5|$|Some {{very large}} events known as fests (short for festival) <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> or {{thousands}} of participants who are usually split into competing character factions camped separately around a large venue. There are relatively few fests in the world, all based in Europe and Canada; however, their size means {{that they have a}} significant influence on local LARP culture and design. At {{the other end of the}} size scale, some small events known as linear or line-course LARPs feature a small group of PCs facing a series of challenges from NPCs and are often more tightly planned and controlled by GMs than other styles of LARP.|$|E

25|$|Most badges have an {{inscription}} on the reverse, which often recorded where the badge was made and, if appropriate, what special occasion it commemorated. In addition the reverse may also feature a revolutionary slogan, a quotation from Mao, or respectful wishes for long life to Chairman Mao. Thus each obverse design may <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> of different varieties with different reverse inscriptions, being produced {{in different parts}} of the country or to commemorate different events.|$|E
25|$|Humans vs. Zombies {{has grown}} in {{popularity}} across campuses. While most games deal with relatively few people, some games have grown to <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> of participants. Some schools and universities have banned the game due to its perceived violent nature. An increase in sensitivity to gun violence following the 2007 school shooting at Virginia Tech also led to worries about the game's continuation at Goucher and elsewhere, and several games have been shut down due to concerns about Nerf Blasters being used.|$|E

Most big cities in the terai <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> of cycle rickshaws that carry local commuters and travelers, as well as are used for carrying goods. Since the terai region is bordered with India, cycle rickshaws are also popular means for shoppers, businessmen and travelers to travel {{in and out of}} the country freely. The free border between India and Nepal enable the rickshaw owners from both countries to operate across the border without any restriction.|$|E
25|$|Plant miRNAs {{usually have}} near-perfect pairing with their mRNA targets, which induces gene {{repression}} through cleavage {{of the target}} transcripts. In contrast, animal miRNAs are able to recognize their target mRNAs by using as little as 6–8 nucleotides (the seed region) at the 5' end of the miRNA, which is not enough pairing to induce cleavage of the target mRNAs. Combinatorial regulation is a feature of miRNA regulation in animals. A given miRNA may <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> of different mRNA targets, and a given target might be regulated by multiple miRNAs.|$|E

Wood pulp is widely used to make paper, paperboard, cellulose sponges, cellophane and some important plastics and textiles, such as cellulose acetate and rayon. Bamboo stems also <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> of uses, including paper, buildings, furniture, boats, musical instruments, fishing poles, water pipes, plant stakes, and scaffolding.

25|$|Addressing is {{generally}} done by hand, {{and is an}} opportunity to demonstrate one's handwriting (see shodō). The postcards may have spaces for the sender to write a personal message. Blank cards are available, so people can hand-write or draw their own. Rubber stamps with conventional messages and with the annual animal are on sale at department stores and other outlets, and many people buy ink brushes for personal greetings. Special printing devices are popular, especially among people who practice crafts. Software also lets artists create their own designs and output them using their computer's color printer. Because a gregarious individual might <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> to write, print shops offer a wide variety of sample postcards with short messages so that the sender has only to write addresses. Even with the rise in popularity of email, the nengajō remains very popular in Japan, although the younger generation hardly send any cards, preferring to exchange digital greetings using their mobile phones. In recent years this digital greeting preference is gradually accepted among the society.|$|E
25|$|Polygyny where {{wives are}} of equal status {{had always been}} illegal in China, and had been {{considered}} a crime in some dynasties. In family laws from Tang to Qing Dynasties, {{the status of a}} wife, concubines and maid-mistresses couldn't be altered. However, concubinage was supported by law {{until the end of the}} Qing/Ching dynasty of the imperial China (1911). In the past, Emperors could and often did <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> to thousands of concubines. Rich officials and merchants of the elite also took concubines in addition to legal wives. The first wife was the head or mother wife; other wives were under her headship if the husband was away. Concubines had a lower status than full wives, generally not being seen in public with their husband and not having rights to decisions in the house. Children from concubines were considered inferior to those of the wife and did not receive equal wealth/legacy from their father. However they were considered legitimate, therefore had many more rights to inheritance of status and wealth than illegitimate children conceived outside a marriage.|$|E

500|$|Technological {{improvements}} in warheads and missiles {{through the late}} 1950s greatly reduced the cost of ICBMs. After the launch of Sputnik, Pravda quoted Nikita Khrushchev claiming they were building them [...] "like sausages". This led {{to a series of}} intelligence estimates that predicted the Soviets would <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> of missiles by the early 1960s, creating the so-called [...] "missile gap". It was later shown that the number of Soviet missiles did not reach the hundreds until the late 1960s, and at the time they had only four.|$|E
500|$|The Nike-X {{system was}} {{developed}} in response to limitations of the earlier Nike Zeus system. Zeus' radars could only track single targets, and it was calculated that a salvo of only four ICBMs would have a 90% chance of hitting a Zeus base. [...] Zeus would have been useful in the late 1950s when the Soviets {{had only a few}} dozen missiles, but it was of little use by the early 1960s when it was believed the Soviets would <b>have</b> <b>hundreds.</b> The attacker could also use radar reflectors or high-altitude nuclear explosions to obscure the warheads until they were too close to attack, making a single-warhead attack highly likely to succeed.|$|E
