5000|$|Interfacing {{with the}} computer's {{hardware}} was likewise done differently than previously had been usual practice. Rather than accessing the memory-mapped keyboard and video directly, {{this was done}} entirely through the TRSDOS SVCs. This method permitted I/O redirection over all the computer's devices, including the disk drives, and made possible, for example, to [...] "print" [...] a document to a disk file {{so it could be}} printed at a later time when a printer was physically available. Another frequent use of I/O redirection was redirecting video output to the printer for permanent <b>hardcopy</b> <b>of</b> a program run. TRSDOS supplied the LINK, ROUTE, and FILTER commands to enable these capabilities. This method also ensured consistent communication between memory resident modules attached to the OS's logical devices. Some applications programmers, however, did circumvent this device-independent approach by physically accessing the computer hardware. The most glaring example of this was Radio Shack itself when it produced its SuperScripsit word processor; their programmers insisted on having the infamous CTL255 routine built into the keyboard driver expressly for this purpose. Another offender was Anitek Software's Lescript. These two applications would ignore any filter programs attached to the keyboard device, depriving the user of some capable terminate-and-stay-resident programs, such as Misosys' Sidekick-like Pro-WAM Window Application Manager.|$|E

Working at the so-called symmetrical point allows to perform minus-sign free QMC simulations and thus reach temperatures of less than 1 % of the conduction electron bandwidth. Study of the temperature dependence of the single particle Green's function and dynamical spin correlation function shows a surprisingly intricate low temperature band structure and gives evidence for two characteristic temperatures, which we identify with the Kondo and coherence temperature, respectively. In particular, the data show a temperature induced metal-insulator transition at the coherence temperature.

After an introduction to the underlying physical ideas, we discuss in detail the formalism of the heavy quark effective theory, including a comprehensive treatment of symmetry breaking corrections.

The main focus is on results obtained using QCD sum rules.
