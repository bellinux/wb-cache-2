5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma {{heavily dependent on}} oil suffered the freefall in <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> due to a glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries.

By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.|$|E
5|$|Some cotton {{crops in}} the Southeast United States {{received}} needed rainfall from Danny, {{while others were}} harmed, as 100,000 acres of cotton fields in Alabama were too heavily damaged for their crop to be salvaged. The effects of Danny caused the gasoline production of Gulf Coast oil refineries to decline and thus contributed {{to an increase in}} <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> in the months following Danny throughout the United States. A severe drought had been in place in the Mid-Atlantic region during the month of July. The high amount of rainfall caused by Danny helped to ease dry conditions in portions of the Mid-Atlantic, but not sufficiently to stop the drought from developing further in most areas from northern Virginia to southern New England.|$|E

5|$|The {{rift between}} Williams and Patton became {{permanent}} during negotiations {{over the state}} budget in 1999. Patton proposed to Williams a 7-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, with 1cent of every 7 dedicated to counties with the most unpaved roads – usually heavily Republican counties ignored by past Democratic governors. Patton claimed Williams {{told him he had}} 10votes in the Senate for the increase. But <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> spiked before the measure came to a vote in the Senate, and Williams failed to deliver his votes after the House passed the tax. The administration and key Republican senators reached a compromise that saved Patton's budget with tax changes that were mostly revenue-neutral. Patton believed Williams had deliberately misled him, however, and the two never reconciled.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico, prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London. Natural <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2. Anticipation {{of a threat to}} supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in the price move. In New Orleans, officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as a worst-case scenario, intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior. Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation. Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall. Both Louisiana and Texas emergency operation centers monitored the progress of the storm, though did not execute any preparation action.|$|E

25|$|Marcellus gas {{production}} has lowered {{the price of}} natural gas in the Mid-Atlantic states of the US, which previously were almost entirely dependent on gas pipelined in from the US Gulf Coast. From 2005 through 2008, wholesale <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> at Mid-Atlantic states were $0.23 to $0.33 per million BTU above prices of the main Gulf Coast trading point, the Henry Hub. The US Energy Information Administration reported in 2012 that Marcellus production had lowered regional <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> to nearly par with Henry Hub, and projected that by 2015, Marcellus gas would drive <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> in its area down to $0.10 below Henry Hub. In October 2013, the US EIA reported that futures markets were predicting Appalachian <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> to dip to $0.30 below Henry Hub in 2016.|$|E

30|$|Natural gas {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} types of energy used for industrial production and household use, and its price can have a great impact on the economic development of a country, including total production and inflation. The Henry Hub natural <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> is an important price level benchmark for the <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> not only in the USA but also in the worldwide market. Also, as a relatively cleaner energy than coal, wood and oil, natural gas can be exploited more broadly, and advancements in technology show a brighter future for the use of natural gas. This paper discusses the factors influencing the Henry Hub natural <b>gas</b> <b>price.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this research, the {{tolerability}} of {{the economy}} of Ukraine for the increase of the <b>gas</b> import <b>price</b> is investigated. The relationship between the economic growth and imported <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> is analyzed, and {{it was found that}} the gas consumption of the food and other smaller industries was growing while the <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> was increasing; although, the larger industries such as chemical and manufacturing industries reduced the gas consumption. It was also found that Ukraine may hold a capability to lower the <b>gas</b> import <b>price</b> to the degree comparable to the current price. For the analysis, the national statistics of every month from 2002 through 2008 was used with the least squares model and the ARMA model for time-series forecasting. The data contains the GDP, the imported <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> and volume, the PPIs for the food industry, the chemical industry, the manufacturers and the energy industry, as well as the gas volumes consumed by the industries of low price hand, other than the manufacturers and the chemical industries. ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ??????? ??? ???????? ???? ?? ??????????????? ???. ?????????? ??????????? ????????????? ? ??????????????? ?????????-????????????? ?????????, ??????? ?????????? ?? ????????????? ????????? ?????? ????????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ???????. ???????? ?????? ??????????? ?????????????? ????? ? ???? ?? ??????????????? ???. ???? ?????? ??????, ??? ??????????? ???? ??? ???????????? ????????? ??????? ? ? ??????, ????? ?????? ???????? ???????????? ?????? ??? ????? ????? ??? ?? ??????????????? ???. ????? ??? ????? ??????? ???????, ????? ??? ?????????? ? ????????????????, ??????? ??????????? ???? ??? ????? ??? ????. ????? ???????? ??????????? ??????? ???? ?? ??????????????? ??? ??? ??????? ?? ??????, ????????????? ? ??????? ?????...|$|R
