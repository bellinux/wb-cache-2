5|$|Bheema however {{carries his}} four {{brothers}} and mother {{on his back}} and races through the tunnel and takes them to the hiding spot. There a certain cannibal rakshasa named Hidimbasura lives with his sister Hidimbi. <b>He</b> <b>smells</b> the scent of human beings and orders his sister to bring them. Hidimbi however falls in love at first sight with Bheema. Unable to wait any longer, Hidimbasura comes to kill the Pandavas himself. Bheema however kills him very easily. Hidimbi is married to Bheema. She later gives birth to Ghatotkacha from this union.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{emphasized}} by White personally {{that if there}} was one single piece of information the public should know about him it would be that <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> like baby powder.|$|E
25|$|Jaypaw {{is upset}} that he can't compete, and while staying behind at the camp, {{he has a}} vision. He is choking on earth, and <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> badger and fox. He is scrabbling desperately with his paws, until realizes that he is seeing through Lionpaw's eyes. It turns out that, while competing, Lionpaw and Breezepaw fell into a {{collapsing}} fox den. Luckily, Jaypaw got there in time to save them along with Crowfeather. The leaders decide that since every Clan won at something, {{there would be a}} tie and no Clan would win.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, gossip, truly?" [...] asked Sir Daniel keenly. [...] "An {{what came}} <b>he</b> <b>smelling</b> up so many stairs in my poor mansion? But <b>he</b> will <b>smell</b> no more." ...|$|R
40|$|It wasn’t that <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> {{different}} to each person. Rather, there were simply no known odors {{with which to}} compare Jake Longaway, leaving each person who {{came in contact with}} him to grasp for some familiarity that never came close to reality. I brainstormed on legal pads and designed elaborate spreadsheets to try and unravel each nuance. Eventually I landed on this: to me <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> like the air rushing through my high school carpool’s slivered windows on a brisk autumn morning...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You ARE drunk,' {{returned}} the magistrate. 'How dare {{you say you}} are not drunk, Sir, when I say you are? Doesn't <b>he</b> <b>smell</b> of spirits, Grummer?' ...|$|R
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Lindy Hemming {{described the}} Joker's look as reflecting his personality, in that [...] "he doesn't care about himself at all"; she avoided designing {{him as a}} vagrant, but still made him appear to be [...] "scruffier, grungier," [...] so that [...] "when you see him move, he's slightly twitchier or edgy." [...] Nolan noted, [...] "We gave a Francis Bacon spin to [...] This corruption, this decay in {{the texture of the}} look itself. It's grubby. You can almost imagine what <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> like." [...] In creating the [...] "anarchical" [...] look of the Joker, Hemming drew inspiration from such countercultural pop culture artists as Pete Doherty, Iggy Pop, and Johnny Rotten. Ledger described his [...] "clown" [...] mask, made up of three pieces of stamped silicone, as a [...] "new technology," [...] taking less than an hour for the make-up artists to apply, much faster than more-conventional prosthetics usually requires. Ledger also said that he felt he was barely wearing any make-up.|$|E
6000|$|Now here <b>he</b> <b>smells,</b> {{now there}} <b>he</b> <b>smells,</b> Winding his voice along the dells, [...] Till grey flows up the morn, O [...] Then hies again [...] To Lady Jane [...] No longer now forlorn, O.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wrangle don't git enough work," [...] said Jerd, {{as the big}} saddle went on. [...] "He's unruly when he's corralled, an' {{wants to}} run. Wait till <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> the sage!" ...|$|E
60|$|Her fair, small brother {{handed her}} the flower dutifully. She sniffed it and gave it without a word to her cousin, for his judgment. <b>He</b> <b>smelled</b> the {{dangling}} flower curiously.|$|R
60|$|She had not {{supposed}} that he drank so much. Always <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> of whisky, {{and she found}} quart bottles of it in his luggage {{when he returned from}} a trip.|$|R
50|$|McCartney had no {{difficulty}} attracting attention and visitors {{as he was}} friendly, chatty, and quick to share an inspirational sermon. By most accounts <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> very bad, as did his goats.|$|R
6000|$|LADY K.--Don't tell me. He {{comes from}} his club. <b>He</b> <b>smells</b> of smoke; he is a low, vulgar person. Send Pinhorn up to me when you go down stairs. [Exit Lady K.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whom have we here?" [...] {{said the}} Prince, [...] "a butcher, and I think fresh from his office. Do butchers ply their craft on Fastern's Eve? Foh, how <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> of blood!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg pardon," [...] said John Harned; [...] "but {{it would}} seem to me a wise bull. He knows he must not fight man. See! <b>He</b> <b>smells</b> death there in the ring." ...|$|E
60|$|In the end, the god {{tossed the}} meat {{on the snow}} at White Fang's feet. <b>He</b> <b>smelled</b> the meat carefully; {{but he did not}} look at it. While <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> it <b>he</b> kept his eyes on the god. Nothing happened. He took the meat into his mouth and {{swallowed}} it. Still nothing happened. The god was actually offering him another piece of meat. Again he refused to take it from the hand, and again it was tossed to him. This was repeated a number of times. But there came a time when the god refused to toss it. He kept it in his hand and steadfastly proffered it.|$|R
50|$|In another twist, Dholak {{comes out}} holding a trigger on Radha's head. Even Kishen is {{surprised}} when Goonga re-introduces himself as Inspector Bhinde. He {{explains that he}} was sent undercover by the commissioner as even <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> a rat.|$|R
5000|$|The program then {{delivered}} 30 {{minutes of}} blues and hot jazz, with Dr. Gino stepping in between numbers to deliver such comments as, [...] "A Bostonian looks like <b>he's</b> <b>smelling</b> something. A New Yorker looks like he's found it." ...|$|R
6000|$|NAPOLEON. Eh? (He {{takes it}} {{and looks at}} it attentively.) Hm! (<b>He</b> <b>smells</b> it.) Ha! (He walks thoughtfully across the room, looking at the handkerchief, which he finally sticks in the breast of his coat.) ...|$|E
60|$|Joh. He {{may make}} a shift to sow lettuce, raise melons, and water a garden-plat; but otherwise, a very filthy fellow: how odiously <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> of his country garlick! fugh, how he stinks of Spain.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nothing," [...] {{answered}} {{the other boy}} drowsily; [...] "he is not used to the veldt, he who always sleeps in a house like a man; or, perhaps, <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> a hyena in the kloof." ...|$|E
60|$|And here, in this inferno of luggage, was White Fang deserted by the master. Or {{at least}} White Fang {{thought he was}} deserted, until <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> out the master's canvas clothes-bags {{alongside}} of him, and proceeded to mount guard over them.|$|R
50|$|Having {{received}} the nickname Cebolla (onion) from his Peñarol days, from his father, {{and also because}} <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> nicely when <b>he</b> sweat, he {{is well known for}} his speed and technical ability. He also played several seasons in Portugal, with Benfica and Porto.|$|R
6000|$|... "You old darling!" [...] he replied, {{and gave}} her an embrace that left her cheek moist with the sweat of his. <b>He</b> <b>smelled</b> of dust and earth and his body was hot. [...] "I wish to God it could be true for always!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hereward is come!" [...] cried he, as {{he folded}} his master's son in his arms. [...] "Hoi! he is wet with blood! Hoi! <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> of blood! Hoi! the ravens will grow fat now, for Hereward is come home!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure, let 'em {{sleep as}} long as they want to. Our time is our own, and there is no use in hurrying. Just the same, I bet Fred wakes up pretty quick when <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> boiling coffee and pancakes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He says <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> blood,' said Mr Mackenzie. 'I only trust {{he is not}} right. I {{am getting}} very fearful about my little girl. She must have gone far, or she would be home by now. It is half-past three o'clock.' ...|$|E
60|$|Toto did {{not like}} this {{addition}} to the party at first. <b>He</b> <b>smelled</b> around the stuffed man as if he suspected {{there might be a}} nest of rats in the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow.|$|R
5000|$|The Skunk - <b>He</b> doesn’t <b>smell</b> good. <b>He</b> {{is always}} afraid of Oscar, but the trio are always {{afraid of him}} because of his <b>smell.</b> <b>He</b> often takes the trio's fruit.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned again}} {{on to his}} face. And a small dog who had lost its master sniffed at his boots, and sat down a little way off, to wait till Gregory could do {{something}} for him, because <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> that <b>he</b> was that sort of man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ev'n them he canna get attended, [...] Altho' {{their face}} he ne'er had kend it, [...] Just--in a kail-blade, an' sent it, [...] As soon's <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> 't, [...] Baith their disease, {{and what will}} mend it, [...] At once he tells 't.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by {{hereditary}} rights, too; he's {{been dead}} four times a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times natural, once by accident. I've heard say <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> damp and cold, like a grave. And he--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't, Mr. Mool! That dog's temper {{is not to}} be trusted. He {{shows it}} with Miss Minerva, my governess--growls just in that way {{whenever}} he sees her. I dare say <b>he</b> <b>smells</b> you. There! Now he barks! You are only making him worse. Come back!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> {{our food}} and came for some," [...] said Giant. [...] "Good little dog!" [...] he cried. [...] "Come here!" [...] And as he {{snapped his fingers}} the collie {{came up to him}} and allowed the small youth to pat him on the head.|$|R

60|$|Wade {{presented}} himself with {{something more than}} his usual methodical action. <b>He</b> <b>smelled</b> buffalo steak, and he was hungry. The cabin had been built years ago, and was a ramshackle shelter at best. The stone fireplace, however, appeared well preserved. A bed of red coals glowed and cracked upon the hearth.|$|R
