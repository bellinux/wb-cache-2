40|$|Inadequate and {{inconsistent}} data {{are a common}} and persistent problem {{in the field of}} migration. Deficiencies in migration statistics may be tackled using modelling techniques, which has recently been recognised by the European Union (EU) policymakers. The new Regulation on Community statistics on international migration, which obliges countries to supply <b>harmonised</b> <b>statistics,</b> provides for the possibility of using estimation methods to adapt statistics based on national definitions to comply with the required 1 -year duration of stay definition. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a theoretical probabilistic framework to capture various migration flow statistics that are available. It is a crucial step towards better understanding and then harmonising the data. Different migration measures represent the same continuous data-generating process. They differ depending on how the data happened to be collected and how the statistics happened to be produced. We introduce the key concepts of migration statistics using a simple duration model, namely an exponential distribution. While more complex models can better reflect the reality, they do not fundamentally modify the framework presented. The main focus is put on the time criterion used in the migration definition. It refers to the duration of stay following relocation, which is specified very differently among countries and constitutes the main source of discrepancies in operationalisation of the migration concept in the EU member states.

40|$|This chapter aims to {{identify}} {{the characteristics of the}} Italian financial system that partially shielded it from the effects of the financial crisis in its first phase. This will be done by analysing the evolution of the financial aggregates and balance sheet compositions of banks at the European and Italian level. Based on the <b>harmonised</b> <b>statistics</b> produced by the European Central Bank (ECB), we compare the structural characteristics of some of the main European countries. Apart from Italy, the countries considered are Germany, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, chosen because these countries’ banking and financial systems share a number of features and trends. We also assess the average data for the financial systems of Euro Area countries. The chapter consists of three main parts. The first part identifies the current trends in the financial systems under consideration, by examining the main indicators that reveal the evolution and determinants of financial intensity. This analysis is completed by an assessment of the portfolio composition and financial structures of non-financial sectors, with a particular focus on the financial strategies of households and non-financial corporations. The next part examines the situation of the banking sectors in the various countries by establishing the size of monetary financial institutions (MFIs) and by analysing the breakdown of their balance sheets. The final part of the chapter provides a comparative analysis of the main structural and composition indicators of banking sector assets. This is followed by the main conclusions...|$|E

40|$|The United Nations (UN) and the {{international}} community are working on a new development framework to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) after 2015. This is expected to place environmental sustainability at its core by integrating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed at the Rio+ 20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development. • The importance of environmental sustainability to development was captured in MDG 7. Despite some progress towards meeting this goal, there is still substantial unfinished business and new global and local challenges endanger the development and environmental gains achieved so far. • The post- 2015 framework will need to reflect the linkages between poverty reduction, natural resource management and development, as well as local and global environmental challenges. A key element will be to identify and address a common agenda to collectively manage shared global environmental risks and to build resilience across all types of countries to contribute to inclusive and sustainable development, taking into account complex issues such as the interactions between food, water and energy security. • To implement this agenda, a wide range of policies and policy reforms will be needed to promote inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth and improve the well-being of all. • The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stands ready to champion implementation of the post- 2015 sustainable development agenda. It can do so by: » Advancing coherent policies for sustainable development through integrated knowledge and practice; » Championing a data revolution and <b>harmonising</b> <b>statistics</b> for the effective monitoring of development finance for climate, biodiversity and other environmental areas; » Supporting and monitoring OECD country progress in implementing the post- 2015 SDGs via policy guidance, governance support and peer review assessments; » Strengthening and leading strategic international partnerships to share knowledge, promote policy reforms and bring communities together to exchange experience, information and lessons learnt in implementing the SDGs.

40|$|The pricing of infrastructure, {{such as this}} of commercially {{competing}} ports, is one of {{the most}} controversial aspects of the global economy of the 21 st century. The controversy arises from the need to reconcile the economic development impacts of infrastructure investments with the, under commercial terms, recovery of investment costs. In developed countries and regions, the role of ‘public investment’ is thus re-evaluated, while the concept of ‘competition on infrastructure’ is increasingly challenged by the need to establish a level playing field among competing ports. The paper shows how Marginal Cost Pricing of port infrastructure can be a powerful ‘pricing discipline’ towards achieving cost recovery and fair competition among ports. To succeed in this, the paper advocates for stronger policy intervention in order to ensure greater transparency of port accounting systems, better and more <b>harmonised</b> port <b>statistics,</b> a meaningful set of state aid guidelines, and stricter application of Competition Law in port infrastructure investments.

The EFTA Statistical Office (ESO) is located in the premises of Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union in Luxembourg, and functions as a liaison office between Eurostat and the EFTA National Statistical Institutes. ESO's main objective is to promote the full inclusion of the EFTA States in the European Statistical System, thus providing <b>harmonised</b> and comparable <b>statistics</b> to support the general cooperation process between EFTA and the EU within and outside the EEA Agreement. The cooperation also entails technical cooperation programmes with third countries and training of European statisticians.|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} how European Union (EU) {{level and}} domestic level actors strive to <b>harmonise</b> migration <b>statistics.</b> Comparable migration statistics {{are essential for}} EU policy-makers and academics for informed policy formulation and policy evaluation. Yet the components of these statistics vary between the EU member states and hamper their comparison. While the statistical possibilities to enhance the comparability of migration statistics are well-covered in the literature, few studies look into the statistics producers themselves, or ask which factors further the harmonisation of migration statistics. With migration policy rising on the EU’s agenda, also related statistics gain in importance. Statistics producers inform governments as well as supranational institutions, and are therefore essential for democratic and transparent policy-making. It is vital, therefore, to analyse those who collect the data, how they produce statistics, and how they harmonise them across countries. This study employs a most different case research design and focuses on two distinct national statistical systems in their cooperation with EU stakeholders {{in the case of}} migration statistics harmonisation. Comparing the United Kingdom with the Netherlands, this thesis finds that there was most domestic adaptation and policy convergence in view of migration statistics definitions, and less adaptation regarding the policy instruments as well as policy goals. This thesis argues that in addition to supranational explanatory factors such as a high obligatory potential, high domestic administrative capacity as well as national non-opposition to and knowledge of rules drive migration statistics harmonisation...|$|R
30|$|<b>Harmonising</b> {{international}} migration <b>statistics</b> are guided by regulations from the European Commission, such as 862 / 2007, adopted in July 2007, {{which is one}} of the cornerstones of migration statistics policy in the EU. Eurostat, the EU statistical office, is in charge to implement such regulations in close collaboration with the National Statistical Offices, including Statistics Netherlands and the Statistisches Bundesamt. According to regulation 862 / 2007, data collection was no longer voluntary on issues of migration and asylum, and furthermore definitions were provided as to various concepts, such as citizenship, country of birth, asylum, and residence permits. However, despite of efforts in providing guidelines, countries often differ not only in the data-collection and weighting model to reduce the non-response bias, but also in the operationalization of concepts such as migrants or minorities, and in the phrasing of the questions in their surveys, including the EU-Labor Force Survey (EU-LFS) and the EU-Survey on Income and Living Conditions (Huddleston et al., 2013, p. 33). Such concepts to define migrants may also differentiate along the perspective of interest: nationality (citizenship), origin, residence or migration history, legal status, descent and ethnicity (Kraler et al., 2015, pp. 50 – 51).|$|R
40|$|The {{non-energy}} use {{of fossil fuels}} {{is a source of}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions that is not negligible and has been increasing substantially in the last three decades. Current emission estimates for this source category are subject to major uncertainties. One important reason is that {{non-energy use}} as published in energy statistics is not defined in a consistent manner, rendering calculation results based on these data incomparable across countries (concerns in particular the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Reference Approach). Further reasons are the complexity and interlinkage of the energy and material flows in the chemical/petrochemical sector and the current use of storage fractions as default values in the IPCC Reference Approach, which are based on a different definition of storage and refer to other flows than those available from energy statistics. Several other shortcomings of the IPCC Reference Approach are identified in this paper, e. g. the fact that it neglects international trade of synthetic organic products. In order to improve emissions accounting, the Non-Energy Use and CO 2 Emissions (NEU-CO 2) network developed a model called Non-Energy Use Emission Accounting Tables (NEAT), which is based on Material Flow Analysis (MFA). The NEAT model and other MFA approaches have been applied to several countries. In this paper, the results for Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands and the USA are compared with the values published in National Communications to the United Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It is shown that the international harmonisation of the data sources (energy statistics) and the methods appliedwould lead to substantially different emissions results for some countries, in the order of several percent. Moreover, the NEAT model and the other MFA have proved to be a valuable tool to identify errors in energy statistics. These results confirm the need for enhanced efforts to improve and <b>harmonise</b> energy <b>statistics</b> and estimation methods for CO 2 emissions from non-energy use. The articles in this special issue contribute to reaching these goals...|$|R
40|$|Data Offices (ECCB) brings {{together}} central banks, statistical offices and similar institutions within the European Union which maintain significant databases of financial statements of non-financial companies. The {{objective of the}} ECCB is to interchange viewpoints {{in order to improve}} the analytical methods of company accounting data in various fields, in particular for statistical and credit rating purposes. In co-operation with the European Commission the ECCB provides the BACH Database, which is publicly available and contains <b>harmonised</b> financial statements <b>statistics.</b> In addition the ECCB administers the European Sectoral Reference database. The research of the Own Funds Working Group of the ECCB has been dedicated since its creation in 1993 on the subject of equity and financial structures of European corporations. Since the databases include small, medium-sized and large companies, the study group is able to extend the analyses far beyond listed corporations. The central banks of France, Germany and Spain as well as the Italian Centrale dei Bilanci are members of the group. « Net Worth at Risk » is the third study of the Own Funds Working Group. In this research project, the concept of Net Worth at Risk is developed which analyses the function of equity as a protective buffer in a recession period. The equity levels of French, German, Italian and Spanish corporations in manufacturing are compared to potential losses, which might affect a corporation with a small but specified degree of probability (worst-case scenario) in a recession. An examination of size effects as well as an analysis of selected sub-sectors of manufacturing industry complete the study...|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} has made tackling health inequalities one of its top priorities. This article investigates spatial variations in mortality {{in the region and}} demonstrates that whilst life expectancy is rising, mortality disparities are widening. Patterns of health across the United Kingdom are well known with areas in Scotland, Wales and the North East of England consistently found to experience the worst levels of health. In contrast to this, southern England and especially areas in the South East experience the best levels of health. This broad regional analysis does not provide information {{on the extent to which}} health inequalities operate at finer spatial scales. In this article, we consider trends in health inequalities within Yorkshire and the Humber at the ward and district scales (including Unitary Authorities) by looking at mortality disparities. Our research compares two periods, 1990 - 1992 and 1996 - 1998, using levels of inequality experienced by the whole population but also by different demographic and social groups. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and life expectancy at birth have been calculated and used as indicators of health status. SMRs are death rates adjusted to remove the influence of age structure. To calculate the SMRs and life expectancy statistics, annual mortality figures and mid-year populations at risk have been averaged over three years to account for yearly variation in the data. Townsend deprivation scores have been used to quantify deprivation in 1991, whilst the DETR / DTLR Index of Multiple Deprivation 2000 was used to quantify deprivation in 1998. All the results are presented for 1998 geographical boundaries, with all <b>statistics</b> <b>harmonised</b> to this standard year. INTRA-REGIONAL MORTALIT...|$|R
40|$|External {{statistics}} – specifically {{balance of}} payments and international investment position statistics – are among the primary statistics on which policy-making bodies and markets rely {{as a basis for}} their decisions in globalised economies. Monitoring and enhancing data quality in the context of rapidly changing economies impose heavy constraints on compilers of these statistics. As it becomes increasingly important worldwide to adhere to a set of international statistical standards in order to ensure the comparability of statistics, the elaboration of meaningful EU/ euro area aggregates hinges critically on attaining a high degree of homogeneity across countries’ contributions. In addition to offering their own value for analysis, the euro area external statistics are the main source for the compilation of the rest-of-the-world account in the quarterly euro area (financial and nonfinancial) accounts. Bearing this in mind, a lot has been achieved since the inception of the euro area to harmonise concepts and definitions in line with international statistical standards, to review the data collection and compilation systems, as well as to enhance the overall data quality. However, asymmetries 1 both across euro area countries and with counterparts elsewhere still need to be overcome. Additionally, new challenges lie ahead for compilers of statistics, with the steady process of globalisation and the increasing role of financial innovation (in terms of both new instruments and new institutional vehicles) observed in financial markets. While the compilation of euro area statistics continues to be based on country contributions, which are mostly derived from national collection systems in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, common tools are built up and maintained by the European Central Bank and national compilers. In particular, the Centralised Securities Database is playing a pivotal role in the move towards security-by-security reporting and should greatly enhance the quality of security-related information, i. e. portfolio investment flows, stocks and income. The tremendous work of European statisticians towards producing <b>harmonised</b> euro area <b>statistics</b> that are fit for purpose has also benefited statisticians elsewhere and is playing {{an important role in the}} current updating of international standards (the 1993 System of National Accounts and the International Monetary Fund’s Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition). Statisticians have worked in close cooperation in various European fora to clarify concepts and identify best practices with a view to enhancing data quality and reducing the reporting burden. This paper aims to make this experience widely available. ...|$|R
