5|$|The University of Virginia has a {{large number}} of social fraternities.

5|$|Behind {{schedule}} and over-budget, the production crew struggled to complete production {{in time for}} the already-announced premiere <b>date</b> <b>that</b> October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40–50 feet (12–15m) of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6am shoot and crashed the car. The actress's face was bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while the facial contusions healed.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, Lympne {{was to be}} the {{destination}} for the landing of an aircraft carrying Adolf Hitler in a daring kidnap plot. A {{man by the name of}} Kiroff had given information to the British Military Attaché in Sofia, Bulgaria, that he was the brother-in-law of Hans Baur, the personal pilot of Hitler. He stated that Baur was planning to defect using Hitler's Focke-Wulf Fw 200 with him on board. The RAF made plans to receive the aircraft at Lympne and 25 March was the <b>date</b> <b>that</b> the defection was expected to occur. Baur did not defect and spent the war as Hitler's personal pilot. A few weeks later Rudolph Hess defected to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In short, an Indian cannot today gain a {{right of}} {{occupancy}} simply by occupying public land, as the Indians did in Cramer. Under current law, that occupancy could {{not be viewed as}} undertaken with the implied consent of the government, as was the occupancy in Cramer. We therefore conclude that any individual occupancy rights acquired by the Danns must have had their inception prior to November 26, 1934, the <b>date</b> <b>that</b> the lands in question were withdrawn from entry by Executive Order No. 6910.|$|E
5|$|In the southwest, Ecgberht was {{defeated}} in 836 at Carhampton by the Danes, but in 838 he won a battle against them and their allies the West Welsh at the Battle of Hingston Down in Cornwall. The Dumnonian royal line continued after this time, but {{it is at this}} <b>date</b> <b>that</b> the independence of one of the last British kingdoms may be considered to have ended. The details of Anglo-Saxon expansion into Cornwall are quite poorly recorded, but some evidence comes from place names. The river Ottery, which flows east into the Tamar near Launceston, appears to be a boundary: south of the Ottery the placenames are overwhelmingly Cornish, whereas to the north they are more heavily influenced by the English newcomers.|$|E

5|$|It {{continued}} to organize {{throughout the day}} on June21, developing banding features and increased convection. Several hours after being classified a depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it received the name Andres. Upon being named, Andres marked latest <b>date</b> <b>that</b> the first named storm of a season developed since 1969 when Tropical Storm Ava developed on July1 of that year. By the morning of June22, very deep thunderstorm activity existed near the center, and the overall convective pattern had become more symmetric in nature. Favorable conditions, warm sea surface temperatures, allowed Andres to gradually intensify as it tracked near the Mexican coastline. However, strong wind shear, a factor that generally weakens tropical cyclones, {{had little effect on}} the developing storm.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} when exactly Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. Juliet's nurse {{refers to an}} {{earthquake}} she says occurred 11 years ago. This may refer to the Dover Straits earthquake of 1580, which would <b>date</b> <b>that</b> particular line to 1591. Other earthquakes—both in England and in Verona—have been proposed {{in support of the}} different dates. But the play's stylistic similarities with A Midsummer Night's Dream and other plays conventionally dated around 1594–95, place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595. One conjecture is that Shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595.|$|E
