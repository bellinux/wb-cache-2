2500|$|Although, most {{elephant}} {{guns are}} equipped with open sights the typical Weatherby Mark V rifle chambered for the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum does not come equipped with open sights. Instead they are <b>drilled</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapped</b> for scope mounts. The cartridge’s performance even at [...] leaves enough energy necessary to bring down large dangerous thick skinned game. At these ranges, telescopic sights have a greater advantage than open sights. The stock itself is designed for {{with the intent of}} providing the shooter a higher line of sight which is consistent with the use of telescopic sights.|$|E
2500|$|Electric motors {{became so}} common that Singer made {{provision}} for them: the model 127/128 'modernized' versions included mounting lugs for a motor, whereas earlier models {{had to be}} <b>drilled</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapped.</b> [...] Some 127/128 machines were even given motors right at the factory, and of those, a few models used a smaller lighter solid handwheel instead of the larger heavier spoked handwheel used on machines sold as treadles. [...] The spoked handwheel is better for treadles because its larger inertia keeps it spinning longer, whereas the lighter solid handwheel is better for motors because its smaller inertia causes it to start and stop more quickly.|$|E

2500|$|Models 27 and 28 do {{not have}} a motor mount {{hardpoint}}; the hardpoint appeared later on the models 127 and 128. [...] Without a hardpoint, screw holes must be manually <b>drilled</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapped</b> into the pillar for the motor mounting bolts. [...] Unfortunately there is not a standard location for these screw holes, and so the add-on motor can be mounted anywhere within a two-inch range on the pillar. [...] Consequently, the belt race length can vary from the standard race lengths of the 127 and 128. [...] If it does vary, then the standard Singer V belts can be too long or too short. [...] In that case a stretch belt (good over a range of several inches) will suffice instead.|$|E
60|$|E2's gun did {{its best}} to knock the heart out of them all. She had to shift the wretched thing twice; once because the bolts that held it down were smashed (the wire hawser must have pretty well pulled it off its seat), and again because the hull beneath it leaked on pressure. She went down to make sure of it. But she <b>drilled</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapped</b> and adjusted, till {{in a short time}} the gun worked again and killed steamers as it should. Meanwhile, the whole boat leaked. All the plates under the old gun-position forward leaked; she leaked aft through damaged {{hydroplane}} guards, and on her way home they had to keep the water down by hand pumps while she was diving through the nets. Where she did not leak outside she leaked internally, tank leaking into tank, so that the petrol got into the main fresh-water supply and the men had to be put on allowance. The last pint was served out {{when she was in the}} narrowest part of the Narrows, a place where one's mouth may well go dry of a sudden.|$|E

40|$|Various options {{have been}} {{introduced}} for the selection of implant overdenture attachments. Attachment wear due to the repeated insertion and removal of dentures has caused problems such as decreased retention and the requirement for suprastructure remanufacturing. In these cases, a Locator bar system was applied using the <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapping</b> technique to achieve total retrievability. In a 55 -year-old female patient who showed three degrees of mobility in most of her teeth due to severe alveolar bone loss, a complete denture in the maxilla and an implant supported type overdenture in the mandible were planned after extracting all the remaining teeth. Six implants were placed from canine region to the distal molar region, and the locator {{was connected to the}} milled bar using the <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapping</b> technique. For a 61 -year-old female edentulous patient who complained of poor retention with old denture, a complete denture in the maxilla and an implant-tissue supported type overdenture in the mandible were planned. Four implants were placed in front of mental foramen, and the Locator was also connected to the Hader bar using the <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapping</b> technique. With this technique, female parts can be easily replaced, and retention can be continuously maintained...|$|R

5000|$|The current {{high-end}} model, the Mk III 22/45 Lite, {{was introduced}} at the 2012 SHOT Show. The main features include a light-weight aluminum upper receiver, material reduction {{on the upper}} receiver for enhanced appearance and further weight savings, a steel barrel that has been threaded ½"-28 for a compensator or suppressor, and user replaceable grips. Finally, the receiver of the Lite model is <b>drilled</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapped</b> for a Weaver rail section included in the packaging.|$|E
50|$|Whether manual or automatic, the {{processing}} of tapping begins with forming (usually by <b>drilling)</b> <b>and</b> slightly countersinking a hole to a diameter somewhat smaller than the tap's major diameter. The correct hole diameter may be determined by consulting a <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> <b>tap</b> size chart, a standard reference item found in many machine shops. If the hole is to be drilled, the proper diameter is called the tap drill size.|$|R
40|$|Surgical <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> pin {{insertion}} {{can lead}} to mechanical and thermic damage of the bone. A methodology giving reproducible in vitro records of insertion and holding parameters of threaded implants is presented. Both <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapping</b> {{are related to the}} cutting technology. To understand the basic principles of the cutting technology some important parameters of <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapping</b> of an external fixation pin are defined. A bone model was selected based on specific mechanical and thermal properties of the bone tissue. In addition, a specific instrumentation was designed in order to compare the insertion characteristics and the anchorage of different pins. Electronic scanning microscopy of the samples was systematically performed to evaluate the quality of the bone thread. The in vitro measurements of the shearing torque and the pull-out force are representative of the immediate holding power of a pin. The different holding parameters were then correlated. Temperature measurements were performed during drilling, smooth part penetration (transfixing pins), <b>tapping,</b> <b>and</b> screwing. The final objective {{of the study was to}} develop new threaded implants with better biomechanical characteristics. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5000|$|As {{the name}} implies, it was {{designed}} as a utility firearm to be used around hunting camps for foraging or defense. It was made in 9mm Parabellum and [...]45 ACP calibers and can use the same magazines as popular handguns in those calibers, in keeping with a convenient American tradition of having a carbine and handgun using common ammunition. The carbine operates by direct blowback. Usually, the receiver is <b>drilled</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapped</b> for a scope mount. The stock was made of walnut-finished Maine birch.|$|E
40|$|The use of minimum {{quantity}} lubrication (MQL) machining, i. e. <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapping</b> {{of aluminum}} <b>and</b> magnesium alloys using very low quantities of cutting fluids was studied and the MQL machining performance {{was compared to}} dry and conventional flooded conditions. An experimental drilling station with an MQL system was built to measure torque and thrust force responses. Uncoated and diamond- like carbon (DLC) coated HSS drills were tested against 319 Al and AZ 91 alloys using 10 - 50 ml/h of distilled water (H 2 O-MQL) and a fatty acid based MQL agent (FA-MQL). The results indicated that H 2 O-MQL {{used in conjunction with}} non-hydrogenated DLC (NH-DLC) coatings reduced the average torque and thrust-force compared to dry cutting and achieved a performance comparable with conventional flooded drilling. At least 103 holes could be drilled using NH-DLC in H 2 O-MQL and uncoated HSS in FAMQL in drilling of both 319 Al and AZ 91. MQL <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapping</b> provided a stable machining performance, which was evident from the uniform torque and force patterns and also resulted in desirable hole surface, thread quality and chip segments. The maximum temperature generated in the workpiece during MQL machining was lower than that observed in dry <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tapping,</b> <b>and</b> comparable to flooded conditions. The mechanical properties of the material adjacent to drilled holes, as evaluated through plastic strain and hardness measurements, revealed a notable softening in case of dry drilling, with magnesium alloys exhibiting a recrystallized grain zone, but not for MQL <b>drilling.</b> Softened aluminum <b>and</b> magnesium promoted adhesion to the tools resulted built-up edge formation and consequently high torques and thrust-forces were generated. NH-DLC coatings low COF in H 2 O-MQL against 319 Al (0. 10) and AZ 91 (0. 12) compared to uncoated HSS (0. 63 and 0. 65) limited the temperature increase during NHDLC in H 2 O-MQL <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> hence both torques and thrust forces were effectively reduced...|$|R
