These types of interference are closely examined and their realization in the MATLAB programming environment is characterized. The SPIHT algorithm is introduced and the possibilities of its use are discussed. Futher, the application of this algorithm to the ECG signal containing individual types of interference generated by means of the designed <b>interference</b> <b>generator</b> is described and the impact of the SPIHT algorithm on the specific types of signal interference is analyzed. Finally, the obtained results are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, we have {{witnessed}} a proliferation of wireless technologies and devices operating in the unlicensed bands. The resulting escalation of wireless demand has put enor-mous pressure on available spectrum. This raises {{a unique set of}} communication challenges, notably co-existence, Cross Technology Interference (CTI), and fairness amidst high un-certainty and scarcity of interference-free channels. Conse-quently, there is a strong need for understanding and debug-ging the performance of existing wireless protocols and sys-tems under various patterns of interference. Therefore, we need to augment testbeds with tools that can enable repeat-able generation of realistic interference patterns. This would primarily facilitate wireless coexistence research experimen-tation. The heterogeneity of the existing wireless devices and protocols operating in the unlicensed bands makes in-terference hard to model. Meanwhile, researchers working on wireless coexistence generally use interference generated from various radio appliances. The lack of a systematic way of controlling these appliances makes it inconvenient to run experiments, particularly in remote testbeds. In this pa-per, we present a Controlled <b>Interference</b> <b>Generator</b> (CIG) framework for wireless networks. In the design of CIG, we consider a unified approach that incorporates a careful se-lection of interferer technologies (implemented in software), to expose networks to realistic interference patterns. We validate the resemblance of interference generated by CIG and interference from represented RF devices, by showing the accuracy in temporal and spectral domains...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the frame}} of the GARTEur working group AD AG 18, the model TWIG/D 750 has been built by DLR Göttingen. It is a generic fighter model, and the name TWIG means Tunnel Wall <b>Interference</b> <b>Generator.</b> The letter D then means "Deutschland", and 750 refers to the spanwidth of 750 mm. Except the scale, this model is {{identical}} with the model TWIG/NL 300 - where NL means "The Netherlands" - named according to the conventions above. Force measurements have been performed with the Dutch model TWIG/NL 300 in the pilot-HST, and also in the HST, in the latter case providing a set of nearly interference-free force results. The model TWIG/D 750 in the test section of the TWG can not be regarded as interference-free, because of its size: the relative span is b/B = 0. 750 (!). Force measurements in the adaptive test section of the TWG will be reported. The residual wall interferences are computed by making use of the DLR wall pressure method applying Green's theorem. Corrections of force data will be made according to AGARDographs 109 and 336. The influence of the support, which has been used when generating the reference data with the model TWIG/NL 300 in the HST, has been investigated by using different support configurations with the model TWIG/D 750 in TWG, in 1997. For the measurements, which have been performed in February 2001, the model TWIG/NL 300 has been used, and three different support configurations. A comparison with the nearly interference-free results from HST is made. This work was performed within {{the frame of}} DNW research support "Analysis of TWIG wall interference measurements in TWG"...|$|E
40|$|Test {{measurements}} such as EVM and ORFS for transmission {{tests as}} well as Minimum Input Level Sensitivity and Adjacent Channel Rejection for receiving tests are required by WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) standards. For such complex tests {{it is hard to}} find a system on the market to meet the requirements. A pure hardware test solution consisting of connecting a number of test instruments such as signal <b>generators,</b> channel emulators, <b>interference</b> <b>generators,</b> signal analyzers, and receiver testers is very expensive and difficult to be configured to meet the standard. Although some virtual analyzers in the current market can extend functionality for some basic test equipment this is not enough to meet the requirements for this type of complex testing.

40|$|The Tracking Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) {{provides}} single access {{forward and}} return communication {{links with the}} Shuttle/Orbiter via S-band and Ku-band frequency bands. The ESTL (Electronic Systems Test Laboratory) at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) utilizes a TDRS satellite simulator and critical TDRS ground hardware for test operations. To accomplish Orbiter/TDRSS relay communications performance testing in the ESTL, a satellite simulator was developed which met the specification requirements of the TDRSS channels utilized by the Orbiter. Actual TDRSS ground hardware unique to the Orbiter communication interfaces was procured from individual vendors, integrated in the ESTL, and interfaced via a data bus for control and status monitoring. This paper discusses the satellite simulation hardware in terms of early development and subsequent modifications. The TDRS ground hardware configuration and the complex computer interface requirements are reviewed.

40|$|A special GSM mobile {{radio system}} (GSM-R) is {{currently}} operated for radio-based transmission in the railway sector. Today, this technology reaches its performance limits, particularly at highly frequented railway station areas.

40|$|Methods for {{accurate}} grinding of face-hobbed bevel gears {{have not been}} developed to date, the main obstacles being their epicycloidal lengthwise tooth curve and slot width taper. Grinding them while preserving their geometry would be desirable, as the epicycloidal tooth curve makes face-hobbed gears less sensitive to misalignments and deflections. To this end, we propose a method based on a flared-cup grinding wheel, whereby generated members are ground by a two-parameter enveloping process, while non-generated ones are finished by a one-parameter enveloping motion. Machine motions are synthesized exploiting the capabilities of 6 -axis hypoid <b>generators.</b> <b>Interference</b> between parts is avoided...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{measurements}} of stable Se isotopic signatures by multi-collector {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) are very challenging, due {{to the presence of}} spectral interferences and the low abundance of Se in environmental samples. We systematically investigated the effect of methane addition on the signal of selenium and its interferences. It {{is the first time that}} the effect of methane addition has been assessed for all Se isotopes and its potential <b>interferences</b> using hydride <b>generator</b> multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HG-MC-ICP-MS). Our results show that a small methane addition increases the sensitivity. However, the response differs between a hydride generator and a standard introduction system, which might be related to differences in the ionization processes. Both argon and hydrogen based interferences, the most common spectral interferences on selenium isotopes in HG-MC-ICP-MS, decrease with increasing methane addition. Therefore analyte-interference ratios and precision are improved. Methane addition has thus a high potential for the application to stable Se isotopes ratios by HG-MC-ICP-MS...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the high}} quality and high {{productivity}} in fabrication of freeform optics has been of primary interest in manufacturing industries, such as die and mould manufacturing, aerospace part manufacturing, and so forth. However, the fabrication of freeform optics is currently expensive and vastly complex. Ultra-precision raster milling can produce non-rotational symmetric surfaces with sub-micrometric form accuracy and nanometric surface finish {{without the need for}} any subsequent post polishing. While, there is little research work focus on this kind of machining method. This paper presents a framework of a tool path generation system for freeform surface ultra-precision raster milling.

40|$|At the Division of Electricity at Uppsala University {{there is}} an {{experimental}} rig for hydroelectric generators. The experimental rig’s vital part is a 12 -pole synchronous machine, whose electrical characterizing parameters (resistances, inductances and time constants) are unknown. The aim of this thesis is to characterize the machine in its current state by perform a Standstill Frequency Response (SSFR) test. From {{the analysis of the}} measurement data, which {{is a part of the}} test, a set of basic parameters have been received. Based on this set of basic parameters a mathematical model has been matched to fit the measurement data so that the last unknown parameters could be obtained. The result of the analysis and fit gave a set of parameters. The set of parameters resulted in a more or less good fit to the measurement data. It has been shown that even though the parameters are based on the generator itself it does not necessarily give the best fit. As a verification of the parameters, which has been received from the test, further work is needed by implementing the parameters into a dynamic model and then compare that model with measured responses from electrical or mechanical <b>interference</b> of the <b>generator...</b>|$|R
40|$|Dissertation (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a data collection system for a small unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight. The following three facets comprise of a UAV system: (1) a UAV aircraft; (2) onboard avionics; and (3) a ground control station subsystem (Taha et al., 2010 : 1). In this project, the UAV aircraft is based on the low-cost autonomous quad-rotator system named “Arducopter Quad”, where the onboard avionic system utilizes both an ArduPilot Mega (APM) on-board controller and IMU sensor shield, while the “Mission Planner” software operates as GCS software to gather essential flight data (Xiang & Tian, 2011 : 176). The approach provides the UAV system structure and both hardware and software with a small UAV data collection system, which is examined throughout the study. And introduce the concept of Arducopter dynamics for better understanding with its flight control. The study also considers the communication process between the UAV and the ground control station. The radio wave is an important aspect in the UAV data collection system (Austin, 2010 : 143). The literature review introduced the basis of the radio wave in respect of its travelling speed, and its characteristics of propagation, including how different frequencies will affect radio wave propagation. The aim of this project was to develop a platform for a small UAV real-time data collection system. The pendulum system was involved to simulate the “Roll” movement of the small UAV, while real-time IMU sensor data was successfully collected at ground control station (GCS), both serial communication and wireless communication, which was applied in the data collection process. The microwave <b>generator</b> <b>interference</b> test proves that the 2. 4 GHz XBee module is capable of establishing reliable indoor communication between the APM controller and the GCS. The work of this project is towards development of additional health monitoring technology to prevent the safety issue of the small UAV. The data collection system can be used as basis for the future research of real-time health monitoring for various small UAVs...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators {{are widely}} used and often {{encountered}} in urology practices worldwide. Safety and performance during electrosurgery, {{extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy}}, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and radiotherapy are not clearly defined. We reviewed the literature on their use and implications in urological practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a PubMed® search and all relevant articles were studied to understand the basic functioning of these devices along with the technological advances designed to reduce electromagnetic interference. RESULTS A modern permanent pacemaker is comprised of a generator and leads connecting to the atrial or ventricular myocardium with sensing and pacing functions. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators respond to episodes of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation by discharging a defibrillating current. From a device perspective, several protective mechanisms have been developed in the permanent pacemaker/implantable cardioverter defibrillator to reduce the effects of electromagnetic <b>interference.</b> These involve <b>generator</b> material changes, lead modification, and better sensing and pacing algorithms. Magnetic resonance imaging compatible pacemakers have now been developed and are approved for use in Europe. From a urologist's perspective 5 procedures require the close monitoring of permanent pacemaker/implantable cardioverter defibrillator function. 1) For electrosurgery modifications in the device and in the methods of use have been recommended. 2) For extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy the European Association of Urology provides some guidance with regard to patients with these devices. 3) During positron emission tomography the pulse generator and the lead area should be covered with lead to protect the device. 4) Magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated but currently trials are under way for a new pacing system for safe use in the magnetic resonance imaging environment. 5) Patients can undergo radiotherapy with standard precautions but those with an abdominal permanent pacemaker/implantable cardioverter defibrillator require careful planning. Finally, implanted devices should have a full evaluation before and after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS Clear guidelines are essential given the rapid advances in technology to enhance patient safety. Magnetic resonance imaging should be avoided in patients without a magnetic resonance imaging compatible device. However, patients can undergo extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, radiotherapy and positron emission tomography as long as the device is not in the path...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} project SIAM {{aimed at the}} development of integrated microwave circuits from HTS components for use in mobile communication base stations. Key aspects of future digital cellular phone systems are an increased capacity (number of participants per area) and a reduced power level for signal transmission. Towards these goals, a simple operational prototype system of an adaptive superconducting receiver circuit was designed and developped. The chronology of the project consisted of three phases. Phase 1 : a first version of a superconducting microwave circuit was fabricated from 3 diameter 1 '' HTS films. It consisted of a two-stage planar hybrid coupler serving as a beamforming network for two linear tapered slot antennas, and of two frequency multiplexers for spectral analysis. Each multiplexer was built from two identical lumped-element bandpass filters (center frequency 5 GHz, bandwidth 1 %) and two planar hybrids in series. The main functional characteristics of this demonstrator were presented at ISIS 3 in May 1994. The desired signal (here: a music transmission) was discriminated from unwanted <b>interferences</b> (here: noise <b>generator)</b> by analyzing their different spectral power distribution (signal: narrow-band, interference: 2 - 8 GHz). The angle of incidence of the interfering signal was determined. The radiation pattern of the antenna system was then adapted to the optimum signal-interference power-ratio by adjusting two external phase shifters (SIAM I). Phase 2 : a miniaturized (lumped-element) version (SIAM Ia) of the previously demonstrated circuit was fabricated from a single diameter 1 '' YBCO-film. Its operation {{was presented at the}} Hannover fair 'Industrie' in April 1995. Real-time adaptation of the radiation pattern was obtained by tuning the carrier frequency of the desired signal and by using dispersive circuit components. Furthermore, a compact high-Q HTS resonator was constructed which enabled a 100 fold higher power handling capability compared to usual filter designs. A laboratory version was fabricated from diameter 1 '' HTS films. This concept is suited for the construction of narrowbandwidth transmitter combiner filters. Phase 3 : an advanced {{research project}} was developed according to the results of the two preceding phases and to the overall progress in HTS technology. It takes into account realistic system requirements as well as the specific properties of HTS. It aimes at the design and development of an advanced superconducting subsystem for adaptive mobile communication base stations. (orig.)
