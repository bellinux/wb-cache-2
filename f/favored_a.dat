5|$|Smith <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> strong {{central bank}} and high tariffs to protect American {{business}} and agriculture. He disfavored imprisonment of convicts except for murder, preferring efforts to reform criminals through labor; he also opposed courts-martial for military deserters. He supported capital punishment but opposed hanging, preferring execution by firing squad or beheading.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of nine-man baseball teams, Adams <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> measure in 1856 which allowed for players {{from outside the}} Knickerbockers to join their intrasquad games when 17 or fewer team members appeared. No rules existed at the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13–11 vote, {{in favor of a}} rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).|$|E
5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial {{issue at}} the time was the protective tariff. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.|$|E
5000|$|A {{critique}} of liberalism: CRT scholars <b>favor</b> <b>a</b> more aggressive approach to social transformation {{as opposed to}} liberalism's more cautious approach, <b>favor</b> <b>a</b> race-conscious approach to transformation rather than liberalism's embrace of color blindness, and <b>favor</b> <b>an</b> approach that relies more on political organizing, in contrast to liberalism's reliance on rights-based remedies.|$|R
25|$|TFA State {{policy debate}} tends to <b>favor</b> <b>a</b> {{multitude}} of off-case arguments and teams that <b>favor</b> <b>a</b> progressive style; while UIL State {{tends to be}} more policy focused.|$|R
50|$|The {{binding energy}} <b>favors</b> <b>a</b> {{smoother}} surface that minimizes {{the number of}} dangling bonds, while the surface entropy term <b>favors</b> <b>a</b> rougher surface with increasing dangling bonds as the temperature is increased.|$|R
5|$|Greece's mountainous terrain <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> {{defensive}} {{strategy and}} the high ranges of the Rhodope, Epirus, Pindus and Olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities. However, air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many defiles. Although an invading force from Albania could be stopped by {{a relatively small number}} of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern part of the country was difficult to defend against an attack from the north.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Northrop Grumman {{proposed}} a YF-23-based bomber {{to meet a}} USAF need for an interim bomber, for which the FB-22 and B-1R were also competing. Northrop modified aircraft PAV-2 {{to serve as a}} display model for its proposed interim bomber. The possibility of a YF-23-based interim bomber ended with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, which <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> long-range bomber with much greater range. The USAF has since moved on to the Next-Generation Bomber program.|$|E
5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
50|$|The {{islands are}} a popular surfing destination, {{specifically}} Bawa Island, and nearby Asu Island. The waves at Bawa <b>favor</b> <b>a</b> northwest {{wind and the}} waves at Asu <b>favor</b> <b>a</b> southeast wind. The two islands are approximately 45 minutes apart by speedboat.|$|R
5000|$|Most Fox News viewers favor both parental {{notification}} {{as well as}} parental consent, when a minor seeks an abortion. A Fox News poll in 2005 {{found that}} 78% of people <b>favor</b> <b>a</b> notification requirement, and 72% <b>favor</b> <b>a</b> consent requirement.|$|R
3000|$|... (z*)] 2 term <b>favors</b> <b>a</b> {{solution}} {{with lower}} objective function value while the -ρ║ z - z *║ 2 term <b>favors</b> <b>a</b> solution {{far away from}} z*. Combining the effects, the discrete filled function <b>favors</b> <b>a</b> solution whose objective function value is not too much {{greater than that of}} z* and at a considerable distance away from z*. The idea is to direct its search towards the direction with the least increase in the objective function value.|$|R
5|$|Later in his career, Ford {{split with}} Huddleston's successor, Mitch McConnell, over a {{proposed}} settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies. Ford favored the package as presented to Congress, {{which would have}} protected the price support program, while McConnell <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> smaller aid package to tobacco farmers {{and an end to}} the price support program. Both proposals were ultimately defeated, and the rift between Ford and McConnell never healed.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting the {{tendency}} in the Third Reich to have several rival agencies {{operating in the}} same field, {{a number of new}} organizations emerged in the diplomatic field that competed with the Auswärtiges Amt. The most important of the rivals of the Auswärtiges Amt was the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, which was the rival foreign office headed by Joachim von Ribbentrop that operated its own foreign policy in direct competition with the Auswärtiges Amt. Neurath <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> pro-Chinese policy whereas Ribbentrop <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> pro-Japanese policy. In the summer of 1935, Ribbentrop and his friend, the Japanese military attache to Germany General Hiroshi Ōshima, {{came up with a plan}} to square the circle between Germany having to choose between Japan or China, and bring China into the Japanese sphere of influence by devising a plan for anti-Communist alliance that would unite Germany, China and Japan together. This was the origin of what become the Anti-Comintern Pact, but the Ribbentrop-Ōshima plan was vetoed in November 1935 jointly by the Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath and by the War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg , who told Hitler that the Chinese would never join this proposed alliance, and that on economic grounds China had much more to offer Germany than did Japan.|$|E
5|$|Shoup <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> more frugal {{approach}} to the military budget, feeling the military was too susceptible to influence from large corporations arguing for expensive and unnecessary programs. As the Kennedy administration brought more emphasis on conventional warfare, Shoup sought to use increased funds to improve military logistics. He is credited with formulating an entirely new system of financial management, supply, and inventory management. He also created a new Data Processing Division to centralize the data processing functions of several combat service support branches.|$|E

50|$|Managers' {{personal}} {{preferences and}} styles <b>favor</b> <b>a</b> large span.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the denomination's existence, {{theological}} battles were {{fought over}} how the Confession of Faith would be interpreted. During the 19th century, Old School Presbyterians insisted that the Confession be interpreted according to strict Calvinism, while the New School Presbyterians <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> looser interpretation. From 1910 to 1927, the Confession of Faith was officially interpreted with reference to five fundamental beliefs: biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection, and the miracles of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Japanese would strike at Port Moresby again, the {{garrison}} was strengthened and MacArthur ordered {{the establishment of}} new bases at Merauke and Milne Bay to cover its flanks. The Battle of Midway in June 1942 led to consideration of a limited offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur's proposal for {{an attack on the}} Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the Navy, which <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> less ambitious approach, and objected to an Army general being in command of what would be an amphibious operation. The resulting compromise called for a three-stage advance. The first stage, the seizure of the Tulagi area, would be conducted by the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. The later stages would be under MacArthur's command.|$|E
5|$|Capodacqua of La Repubblica {{believed}} that the route <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> rider that could defend well {{and put in a}} good time during the uphill time trial. La Stampa writer Gianni Ranieri felt the two non-uphill time trials would favor Gianni Bugno, while the up-hill time trial could be a place where Claudio Chiappucci could gain time on the field. Pedro Delgado believed the race to be tougher than the Tour de France that same year. The Cima Coppi – the highest point in altitude the race reached – was scheduled to be the Passo dello Stelvio, but the pass was scrapped from the race and the Passo Pordoi – the next highest mountain – became the new Cima Coppi.|$|E

50|$|The {{main source}} of {{disagreement}} was {{the format of the}} search engine, with German engineers <b>favoring</b> <b>a</b> text-based search engine and the French engineers <b>favoring</b> <b>a</b> multimedia search engine. Many German engineers also balked at what they thought was becoming too much of an anti-Google project, rather than a project driven by its own ideals.|$|R
5|$|During {{the primary}} campaign, two major issues surfaced. First, Waterfield <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> tax on parimutuel betting, while Clements opposed it. Second, Waterfield {{supported}} {{the development of}} electric power generation through public utilities, while Clements favored private development (which won him {{the support of the}} Kentucky Utilities company). The Clements campaign also attacked Waterfield for being deemed physically unfit for military service. Clements received a late boost when he gained the endorsement of John Y. Brown, Sr., garnering added support from organized labor. Ultimately, Clements defeated Waterfield by over 30,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|For decades, {{rebels in}} Cuba had waged an {{intermittent}} campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule. By 1895, the conflict had expanded {{to a war}} for Cuban independence. As war engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher. American public opinion favored the rebels, and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies. However while public opinion called for war to liberate Cuba, McKinley <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> peaceful approach, hoping that through negotiation, Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence, {{or at least to}} allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Payton, {{along with}} many other investors, sought to bring an NFL {{expansion}} team to St. Louis, Missouri, and Payton expressed his interest in becoming the first minority owner in NFL history. Although the NFL strongly <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> franchise in St. Louis, their efforts were thwarted because of internal dissension among the investment group members leading the NFL to award franchises to investment groups in Jacksonville, Florida (Jacksonville Jaguars) and Charlotte, North Carolina (Carolina Panthers). St. Louis eventually received a team when the Los Angeles Rams moved to the city in 1995.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{a debate}} between {{scholars}} over when the book was actually published. One school of thought <b>favors</b> <b>a</b> political interpretation which lends itself to a later publication after {{the founding of the}} Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The second <b>favors</b> <b>a</b> religious interpretation which lends itself to an earlier publication during the late Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).|$|R
5000|$|Webb County {{officials}} <b>favor</b> <b>a</b> site on Mangana-Hein Road {{in southern}} Laredo.|$|R
2500|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{fall into}} one of two main camps: an [...] "early camp" [...] <b>favoring</b> <b>a</b> date for the [...] "core" [...] of between the years 50 and 100, before or approximately contemporary with the composition of the canonical gospels and a [...] "late camp" [...] <b>favoring</b> <b>a</b> date in the 2nd century, after composition of the canonical gospels.|$|R
5|$|Senator Powell favored Kentucky's {{neutrality}} policy {{during the}} Civil War, but nationally, the conflict {{put him in}} a tenuous political situation. On one hand, he <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> strong national government and a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Avenue Northeast {{site for}} the University District's station was {{rejected}} {{in favor of an}} option on Brooklyn Avenue. The placement of the Brooklyn station, either on the north or south side of NE 45th Street, was debated by the Sound Transit Board in 2004. Seattle mayor Greg Nickels <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> station on the north side, but other boardmembers sided with community and business groups who wanted a site on the south side. The station site was further complicated the following year by Safeco's decision to expand its headquarters building {{on the west side of}} Brooklyn Avenue NE, impacting staging areas that were selected by Sound Transit. Ultimately, Safeco moved its headquarters to a downtown building in 2006, and sold the Brooklyn building to the University of Washington, and the staging areas remained available.|$|E
5|$|The RTA, later renamed to Sound Transit, began {{planning}} the routing {{of the light}} rail line and placement of stations in 1998. Sound Transit and the Port of Seattle requested that the line be routed along International Boulevard to serve the airport's hotel area, while other officials {{from the city of}} SeaTac <b>favored</b> <b>a</b> station inside the current Sea-Tac Airport terminal to the west. Sound Transit selected their preferred route for the light rail line in 1999, choosing to serve the Port of Seattle's planned North End Airport Terminal, a multi-modal facility with a direct connection to the airport's Satellite Transit System, and a potential station at South 184th Street to serve the city center.|$|E
50|$|The Federal Republic lasted almost {{twelve years}} with {{constant}} struggles between the main political parties: the Conservatives, landowners and former monarchists, <b>favoring</b> <b>a</b> strong central {{government and a}} confessional state; and the Liberals, republicans <b>favoring</b> <b>a</b> limited government power divided among the federated states and a secular nation. That caused a severe political instability and violence.|$|R
