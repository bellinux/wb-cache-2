5000|$|Respiratory {{equipment}} and dust collection systems {{are also important}} when woodturning or doing any type of woodworking that creates dust. This can range from a simple <b>disposable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>mask,</b> to a full face helmet with built in respirator. Most stand alone respiratory equipment will interfere with dust shields and visors, so devices that incorporate both are available. Many woods create dust that is actually a health hazard. For example, cocobolo (granadillo) dust {{is known to be}} toxic (toxic shock). Many people are sensitive to oils carried in walnut, locust, and oak sawdust. Long term exposure to fine wood dust has also been linked with an increased risk of developing cancer.|$|E
40|$|Possible work {{decrements}} {{caused by}} respirator usage were examined. A battery of physical, cognitive and psychomotor tasks {{were used to}} investigate the effects of respirator wear on twelve subjects. A repeated measures experimental design was used to {{study the effects of}} three types of respirators: a <b>disposable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>mask,</b> an air purifying half-mask and a full-face airline. Performance while wearing a mask was compared to the control condition without a respirator. The psychomotor task test methods appear to be the best indicators of respiratory effects on work performance decrement. A steadiness task showed a 31 % decrement for the full-face respirator. The One-Hole Test, which includes a number of measurement variables, indicated an average movement time decrement of 16 %. The other One-Hole Test indicators also showed decrements, but were lower and not statistically significant. The results from the physical work task of bicycle riding indicated approximately a 10 % increase in oxygen consumption with the half and full face masks, supporting previous physiological findings. The results indicate that the respirators did not significantly affect the performance of cognitive tasks. In general, respirators can be shown to produce an increase in oxygen consumption for physical tasks and decrements in psychomotor performance with regard to hand movement speed and steadiness...|$|E
40|$|Keene State College has a {{voluntary}} use policy {{with respect to}} respiratory protection. This means there are no known job tasks where Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) are exceeded 1. However, if an employee chooses to wear a respirator the College will provide the employee with a respirator for their comfort in accordance with this policy. The following procedures must be followed {{if you choose to}} wear a respirator. Respirators A respirator is a device that protects you from inhaling dangerous substances, such as chemicals and infectious particles. Selecting the right respirator requires an assessment of all the workplace operations, processes or environments that may create a respiratory hazard. There are four main types of respirators: Particulate Respirators only protect against particles (e. g., dust). They do not protect against chemicals, gases, or vapors, and are intended only for low hazard levels. The “N- 95 ” filtering facepiece 2 respirator or “dust mask ” is one type of particulate respirator. Particulate respirators filter out dusts, fumes, and mists, are usually <b>disposable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>masks</b> or respirators with disposable filters, and must be replaced when they become discolored, damaged, or clogged. Chemical Cartridge/Gas Mask Respirators filter or clean chemical gases out of the air as you breathe. This respirator includes a facepiece or mask, a replaceable cartridge or canister to remove the contaminant, and may require more than one cartridge to protect against multiple hazards. They are color coded, {{depending on the type of}} chemical hazard. It is very important to choose the correct type of cartridge to protect you from the chemical hazard you may be exposed to. Powered Air-Purifying Respirators (PAPR) use a fan to draw air through the filter to the user. They use the same type of filters/cartridges as other respirators, but they are easier to breathe through. Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) use their own air tank to supply clean air, so you don’t need to worry about filters. They are commonly used by firefighters and require special training and provide clean air when the air round you is simply too dangerous to breathe. If you do not use a respirator correctly, it is very likely that it will not adequately protect you and may even hurt you...|$|R

50|$|A <b>dust</b> <b>mask</b> is a {{flexible}} pad held over {{the nose and}} mouth by elastic or rubber straps to protect against dusts encountered during construction or cleaning activities, such as dusts from drywall, brick, wood, fiberglass, silica (from ceramic or glass production), or sweeping. A <b>dust</b> <b>mask</b> can also be worn to protect against allergens. A <b>dust</b> <b>mask</b> is worn {{in the same fashion}} as a paint mask or surgical mask, but it is dangerous to confuse the three because they each protect against specific airborne dangers. Using the wrong mask for a job can present a significant and possibly deadly danger as many <b>dust</b> <b>masks</b> with widely varied levels of protection may look similar, and even masks that do not protect against dust at all, such as paint masks and surgical masks. Misfitting masks are also a danger as they allow material to bypass the mask entirely. A correct fit may not be as critical in masks that are intended to protect against splattering liquids or mists. <b>Dust</b> <b>masks</b> are manufactured to protect against only certain dangers, and do not protect against chemicals such as vapors and mists. For this reason, it is dangerous to confuse <b>dust</b> <b>masks</b> with paint masks.|$|R
