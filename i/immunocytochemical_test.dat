40|$|Background: The Fragile X {{syndrome}} {{is the most}} common heritable form of mental retardation. The diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome can be supported by chromosomal and molecular analysis. Fragile X Mental retardation Protein (FMRP) is a protein that involved in mRNA metabolism and found in several tissues with predominant location in cytoplasm. Immunocytochemical study can detect the presence of FMRP in cytoplasm of lymphocytes. Objective: To investigate the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio of <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>test</b> of lymphocytes at peripheral blood smear compared to chromosomal analysis. Material and method : Twenty consecutive samples were obtained from students of special school (SLB) at Semin Gunung Kidul. The inclusions criteria were male > 7 years old, mild to moderate mental retardation, no Down syndrome, no multiple malformation, and no dumbness and deafness. Heparinized peripheral blood samples were cultured in low folate TC 199 and MEM + thymidine media to analyze the expression of fragile sites. The presence of FMRP protein in lymphocyte was analyzed by immunocytochemical techniques using monoclonal antibody against FMRP. Result of <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>test</b> for detecting FMRP expression from lymphocyte in blood smear was tabulated and compared to chromosomal analysis that used as the gold standard. Then, the data was summarized into table 2 x 2 and calculated for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratio. Result : The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value of <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>test</b> were 93, 33...|$|E
40|$|Aims - To {{compare the}} {{haemoglobin}} (Hb) H inclusion test with immunocytochemical detection of embryonic ζ chains in screening for a thalassaemia. Methods - Blood samples from 115 patients with relevant {{clinical history and}} hypochromic microcytic indexes were screened using the HbH inclusion test and the Variant Hemoglobin Testing System (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Results - The HbH inclusion test was positive in 61 of 115 cases, three of whom had HbH disease confirmed by electrophoresis. The remaining 58 had α thalassaemia 1. All three HbH cases and 56 of 58 cases of a thalassaemia 1 expressed embryonic ζ chains, giving a specificity of 96. 7 %. Fifty four of 115 cases had a negative HbH inclusion test, of whom 50 had β thalassaemia trait and three had iron deficiency. No diagnosis was reached for the remaining patient. Conclusion - The <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>test</b> is as sensitive as the HbH inclusion test in screening for a thalassaemia. The presence of ζ chains is highly specific for a thalassaemia I incorporating the ( [...] /SEA) deletion. The specificity and simplicity of the <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>test</b> make it the test of choice in screening for α thalassaemia. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Fine-needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) cytology {{is being}} increasingly employed {{in conjunction with}} physical examination and mammography in the pre-surgical diagnosis of breast nodules. In the present study, we have submitted to multicenter validation an <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>test</b> which employs monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to breast-tumor-associated antigens (BTAA) for the diagnosis of breast cancer. The results of this analysis, which has evaluated 846 FNAs, show that the immunological test has a sensitivity of 88. 62 %, a specificity of 97. 9 % and an accuracy of 92. 4 %. The predictive value of a positive and a negative finding were 98. 4 % and 85. 57 % respectively. Comparison between the cytological and immunocytochemical diagnosis displayed a higher sensitivity, accuracy and predictive value of a negative result with the latter method (p less than 0. 01). Our findings clearly indicate that immunocytochemical methods can complement and improve the diagnostic accuracy of FNA cytology of breast nodules...|$|E

This paper describes a blind study in which inhibition of dimethylbenzanthracene-induced cheek-pouch tumours by a goat liver extract denominated UK 101 was investigated. Less than 40 % of animals treated with UK 101 developed tumours compared with 100 % of the controls. Intermediate results (80 %) were noted in a positive control group treated with Calmette–Guérin bacillus. <b>Immunocytochemical</b> <b>testing</b> of cheek-pouch mucosa by Mib 5 showed significantly less proliferating cells in UK 101 animals than in the controls. The effect of UK 101 was completely reversed when dexamethasone was added in a third control group. A significant difference in complement-mediated cytotoxicity was noted in the sera of UK 101 -tested and control animals.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} indicates that oxytocin (OT), {{in addition to the}} induction of myometrial and myoepithelial cell contraction, can influence proliferation and differentiation in developing mammary glands and in breast cancer cells, hence the interest in detecting and locating OT receptors (OTRs). We produced rabbit antisera and a monoclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxy terminus of the predicted OTR sequence. We tested their specificity in immunoblasts and <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>tests.</b> All of the antibodies specifically stained myometrium (at term of pregnancy). In the human breast, OTRs were detected in myoepithelial cells along ducts of normal lobules and in sclerosing adenosis. Intraductal cells in benign hyperplastic lesions were also positive. OTRs were demonstrated in cases of primary and metastatic carcinomas of the breast. In the same tissues, OTR gene expression was shown by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction procedures detecting the specific mRNA. These results suggest that the interaction between OT and its receptors might {{play a role in the}} origin and evolution of non-neoplastic lesions and carcinomas of the breast...|$|R
40|$|Background. Secondary {{hyperparathyroidism}} (2 HPT) is {{a frequent}} complication of long-term dialysis treat-ment and, despite recent advances in medical therapy, surgical parathyroidectomy (PTX) is required in {{a considerable number of}} uraemic patients. Recently, other modalities of therapy, such as ultrasound-guided percutaneous parathyroid injection of ethanol (PEIT) or of calcitriol (PCIT), have been used to treat refrac-tory 2 HPT. Our objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of these therapeutic modalities and to analyse their effects on parathyroid cell proliferation. Methods. Nineteen haemodialysis patients with severe 2 HPT were studied. Ten underwent PEIT (Group I) and nine underwent PCIT (Group II). After treatment, five patients in each group were submitted to PTX. Parathyroid cell proliferation was appraised at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the study by fine-needle aspiration biopsy, making use of <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>testing</b> for Ki- 67. The surgically removed glands were submitted to histopathological analysis and cellular proliferation was evaluated. Results. Both PEIT and PCIT proved inefficient in controlling 2 HPT.

40|$|Melilotus suaveolens Ledeb is a {{traditional}} medicinal plant for treating inflammation-related disease. This explores the inner anti-inflammatory mechanism of n-butanol extract from M. suaveolens Ledeb. Inflammatory cellular model was established by lipopolysaccharide intervention on RAW 264. 7 cell line. Levels of secreted cytokines TNF-a, IL- 1 b, IL- 6, NO and IL- 10 in supernatant, mRNA expression of TNF-a, COX- 2, iNOS and HO- 1, protein expression of COX- 2 and HO- 1, activation of NF-kB and ingredients in the extract were assayed by ELISA, real time quantitative PCR, western blot, <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>test</b> and HPLC fingerprint test, respectively. As a result, the extract could not only markedly reduce the production of pro-inflammatory mediators to different extents by blocking NF-kB activation but also promote the release of anti-inflammatory mediator HO- 1 significantly. Each 1 g extract contained 0. 023531 mg coumarin and another two high polar ingredients, probably saponins. It can be concluded that the extract has similar effects on antagonizing pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines like Dexamethasone, and has effects on promoting the production of anti-inflammatory mediators...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: A {{cell line}} spontaneously derived from human retinal pigment {{epithelium}} (hRPE) was cultured on alginate film gelatinized with different concentrations of neurobasal cell culture medium (NCCM) to assess its growth and morphological behavior on this naturally occurring polysaccharide. Methods: Neonatal human globes were used to isolate hRPE cells. They were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s‑medium‑and‑Ham’s‑F 12 ‑medium‑(DMEM/F 12) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cultures were continuously studied using phase contrast microscopy. After the nineth passage, cells were characterized through immunocytochemical analysis for Oct 4, Chx 10, and Pax 6 and Ki 67 markers. In each well of a 6 ‑well microplate, 1 and 2 % weight/volume (w/v) alginate in deionized water was added and gelatinized using 1 × and 10 × NCCM. hRPE cells were cultured at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in alginate‑coated microplates. After 5 days, hRPE colonies were harvested and re‑plated on polystyrene substrates. Morphology and growth of hRPE cultures were determined during the next 2 weeks. Results: The first few passages of the cultures were purely hRPE cells that revealed typical morphological features of the pigmented epithelium. They made spaces, devoid of cells, between hRPE cell monolayer and fill in the unoccupied spaces. They grew faster than native RPE cells and rapidly overgrew. <b>Immunocytochemical</b> <b>test</b> revealed that the founded cells expressed Chx 10, Pax 6, Ki 67 and Oct 4. The hRPE cells survived unlimitedly on alginate film and formed giant adjoining colonies. After re‑plating, hRPE colonies adhered quickly on polystyrene and displayed native hRPE morphological features. Conclusion: Alginate film can support the survival and growth of hRPE cells and induce the cells to re‑organize in tissue‑like structures...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Because the cytomorphologic {{examination}} of bone marrow (BM) aspirates appears not sensitive enough to detect residual neuroblastoma cells, two four-color flow cytometric assays using {{different combinations of}} CD 9, CD 81, CD 56, CD 45, and anti-GD 2 were evaluated. METHODS: The sensitivity of the flow cytometric assays was assessed by spiking experiments in normal peripheral blood samples. Twenty-eight BM samples, 12 biopsies, and 3 peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) preparations from 22 patients with neuroblastoma were analyzed. The results were {{compared with those of}} an anti-GD 2 immunocytochemical reference assay. RESULTS: Flow cytometric and immunocytochemical analyses showed residual neuroblastoma cells in four BM samples. One PBSC preparation and 20 BM samples were negative for both assays. Four BM and two PBSC samples scored positive for the immunocytochemical assay but were negative for the flow cytometric tests. This was due to the limited number of cells that were flow cytometrically analyzed. A strong correlation between the flow cytometric and immunocytochemical tests was found (chi 2 = 6. 4, P = 0. 011). CONCLUSIONS: When an equal amount of cells is analyzed, the sensitivity of the flow cytometric assays is to be about 10 times lower than that of the <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>test.</b> However, the flow cytometric assays can be used to screen for residual cells in clinical samples with a sensitivity of one neuroblastoma cell in 10 (4) to 10 (5) normal mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry is simple, quick, and cost effective compared with immunocytochemistry. In addition, the flow cytometric assays can be used to screen for residual neuroblastoma cells in case of a GD 2 -negative primary tumor. Therefore we recommend flow cytometry for the detection of residual neuroblastoma cells...|$|E
40|$|During {{the course}} of colon-rectum tumours a number of {{clinical}} events may occur in which conventional cytopathology can provide only a partial contribution {{to the definition of}} a differential diagnosis, i. e. effusions, distant recurrences and second neoplasias. In the present study we have evaluated whether monoclonal antibody (MoAb) D 612, recognising a colon-rectum associated antigen, can be used in this context. To this end, MoAb D 612 was employed in combination with a panel of MoAb of well defined tumour specificity in <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>tests.</b> The <b>immunocytochemical</b> findings obtained were compared with the histological and clinical diagnosis. Of 62 effusions and 40 fine needle aspirates studied, MoAb D 612 reactivity correlated with the correct diagnosis in 92. 8 % of the instances. These results indicate that this reagent may help to improve the current cytopathological diagnosis of colon-rectum tumours by identifying the colonic origin of metastases in patients with unknown primary tumour, differentiating ovarian carcinoma from colon metastases to the ovaries and establishing the presence of a second neoplasia in patients with a previous history other than colon carcinoma...|$|R

We describe three patients with clinical, biochemical, and microscopic evidence of a peroxisomal disorder. However, their liver displays mosaicism, i. e., parenchymal cells with peroxisomes are adjacent to cells without peroxisomes. Ten percent (volume), 8 %, and less than 1 % of the parenchyma possessed peroxisomes that can be identified in <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>tests</b> for six matrix and membrane proteins performed by light and electron microscopy. In the bulk of the parenchyma, catalase is localized in the cytoplasm, and in such cells no peroxisomes are evident by electron microscopy and immunolabeling for the 43 -kd peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP) in two patients; in the third case, peroxisomal membrane ghosts are present. Immunoblots of peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes show a pattern similar to that from patients with a generalized peroxisomal deficiency.

40|$|PV- 1 {{is a novel}} endothelial protein {{shown by}} <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>tests</b> to be {{specifically}} associated with the stomatal diaphragms of caveolae in lung endothelium. Although the highest expression levels of both mRNA and protein are in the lung, PV- 1 also {{has been found to}} be expressed in other organs. Using a specific antibody to the extracellular domain of PV- 1, we have extended the survey on the presence of this protein at light and electron microscope level in several rat organs. Here we show that by immunofluorescence the antibody recognizes with high specificity the endothelium of the fenestrated peritubular capillaries of the kidney and those of the intestinal villi, pancreas, and adrenals. By immunolocalization at electron microscope level, the antibody recognizes specifically the diaphragms of the fenestrae and the stomatal diaphragms of caveolae and transendothelial channels in the endothelia of these vascular beds. No signal was detected in the continuous endothelium of the heart, skeletal muscle, intestinal muscularis, or brain capillaries or the nondiaphragmed fenestrated endothelium of kidney glomeruli. Taken together, our findings define the only antigen to be localized thus far in fenestral diaphragms. They also show that the stomatal diaphragms of caveolae and transendothelial channels and the fenestral diaphragms might be biochemically related, in addition to being morphologically similar structures...|$|R

Two monoclonal antibodies were used in an indirect immunoenzymatic assay to test 384 samples collected from multiple bone marrow sites during 79 staging procedures in 48 patients. Of 578 <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>tests,</b> 59 (10 %) yielded non-evaluable results. Analysis by individual bone marrow sites showed an agreement between cytological and immunocytochemical examinations in 276 of 309 (89 %) evaluable tests with 5 A 7 and in 179 of 210 (85 %) with UJ 13 A. Infiltration by neuroblastoma cells was reported in 9 % of samples by cytology, in 6 % by immunochemistry with 5 A 7 and in 16 % with 13 A. Analysis of results by staging demonstrated agreement between cytological examination and immunocytochemical detection with both monoclonal antibodies in 60 of 75 (80 %) evaluable stagings. Bone marrow metastasis was detected by cytology in 22 % of stagings, by immunochemistry with 5 A 7 in 23 %, with UJ 13 A in 25 %. Detailed analysis of discordant results revealed that they were related partly to bone marrow sampling variability associated with focal and minimal metastasis of neuroblastoma cells.

40|$|Streptococcal pharyngitis sequel such as Rheumatic Fever (RF) or Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) is an {{autoimmune}} response mediated by T cells and IgG. Since {{it is an}} autoimmune process, the result of bacterial culture as the gold standard of diagnosis often shows negative results. IgG against the 33 kDa OMP is considered as an important mediator {{in the process of}} these autoimmune diseases, so its presence in blood serum {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool. The purpose of this study is to prove that 33 kDa OMP is one of the immunogenic parts of the Streptococcus Group A β-hemolytic, so it is expected that IgG anti- 33 kDa OMP can recognize and respond the bacteria and to support the probability of the Streptococcus Group A β-hemolytic infection. This study was a laboratory experimental study with a control group design. Animal used was RattusNovergicus immunized with whole cell bacteria or 33 kDa OMP mixed with Complete Freund’s Adjuvant or Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant. Polyclonal IgG was obtained by drawing blood serum from the animals after immunization with Streptococcus Group A β-hemolytic for 4 weeks (A; n = 5) and 8 weeks (B; n = 5) or immunization with OMP 33 kDa for 4 weeks (C; n = 5) and 8 weeks (D; n = 5) and also negative control group (E; n = 5).

It remains unclear how far cellular expression of HCV proteins in vivo may represent an index of progression {{of the disease and}} of proliferative activity in the liver in chronic hepatitis C. Aim of the studies included detection and subcellular localization of three HCV proteins (NS 3, NS 5 A and C) in liver biopsies from adults (n= 19) with chronic, long lasting hepatitis C as related to hepatocyte proliferative activity. The immunocytochemical ABC (avidin biotin-peroxidase complex) technique was applied, alone or associated with the ImmunoMax technique. Results of the <b>immunocytochemical</b> <b>tests</b> were compared to histological alterations in liver biopsies, proliferation index and with selected clinical data. A significantly higher expression of NS 3 protein was noted, as compared to expressions of NS 5 A and C proteins. In all the patients, cytoplasmic localization of all proteins dominated over nuclear localization (p 0. 05). At the level of electron microscopy, protein localization in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, mitochondria, perinuclear region and/or in hepatocyte cell nucleus was observed. No direct relationships could be demonstrated between expressions of HCV proteins and of Ki- 67 antigen. No correlations could also be demonstrated between cellular expression of any HCV protein on one hand and grading or staging, alanine transaminase (ALT), serum level of HCV RNA or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) on the other. However, positive correlations were disclosed between proliferative activity of hepatocytes on one hand and patient's age, grading and staging on the other. Advanced hepatic fibrosis correlated also with serum levels of AFP. The studies were supplemented with data on subcellular localization of HCV proteins. Moreover, they indicated that in HCV infection grading and staging, proliferative activity of hepatocytes and serum AFP level represent more valuable indices of the disease progress than those provided by cellular expression of three potentially oncogenic HCV proteins in vivo...|$|R

This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of an alternative cost-effective technique, Shandon PapSpin (PS) LBC in diagnosis of oral and oropharyngeal dysplasia and malignancy. Materials and Methods. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of Shandon PS LBC with that of scalpel biopsy in 69 patients. Transepithelial cytology specimens were obtained using a cervical Cytobrush. The cytology specimens were graded and scored using a novel oral cytologic grading and scoring system respectively. Results: Histological diagnosis of dysplasia or invasive squamous cell carcinoma was made in 51 of the 69 cases. Histology confirmed the cytological diagnosis of dysplasia or malignancy in 49 of the 51 cases. There were two false negative and no false positive cases. The sensitivity was 96 % and the specificity 100 %. The cytologic grade correlated positively with histologic grade. The best cut off value for distinguishing reactive/mildly dysplastic lesions from high 9 grade/invasive squamous cell carcinoma was determined as a cytologic score of 3, representing a sensitivity of 95 % and a specificity of 96 %. Conclusion: The Shandon PS LBC in association with transepithelial brush biopsy technique (TBBT) is a highly sensitive, specific and economical screening test in detection of oral and oropharyngeal dysplasia and malignancy. The proposed oral cytologic grading system correlates well with histology. The novel oral cytologic scoring system shows promise as a simple, reliable and reproducible scoring system.

Cancer of the corpus uteri remains the most common gynecological related cancer in developed countries. Cytology, after the induction of liquid based cytology, has reemerged as a possible first line non-interventional diagnostic proce-dure with promising results. Apart from slide preparation for cytology diagnosis, LBC allows the application of elabo-rate molecular tests on the residual material. Samples from 74 symptomatic women were collected in ThinPrep ® Pre-servCyt medium, from witch <b>immunocytochemical</b> and molecular <b>tests</b> were performed. Final diagnosis of 39 endo-metrioid carcinomas, 20 non-endometrioid carcinomas and 15 non-malignant was set after hysterectomy. Topoisom-erase IIa expression was common (42 %) in both types of cancer. Promoter methylation analysis revealed that hMLH 1 is commonly methylated in cancers (52. 7 %), CDKN 2 A and MGMT less often (27. 1 %) and RARB rarely methylated (8. 4 %). BRAF activating mutation V 600 E was a rare event (8. 4 %) only found in low grade endometrioid carcinomas. Topoisomerase IIa expression correlated with BRAF mutations, hMLH 1 and to lesser extent with CDKN 2 A methyla...|$|R
40|$|Regeneration {{of the rat}} {{sciatic nerve}} through {{acellular}} muscle and nerve autografts was evaluated 6 - 28 days postoperatively by the sensory pinch <b>test,</b> <b>immunocytochemical</b> staining for neurofilaments, and light and electron microscopy. Data points generated by the pinch test were plotted against postoperative time periods and {{by the use of}} regression analysis the initial delay period for muscle grafts was determined to 10. 3 days. This value was similar to that previously published for acellular nerve grafts (9. 5 days), but significantly longer than that for fresh nerve grafts (3. 6 days). The calculated regeneration rate (slope of the regression line) for muscle grafts (1. 8 mm/day) did not differ significantly (p > 0. 05) from that calculated for acellular nerve grafts (2. 1 mm/day) or for fresh nerve grafts (1. 5 mm/day). The front of regenerating axons shown by axonal neurofilament staining confirmed the pinch test results. Both types of acellular grafts were repopulated with host non-neuronal cells and the muscle graft contained occasional ectopic muscle fibres. Remnants of graft basal laminae were evident at the ultrastructural level. These results indicate the suitability of either acellular muscle or nerve grafts for nerve repair despite their prolonged initial delay periods compared with conventional fresh nerve grafts...|$|R
40|$|Glutamate is {{the major}} {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system. It is inactivated by cellular uptake catalyzed by a family of glutamate transporter proteins (GLT 1, GLAST, EAAC 1, EAAT 4 and EAAT 5). The main aim of the present thesis {{was to determine the}} contributions of the individual glutamate transporter subtypes to the total glutamate uptake around hippocampal synapses focusing on the EAAC 1 subtype and on the mysterious transporter responsible for nerve terminal uptake of glutamate. The first step on this endeavor was to make antibodies to EAAC 1. As outlined in Paper I, {{it turned out to be}} more difficult to make good antibodies to EAAC 1 than to the other glutamate transporters. Specificity testing using tissue from EAAC 1 knockout mice as negative controls revealed highly specific interactions with unrelated proteins. Paper II summarizes of the lessons learnt about <b>immunocytochemical</b> specificity <b>testing,</b> and Paper III illustrates how the antigen pre-adsorption test can be misleading. After having overcome methodological problems, we were in position to address the original question. In Paper IV a new procedure for immunoisolation of EAAC 1 was developed, and known amounts of pure EAAC 1 protein was used as standard to quantify EAAC 1 concentrations in brain tissue extracts. EAAC 1 was found to be present at 13 μg per gram hippocampal protein. This is 100 times less than GLT 1 and argues against a significant contribution of EAAC 1 to rapid transmitter activation. EAAC 1 is selectively expressed in neuronal somata and dendrites throughout the brain, and thereby in a total surface area similar to that of astrocytes. In Paper V we show that nerve terminal glutamate uptake fully depends on GLT 1, and that about 10 % of hippocampal GLT 1 protein is expressed terminals. This also explains why high levels of GLT 1 mRNA is present in CA 3 pyramidal cells. In Paper VI we describe antibodies to GLT 1 splice variants and show that GLT 1 a represents about 90 % of total hippocampal GLT 1, while GLT 1 b and GLT 1 c represented 6 and 1 %, respectively. We also provide the first data on the distribution of the GLT 1 b and show that this variant does not contribute to nerve terminal uptake...|$|R
40|$|A {{protein that}} is {{expressed}} on capillary endothelial cells, called GPIHBP 1 (glycosylphosphatidylinositol- anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1), binds lipoprotein lipase and shuttles {{it to its}} site of action in the capillary lumen. A deficiency in GPIHBP 1 prevents lipoprotein lipase from reaching the capillary lumen. Patients with GPIHBP 1 deficiency have low plasma levels of lipoprotein lipase, impaired intravascular hydrolysis of triglycerides, and severe hypertriglyceridemia (chylomicronemia). During the characterization of a monoclonal antibody- based immunoassay for GPIHBP 1, we encountered two plasma samples (both from patients with chylomicronemia) that contained an interfering substance that {{made it impossible to}} measure GPIHBP 1. That finding raised the possibility that those samples might contain GPIHBP 1 autoantibodies. METHODS Using a combination of immunoassays, Western blot analyses, and <b>immunocytochemical</b> studies, we <b>tested</b> the two plasma samples (as well as samples from other patients with chylomicronemia) for the presence of GPIHBP 1 autoantibodies. We also tested the ability of GPIHBP 1 autoantibodies to block the binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP 1. RESULTSWe identified GPIHBP 1 autoantibodies in six patients with chylomicronemia and found that these autoantibodies blocked the binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP 1. As in patients with GPIHBP 1 deficiency, those with GPIHBP 1 autoantibodies had low plasma levels of lipoprotein lipase. Three of the six patients had systemic lupus erythematosus. One of these patients who had GPIHBP 1 autoantibodies delivered a baby with plasma containing maternal GPIHBP 1 autoantibodies; the infant had severe but transient chylomicronemia. Two of the patients with chylomicronemia and GPIHBP 1 autoantibodies had a response to treatment with immunosuppressive agents. CONCLUSIONSIn six patients with chylomicronemia, GPIHBP 1 autoantibodies blocked the ability of GPIHBP 1 to bind and transport lipoprotein lipase, thereby interfering with lipoprotein lipase-mediated processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and causing severe hypertriglyceridemia...|$|R

Topoisomerase IIa expression correlated with BRAF mutations, hMLH 1 and to lesser extent with CDKN 2 A methylation. Almost none of the biomarkers were positive in cytological negative or hyperplastic without atypia samples. Detection of methylation in any gene displayed sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV similar to cytology of cancer. However, inclusion of cytology diagnosis of hyperlasias with atypia increased sensitivity and NPV of cytology outperforming methylation of any gene. Further evaluation of the panel of promoter methylation, especially in cytology diagnoses of hyperplasia with or without atypia should be evaluated since initial results are promising. Even though methylation of MGMT and RARB are rare events, some patients could be benefit from specific chemotherapeutics that target either of them or the more frequently expressed topoisomerase IIa. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown that B- 50 is {{identical}} to the neuron- specific, growth-associated protein GAP 43. The present study reports on the fate of B- 50 /GAP 43 mRNA and B- 50 /GAP 43 protein, determined by radioimmunoassay, in a rat model of peripheral nerve regeneration (sciatic nerve crush) over a period of 37 and 312 d, respectively. Moreover, the effects of repeated subcutaneous injection of the neurotrophic peptide Org. 2766 (an ACTH 4 - 9 analog) and of a conditioning lesion on B- 50 /GAP 43 protein levels in the regenerating nerve and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were investigated. Both treatments enhanced the functional recovery as evidenced by a foot-flick withdrawal <b>test.</b> <b>Immunocytochemical</b> analysis using antineurofilament antibodies revealed a peptide-induced increase in the number of outgrowing sprouts in the sciatic nerve. Both the peptide and the conditioning lesion amplified the crush lesion-induced increase in B- 50 protein content in the nerve as determined by radioimmunoassay. B- 50 protein levels seem to correlate proportionally with the number of sprouts. In the DRG of the crushed sciatic nerve, the time course of B- 50 expression was studied. B- 50 mRNA was quantified from Northern blots. A linear increase up to 10 times the basal level of B- 50 mRNA was observed 2 d postsurgery, followed by a gradual decline to normal levels at day 37. The first significant rise in B- 50 mRNA level became apparent between 8 and 16 hr after placement of the crush lesion. The first significant rise in B- 50 protein level occurred 40 hr after the crush lesion, reaching a plateau of 3 times the basal level between day 6 and 20. B- 50 protein levels in DRG cell bodies remained elevated up to 60 d after crush, a period much longer than that observed for B- 50 mRNA. Thus, during a later phase of peripheral axonal regeneration, the presence of B- 50 appears to be prolonged, probably by an increase in half-life and not so much by enhanced transcription. Treatment with Org. 2766 did not affect the B- 50 /GAP 43 levels in DRG cell bodies during the first 6 d following crush. Conditioning lesion resulted in a DRG B- 50 /GAP 43 protein amount at the same level as in rats 14 d after the test lesion. B- 50 /GAP 43 levels in DRG are probably influenced by the rapid axonal transport of the protein, as has been reported by others...|$|R
