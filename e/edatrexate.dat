40|$|Purpose. To {{define the}} maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of {{ifosfamide}} when given with G-CSF on an {{every other week}} schedule, and to define the MTD of <b>edatrexate</b> that can be given every two weeks with an intense schedule of ifosfamide. Patients and Methods. Forty-one patients with metastatic or unresectable, locally advanced sarcoma participated in this 2 -step phase I trial. The starting dose of ifosfamide was 10 gm/m[sup 2] given by continuous intravenous infusion over 4 days every 2 weeks. When the MTD was defined, <b>edatrexate,</b> beginning at a dose of 40 mg/m[sup 2] intravenously every 2 weeks was added in subsequent cohorts of patients. Results. Myelosuppression was the most prominent toxicity. Fatigue, nausea, and vomiting were observed {{in the majority of}} patients. Ifosfamide 12 gm/m[sup 2] given every 2 weeks approached or exceeded the MTD. <b>Edatrexate</b> 100 mg/m[sup 2] could be given safety as an intravenous bolus with ifosfamide 10 gm/m[sup 2] every 2 weeks. Therapeutic responses were observed in patients with measurable disease. Conclusions. This study demonstrates the feasibility of administering a dose-intense schedule of ifosfamide alone or ifosfamide with <b>edatrexate</b> that might be applied in the adjuvant or neo-adjuvant setting.

40|$|Murine L 1210 leukaemia cells expressing {{either the}} reduced folate carrier (RFC) or the {{membrane}} folate receptor (MFR) were studied in vitro and in vivo {{to assess the}} dynamics of membrane transport of two categories antifolates; folate-based inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (methotrexate, <b>edatrexate,</b> aminopterin, PT 523, and PT 644) and thymidylate synthase (TS) [CB 3717, raltitrexed, plevitrexed (BGC 9331), pemetrexed and GW 1843]. The potency of in situ inhibition of TS {{was used as an}} endpoint to analyze the in vitro dynamics of RFC/ MFR-membrane transport of these antifolates. Both for L 1210 -RFC and L 1210 -MFR cells, the potency of in situ TS inhibition was closely correlated with increasing aYnities of these transporters for the antifolates (r = 0. 64, P < 0. 05 and r = ยก 0. 65, P < 0. 05, respectively). Within the group of antifolates for which MFR had a low binding aYnity, those that had the ability to become polyglutamylated, were more potent inhibitors of TS in situ activity than non-polyglutamatable antifolates. In vivo activity of methotrexate, <b>edatrexate,</b> raltitrexed and pemetrexed was assessed in L 1210 -RFC and L 1210 -MFR bearing mice that were fed either a standard or a folate-deWcient chow. Dietary folate depletion signiWcantly reduced the MTD for methotrexate (sevenfold), <b>edatrexate</b> (sevenfold), raltitrexed (50 -fold) and pemetrexed (150 -fold). Based on increased life spans, antitumor eVects of methotrexate and <b>edatrexate</b> were markedly better in L 1210 -RFC bearing mice on the folate-deWcient chow (ILS: 455 and 544...|$|E

40|$|We have {{established}} an Adriamycin (ADM) -resistant small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line, SBC- 3 /ADM 100, which shows multifactorial mechanisms {{of resistance to}} ADM, such as overexpression of P-glycoprotein, an enhanced detoxifying system {{and a decrease in}} topoisomerase II activity. In the present study, we confirmed that SBC- 3 /ADM 100 showed collateral sensitivity to methotrexate and TNP- 351, a new antifolate, though this cell line showed a typical multidrug resistance (MDR) pattern. We also demonstrated a faster uptake and higher accumulation (1. 3 -fold) of TNP- 351 in the SBC- 3 /ADM 100 cells than those in the parent SBC- 3 cells. These results explain one of the mechanisms for collateral sensitivity in the resistant cells. Furthermore, this cell line was found to have no cross-resistance to <b>edatrexate</b> and minimal cross-resistance to trimetrexate, 254 -S (cisplatin analog), 5 -fluorouracil and 4 -hydroperoxyifosfamide. These drugs will have clinical importance in patients with SCLC who were previously treated with an ADM-containing regimen. Thus, antifolates, especially TNP- 351 and <b>edatrexate,</b> can be expected to eradicate residual multidrug resistant SCLC cells selected by ADM. </p...|$|E
40|$|Many new antifolate {{compounds}} {{with unique}} clinical properties {{are currently in}} clinical development. Some of these agents have been rationally designed to circumvent known mechanisms of resistance to methotrexate, the most useful and extensively studied antifolate in clinical practice. Resistance to methotrexate can result from decreased active transport into cells, decreased polyglutamation resulting in enhanced drug efflux from cells, mutations in dihydrofolate reductase which reduce drug binding affinity, and increased expression of dihydrofolate reductase due to gene amplification or increased translational efficiency. As a consequence, the newer antifolates may differ from methotrexate because of increased lipid solubility, improved cellular uptake or increased ability to undergo polyglutamation. Several of these newer agents also uniquely target specific folate-dependent enzymes such as thymidylate synthase or glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase. Antifolates currently in clinical development include trimetrexate, <b>edatrexate,</b> piritrexim, ZD 1694, lometrexol, AG 337, LY 231514 and 1843 U 89. This report summarizes the basic pharmacology and potential clinical applications of these promising new agents. The Oncologist 1996; 1 : 68 - 8...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{methotrexate}} (MTX) -resistant L 1210 leukemia murine ascites tumors {{were developed in}} vivo and analyzed for drug resistance. Three of 20 tumors studied expressed an altered dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and each was identical, having a C to T base transition at nucleotide 46 in the DHFR gene as demonstrated by PCR and direct sequencing. This transition results in a Gly to Trp substitution at amino acid 15 of the enzyme. Purified altered enzyme displays significantly lower binding affinity for the antifolates MTX, trimetrexate, <b>edatrexate,</b> and trimethoprim with respective Ki values 165 -, 76 -, 30 -, and 28 -fold higher than values obtained for enzyme isolated from parental tumor (wild-type enzyme). Substrate (dihydrofolate) and cofactor (NADPH) binding is also diminished for the mutant enzyme, although {{to a lesser extent}} (17. 3 - and 3. 6 -fold higher Km, respectively). Gly- 15 is highly conserved for all vertebrate species of DHFR but has no known interaction(s), either directly or indirectly, with bound cofactor, substrate, or inhibitor. Protein molecular modeling reveals that the affected residue is 9 - 12 A away from the enzyme active site and located in a region analogous to the mobile Met- 20 loop domain characterized for Escherichia coli DHFR...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{molecular}} basis of resistance of multiple human leukaemia CCRF-CEM sublines to the novel antifolates ZD 9331, GW 1843, AG 2034, PT 523 and <b>edatrexate,</b> which use the reduced folate carrier (RFC) as their main cellular uptake route and that target different folate-dependent enzymes. Antifolate-resistant sublines established by stepwise and single-step selections displayed up to 2135 -fold resistance to the selection drug, and up to 2323 -fold cross-resistance to various hydrophilic antifolates. In contrast, these sublines were up to 17 - and 20 -fold hypersensitive to the lipophilic antifolates AG 377 and trimetrexate, respectively. The total reduced folate pool of these antifolate-resistant sublines shrunk by 87 - 96 %, resulting in up to 42 -fold increased folic acid growth requirement. These sublines lost 92 - 97 % of parental [(3) H]methotrexate influx rates. Genomic PCR single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and sequencing revealed {{that most of these}} drug-resistant sublines harboured RFC mutations that surprisingly clustered in two confined regions in exons 2 and 3. The majority of these mutations resulted in frame-shift and/or premature translation termination and lack of RFC protein expression. The remaining mutations involved single amino acid substitutions predominantly residing in the first transmembrane domain (TMD 1). Some RFC-inactivating mutations emerged during the early stages of antifolate selection and were stably retained during further drug selection. Furthermore, some sublines displayed a markedly decreased or abolished RFC mRNA and/or protein expression. This constitutes the first demonstration of clustering of multiple human RFC mutations in TMD 1, thereby suggesting that it plays a functional role in folate/antifolate binding and/or translocation. This is the first molecular characterization of human RFC-associated modalities of resistance to various novel antifolates in multiple leukaemia sublines...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{molecular}} {{basis of the}} up to 46 -fold increased accumulation of folates and methotrexate (MTX) in human leukemia CEM- 7 A cells established by gradual deprivation of leucovorin (LCV). CEM- 7 A cells consequently exhibited 10 - and 68 -fold decreased LCV and folic acid growth requirements and 23 - 25 -fold hypersensitivity to MTX and <b>edatrexate.</b> Although CEM- 7 A cells displayed a 74 - 86 -fold increase in the reduced folate carrier (RFC) -mediated influx of LCV and MTX, RFC overexpression per se cannot induce a prominently increased folate/MTX accumulation because RFC functions as a nonconcentrative anion exchanger. We therefore explored the possibility that folate efflux activity mediated {{by members of the}} multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family was impaired in CEM- 7 A cells. Parental CEM cells expressed substantial levels of MRP 1, MRP 4, poor MRP 5 levels, whereas MRP 2, MRP 3 and breast cancer resistance protein were undetectable. In contrast, CEM- 7 A cells lost 95 % of MRP 1 levels while retaining parental expression of MRP 4 and MRP 5. Consequently, CEM- 7 A cells displayed a 5 -fold decrease in the [(3) H]folic acid efflux rate constant, which was identical to that obtained with parental CEM cells, when their folic acid efflux was blocked (78 %) with probenecid. Furthermore, when compared with parental CEM, CEM- 7 A cells accumulated 2 -fold more calcein fluorescence. Treatment of parental cells with the MRP 1 efflux inhibitors MK 571 and probenecid resulted in a 60 - 100 % increase in calcein fluorescence. In contrast, these inhibitors failed to alter the calcein fluorescence in CEM- 7 A cells, which markedly lost MRP 1 expression. Replenishment of LCV in the growth medium of CEM- 7 A cells resulted in resumption of normal MRP 1 expression. These results establish {{for the first time that}} MRP 1 is the primary folate efflux route in CEM leukemia cells and that the loss of folate efflux activity is an efficient means of markedly augmenting cellular folate pools. These findings suggest a functional role for MRP 1 in the maintenance of cellular folate homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|The 10 -deazaaminopterins are a {{new class}} of rationally {{designed}} antifolates demonstrating greater antitumor effects than methotrexate in murine tumor models and human tumor xenografts. Their design was aimed at improving membrane transport and polyglutamylation in tumor cells, resulting in increased intracellular accumulation and enhanced cytotoxicity. Compared with other 4 -aminofolate analogues, 10 -propargyl- 10 -deazaaminopterin (PDX) is the most efficient permeant for the RFC- 1 -mediated internalization and substrate for folylpolyglutamate synthetase. PDX demonstrates greater in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy than methotrexate or <b>edatrexate.</b> We undertook a Phase I study with PDX to identify the potential toxicities and define an optimal dose and schedule. Thirty-three patients were enrolled, all of whom had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and were treated previously with a median of two prior chemotherapy regimens. Initially, PDX was administered weekly for 3 weeks in a 4 -week cycle. Mucositis requiring dose reduction and/or delay in the first cycle occurred in four of six patients treated at the initial dose level (30 mg/m 2), making this the maximal tolerated dose for PDX given on this schedule. The treatment schedule was then modified to every 2 weeks. Twenty-seven patients were treated twice weekly with a total of 102 four-week cycles (median, 2 cycles/patient). Mucositis was the dose-limiting toxicity, with grade 3 and 4 mucositis occurring in the first two patients treated at the 170 mg/m 2 dose level. Other toxicities were mild and reversible. No neutropenia was observed. The recommended Phase II dose is 150 mg/m 2 biweekly. At that dose level, the mean area under the curve was 20. 6 {micro}mol{middle dot}h, and the mean terminal half-life was 8 h. Two patients with stage IV NSCLC had major objective responses, and five patients had stable disease for 7 (two patients), 9 (one patient), 10 (one patient), and 13 months (one patient). PDX is a new antifolate with manageable toxicity and evidence of antitumor activity in NSCLC. A Phase II trial in NSCLC and a Phase I trial with paclitaxel are under way. These studies will also quantitate the expression of genes controlling internalization (RFC- 1) and polyglutamylation of PDX in tumor cells as correlates of response...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this doctoral thesis were to develop sensitive and versatile electrochemical detection systems, {{taking advantage of}} the unique analytical characteristics of microelectrodes, and apply them to selected biomedical analyses. In order to broaden the applicability of electrochemical detection following capillary electrophoresis (CE), a system was developed which enabled reductive electrochemical detection to be earned out following capillary electrophoresis. This greatly broadens the number of compounds that can be detected electrochemically following separation by CE The analytical potential of the system was demonstrated for both mtroaromatic compounds and quinones It was shown to possess major advantages over reductive LCEC, including very short deoxygenation times and low limits of detection. The system was also applied to the analysis of an antitumour compound, mitomycin C, in human serum without the need for prior extraction procedures. In another project, continuous in vivo microdialysis sampling was used in conjunction with capillary electrophoresis and electrochemical detection, to monitor the levels of tryptophan and its metabolites in the extracellular fluid of rat brain. The relative changes in the concentration of these metabolites in the extracellular fluid were monitored following mtrapentoneal administration of tryptophan and kynuremne, respectively. The advantages of capillary electrophoresis for sample volume limited analyses were demonstrated, and the high sensitivity of electrochemical detection was shown to be very desirable in this field of research. In the area of biomedical analysis one of the major objectives is to develop very sensitive techniques for the determination of therapeutic compounds in biological fluids. The advantages of microelectrodes and adsorptive stripping voltammetry were combined by developing a mercury thin film ultramicroelectrode using a carbon fibre substrate. Using phase-selective AC stripping voltammetry, a very sensitive technique was developed for the analysis of methotrexate, aminoptenn, and <b>edatrexate,</b> members of the very important ptendine class of chemotherapeutic drugs. These compounds were analysed in human unne and serum, both with and without the employment of prior extraction procedures. Carbon fibre electrodes were also modified with the polymer [Os(bipy) 2 (PVP) 2 () Cl]Cl for the flow amperometnc determination of nitrite. This redox polymer greatly enhances the kinetics of nitrite reduction compared with the reaction at bare carbon electrodes Due to the electrocatalytic effect, a less extreme working potential could be employed which minimised the responses from the commonly present interferents present in real samples. The electrode was applied to the flow amperometnc determination of nitnte in processed meat samples. The electrode exhibited excellent selectivity and long term stability...|$|E
