60|$|As {{there were}} yet {{several hours of}} light remaining, Roswell, still {{attended}} by Stimson, each armed with a sealing spear or lance, {{not only as a}} weapon of defence but as a leaping-staff, set out to climb as high up the central acclivity of the island as circumstances would allow him to go. He was deceived in the distances, however, and soon found that an entire day would be necessary to achieve such an enterprise, could it be performed at all; but he did succeed in reaching a low spur of the central mountain that commanded a wide and noble view of all that lay to the north and east of it. From this height, which must have been a few hundred feet above the level of the ocean, our adventurers got a still better view of the whole north coast, or {{of what might have been}} called the sealing quarter of the island. They also got a tolerably accurate idea of the general formation of that lone fragment of rock and earth, as well as of the islets and islands that lay in its vicinity. The outline of the first was that of a rude, and of course an <b>irregular</b> <b>triangle,</b> the three principal points of which were the two low capes already mentioned, and a third that lay to the northward and westward. The whole of the western or south-western shore seemed to be a nearly perpendicular wall of rock, that, in the main, rose some two or three hundred feet above the ocean. Against this side of the island in particular, the waves of the ocean were sullenly beating, while the ice drove up 'home,' as sailors express it; showing a vast depth of water. On the two other sides, it was different. The winds prevailed most from the south-west, which rendered the perpendicular face of the island its weather-wall; while the two other sides of the triangle were more favoured by position. The north side, of course, lay most exposed to the sun, everything of this nature being reversed in the southern hemisphere from what we have it in the northern; while the eastern or north-eastern side, to be precisely accurate, was protected by the group of islands that lay in its front. Such was the general character of Sealer's Land, so far as the hurried observations of its present master enabled him to ascertain. The near approach of night induced him now to hasten to get off of the somewhat dangerous acclivities to which he had climbed, and to rejoin his people and his schooner.|$|E

40|$|Bivariate {{quadratic}} simplical B-splines {{defined by}} their corresponding set of knots {{derived from a}} (suboptimal) constrained Delaunay triangulation of the domain are employed to obtain a C 1 -smooth surface. The generation of triangle vertices is adjusted to the areal distribution of the data in the domain. We emphasize here that the vertices of the triangles initially define the knots of the B-splines and do generally not coincide with the abscissae of the data. Thus, this approach is well suited to process scattered data. With each vertex of a given triangle we associate two additional points which give rise to six configurations of five knots defining six linearly independent bivariate quadratic B-splines supported on the convex hull of the corresponding five knots. If we consider the vertices of the triangulation as threefold knots, the bivariate quadratic B-splines turn into the well known bivariate quadratic Bernstein-Bézier-form polynomials on triangles. Thus we might be led to think of B-splines as of smoothed versions of Bernstein-Bézier polynomials {{with respect to the}} entire domain. From the degenerate Bernstein-Bézier situation we deduce rules how to locate the additional points associated with each vertex to establish knot configurations that allow the modeling of discontinuities of the function itself or any of its directional derivatives. We find that four collinear knots out of the set of five defining an individual quadratic B-spline generate a discontinuity in the surface along the line they constitute, and that analogously three collinear knots generate a discontinuity in a first derivative. Finally, the coefficients of the linear combinations of normalized simplicial B-splines are visualized as geometric control points satisfying the convex hull property. Thus, bivariate quadratic B-splines associated with <b>irregular</b> <b>triangles</b> provide a great flexibility to approximate and model fast changing or even functions with any given discontinuities from scattered data.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} {{challenging}} aspects in the accurate simulation of three-dimensional soft objects such as vesicles or biological cells is the computation of membrane bending forces. The origin of this difficulty stems from the need to numerically evaluate a fourth order derivative on the discretized surface geometry. Here we investigate six different algorithms to compute membrane bending forces, including regularly used methods as well as novel ones. All are based on the same physical model (due to Canham and Helfrich) and start from a surface discretization with flat triangles. At the same time, they differ substantially in their numerical approach. We start by comparing the numerically obtained mean curvature, the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the mean curvature and finally the surface force density to analytical results for the discocyte resting shape of a red blood cell. We find that none of the considered algorithms converges to zero error at all nodes and that for some algorithms the error even diverges. There is furthermore a pronounced influence of the mesh structure: Discretizations with more <b>irregular</b> <b>triangles</b> and node connectivity present serious difficulties for most investigated methods. To assess the behavior of the algorithms in a realistic physical application, we investigate the deformation of an initially spherical capsule in a linear shear flow at small Reynolds numbers. To exclude any influence of the flow solver, two conceptually very different solvers are employed: the Lattice-Boltzmann and the Boundary Integral Method. Despite the largely different quality of the bending algorithms when applied to the static red blood cell, we find that in the actual flow situation most algorithms give consistent results for both hydrodynamic solvers. Even so, a short review of earlier works reveals a wide scattering of reported results for, e. g., the Taylor deformation parameter. Besides the presented application to biofluidic systems, the investigated algorithms are also of high relevance to the computer graphics and numerical mathematics communities...|$|R

40|$|Splitting {{process in}} Bounding-Volume Hierarchies (BVH) for {{collision}} detection {{is one of}} the most challenging issues in computer graphics. The splitting process requires an object with their set of triangles to be splitted into two parts using binary tree. The problem exists where most of objects do not have similar triangle size and thus creating unbalanced tree when reaching the final level of tree construction. It is very crucial to make sure that the BVH tree construction is always in balanced as the speed of BVH tree traversal algorithm dropped for unbalanced tree. In this thesis, we introduce the Spatial Object Median Splitting (SOMS) Rule to enhance the capability of BVH construction by efficiently splitting the <b>irregular</b> <b>triangles</b> so that each of them can be bounded with single Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB). The process starts by splitting the longest axis between the midpoint of the triangles based on their minimum and maximum points. Result show that SOMS is capable of creating an optimum level of BVH where more leaf nodes containing a single triangle bounded with AABB are produced compared to Spatial Median technique. From the BVH construction experiments, SOMS managed to create the AABB tree in 43 milliseconds for object that have 948 triangles or 8 % faster compared to the Spatial Median technique. Furthermore, experiment to create BVH also showed that SOMS produced 26 % more nodes with single triangle compared to the Spatial Median technique given that the total object triangle count for the complex environment are 5672 triangles. The E-Node traversal approach that is specially designed to perform traversal testing for SOMS technique is able to detect overlap between dynamic and static models in an average of 0. 2 milliseconds for the same complex environment. As a conclusion, BVH can easily be constructed using SOMS approach to create a more balanced tree and an E-Node traversal algorithm that is more efficient and faster...|$|R

This method builds upon {{the combination of the}} detection of image spectral discontinuities using Canny edge detection and the image Laplacian, followed by the construction of a hierarchy of segmented images of successively reduced levels of details. These images are represented as sets of polygonized pixel patches (polygons) attributed with spectral and structural characteristics.

Image graph partitioning is based on the iterative graph contraction using Boruvka's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm.
