5000|$|The AAM, or American Alliance of Museums, defines an <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>plan</b> as [...] "a {{series of}} written {{policies}} and procedures that prevent or minimize damage resulting from disasters (either man made or natural) and help a museum recover." [...] The required elements of such a plan are as follows: tailored to the institutions current facilities and specific circumstances, covers all threats/risks relevant to the institution, addresses staff, visitors, structures, and collections, includes evacuation plans for people, specifies how to protect, evacuate or recover collections {{in the event of}} a disaster, and delegates responsibility for implementation. A Photography Conservator would have a vital role to play in the <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>plan</b> at their institution. It would be their responsibility to detail the needs of the photography collection and the ways to recover that collection in case of a disaster. It is widely recommended that the staff partake in monthly training to go over the <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>plan</b> in order to ensure that each staff member, including the photograph conservator, knows their role in case of an emergency.|$|E

40|$|Third party {{damage from}} {{activities}} such as work carried out by contractors’ poses risks to gas pipelines. Within the UK, emergency plans are drawn up {{in an attempt to}} mitigate the significant consequences of any pipeline failure. The Control of Major Accident Hazards 1999 and the Pipeline Safety Regulations 1996 place legislative requirements on UK gas infrastructure providers, to regularly test emergency plans with simulation exercises. The exercises are intended to support the preparation of responders for dealing with incidents of failure. Software simulation is not currently utilised to facilitate the testing of <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>plans</b> in the UK gas pipeline industry. This project serves to evaluate the user acceptance of a software simulation prototype to enable the testing of <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>planning</b> strategies in the UK gas industry. Current emergency planning legislation and strategies applied to satisfy legislation within the UK gas industry are reviewed. The adoption and application of software simulation for the development of applied skill in other industries is examined, to determine the potential for use in testing <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>planning</b> for gas incidents. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the theoretical framework that underpins the study of user acceptance, of a software simulation prototype designed for running exercises to test <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>plans.</b> A case study evaluation of the user acceptance of the prototype, by representatives experienced in testing <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>planning</b> strategies in the gas industry, is presented. The participants in this case study are drawn from the Police, Fire and Rescue Service, Local Authority and Gas infrastructure provider, that perform a range of job roles operating at Operational, Tactical and Strategical levels. The research findings demonstrate that the participants perceive software simulation of <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>planning</b> processes for gas incidents to be beneficial. The TAM claims that if users perceive a system to be useful they are likely to adopt that system. Furthermore if users don’t perceive a system to be easy to use, according to the TAM, they will still adopt it after the correct training has been provided. Users would be most likely to adopt and use the software to facilitate <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>planning</b> exercises, if the correct training is provided. Software simulation offers great potential for the testing of emergency plans, it provides a controlled environment where decisions and responses can be audited and mistakes can be made without serious consequence. Software simulation has been shown to enhance, rather than replace, existing <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>planning</b> processes...|$|R

Methods—Information from the Bioterrorism and Mass Casualty Preparedness Supplements to the 2003 and 2004 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys was used to provide national estimates of variations in hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>plans</b> and resources by residency and medical school affiliation, hospital size, ownership, metropolitan statistical area status, and Joint Commission accreditation. Of 874 sampled hospitals with emergency or outpatient departments, 739 responded for an 84. 6 percent response rate. Estimates are presented with 95 percent confidence intervals. Results—About 92 percent of hospitals had revised their <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>plans</b> since September 11, 2001, but only about 63 percent had addressed natural disasters and biological, chemical, radiological, and explosive terrorism in those plans. Only about 9 percent of hospitals had provided for all 10 of the <b>response</b> <b>plan</b> components studied. Hospitals had a mean of about 14 personal protective suits, 21 critical care beds, 12 mechanical ventilators, 7 negative pressure isolation rooms, and 2 decontamination showers each.
