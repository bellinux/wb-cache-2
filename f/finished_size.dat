40|$|For decades, tin-lead {{has been}} used as the primary surface finish for {{compliant}} pins and plated through holes (PTH) of printed circuit board (PCB) in press-fit connections. Therefore, most test results on press-fit performance are focused on the tin-lead finishes for the connections. Due to the discontinuation of the use of lead in electric and electronic components, the trend of using lead-free manufacturing for PCB’s and connectors is being vigorously pursued by the industry. The present study is intended to evaluate press-fit connections using various lead-free finishes on compliant pins and PTH’s and then compare to tin-lead finish. The lead-free finishes for the compliant pins are plated with matte and bright pure tin, and the lead-free finishes for the PTH’s are electroplated Au, OSP, and immersion tin, Au, and Ag finishes. In the design of experiments (DOE) of the current study, single pin tests were used to obtain the DOE outputs of insertion and retention forces for eye-of-the-needle (EON) compliant pins in PTH’s. For all three EON finishes (two pure tin and one tin-lead), the DOE results show that <b>finished</b> PTH <b>size</b> is the most important factor to determine the insertion force. The insertion force is a strong inverted linear function of <b>finished</b> PTH <b>size</b> (i. e., a larger force is required for a smaller <b>finished</b> PTH <b>size).</b> The impact from pin installation/repair cycle is the second factor behind the <b>finished</b> PTH <b>size.</b> The <b>finishes</b> of EON and PTH are only minor factors for the insertion force.

40|$|A {{heuristic}} {{procedure for}} scheduling production rolls of paper through a finishing operation {{to cut them}} down to <b>finished</b> roll <b>sizes</b> is described. The ratio of service time to interarrival time of production rolls at the initial cutting station is large so that insufficient time is available {{to set it up}} unless a minimum number of production rolls are to be processed in the same manner. Otherwise, some portion of each production roll must go through a reprocessing operation to complete the cutting of <b>finished</b> <b>sizes.</b> The objective is to minimize the cost of trim loss and reprocessing. The procedure generates cutting patterns and usage levels sequentially until all the requirements are satisfied. At each step the search is dependent upon the characteristics of the unsatisfied requirements. A maximum of three solutions is generated for each problem. If none satisfies a predetermined aspiration level, the best of the three is chosen. The procedure was evaluated by scheduling a specific paper production facility and observing the results for a set of 15 problems. For each problem, the best solution was recorded. The overall results from this set of problems were then compared to previously recorded results on problems solved manually. There was a 16 % improvement in solution quality for the heuristic procedure relative to the manual method. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the field}} of {{electronic}} devices, Roll-to-roll processing, also known as web processing, reel-to-reel processing or R2R, {{is the process of}} creating electronic devices on a roll of flexible plastic or metal foil. In other fields predating this use, it can refer to any process of applying coatings, printing, or performing other processes starting with a roll of a flexible material and re-reeling after the process to create an output roll. These processes, and others such as sheeting, can be grouped together under the general term converting. When the rolls of material have been coated, laminated or printed they can be subsequently slit to their <b>finished</b> <b>size</b> on a slitter rewinder.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Block {{electrode}} discharge grinding is {{an effective}} approach to produce micro rods. However, {{it is difficult to}} fabricate the rods into desired miniature and precision. To solve this problem, the tangential feeding method is proposed to control the <b>finish</b> <b>size</b> of micro rods. With this method, the micro rod is first fed in its radial direction, and then in the tangential direction for an enough distance. The wear of the block electrode decreases gradually from the start to the end, and the wear in the end can be neglected. Experiments indicate that the large capacitance or voltage can obtain high machining speed, while the small ones can gain thin micro rods. Based on this result, the policy of delaminating grinding is adopted to gain enough thin micro rods at a high machining speed. The Φ 5 µm micro rods can be ground with this method. SEM results show that the relative error of the size control is less than 10 %...|$|R
50|$|The layers {{are created}} by {{shredding}} the wood into strips, which are sifted and then oriented on a belt or wire cauls. The mat is made in a forming line. Wood strips on the external layers are aligned to the panel's strength axis, while internal layers are perpendicular. The number of layers placed is determined partly by {{the thickness of the}} panel but is limited by the equipment installed at the manufacturing site. Individual layers can also vary in thickness to give different finished panel thicknesses (typically, a 15 cm layer will produce a 15 mm panel thickness). The mat is placed in a thermal press to compress the flakes and bond them by heat activation and curing of the resin that has been coated on the flakes. Individual panels are then cut from the mats into <b>finished</b> <b>sizes.</b> Most of the world's OSB is made in the United States and Canada in large production facilities.

50|$|In November 1938, the two {{segments}} of the tunnel met under the mountain, {{no more than a}} few inches off. With the excavation completed, the tunnel was then grouted with concrete. This operation filled in cracks and crevices and reduced the tunnel to its <b>finished</b> <b>size</b> of 16 feet (4.9 m) tall and 16 feet (4.9 m) wide. About 24,100 tons of cement were used in the attempts to seal off the seepage, averaging about 20 sacks per foot of tunnel. As leaks were sealed, pressure would build and create a new leak elsewhere. Eventually the seepage was reduced to 540 US gallons per minute (0.034 m3/s), and on October 14, 1939, the San Jacinto Tunnel was completed, well ahead of schedule.|$|E

25|$|In {{ammunition}} manufacture, swaged bullets are bullets {{manufactured by}} compressing metal {{at room temperature}} into a die to form it {{into the shape of}} a bullet. The other common manufacturing method is casting, which uses molten metals poured into a mold. Since metals expand when heated and contract when cooled, cast bullets must be cast with a mold slightly larger than the desired <b>finish</b> <b>size,</b> so that as the molten metal cools, it will harden at just the right point to shrink to the desired size. In contrast, swaged bullets, since they are formed at the temperature at which they will be used, can be formed in molds of the exact desired size.

The swaging process also leads to fewer imperfections, since voids commonly found in casting would be pressed out in the swaging process. The swaging process in reference to cold flow of metals into bullets is the process not of squeezing the metals into smaller forms but rather pressing smaller thinner items to form into shorter and slightly wider shapes.|$|R

40|$|With {{industrial}} progress, the advancements in garment manufacturing {{have evolved}} from cut & sew to complete garment knitting, which produces one entire garment without sewing or linking process. Seamless knitting technology {{is similar to}} sock manufacture, the specialized circular knitting machines producing 3 dimensional garments with no side seams, with the waistband integrated with body of the garment and with knitted washing instructions and logos. The paper starts by presenting the main advantages of seamless garments but also some limitations because the technology.

40|$|Carbon fibres, after {{a period}} of 40 years of {{development}} and use in specialized applications, are now on the brink of broad commercialization. All carbon fiber composites used in today 2 ̆ 7 s applications are manufactured through a molding or extrusion manufacturing process. The finished product is normally not machined. However there are instances where machining to a <b>finished</b> <b>size</b> is desirable. ^ This research is focused on determining the strength and micro-structural characteristics of Uni-Directional vinyl ester-carbon fibre rod after machining with a carbide insert. This study examined the surface fractures, and the micro-structural changes before and after machining the carbon fibre rod. As part of the study, the tensile strength of the carbon fibre rod after machining was observed and stress and strain graphs were plotted. The machining of the carbon fibre was performed with cold compressed air as the coolant and a carbide insert having a trade name of Sandvik was utilized to perform the turning operations. ^ The study was conducted to determine, whether machined vinyl ester-carbon fibre rod retains a tensile strength comparable to virgin solid carbon fibre rod. Also the study determined the changes in the micro-structure of the surface after machining. The hypothesis of this thesis is that the strength of vinyl-ester carbon fiber rod after machining is adequate for use in fields such as automotive, paper production, aerospace and industrial applications. ^ This study also determined a testing method for carbon fibre composite rod. This technique relied on bonding the test rods into machined aluminum holders that could be gripped in an Instron tensile test machine. ...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. A costing system has been evolved for turned components produced {{by a variety of}} machines; the system is based upon a fundamental cost equation which utilises in the main, the manufacturing time of the component, together with its material cost. A technique for predicting the floor to floor time, Ft, has been established based upon {{the size and shape of}} the component in parameters readily available to the designer. The generally accepted setting times for various machines have been corrected to take into account the component complexity. In estimating the material requirements, allowances have been made for material wastage, due to schedule or quantity change, scrap losses and the effect of the operator learning curve on these losses. A graphical presentation of the floor time equation enables the designer to rapidly assess variations in Ft, if he chooses to vary one, or indeed all of the parameters within his control, i. e. material, <b>finish,</b> <b>size,</b> features, etc., etc. in order to meet a certain cost target...|$|R
50|$|Cutter {{location}} is {{the topic of}} where to locate the cutter {{in order to achieve}} the desired contour (geometry) of the workpiece, given that the cutter's size is non-zero. The most common example is cutter radius compensation (CRC) for endmills, where the centerline of the tool will be offset from the target position by a vector whose distance is equal to the cutter's radius and whose direction is governed by the left/right, climb/conventional, up/down distinction. In most implementations of G-code, it is G40 through G42 that control CRC (G40 cancel, G41 left/climb, G42 right/conventional). The radius values for each tool are entered into the offset register(s) by the CNC operator or machinist, who then tweaks them during production {{in order to keep the}} <b>finished</b> <b>sizes</b> within tolerance. Cutter location for 3D contouring in 3-, 4-, or 5-axis milling with a ball-endmill is handled readily by CAM software rather than manual programming. Typically the CAM vector output is postprocessed into G-code by a postprocessor program that is tailored to the particular CNC control model. Some late-model CNC controls accept the vector output directly, and do the translation to servo inputs themselves, internally.|$|R
