5|$|Foundational {{elements}} for a student's learning {{were having a}} concept of (principally diatonic) scales as music and a basis for harmony. One of the teaching tools often used by Tristano, including for scales, was the metronome. The student set the metronome at or near its slowest setting initially, and gradually increased <b>its</b> <b>speed,</b> allowing a sense of time to develop, along with confidence in placing each note.|$|E

50|$|The actual {{maximum speed}} of a {{submarine}} can be much greater than <b>its</b> tactical <b>speed.</b> For instance, the maximum speed (when submerged) of USS Scranton (SSN-756) is 33 knots, whereas <b>its</b> tactical <b>speed</b> is only 12 knots.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Intercity 225, {{shown here}} in the livery of the Flying Scotsman, was so named because <b>its</b> design <b>speed</b> is 225 km/h. Some {{publications}} quote <b>its</b> top <b>speed</b> as [...] "140 mph (225 km/h)", but others only as [...] "140 mph" ...|$|R
5|$|The Solar System travels alone {{through the}} Milky Way in a {{circular}} orbit approximately 30,000light years from the Galactic Centre. <b>Its</b> <b>speed</b> is about 220km/s. The period required for the Solar System to complete one revolution around the Galactic Centre, the galactic year, is {{in the range of}} 220–250 million years. Since its formation, the Solar System has completed at least 20 such revolutions.|$|E
5|$|The V-22 {{deployment}} to Afghanistan was set {{to conclude}} in late 2013 with the drawdown of combat operations; however, VMM-261 was directed to extend operations for a new role, casualty evacuation, {{for which it was}} better suited than helicopters as <b>its</b> <b>speed</b> better enabled casualties to reach a hospital within the 'golden hour'; they were fitted with medical equipment such as heart-monitors and basic triage supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} pintail {{is a popular}} species for game shooting because of <b>its</b> <b>speed,</b> agility, and excellent eating qualities, and is hunted across its range. Although one of the world's most numerous ducks, the combination of hunting with other factors has led to population declines, and local restrictions on hunting have been introduced at times to help conserve numbers.|$|E
50|$|The {{maximum speed}} of trains {{operating}} on a cog railway is very low, generally from 9 to 25 km/h (6 to 16 mph) depending on gradient and propulsion method. Because the Skitube has gentler gradients than typical, <b>its</b> <b>speeds</b> are higher than typical.|$|R
30|$|The line of Beijing Subway is underground, and <b>its</b> general <b>speed</b> {{can reach}} 30 – 40  km/h while <b>its</b> maximum <b>speed</b> can {{run up to}} 80  km/h.

5000|$|If such {{a change}} causes no {{tendency}} for the vehicle to be restored to <b>its</b> original <b>speed</b> and orientation, and no tendency for the vehicle to be driven away from <b>its</b> original <b>speed</b> and orientation, the vehicle {{is said to be}} neutrally stable. The aircraft has zero stability.|$|R
5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. <b>Its</b> <b>speed</b> would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E
5|$|Features of the He 111 were {{apparent}} in the Heinkel He 70. The first single-engined He 70 Blitz ("Lightning") rolled off the line in 1932 and immediately started breaking records. In the normal four-passenger version <b>its</b> <b>speed</b> reached 380km/h (230mph) when powered by a 447kW (600hp) BMW VI engine. The He 70 was designed with an elliptical wing, which the Günther brothers had already incorporated into the Bäumer Sausewind before they joined Heinkel. This wing design became a feature in this and many subsequent designs they developed. The He 70 drew {{the interest of the}} Luftwaffe, which was looking for an aircraft with both bomber and transport capabilities.|$|E
5|$|In Fig.2, the {{corresponding}} {{part of the}} revolving orbit is mn with s as its centre of force. Assume that initially, {{the body in the}} static orbit starts out at right angles to the radius with speed V. The body in the revolving orbit must also start at right angles and assume <b>its</b> <b>speed</b> is v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v > V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v < V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.|$|E

5|$|In Greek Mythology, Canis Major {{represented}} the dog Laelaps, {{a gift from}} Zeus to Europa; or sometimes the hound of Procris, Diana's nymph; or the one given by Aurora to Cephalus, so famed for <b>its</b> <b>speed</b> that Zeus elevated it to the sky. It was also considered to represent one of Orion's hunting dogs, pursuing Lepus the Hare or helping Orion fight Taurus the Bull; and is referred to in this way by Aratos, Homer and Hesiod. The ancient Greeks refer only to one dog, but by Roman times, Canis Minor appears as Orion's second dog. Alternative names include Canis Sequens and Canis Alter. Canis Syrius was the name used in the 1521 Alfonsine tables.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} {{explored}} {{on several occasions}} by robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase <b>its</b> <b>speed</b> and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.|$|E
5|$|Nanda and Hiranandani {{proved to}} be {{instrumental}} in taking Vikrant to war. There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to increased danger on operations. In addition, the three s acquired by the Pakistan Navy posed a significant risk to the carrier. In June, extensive deep sea trials were carried out, with steel safety harnesses around the three boilers still operational. Observation windows were fitted as a precautionary measure, to detect any steam leaks. By the end of June, the trials were complete and Vikrant was cleared to participate on operations, with <b>its</b> <b>speed</b> restricted to 14 knots.|$|E

50|$|In {{contemporary}} use, the Beier variator is {{most widely}} used {{as part of an}} industrial motor drive. An electric induction motor is driven at <b>its</b> ideal <b>speed,</b> derived from the electrical line frequency, and the variator drive is used to manually adjust <b>its</b> output <b>speed.</b> These are often coupled with a cycloidal drive to provide an extra-low speed output.|$|R

5|$|The destroyers Yukikaze and Asagumo plucked 950 {{survivors}} of Kyokusei Maru from the water. These two destroyers, being {{faster than the}} convoy since <b>its</b> <b>speed</b> was dictated by the slower transports, {{broke away from the}} group to disembark the survivors at Lae. The destroyers resumed their escort duties the next day. The convoy – without the troop transport and two destroyers – was attacked again on the evening of 2 March by 11 B-17s, with minor damage to one transport. During the night, PBY Catalina flying boats from No. 11 Squadron RAAF took over the task of shadowing the convoy.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first practical jet engines in the late-World War II period led to calls for new jet-powered versions of practically every aircraft then flying. Among these was {{the design of a}} replacement for the de Havilland Mosquito, at that time among the world's leading light bombers. The Mosquito had been designed with the express intent of lightening the aircraft in order to improve <b>its</b> <b>speed</b> as much as possible, a process that led to the removal of all defensive armament, improving performance {{to the point where it}} was unnecessary anyway. This high-speed approach was extremely successful, and a jet-powered version would be even more difficult to intercept.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B cannot reach Mach2+ speeds; {{its maximum}} speed is Mach1.25 (about 950mph or 1,530km/h at altitude), but its {{low-level}} speed increased to Mach0.92 (700mph, 1,130km/h). The {{speed of the}} current version of the aircraft is limited by the need to avoid damage to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross section (RCS), the B-1B uses serpentine air intake ducts (see S-duct) and fixed intake ramps, which limit <b>its</b> <b>speed</b> compared to the B-1A. Vanes in the intake ducts serve to deflect and shield radar emissions from the highly reflective engine compressor blades.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged {{along by the}} medium, so that the measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of <b>its</b> <b>speed</b> through the medium plus {{the speed of the}} medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E
5|$|Following the accident, Johnson {{suggested}} {{launching the}} D-21 {{from the very}} large Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber, and adding a solid rocket booster to get it up to speed. The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase <b>its</b> <b>speed</b> and allow its ramjet to operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20%. The modified drone version was designated D-21B (there was no D-21A). Two B-52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles. The tail gunner's and electronic warfare officer's stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and telemetry systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons. The launch control officer on the B-52H could communicate with the D-21Bs, and could make it self-destruct.|$|E
5|$|In March 2000, NSB {{announced}} that they were considering {{reducing the number of}} stations on the commuter rail from the then 31 stations to between 15 and 20. NSB stated that 50% of the stations were responsible for only 2% of the traffic, and that a bus service to these areas—which would transport people to the closest railway station—would be more economic and reduce travel time for the remaining passengers. NSB also stated that they indented to re-brand the service as part of the Puls brand used for the other commuter rail services. Part of the reason for the change of service was that Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality had permitted TrønderBilene to double the number of services on their competing coach service along the route and the commuter rail needed to increase <b>its</b> <b>speed</b> to not lose customers to the coach.|$|E
