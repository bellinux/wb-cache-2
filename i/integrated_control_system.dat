In this thesis, we identify and formulate the configuration challenges in the <b>integrated</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> domain, and propose a model-based semi-automated configuration approach to overcome those challenges. Our solution to the configuration problems consists of a UMLbased modeling methodology, named SimPL, and a semi-automated configuration approach. The SimPL methodology enables creating concise abstractions of families of <b>integrated</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> Our semi-automated configuration approach uses constraint satisfaction techniques to provide automation support for deriving products that are guaranteed to be consistent with the SimPL models of their respective product families. We have performed a comprehensive domain analysis to identify characteristics of families of <b>integrated</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> and their configuration challenges. We then derived a set of modeling requirements based on the findings of our domain analysis. The SimPL methodology is proposed to fulfill these requirements. We have defined and formalized the notion of product configuration and its consistency, in the <b>integrated</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> domain, and we have provided mathematical analysis to prove that our approach to configuration ensures the consistency and the correctness of the derived products with respect to their product family models. We have implemented our configuration approach in a configuration engine and we have evaluated its capabilities by applying it to a family of real subsea oil production systems from our industry partner. To evaluate the ability of the SimPL methodology in fulfilling the modeling requirements, we applied it to a large-scale industrial case study. Our experience with the case study shows that the SimPL methodology can provide a model of the product family that meets all the modeling requirements. Moreover, our experiments with the configuration engine shows that up to 50 % of the configuration decisions can be automated using our approach, therefore reducing configuration effort. Furthermore, by taking into account the internal similarities, our approach can offer a higher automation rate of more than 60 %. In conclusion, the research presented in this thesis shows that software configuration in the domain of <b>integrated</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> can be mechanized and automated to a considerable extent. Such automation support can reduce configuration effort and configuration complexity, and can ensure the consistency of final products. Moreover, our work shows that UML-based modeling methodologies, such as SimPL, can be tailored to provide the foundation required for providing the automation support...|$|R

On the basis of generalizationthe disadvantages of inertial and satellite navigation systems it was revealed, {{that as a result of}} theinsufficient compensation of indignations these systems lose a stable condition.

For the solution of this actual problem of the onboardintegrated <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> a method of increase the efficiency of the compensation of indignations of nonstationarylinear systems in the conditions of uncertainty with the observer and with the correction bymistake of recovery was suggested. For this purpose the conditions of uncertainty were mathematicallystated, the equations of the onboard <b>integrated</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> were completed, as non-stationary object ofmanagement, the observer with correction by mistake of recovery and a matrix of factor of strengthening ofthe observer are made.

50|$|A recent {{initiative}} to extend opium production for medicinal purposes called Poppy for Medicine was launched by The Senlis Council which proposes that Afghanistan could produce medicinal opium under a scheme {{similar to that}} operating in Turkey and India.

Senlis is on record advocating reintroduction of poppy into areas of Afghanistan, specifically Kunduz, which has been poppy free for some time.|$|E

In their dossier, the organisation laid out an <b>integrated</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> that combines the involvement of local structures and state authorities such as {{the police and the}} Afghan National Army in order to limit diversion. They argued that by making the medicines locally, value is added to the finished product, the proceeds of which will go towards the economic diversification necessary to break ties with the illegal opium industry and eventually phase out opium production.|$|E

The gun was fully stabilised with a fully computerized <b>integrated</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The secondary armament consisted of a coaxial L8A1 7.62 mm machine gun and another 7.62 mm machine gun mounted on the commander's cupola. An advantage of using two-part ammunition was {{that in the case of}} inert rounds like APDS the loader could reach for the next round and hold it in his lap, ready to load while the gunner was acquiring the target and firing.

5000|$|A recent {{proposal}} from the European Senlis Council hopes {{to solve the}} problems caused by the large quantity of opium produced illegally in Afghanistan, most of which is converted to heroin and smuggled for sale in Europe and the United States. This proposal is to license Afghan farmers to produce opium for the world pharmaceutical market, and thereby solve another problem, that of chronic underuse of potent analgesics where required within developing nations. Part of the proposal is to overcome the [...] "80-20 rule" [...] that requires the U.S. to purchase 80 percent of its legal opium from India and Turkey to include Afghanistan, by establishing a second-tier system of supply control that complements the current INCB regulated supply and demand system by providing poppy-based medicines to countries who cannot meet their demand under the current regulations. Senlis arranged a conference in Kabul that brought drug policy experts {{from around the world to}} meet with Afghan government officials to discuss internal security, corruption issues, and legal issues within Afghanistan.In June 2007, the Council launched a [...] "Poppy for Medicines" [...] project that provides a technical blueprint for the implementation of an <b>integrated</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> within Afghan village-based poppy for medicine projects: the idea promotes the economic diversification by redirecting proceeds from the legal cultivation of poppy and production of poppy-based medicines (See Senlis Council).
