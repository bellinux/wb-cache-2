5000|$|In {{the fourth}} article, {{entitled}} [...] "Pre-Eminent Success of the <b>Differential</b> <b>Piece</b> <b>Rate</b> System", Arnold described the Taylor System as worked {{out by the}} Midvale Steel Company. Especially {{the operation of the}} piece-rate system at Midvale Steel was described, and the analytic method of rate-fixing deveped by Frederick Winslow Taylor. In those days the rates in the piecework system were set by the supervisor. Burton commented, that this paper contained contains some pregnant remarks on the increase of output through the stimulus of unfettered piecework rates, and is deserving of the most grave consideration by English managers and workmen... The justice and economy of piece-work, even under fixed and absolute rates, is admirably expressed." [...] As Arnold stated:Not only does the fast man do more work, but that work is done at a reduced fixed-charges cost, and the intelligent manager discovers that he must greatly increase the pay of the speedy man or decrease the pay of the slow man to make each equally profitable. Under these conditions the piece-rate at once suggests itself as a remedy. The piece-rate stimulates the slow artisan, and justly rewards the quick worker, tends to increase the area output, and lessen the fixed-charges drawback on profits.|$|E
40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{unexpected}} of Frederick Taylor‟s legacies is the alleged influence his ideas {{had in the}} Soviet world. This paper explores this contention by examining the introduction of <b>differential</b> <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> and „scientific ‟ norms—both key aspects of the Taylorist and Soviet systems—in East Germany between 1945 and 1951. As elsewhere, these measures faced stiff opposition. What made this experience different was that their introduction {{took place in the}} context of extreme economic and political uncertainty. As this paper outlines, the party‟s various attempts to impose workplace control laid the foundations for the Sovietisation of East Germany. This paper uses a variety of primary sources to tell this story. It concentrates its attention not just on worker resistance to change, but also on how the interactions between party and worker, between different organisations within the occupation zone, between the Soviets and German communists, and within the party itself came together to see piecework entrenched within the East German workplace. While Taylor‟s ideas influenced the party in this process, they did so only after they had been fed through the prisms of Leninism, Stalinism and Soviet experience. East Germany‟...|$|R

50|$|If {{a worker}} {{will be paid}} on a <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> basis, the worker must be paid the {{prevailing}} <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> {{as determined by the}} State Workers Agency (SWA).

40|$|While <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> are {{routinely}} {{associated with greater}} productivity and higher wages, they may also generate unanticipated effects. This paper uses cross-country European data to provide among the first broad survey evidence of a strong link between <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> and workplace injury. Despite unusually good controls for workplace hazards, job characteristics and worker effort, workers on <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> suffer a large 5 percentage point greater likelihood of injury. As injury rates are typically not controlled for when estimating the premium to <b>piece</b> <b>rates,</b> this raises the specter that {{a portion of the}} return to <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> reflects a compensating wage differential for risk of injury. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares {{relative}} {{performance evaluation}} via tournaments to absolute performance evaluation via <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> when agents are heterogeneous ex post, {{to make the}} point that agent heterogeneity compromises the insurance function of tournaments. In particular, we show that the more heterogeneous agents are the less insurance can be offered through tournaments and the less dominant tournaments are over <b>piece</b> <b>rates.</b> Thus, absolute performance <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> should be preferred when agents are highly heterogeneous. However, even with heterogeneous agents, tournaments become more desirable when the number of agents or the uncertainty about the common shock increases sufficiently. <b>piece</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
30|$|In Proposition 2, {{we focus}} only on the {{relationship}} between the <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> and the firm’s choice between wage cuts and layoffs. We can theoretically confirm that the firm collects funds by implementing only layoffs if the <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> (b) is sufficiently large. Therefore, in a situation where wage cuts damage the worker’s productivity, the higher the <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> b, the more firms try to avoid wage cuts and prefer layoffs.|$|R
30|$|This means that, since a firm whose <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> is b {{expects that}} {{a decline in}} worker {{productivity}} by conducting wage cuts is most sensitive, it conducts layoffs only. From the fact that b is a threshold, if the firm’s <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> is higher than b, it keeps implementing layoffs only, while if a firm’s <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> is lower than b, it simultaneously implements both layoffs and wage cuts. Hence, the following proposition summarizes these results.|$|R
5000|$|Frederick Winslow Taylor {{was one of}} {{the main}} champions of the <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> system in the late 19th century. Although there were many <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> systems in use, they were largely resented and manipulative. One of the most {{influential}} tenets of Scientific Management was Taylor's popularization of the [...] "differential <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> system", which relied on accurate measurements of productivity rates to create a [...] "standard" [...] production output target. Those who were not able to meet the target suffered a penalty and were likely fired. Taylor spread this in published papers in 1895, and the timed <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> system gave birth to creating modern cost control, and as a result, modern corporate organization.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{literature on the}} comparison of tournaments and <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> as alternative incentive schemes {{has focused on the}} case of unlimited liability. However, in practice real workers' wealth is typically restricted. Therefore, this paper compares both schemes under the assumption of limited liability. The results show that if the cost function is suffciently convex, first-best effort will be more likely implemented under <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> than under tournaments. Moreover, if first-best implementation is not achieved and workers earn positive rents, efforts and profits will be larger for <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> than for tournaments given suffciently convex costs. While tournaments offer a partial insurance due to their fixed prizes, <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> may not work any longer if potential losses become prohibitively high. Finally, if risk is suffciently high, <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> will dominate tournaments despite the partial insurance effect of tournament compensation.

As a result, the <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> paid to workers in Period 1 is set below the output price, while the <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> paid to workers in Period 2 is set equal to the output price.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} aging on productivity using piece-rate earnings {{as a proxy for}} worker output. Our data contain the population of Finnish blue collar workers in 61 different industries during 1990 - 2002. A unique feature of the data is that we can observe the exact hours worked on <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> and on fixed time rates as well as earnings under both performance schemes. We account for the selection into <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> by using firm-level changes in pay systems as instruments for the probability of working on <b>piece</b> <b>rates.</b> A subset of workers also receive both <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> and time rates within the same quarter. For these workers, we can directly compare the age profile of hourly earnings under <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> and fixed rates. The results indicate that productivity increases with age until age 40 after which it stays roughly constant.

Using contract production data for broiler chickens, we estimate the variances of growers' abilities, common production shock, and grower's idiosyncratic shock.

40|$|Why {{are women}} disproportionately on <b>piece</b> <b>rates?</b> We {{investigate}} three possible explanations: (1) Women {{are more likely}} to be on <b>piece</b> <b>rates,</b> because they have a shorter expected tenure than men.

(3) Women prefer <b>piece</b> <b>rates,</b> because they are subject to less wage discrimination when objective performance measures are available.

40|$|We {{present results}} from a field {{experiment}} designed to measure the importance of managerial commitment to a contract within a firm that pays its workers <b>piece</b> <b>rates.</b> In the tree planting industry the <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> paid to workers is determined {{as a function of}} the difficulty of the terrain to be planted. During the experiment, workers began planting a terrain at a trial <b>piece</b> <b>rate,</b> but were told this rate would be revised upwards if, after a few work days, average average productivity was below that observed on a similar (control) terrain on which the firm had committed to the contract. Our results suggest that worker productivity was 20 % to 40 % lower in the absence of commitment. The reduction was less pronounced when workers had less time to benefit from any subsequent increase in the <b>piece</b> <b>rate.</b> This provides support for models of worker turnover as a means of overcoming ratchet effects...|$|R
40|$|Previous work {{shows that}} establishments with higher {{proportions}} {{of women are}} more likely to use <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> hut that individual women are less likely to receive performance pay.

40|$|If policy {{prescriptions}} for compensation systems {{are to be}} useful, then they {{must be based on}} the empirical analysis of incentive effects; i. e., the elasticity of worker effort with respect to changes in the compensation system. We measure the elasticity of worker effort with respect to changes in the <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> using panel data collected from the payroll records of a British Columbia tree-planting firm. Our data contain information on daily worker productivity and the <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> received over a five-month period. We highlight the endogeneity problems inherent in traditional empirical analyses of compensation systems. In particular, employing regression methods, which use the sample covariance between <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> and daily productivity to identify the incentive effect, we consistently estimate the elasticity of effort with respect to changes it the <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> to be negative. Using a structural model to control for the endogeneity of the <b>piece</b> <b>rate,</b> we estimate this elasticity to be approximately 2. 2.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} current {{practice}} of motivating agricultural workers in post-socialist settings. In addition, {{it attempts to}} evaluate the different wage systems observed in reality and better understand under which conditions they are reformed. It does so by contrasting the experience of two extreme cases representing fast and slow reform advance, East Germany and North Kazakhstan. The primary data for the analysis comes from cross-sectional farm surveys conducted by various researchers in both countries. East German farmers quickly replaced the inherited Soviet-style <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> payment system by simple time rate schemes, augmented by wage premia for certain performance parameters, especially in livestock. To the contrary, the <b>piece</b> <b>rate</b> approach persists in many farms in North Kazakhstan. Moreover, the latter rarely use non-wage incentives to motivate their workers. In Kazakhstan, farms using either mixed systems or pure <b>piece</b> <b>rates</b> were more productive than the reference group using pure time rates.
