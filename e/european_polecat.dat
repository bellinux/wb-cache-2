5|$|Despite {{the name}} fisher, {{the animal is}} not known to eat fish. The name is instead related to the word fitch, meaning a <b>European</b> <b>polecat</b> (Mustela putorius) or pelt thereof, due to the {{resemblance}} to that animal. The name comes from colonial Dutch equivalent fisse or visse. In the French language, the pelt of a polecat is also called fiche or fichet.|$|E
5|$|Other animals became locally extinct through overhunting. The last elk in Pennsylvania {{was killed}} in Elk County in 1867. The Pennsylvania Game Commission brought 177 animals from the Rocky Mountains to the state from 1913 to 1926; today the elk herd of over 600 animals can often be seen in Quehanna Wild Area. Between 1906 and 1925, Pennsylvania became so {{concerned}} about declining numbers of white-tailed deer that it imported nearly 1,200animals from Michigan to re-establish the species, and made it the official state animal in 1959. In the early 21st century, over-grazing by deer threatens plant diversity. By the early 20th century, the fisher, a small mammal similar to the <b>European</b> <b>polecat</b> or American marten, was hunted to extinction in Pennsylvania. Between 1994 and 1998, 190animals were released in five sites {{in the northern part}} of the state, including 23animals along Quehanna's Wykoff Run in 1995. Breeding populations of fisher appear to have been reestablished.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} {{physiology of}} the black-footed ferret {{is similar to}} that of the <b>European</b> <b>polecat</b> and the steppe polecat. It is probably polygynous, based on data collected from home range sizes, skewed sex ratios, and sexual dimorphism. Mating occurs in February and March. When a male and female in estrus encounter each other, the male sniffs the genital region of the female, but does not mount her until after a few hours have elapsed, which is contrast to the more violent behavior displayed by the male <b>European</b> <b>polecat.</b> During copulation, the male grasps the female by the nape of the neck, with the copulatory tie lasting from 1.5–3 hours. Unlike other mustelids, the black-footed ferret is a habitat specialist with low reproductive rates. In captivity, gestation of black-footed ferrets lasts 42–45 days. Litter size ranges from 1–5 kits. Kits are born in May and June in prairie dog burrows. Kits are altricial and are raised by their mother for several months after birth. Kits first emerge above ground in July, at 6 weeks old. They are then separated into individual prairie dog burrows around their mother's burrow. Kits reach adult weight and become independent several months following birth, from late August to October. Sexual maturity occurs at one year of age.|$|E

50|$|One {{scientific}} speculation {{has pointed}} towards frog spawn {{which has been}} vomited up by amphibian-eating creatures (notably <b>European</b> <b>polecats),</b> though no frog spawn has ever approached the size of some reported cases of star jelly. The German terms Sternenrotz (star snot) and Meteorgallerte (meteorite jelly) are known to refer to more or less digested frog spawn vomited by predators (Schlüpmann 2007). This is quite easy to identify by its smell and found in winter and early spring near frog spawning sites.|$|R
50|$|In {{areas where}} the beech marten is {{sympatric}} with the pine marten, the two species avoid competing with one another by assuming different ecological niches; the pine marten feeds on birds and rodents more frequently, while the beech marten feeds on fruits and insects. There is however one case of a subadult beech marten being killed by a pine marten. The beech marten {{has been known to}} kill <b>European</b> <b>polecats</b> on rare occasions. Red foxes, lynxes and mountain lions may prey on adults, whereas juveniles are vulnerable from attack by birds of prey and wildcats. There is, however, one case from Germany of a beech marten killing a domestic cat.|$|R
25|$|The {{black-footed ferret}} {{is roughly the}} size of a mink, and differs from the <b>European</b> <b>polecat</b> by the greater {{contrast}} between its dark limbs and pale body and the shorter length of its black tail-tip. In contrast, differences between the black-footed ferret and the steppe polecat of Asia are slight, {{to the point where the}} two species were once thought to be conspecific. The only noticeable differences between the black-footed ferret and the steppe polecat are the former's much shorter and coarser fur, larger ears, and longer postmolar extension of the palate.|$|E
25|$|Rila Monastery Nature Park is {{inhabited}} by 202 vertebrate species. There are 52 species of mammals. The number of bats species is 15, or 50% {{of the diversity}} in Bulgaria and 45% in Europe. There are 20 species of small mammals: 9 Insectivora, 1 Lagomorpha and 13 Rodentia.

25|$|Like {{its close}} cousin, the Asian steppe polecat (with {{which it was}} {{once thought to be}} conspecific), the black-footed ferret {{represents}} a more progressive form than the <b>European</b> <b>polecat</b> in the direction of carnivory. The black-footed ferret's most likely ancestor was Mustela stromeri (from which the European and steppe polecat are also derived), which originated in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene. Molecular evidence indicates that the steppe polecat and black-footed ferret diverged from Mustela stromeri sometime between 500,000 and 2,000,000 years ago, perhaps in Beringia. The species appeared in the Great Basin and the Rockies by 750,000 years ago. The oldest recorded fossil find originates from Cathedral Cave, White Pine County, Nevada, and dates back to 750,000–950,000 years ago. Prairie dog fossils have been found in six sites where ferrets are yielded, thus indicating that the association between the two species is an old one. Anecdotal observations and 42% of examined fossil records indicated that any substantial colony of medium- to large-sized colonial ground squirrels, such as Richardson's ground squirrels, may provide a sufficient prey base and a source of burrows for black-footed ferrets. This suggests that the black-footed ferret and prairie dogs did not historically have an obligate predator-prey relationship. The species has likely always been rare, and the modern black-footed ferret represents a relic population. A reported occurrence of the species is from a late Illinoian deposit in Clay County, Nebraska, and is further recorded from Sangamonian deposits in Nebraska and Medicine Hat. Fossils have also been found in Alaska dating from the Pleistocene.|$|E

5000|$|After reunification, the A 143 {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{projects}} to begin planning under the new government. The A 143 project was placed under top priority in the Bundesverkehrswegeplan (Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan) of 1992, and the original plan was for at least part of the highway to open within a year. However, the A 143's path goes through an environmentally sensitive area, part of which is protected by the Habitats Directive. The southernmost 9 km was not built and opened until July 11, 2005. [...] Construction on the remaining 12.6 km is currently blocked from proceeding after a successful lawsuit by the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU).

50|$|A 2002 {{article in}} The Mammal Society's Mammal Review contested the <b>European</b> <b>polecat's</b> {{status as an}} animal {{indigenous}} to the British Isles on account of a scarce fossil record and linguistic evidence. Unlike most native British mammals, the polecat's Welsh name (ffwlbart, derived from the Middle English foulmart) is not of Celtic origin, much as the Welsh names of invasive species such as the European rabbit and fallow deer (cwningen, derived from the Middle English konyng and danas, derived from the Old French dain, respectively) are of Middle English or Old French origin. Polecats are not mentioned in Anglo-Saxon or Welsh literature prior to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, with the first recorded mention of the species in the Welsh language occurring in the 14th century's Llyfr Coch Hergest and in English in Chaucer’s The Pardoner’s Tale (1383). In contrast, attestations of the Welsh word for pine marten (bele), date {{back at least to}} the 10th century Welsh Laws and possibly much earlier in northern England.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} true polecat was Mustela stromeri, {{which appeared}} during the late Villafranchian period. It was considerably smaller than the present form, thus indicating polecats evolved at a relatively late period. The steppe polecat's closest relatives are the <b>European</b> <b>polecat</b> and black-footed ferret, with which it {{is thought to have}} shared Mustela stromeri as a common ancestor. The steppe polecat likely diverged from the <b>European</b> <b>polecat</b> 1.5 million years ago based on IRBP, though cytochrome b transversions indicate a younger date of 430,000 years. As a species, the steppe polecat represents a more specialised form than the <b>European</b> <b>polecat</b> in the direction of carnivory, being more adapted to preying on larger rodent species; its skull has a stronger dentition, its projections are more strongly developed and its muscles of mastication are more powerful. The steppe polecat's growth rate is also much slower than the European polecat's, as its skull undergoes further development at an age when the <b>European</b> <b>polecat</b> attains full growth. The species may have once been present in Pleistocene central Alaska.|$|E
40|$|Ferrets (Mustela furo) were domesticated from polecats (M. putorius, M. eversmannii) over 2000 years ago. Following their {{introduction}} to Britain, they escaped and hybridized with native <b>European</b> <b>polecats</b> (M. putorius). Native polecats declined {{to the point}} of near extinction prior to World War I, but have recently begun to expand from a Welsh refugium. Concern has arisen as to the extent of polecat/ferret introgression, and in particular, whether the expanding population is of mainly hybrid origin. Therefore, mitochondrial DNA sequencing was used to investigate polecat genetic diversity in Britain. Two geographically distinct lineages were found, where one may be ancestral to the British polecat, and the other to the domestic ferret. The ancestral distribution of each lineage, or assortative mating is sucient to explain the observed pattern. A further comparison between the distribution of the polecat phenotype and mitochondrial haplotype implies that the current population expansion may be mediated by dispersing male polecats hybridizing with female feral ferrets. However, the wild source of the ferret remains obscure. Relatively recent spe-ciation from European mink (M. lutreola) and black-footed ferrets (M. nigripes), and/or the eects of hybridization result in a...|$|R
40|$|Heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) is a {{parasitic}} roundworm {{that causes}} a zoonotic disease known as dirofilariosis.

Therefore, we examined 738 hearts and lungs of free ranging wild carnivores from Serbia to determine the presence of adult heartworms. During the period 2009 - 2013, the prevalence in golden jackals (Canis aureus) was 7. 32 %, in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) 1. 55 %, in wolves (Canis lupus) 1. 43 %, and in wild cats (Felis silvestris) 7. 69 %.

50|$|Although superficially {{similar to}} the European mink, studies {{indicate}} the American mink's closest relative is the Siberian weasel (kolonok) of Asia.

50|$|Unlike the stoat {{and least}} weasel, the <b>European</b> <b>polecat</b> {{is easy to}} breed in captivity.

It is prone to attempting escape once finished bolting rats, but can be easily outrun. Polecat kits can be successfully raised and suckled by mother cats. According to Owen's Welsh Dictionary, the Gwythelians (early Irish settlers in northern Wales) kept polecats as pets.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{possible}} role of {{disease in the}} decline of endangered European mink (Mustela lutreola), we conducted a survey of antibody prevalence and renal carriage of pathogenic leptospira (Leptospira interrogans sensu lato) using serum and kidney samples collected from 1990 to 2007 from several free-ranging small carnivores and farmed American mink (Mustela vison) in southwestern France. An indirect microscopic agglutination test using a panel of 16 serovars belonging to 6 serogroups (Australis, Autumnalis, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Grippotyphosa, Panama, Sejroe) revealed antibodies in all species, with significant differences in antibody prevalences: 74 % in European mink (n= 99), 65. 4 % in <b>European</b> <b>polecats</b> (Mustela putorius, n= 133), 86 % in American mink (n= 74), 89 % in stone martens (Martes foina, n= 19), 74 % in pine martens (Martes martes, n= 19), 35 % in corn moo genets (Genetta genetta, n= 79), and 31. % in farmed American mink (n= 51). Serogroups Australis and Icterohaemorragiae were dominant in most free-ranging species; serogroup Grippotyphosa had high prevalences in European mink. Such high antibody prevalences have never been reported. They are probably related to {{the large number of}} known reservoirs, rats (Rattus spp.), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), and coypu (Myocastor coypu), in the study area. The polymerase chain reaction test specific for pathogenic leptospiral DNA detected renal carriage in 23 % of 34 European mink, 22 % of 18 polecats, and 15 % of 33 free-ranging American mink, with no significant differences. Renal carriage shows that mustelids may shed leptospira for short periods, but their epidemiologic role is probably limited. High antibody prevalences suggest that the disease is unlikely to be highly pathogenic for these species; however, chronic forms of the disease (abortions, renal lesions) could reduce the reproductive success or life span of infected animals. Further studies on the pathogenicity of leptospirosis in these populations are needed to measure its impact on the population dynamics of these rodent predators...|$|R

It greatly resembles the black-footed ferret of North America, with the only noticeable differences between them being the steppe polecat's much longer and softer fur, shorter ears, and shorter postmolar extension of the palate. It has four pairs of teats and well-developed anal glands, which can produce a sharp-smelling liquid which is sprayed in self-defence. Males measure 320-562 mm in body length, while females measure 290-520 mm. Tail length of males is 80-183 mm and 290-520 mm for females.

The feet on both surfaces are covered in hair, even to the soles, thus concealing the claws. It combines several physical features common in both members of the subgenus Gale (least, short-tailed and long-tailed weasels) and Putorius (<b>European</b> and steppe <b>polecats).</b> Its skull resembles that of polecats in its size, massiveness {{and the development of}} its ridges and depressions, though it is distinguished by the extreme degree of constriction behind the orbits where the width of the cranium is much less than that of the muzzle.

40|$|Human-mediated {{global change}} will {{probably}} increase {{the rates of}} natural hybridization and genetic introgression between closely related species, and this will have major implications for conservation of the taxa involved. In this study, we analyse both mitochondrial and nuclear data to characterize ongoing hybridization and genetic introgression between two sympatric sister species of mustelids, the endangered European mink (Mustela lutreola) and the more abundant polecat (M. putorius). A total of 317 <b>European</b> mink, 114 <b>polecats</b> and 15 putative hybrid individuals were collected from different localities in Europe and genotyped with 13 microsatellite nuclear markers. Recently developed Bayesian methods for assigning individuals to populations and identifying admixture proportions were applied to the genetic data. To identify the direction of hybridization, we additionally sequenced mtDNA and Y chromosomes from 78 individuals and 29 males respectively. We found that both hybridization and genetic introgression occurred at low levels (3 % and 0. 9 % respectively) and indicated that hybridization is asymmetric, as only pure polecat males mate with pure European mink females. Furthermore, backcrossing and genetic introgression was detected only from female first-generation (F 1) hybrids of <b>European</b> mink to <b>polecats.</b> This latter result implies that Haldane's rule may apply. Our results suggest that hybridization and genetic introgression between the two species {{should be considered a}} rather uncommon event. However, the current low densities of European mink might be changing this trend. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Species {{definitions}} are discussed, {{with particular}} reference to biological species concepts and the conservation viewpoint. Techniques available for examining differences between populations and species of animals are reviewed. The most recent techniques using nuclear or mitochondrial DNA have been effectively used in hybridisation studies of mammal species. The occurrence of hybridisation between four pairs of British mammals are examined in detail. Hybridisation between mountain hare and brown hare {{is very rare}} under natural conditions and hybrids in Britain would appear to present only novelty value. The genetic mix of red and sika deer in Britain is complex. Morphometric {{studies have suggested that}} hybridisation between these two species is widespread in some areas. Current investigations using molecular and genetic techniques hope to further evaluate the real extent of hybridisation and introgression. Current evidence suggests that introgression of sika into the red deer populations will increase rather than decrease. Whether wildcats and domestic cats can be considered to be subspecies or separate species is unresolved. Past European studies, mainly skull morphometrics, suggested that hybridisation between the two types was widespread. The proportion of hybrids within a population has yet to be objectively measured. Current research in Scotland is using DNA techniques, sampling living and historic cats across Scotland. British ferrets are probably domesticated directly from <b>European</b> <b>polecats.</b> The recent spread of polecats from Wales into the English Midlands may lead to the introgression of domestic genes into wild polecats. However, it is not known to what extent feral ferrets survive in mainland Britain, and as yet hybridisation is not perceived as a substantial threat to the species. Examples of hybridisation in British Birds and fish are summarised. Many bird species hybridise and the reasons for this are discussed. Conservation issues concerning ruddy ducks, crossbills and goshawks are briefly outlined. In conclusion, the two mammals at greatest risk from hybridisation and subsequent loss of native type, are the wildcat and red deer. The importance of maintaining native habitat for native species is also stressed. It is recommended that studies initiated using modern molecular techniques be followed through, and that hypotheses based on these findings, about the ecological/behavioural reasons for hybridisation be investigated. Even though the best methods available are used, it should be recognised that descriptions of a species for legal purposes will contain a degree of subjectivity. ...|$|R
