Several cameras use DNG as their raw file format, so in that limited sense they use TIFF/EP too.|$|E
40|$|Answering range queries is {{a common}} {{database}} opera-tion. Methods based on hashing techniques to minimise the cost of answering range queries by taking the query distri-bution into account have previously been proposed. These methods have all assumed a uniform distribution of data to disk pages to achieve good performance. This assumption makes them less useful in practice because most real da-ta distributions are non-uniform. In this paper, we discuss a method to eliminate this restriction. Extensive experimenta-tion using a multi-dimensional file structure, the BANG file, indicates that our method results in good performance for all data distributions. In one case an improvement of over 36 times was achieved without compromising the storage u-tilisation. Our method also results in a stable and efficient <b>file</b> <b>organisation.</b> If the query distribution does not change substantially, an optimised <b>file</b> <b>organisation</b> rarely requires reorganisation. 1...|$|E

Retrieval using secondary attributes depends on several factors. For secondary attribute retrieval, the linear structures—inverted lists, multilists, doubly linked lists—and the recently proposed nonlinear tree structures—multiple attribute tree (MAT), K-d tree (kdT) —have their individual merits. It is shown in this paper that, of the two tree structures, MAT possesses several features of a systematic data structure for external <b>file</b> <b>organisation</b> which make it superior to kdT.

40|$|Modern {{computer}} systems {{are based on}} the traditional hierarchical file system model, but typically contain large numbers of files with complex interrelationships. This traditional model is not capable of meeting the needs of current computer system users, who {{need to be able to}} store and retrieve files based on flexible criteria. A metadata file system can associate an extensive and rich set of data with a file, thus enabling more effective <b>file</b> <b>organisation</b> and retrieval than traditional file systems. In this paper we review a wide range of existing proposals to add metadata to files and make that metadata available for searching. We then propose a hierarchy of definitions for metadata file systems based on the reviewed prototypes. We introduce a data model for a database-oriented pure mdfss complete with operations and semantics. The model supports user-initiated instance and schema updates and file searches based on structured queries. We also explore the design space of a set of user interface operations intended to implement the pure model and facilitate the capturing of rich metadata. We argue that without such a simple method for users to create rich metadata, progress in this field will remain limited...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} and political crisis of 1931 provoked the reappearance of rank and file movements in Britain. This article examines the unofficial organisations that developed in building, engineering, passenger transport and the railways – {{as well as more}} ephemeral bodies. It critically synthesises the existing historiography and replenishes it with new material from the Russian archives. The progress of rank and filism to 1939 is surveyed and the largely forgotten project of a new Communist-led rank and <b>file</b> <b>organisation,</b> a Trade Union Militant League, which would supersede the National Minority Movement, is recuperated. The article stresses the role of Comintern policy in harnessing and moulding grass-roots rebellion. It validates that strand in the literature which argues that Moscow’s subsequent turn to the popular front and aspirations to alliances with labour movement leaders predominated over, and legitimated, indigenous influences, enhanced existing adaptation to trade unionism, and encouraged subordination of oppositional movements to activity in official structures. By 1939, the Communists had abandoned the idea of a national rank and file movement they had pursued since 1923. Little survived of the revolutionary enterprise launched in 1931. Rank and filism endured only as a handful of sectional, party-sponsored, trade union ginger groups...|$|E

Many different record indexing techniques can be used to cluster records. Multiattribute hash indexing is the indexing technique which we use to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposals. We describe algorithms which exploit a clustering arrangement for range queries, join queries and other relational queries, and describe the costs of these algorithms. We compare the performance of various optimisation techniques for the problem of optimally clustering records using each of these algorithms. In general, designing optimal indexes to cluster records is NP-hard. We show that by combining heuristic and combinatorial algorithms, near-optimal indexes can be constru [...] ...|$|R

We propose a knowledge-based user interface, called a Virtual Secretary (VS), for file management. The {{system is designed}} to emulate the basic behaviour of a human secretary, and it allows a user to instruct the VS to perform tasks for managing files, instead of manipulating files directly through windows as with a conventional operating system. The system {{is supported by a}} knowledge base and a collection of Agents, which are programs that manage and process the knowledge collected, and work behind the scene aiding gradual proliferation of knowledge. In this paper, we present our experience in designing and implementing a VS user interface, its system architecture, its knowledge base and a collection of agents. We demonstrate that it is desirable as well as feasible to deploy a knowledge base in supporting an intelligent user interface that acts like a human assistant who handles paperwork, looks after filing, security and so on.

40|$|In Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, Espen J. Aarseth {{introduces}} {{the notion of}} cybertext. Rather than a sequence of signifiers cybertext (cf. cybernetics) denotes a textual machine, a mechanical device for generating signifiers. Montford adds the distinction between two types of automata: linear bounded automata and Turing machines. A finite automaton allows for {{a finite number of}} inputs, which it either accepts or rejects and with which it accomplishes computational tasks. A Turing machine theoretically allows for an infinite number of different operations. Nelson defined hypertext as "non-sequential writing. " Since (static) hypertext consists of a certain number of nodes connected by links, the number of possible pathways is limited. Consequently hypertext should be considered a finite automaton. On a dynamic website driven by a database, text can be produced according to hard-coded links and associations, {{but it can also be}} manipulated by all kinds of programming algorithms turning it into a Turing machine. In 1991 Paul Lindner and Mark P. McCahill release gopher, an Internet application protocol permitting hierarchically organised file systems to be shared over the Internet. Gopher is hierarchical and should therefore be seen as database- rather than hypertext-oriented. In May 1991, the World Wide Web (www) is officially released by CERN in Switzerland. Like gopher, the World Wide Web allows the user to access information from anywhere in the world and display it directly in a client viewer (browser). Thanks to the hypertext aesthetic, www is not restricted to a strict hierarchical database structure. By March 1994 www byte-traffic passes gopher byte-traffic on NSFnet. Later that year www edges out telnet to become the second most popular service on the net (behind ftp). In recent years however, the web seems to witness a return of database design. The need for more search power and increased manageability drives developers of large websites away from the one page / one <b>file</b> <b>organisation</b> html was originally designed for. Instead, complex textual machines are devised, which retrieve their information from databases and generate html pages according to sophisticated logic. Within the medial amalgamation of hypertext and database structuring we are witnessing today, both systems are doing what they are good at. On the surface (interface) level, web-design remains hypertext design. On the storage level however computational power is playing its game. That is where hypertext becomes cybertext, electronic text generated according to an almost endless set of possible variables. New initiatives are launched to combine the strengths of both database and hypertext design in one strong principle. xml (eXtensible Markup Language), a recent addition to the standards put forward by the www consortium may be a first step towards this marriage, a semantic web powered by cybertext, not just hypertext and databases...|$|E
