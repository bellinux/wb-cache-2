5|$|Cancers can be {{analyzed}} using genetic techniques (including DNA sequencing and <b>immunohistochemistry)</b> to determine if certain therapies specific to mutated genes {{can be used to}} treat it. PARP inhibitors are used to treat endometrial cancer with PTEN mutations, specifically, mutations that lower the expression of PTEN. The PARP inhibitor shown to be active against endometrial cancer is olaparib. Research is ongoing in this area as of the 2010s.|$|E
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are classically well to {{moderately}} differentiated adenocarcinomas. <b>Immunohistochemistry</b> {{is useful}} in the diagnosis and {{may be used to}} help differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis of other gastrointestinal tumors. Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.|$|E
5|$|Proteins may be {{purified}} {{from other}} cellular components {{using a variety}} of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification. Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include <b>immunohistochemistry,</b> site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.|$|E
5|$|Other {{possibilities}} exist, as well. For example, <b>immunohistochemistry</b> usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E
5|$|In research, {{purified}} antibodies {{are used}} in many applications. Antibodies for research applications can be found directly from antibody suppliers, or through use of a specialist search engine. Research antibodies are most commonly used to identify and locate intracellular and extracellular proteins. Antibodies {{are used in}} flow cytometry to differentiate cell types by the proteins they express; different types of cell express different combinations of cluster of differentiation molecules on their surface, and produce different intracellular and secretable proteins. They are also used in immunoprecipitation to separate proteins and anything bound to them (co-immunoprecipitation) from other molecules in a cell lysate, in Western blot analyses to identify proteins separated by electrophoresis, and in <b>immunohistochemistry</b> or immunofluorescence to examine protein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells {{with the assistance of}} a microscope. Proteins can also be detected and quantified with antibodies, using ELISA and ELISPOT techniques.|$|E
25|$|Histology is {{the study}} of the {{structures}} of biological tissues by light microscopy, electron microscopy and <b>immunohistochemistry.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{expression}} of Ki-67 by <b>immunohistochemistry</b> {{may be a}} significant predictor of patient outcome for men with prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} diagnosis relies on histopathological examination of the medulla oblongata of the brain, and other tissues, post mortem. <b>Immunohistochemistry</b> {{can be used to}} demonstrate prion protein accumulation.|$|E
25|$|Other related {{techniques}} include {{dot blot}} analysis, quantitative dot blot, <b>immunohistochemistry,</b> and immunocytochemistry where antibodies {{are used to}} detect proteins in tissues and cells by immunostaining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).|$|E
25|$|To {{localize}} INMT, {{a qualitative}} leap is accomplished {{with use of}} modern techniques of molecular biology, and of <b>immunohistochemistry.</b> In humans, a gene encoding INMT is determined to be located on chromosome 7. Northern blot analyses reveal INMT messenger RNA (mRNA) to be highly expressed in rabbit lung, and in human thyroid, adrenal gland, and lung. Intermediate levels of expression are found in human heart, skeletal muscle, trachea, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, testis, prostate, placenta, lymph node, and spinal cord. Low to very low levels of expression are noted in rabbit brain, and human thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, colon, ovary, and bone marrow. INMT mRNA expression is absent in human peripheral blood leukocytes, whole brain, and in tissue from 7 specific brain regions (thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, amygdala, substantia nigra, and corpus callosum). <b>Immunohistochemistry</b> showed INMT {{to be present in}} large amounts in glandular epithelial cells of small and large intestines. In 2011, <b>immunohistochemistry</b> revealed the presence of INMT in primate nervous tissue including retina, spinal cord motor neurons, and pineal gland.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} ion {{channels}} often involves biophysics, electrophysiology, and pharmacology, while using techniques including voltage clamp, patch clamp, <b>immunohistochemistry,</b> X-ray crystallography, fluoroscopy, and RT-PCR. Their classification as molecules {{is referred to}} as channelomics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Immunohistochemistry</b> - {{the use of}} {{antibodies}} to detect the presence, abundance, and localization of specific proteins. This technique is critical to distinguishing between disorders with similar morphology, as well as characterizing the molecular properties of certain cancers.|$|E
25|$|At 65, {{instead of}} retiring, Leblond {{continued}} his research with an NIH Fogarty Scholarship at the National Institute of Dental Research, {{where he learned}} about <b>immunohistochemistry.</b> This launched a twenty-year molecular exploration culminating {{in the concept of}} the basement membrane as an integrated polymer, rather than as layers of separated macromolecules initially favored by others.|$|E
25|$|Electron {{microscopy}} - {{the examination}} of tissue with an electron microscope, which allows much greater magnification, enabling the visualization of organelles within the cells. Its use has been largely supplanted by <b>immunohistochemistry,</b> {{but it is still}} in common use for certain tasks, including the diagnosis of kidney disease and the identification of immotile cilia syndrome.|$|E
25|$|With <b>immunohistochemistry,</b> {{the chief}} cells {{located in the}} cell balls are {{positive}} for chromogranin, synaptophysin, neuron specific enolase, serotonin, neurofilament and Neural cell adhesion molecule; they are S-100 protein negative. The sustentacular cells are S-100 positive and focally positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein. By histochemistry, the paraganglioma cells are argyrophilic, periodic acid Schiff negative, mucicarmine negative, and argentaffin negative.|$|E
25|$|PSA is {{produced}} in the epithelial cells of the prostate, and can be demonstrated in biopsy samples or other histological specimens using <b>immunohistochemistry.</b> Disruption of this epithelium, for example in inflammation or benign prostatic hyperplasia, may lead to some diffusion of the antigen into the tissue around the epithelium, and {{is the cause of}} elevated blood levels of PSA in these conditions.|$|E
25|$|Once {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{for a given}} substance {{have been}} produced, {{they can be used}} to detect the presence of this substance. The Western blot test and immuno dot blot tests detect the protein on a membrane. They are also very useful in <b>immunohistochemistry,</b> which detect antigen in fixed tissue sections and immunofluorescence test, which detect the substance in a frozen tissue section or in live cells.|$|E
25|$|As an {{antibody}} technique, <b>immunohistochemistry</b> (IHC) {{allows for}} validating protein presence. It, and immunocytochemistry, allow for surveying the localization of proteases on a tissue or cellular scale respectively. It also can evaluate for the localization of cleavage products using monoclonal antibodies raised against neo-epitopes of cleavage sites produced by protease processing. Unfortunately, {{in addition to}} providing little functional information, IHC is also non-quantitative, making it an unappealing option for describing degradomics on system-wide scales.|$|E
25|$|Western {{blotting}} {{allows the}} detection of specific proteins from extracts made from cells or tissues, before or after any purification steps. Proteins are generally separated by size using gel electrophoresis before being transferred to a synthetic membrane via dry, semi-dry, or wet blotting methods. The membrane can then be probed using antibodies using methods similar to <b>immunohistochemistry,</b> but without a need for fixation. Detection is typically performed using peroxidase linked antibodies to catalyse a chemiluminescent reaction.|$|E
25|$|Pathology as {{a medical}} {{specialty}} is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic, physiologic changes produced by them. As a diagnostic specialty, pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays {{a large role in}} evidence-based medicine. Many modern molecular tests such as flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), <b>immunohistochemistry,</b> cytogenetics, gene rearrangements studies and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) fall within the territory of pathology.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{breast cancer}} cells {{look the same}} whether they {{are found in the}} breast or have spread {{to another part of the}} body. So, if a tissue sample taken from a tumor in the lung {{contains}} cells that look like breast cells, the doctor determines that the lung tumor is a secondary tumor. Still, the determination of the primary tumor can often be very difficult, and the pathologist may have to use several adjuvant techniques, such as <b>immunohistochemistry,</b> FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), and others. Despite the use of techniques, in some cases the primary tumor remains unidentified.|$|E
25|$|A good initial Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) and MGMT {{methylation}} {{are associated}} with longer survival. A DNA test can be conducted on glioblastomas {{to determine whether or}} not the promoter of the MGMT gene is methylated. Patients with a methylated MGMT promoter have longer survival than those with an unmethylated MGMT promoter, due in part to increased sensitivity to temozolomide. This DNA characteristic is intrinsic to the patient and currently cannot be altered externally. Another positive prognostic marker for glioblastoma patients is mutation of the IDH1 gene, which can be tested by DNA-based methods or by <b>immunohistochemistry</b> using an antibody against the most common mutation, namely IDH1-R132H.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 20% of all {{examined}} human tumor samples {{display a}} mutated B-Raf gene. The {{overwhelming majority of}} these mutations involve the exchange of a single amino acid: Val 600 into Glu,and this aberrant gene product (BRAF-V600E) can be visualized by <b>immunohistochemistry</b> for clinical molecular diagnostics The aberration can mimic the activation loop phosphorylation and - by jumping all control steps at normal activation - immediately render the kinase domain fully active. Since B-Raf can also activate itself by homodimerisation and c-Raf by heterodimerisation, this mutation has a catastrophic effect by turning the ERK1/2 pathway constitutively active, and driving an uncontrolled process of cell division.|$|E
25|$|HPV+OPC is {{not merely}} {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} HPV-16. Only the expression of viral oncogenes within the tumor cells plus the serum presence of E6 or E7 antibodies is unambiguously conclusive. There is not a standard HPV testing method in head and neck cancers, both in situ hybridization (ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are commonly used. Both methods have comparable performance for HPV detection, however it is important to use appropriate sensitivity controls. <b>Immunohistochemistry</b> (IHC) staining of the tissue for p16 is frequently used as a cost effective surrogate for HPV in OPC, compared to ISH or PCR but there is a small incidence of HPV-negative p16-positive disease accounting for about 5% of HPV-OPC.|$|E
25|$|There are {{uncertainties}} {{with this}} approach using current microscopy techniques. If {{it is possible to}} replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone, then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique. However, as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events (particularly at synapses, but also at other places on the neuron's cell membrane), this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions. It may be possible to extend the techniques of serial sectioning and to capture the internal molecular makeup of neurons, through the use of sophisticated <b>immunohistochemistry</b> staining methods that could then be read via confocal laser scanning microscopy. However, as the physiological genesis of 'mind' is not currently known, this method {{may not be able to}} access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity.|$|E
2500|$|Immunostaining {{of cells}} on slides by Microscopy (<b>ImmunoHistoChemistry</b> or Fluorescence), on {{microplates}} by photometry including the ELISPOT (and its variant FluoroSpot) to enumerate B-Cells or antigen-specific cells, in solution by Flow cytometry ...|$|E
2500|$|Estrogen receptors are over-expressed {{in around}} 70% {{of breast cancer}} cases, {{referred}} to as [...] "ER-positive", and can be demonstrated in such tissues using <b>immunohistochemistry.</b> Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain why this causes tumorigenesis, and the available evidence suggests that both mechanisms contribute: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fluorescent}} species used in FCS {{is typically}} a biomolecule {{of interest that}} has been tagged with a fluorophore (using <b>immunohistochemistry</b> for instance), or is a naked fluorophore {{that is used to}} probe some environment of interest (e.g. the cytoskeleton of a cell). [...] The following table gives diffusion coefficients of some common fluorophores in water at room temperature, and their excitation wavelengths.|$|E
2500|$|Antibodies to Bcl-2 can be {{used with}} <b>immunohistochemistry</b> to {{identify}} cells containing the antigen. In healthy tissue, these antibodies react with B-cells in the mantle zone, as well as some T-cells. However, positive cells increase [...] considerably in follicular lymphoma, as well as many other forms of cancer. In some cases, {{the presence or absence of}} Bcl-2 staining in biopsies may be significant for the patient's prognosis or likelihood of relapse.|$|E
2500|$|EIN Biomarkers. (Figure 1). There are {{no single}} {{biomarkers}} which are completely informative {{in recognition of}} EIN. [...] The tumour suppressor gene PTEN is frequently inactivated in EIN, being abnormally turned off in approximately 2/3 of all EIN lesions. [...] This can be seen with special tissue stains applied to histological sections known as PTEN <b>immunohistochemistry,</b> in which the brown PTEN protein is seen to be absent in the crowded tubular glands {{that make up an}} EIN lesion.|$|E
2500|$|The use of <b>immunohistochemistry</b> has {{permitted}} pathologists to give {{an identity}} to many of these metastases. However, imaging of the indicated area only occasionally reveals a primary. [...] In rare cases (e.g., of melanoma), no primary tumor is found, even on autopsy. It is therefore thought that some primary tumors can regress completely, but leave their metastases behind. In other cases, the tumor might just be too small and/or in an unusual location to be diagnosed.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescein {{can also}} be {{conjugated}} to nucleoside triphosphates and incorporated into a probe enzymatically for in situ hybridisation. The use of fluorescein amidite shown above allows one to synthesize labeled oligonucleotides for the same purpose. Yet another technique termed molecular beacons makes use of synthetic fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides. [...] Fluorescein-labelled probes can be imaged using FISH, or targeted by antibodies using <b>immunohistochemistry.</b> [...] The latter is a common alternative to digoxigenin, and the two are used together for labelling two genes in one sample.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Immunohistochemistry</b> or IHC {{staining}} {{of tissue}} sections (or immunocytochemistry, {{which is the}} staining of cells), {{is perhaps the most}} commonly applied immunostaining technique. While the first cases of IHC staining used fluorescent dyes (see immunofluorescence), other non-fluorescent methods using enzymes such as peroxidase (see immunoperoxidase staining) and alkaline phosphatase are now used. These enzymes are capable of catalysing reactions that give a coloured product that is easily detectable by light microscopy. [...] Alternatively, radioactive elements can be used as labels, and the immunoreaction can be visualized by autoradiography.|$|E
2500|$|Surgical {{pathology}} {{is one of}} {{the primary}} areas of practice for most anatomical pathologists. Surgical pathology involves the gross and microscopic examination of surgical specimens, as well as biopsies submitted by surgeons and non-surgeons such as general internists, medical subspecialists, dermatologists, and interventional radiologists. [...] Often an excised tissue sample is the best and most definitive evidence of disease (or lack thereof) in cases where tissue is surgically removed from a patient. [...] These determinations are usually accomplished by a combination of gross (i.e., macroscopic) and histologic (i.e., microscopic) examination of the tissue, and may involve evaluations of molecular properties of the tissue by <b>immunohistochemistry</b> or other laboratory tests.|$|E
2500|$|Bone marrow samples can be {{obtained}} by aspiration and trephine biopsy. [...] Sometimes, a bone marrow examination will include both an aspirate and a biopsy. [...] The aspirate yields semi-liquid bone marrow, which can be examined by a pathologist under a light microscope and analyzed by flow cytometry, chromosome analysis, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequently, a trephine biopsy is also obtained, which yields a narrow, cylindrically shaped solid piece of bone marrow, 2mm wide and 2cm long (80 μL), which is examined microscopically (sometimes with the aid of <b>immunohistochemistry)</b> for cellularity and infiltrative processes. An aspiration, using a 20 mL syringe, yields approximately 300 μL of bone marrow. A volume greater than 300 μL is not recommended, since it may dilute the sample with peripheral blood.|$|E
2500|$|Results of <b>immunohistochemistry</b> (IHC) {{staining}} in rhabdoid lung cancers {{tends to}} reflect the multiphasic nature of these tumors. Typically, markers expressed in LCLC-RP include those seen in [...] "generic" [...] NSCLC's, such as epithelial membrane antigen (EMA, 61%), various cytokeratins (CK's, 80%), and markers associated with the underlying [...] "parent" [...] pulmonary carcinoma. Expression of immunomarkers in the rhabdoid cells, however, have often been noted to be weaker and more diffuse {{than those in the}} more differentiated tumor cells. They also more frequently express [...] "non-carcinomatous" [...] markers typically associated with [...] "dedifferentiated" [...] neoplasms. Interestingly, expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), a commonly used marker for primary lung cancers, appears to be less frequent in rhabdoid carcinomas than in most other histotypes of pulmonary cancers.|$|E
