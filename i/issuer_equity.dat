5000|$|An equity {{security}} is a share of equity interest in an entity such as the capital stock of a company, trust or partnership. The {{most common form of}} equity interest is common stock, although preferred equity is also a form of capital stock. The holder of an equity is a shareholder, owning a share, or fractional part of the issuer. Unlike debt securities, which typically require regular payments (interest) to the holder, equity securities are not entitled to any payment. In bankruptcy, they share only in the residual interest of the issuer after all obligations have been paid out to creditors. However, equity generally entitles the holder to a pro rata portion of control of the company, meaning that a holder of a majority of the equity is usually entitled to control the <b>issuer.</b> <b>Equity</b> also enjoys the right to profits and capital gain, whereas holders of debt securities receive only interest and repayment of principal regardless of how well the issuer performs financially. Furthermore, debt securities do not have voting rights outside of bankruptcy. In other words, equity holders are entitled to the [...] "upside" [...] of the business and to control the business.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{valuation}} and risk management of callable, defaultable bonds when both {{interest rates and}} firm value are stochastic and when the issuer follows optimal call and default policies. Since interest rate sensitivity is low when call is imminent and firm value sensitivity is high when default is imminent, characterizing the issuer's call and default policies is essential to understanding corporate bond risk management. We develop analytical results on optimal call and default rules {{and use them to}} explain the dynamics of a hedging strategy for corporate bonds using Treasury bonds and <b>issuer</b> <b>equity.</b> To clarify the interaction between the issuer's embedded call and default options, we compare the callable defaultable bond to its pure callable and pure defaultable counterparts. Each bond's embedded option is a call on a riskless, noncallable host bond, distinguished only by its strike price. This generalized call option perspective generates intuition for a variety of results. For instance, spreads on all bonds, not just callables, narrow with interest rates; a decline in rates can trigger a default; a call provision can increase the duration of a risky bond; a call provision increases equity's sensitivity to firm value, mitigating the underinvestment problem identified by Myers (1977) ...|$|E

From 1995 - 2000, 1, 466 firms raised more than $ 29 billion through 2, 626 PIPE issues. We find that PIPE issuers are poorly performing firms, urgently in need of cash that, as a consequence, are without access to traditional forms of financing. The contract terms and embedded options in PIPEs allow investors to alter their exposure to post-issue movements {{in the value of}} the <b>issuer’s</b> <b>equity.</b> As a result, the returns earned by investors substantially exceed those of shareholders.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the current market {{infrastructure}} systemically prevents investors, both shareholders and bondholders, from exercising their rights against <b>issuers.</b> <b>Equity</b> and debt securities are now normally held through a chain of custodians. These custodians are connected with each other through contract law. There also exists legislation determining the relationship between custodians and their clients. It will be shown {{in the paper that}} custody chains have become independent from investors and issuers. Neither issuers nor investors are able to control the length of the chain or the content of the legal arrangements that governs the custody chain. Custodians are connected through a series of bilateral links that are independent of each other. This erodes the rights of investors. The paper will illustrate this by reference to the liability of custodians for their services and by reference to the ability of custodians to contract with sub-custodians on terms that are independent from the terms that they have entered into with their customers...|$|R

This chapter has the following objectives: • Highlight the factors responsible for the growth in convertible issuance • Discuss the design and valuation of convertible bonds • Introduce stock warrants and preferred stocks A convertible bond, as opposed to a straight bond, gets converted into a fixed number of shares of the issuing company at a pre-specified price. The holder of a convert is entitled to receive interest on the convertible portion till conversion. Thus, a convert is a package of straight debt and equity option. The option to convert is usually at the discretion of the holder and will only be exercised when and if the holder finds such an exercise desirable.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the pricing of credit risk as {{reflected}} in the market for credit default swaps (CDS) between 2003 and 2008. This market has newly emerged as the reference for credit risk pricing because of its use of standardized contract specifications and has achieved a higher level of liquidity than typically prevails in the markets for the underlying notes and bonds of the named corporate issuers. We initiate our exploration by studying a particular case which allows us to set out some of the issues of CDS pricing in a simple way. We show that for the purposes of accounting for relatively short-term changes of CDS spreads, an approach based on the structural (or firm-value based) models of credit risk faces an important obstacle in that reliable information about the firm’s liabilities required to calculate the “distance to default ” are available only quarterly or in some cases annually. Thus structural models account for short-term movements in credit spreads largely by changes in the <b>issuer’s</b> <b>equity</b> price. In the case studied we show the effect of equity returns in explaining weekly changes of spreads is insignificant and of the wrong sign. In examination of particular episodes when the CDS spread was particularly delinked from the firm’s equity series, we find that a likely explanation is changes in expectations about the firm’s planned capital market operations. Since these are hard to capture in an observed proxy variable, we argued that this motivates the use of latent variablemodels that have recently been employed in the credit risk literature. We further see that movements in the CDS spreads for the particlar name chosen are highly correlated with an index of CDS spreads for industrial Blue-chip names. ∗Preliminary and incomplete.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} {{earnings}} manipulation around seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) {{is associated with}} an increase in the likelihood of a stock price crash post-issue and test whether the enactment of securities regulations attenuate the relation between SEOs and crash risk. Empirical evidence documents that managerial tendency to conceal bad news increases the likelihood of a stock price crash (Jin and Myers, 2006; Hutton, Marcus, and Tehranian, 2009). We test this hypothesis using a sample of firms from 29 EU countries that enacted the Market Abuse Directive (MAD). Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that <b>equity</b> <b>issuers</b> that engage in earnings management experience a significant increase in crash risk post-SEO relative to control groups of non-issuers; this effect is stronger for <b>equity</b> <b>issuers</b> with poor information environments. In addition, our findings show a significant decline in crash risk post-issue after the enactment of MAD that is stronger for firms that actively manage earnings. This decline in post-issue crash risk is more effective in countries with high ex-ante institutional quality and enforcement. These results suggest that the implementation of MAD helps to mitigate managers’ ability to manipulate earnings around SEOs. COMPETE, QREN, FEDER, FC...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the reactions of}} equity holders and bondholders to the announcement of 427 preferred stock issues. We document an average equity announcement effect of – 0 : 65 %.

We find that average credit default swap spreads decrease by 50 basis points after the issue announcement. This decrease is also larger for more creditworthy and transparent firms. Convertibility and the moneyness of the embedded option further decrease the CDS spread. In aggregate, the decrease in equity value is much smaller than the increase {{in the value of the}} issuer’s debt...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{relation}} between seasoned equity offerings and the uses of issue proceeds. More specifically, I compare issuers' stated intentions of the uses of issue proceeds and the actual uses of the funds. Moreover, I investigate the relation between issuers' stated intended use of issue proceeds and subsequent stock market and operating performance. The study adds to the existing literature by applying existing methodologies and framework in a Nordic context. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The SEO data employed in this study has been gathered from the Dealogic database. The SEOs have been divided in to three subgroups based on their communicated intended uses of issue proceeds following Dealogic's classification. The sample consists of SEOs conducted in the Nordic countries during 2000 - 2011, where issue proceeds exceed EUR 10 million. Financial and stock market data used in empirical analyses has been retrieved from Thomson One, Factset and Datastream databases. To test the hypotheses, I various statistical tests and standard event study methodologies are applied. FINDINGS: The {{results of the study}} indicate that that seasoned <b>equity</b> <b>issuers</b> use the issue proceeds as communicated prior to the offering. Further, I find that the announcement effect is better for issuers stating investment purposes as the use of issue proceeds, compared to issuers stating other reasons. Additionally, firms stating investment purposes as the use of issue proceeds seem to exhibit better post-issue stock market performance compared to firms stating other purposes for the issue proceeds. However, I find that seasoned <b>equity</b> <b>issuers</b> exhibit negative abnormal returns compared to benchmarks in 24 and 36 month time period subsequent to the offering...|$|R

40|$|The {{studies in}} this thesis {{contribute}} to a growing stream of papers showing that capital structure decisions are not only influenced by corporate determinants, but also by fluctuations in investor tastes and capital available for investment. This {{is a relatively new}} way of looking at corporate decisions, but is also given the deserved importance in the literature. This view contrasts with the traditional approach in the literature that largely considered corporate decisions to be distinct from the decision process of investors. Chapters 2 and 3 use convertible debt issuance to analyze the impact of intertemporal variation in investor demand on corporate decisions, and the market reaction to these decisions. Chapter 2 shows that convertible debt issuance, pricing, and design decisions are influenced by demand forces from investors. Chapter 3 finds that a shift in the convertible bond investor base from long-only investors towards convertible arbitrage funds resulted in an increasingly negative stock price reaction, induced by short-selling pressure. Thus, the first two studies {{in this thesis}} provide more evidence of corporate opportunism, using data on issuers of convertible debt.

Further, consistent with the certifying role of underwriters, equity issues underwritten by high-quality brokers show no evidence of post-issue abnormal returns, but offerings taken public by low-quality underwriters exhibit negative abnormal performance.
