25|$|A final meeting {{took place}} in Oslo in September 1951, where {{marriage}} questions were again on the agenda. Various items were discussed, amongst others the growing conviction that the time had now come for the Apostolic Vicariates to become fully fledged dioceses. It was decided that a request to this effect be forwarded to Rome. As we now <b>know,</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> soon to be granted.|$|E

Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As {{if they were in}} mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didn’t <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> coming." [...] Following Denny's death, Heigl approached Rhimes to ask when her character would next have a romantic liaison. Rhimes explained that [...] "Izzie doesn't sleep around". Heigl expressed a desire for Izzie to reunite with Alex, explaining: [...] "I believe on some level, there's a connection between Izzie and Alex. He can do honorable things even though he's cutting and sarcastic. I would like to ultimately see them together, if not this season, then next." ...|$|E
500|$|By 4:00 in {{the morning}} the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or {{gathered}} nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be [...] "electricity in the air". One commented: [...] "There was a certain beauty {{in the aftermath of the}} riot... It was obvious, at least to me, that a lot of people really were gay and, you <b>know,</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> our street." [...] Thirteen people had been arrested. Some in the crowd were hospitalized, and four police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken. Inspector Pine had intended to close and dismantle the Stonewall Inn that night. Pay phones, toilets, mirrors, jukeboxes, and cigarette machines were all smashed, possibly in the riot and possibly by the police.|$|E

500|$|Despite Weed's efforts, Taylor was {{nominated}} {{on the fourth}} ballot, to the anger of Clay's supporters and of [...] Conscience Whigs from the Northeast. When order was restored, John A. Collier, a New Yorker and a Weed opponent, addressed the convention. Delegates hung on his every word as he {{described himself as a}} Clay partisan; he had voted for Clay on each ballot. He eloquently described the grief of the Clay supporters, frustrated again in their battle to make Clay president. [...] Collier warned of a fatal breach in the party, and stated that only one thing could prevent it: the nomination of Fillmore for vice president, whom he incorrectly depicted as a strong Clay supporter. Fillmore in fact agreed with many of Clay's positions, but did not back him for president and was not in Philadelphia. Delegates did not <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> false, or at least greatly exaggerated, and there was a large reaction in Fillmore's favor. At the time, the presidential candidate did not automatically pick his running mate, and despite the efforts of Taylor's managers to get the nomination for their choice, Abbott Lawrence of Massachusetts, Fillmore became the Whig nominee for vice president on the second ballot.|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} {{primarily}} filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, {{which is the}} headquarters building for the media company Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad. This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is {{directly across the street}} from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. Most scenes are primarily taped in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, at the Prospect Studios, and the set occupies two stages, including the hospital pieces, but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle. Several props used are genuine medical supplies, including the MRI machine. Prior to being cast, Sara Ramirez was seen by ABC executives, in her Broadway performance of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, which ultimately led in her choosing Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", a statement she deemed rare. Ramirez's character was given recurring status in the second season, having been conceived as a love interest for George O'Malley. At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Grey's relationship. When asked of this, Torres said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] Discussing Izzie Stevens' relationship with Alex Karev, Katherine Heigl described her character as naive enough to believe she can save him, assessing that: [...] "Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her, she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over." [...] Writer Stacy McKee described Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette as [...] "karma", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with Denny, regarded by her as [...] "undeniably handsome and totally charming". Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when she’s around him. I love their relationship because it's so pure and honest and completely game free." [...] Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie [...] "seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny." [...] When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: [...] "Is Izzie bad for doing it? Is she tremendously irresponsible? She cut the wire for love so does that make her action understandable?" [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: [...] "Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As if they were in mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didn't <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> coming." ...|$|E
2500|$|Independent music magazine, American Songwriter, {{called the}} album [...] "Dark, piano-driven [...] spectacularly unique", {{crediting}} Amos with offering up something [...] "gothic, inspired and winter-y." [...] Billboard noted, [...] "Amos reaches {{deep into the}} world of carols for ancient and less obvious fare that she subsequently recasts on string-laden songs," [...] praising the album, finally, as [...] "a typically provocative-in the best possible way-entry in the yuletide canon." [...] The New York Times noted, [...] "Gorgeously recorded and impeccably produced, [...] dwells in hymn-like serenity and diaphonous wonder." [...] The London Evening Standard also considered the album a success, stating, [...] " [...] fills [...] with harpsichord and subdued strings as well as her crisp, icicle voice. There's an ancient sound to [...] tracks...and again, a deliberate avoidance of anything cheery enough to be played over the Asda tannoy." [...] The Guardian, which gave the album 4/5 stars, noted enthusiastically, [...] "Centre stage is given to her voice and the simple arrangements," [...] adding, [...] "Amos sounds so tranquil she could almost be floating, but the stateliness of the orchestral backing keeps the songs grounded. You'd never <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> recorded [...] summer, so vividly does it evoke crunching snow and frosty nights." [...] They summized, [...] "Accordingly, it's her most touching album in years." [...] BBC Music exclaimed, [...] "'Midwinter Graces' has an appealing skip in its step... When it slows, it can do so with an understated elegance that Amos has only sporadically summoned during the 00s." [...] The Digital Fix called it [...] "perhaps the most straightforward album, both musically and lyrically that [...] has ever produced." ...|$|E
