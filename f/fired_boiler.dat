Process models obtained from identification {{process can be}} used for process simulation, analysis, design of safety systems and control systems for the process. This paper presents the Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) modeling of 210 MW Industrial Coal <b>Fired</b> <b>Boiler</b> which is commonlyused in thermal power plants. LPV model is the interpolation of linear transfer function models at different operating conditions. The LPV model is adopted by considering the fact that the Industrial Coal <b>Fired</b> <b>Boiler</b> in the thermal power plant has several operating conditions due to the fluctuations in steam flow based on demands. By assuming that at every operating condition, there are changes in parameters, the LPV model is suitable for covering all operating conditions. The Industrial Coal <b>Fired</b> <b>Boiler</b> is modeled using the mass and energy balance equation in MATLAB / SIMULINK. Data needed foridentification of transfer function models is taken from first principle model of the process with sampling time of 1 second. LPV model is obtained for selected physical quantities of the process. At first, linear transfer function models are identified using the data at every operation conditions using Prediction error method and then the Linear Parameter Varying model is obtained by interpolating the linear models of different operating conditions using weighting functions.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the influence of the temperature of characteristic zones of coal combustion in a stoker <b>fired</b> <b>boiler</b> (drying, degassing, and burn-out), on changes in physical and chemical parameters of bituminous coal and slags. This information is important as it helps identify the impact of coal properties on the accumulation of trace elements, primarily mercury, in combustion waste. The study is the continuation of research work on the impact of mercury compounds accumulated in combustion waste on the natural environment (mercury from landfills of slag, and fly ash). Studies were undertaken because no in-depth analysis {{of the impact of the}} temperature of particular zones of stoker fired boilers on the physical and chemical parameters of the post-process slag, including mercury content, had been reported in literature. Both of the coals examined, classified as bituminous coal according to the International Classification of Seam Coals and of type 32. 1 according to the PN-G- 97002 : 1982 standard, showed an average mercury content of 0. 0849  μg/g. In the chemical composition determined for the ash derived from burnt coal, the dominance of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 over other oxides was found. This feature results in the increase of the softening temperature and ash melting and, therefore, during the combustion of coal tested in a stoker <b>fired</b> <b>boiler,</b> only ash was subjected to the sintering process. Mercury content in the other examined samples taken from various locations of the stoker <b>fired</b> <b>boiler</b> (drying – 32 – 1050  °C, degassing – 1050 – 1020  °C, and burn-out – 1020 – 400  °C) varied from 0. 0668 to 0. 0009  μg/g and was determined with the use of a LECO atomic absorption spectrometer. The analyses of the elemental composition, performed with the application of XRF spectrometry, for ash obtained from samples collected from different sampling points of the stoker <b>fired</b> <b>boiler</b> showed that the largest concentration of trace elements was observed for the ash derived from the samples collected in the degassing zone (temperature range 1050 – 850  °C) ...|$|E
