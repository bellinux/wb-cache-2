40|$|Abstract—Energy {{efficiency}} for {{the buildings}} {{is vital for}} the environment and sustainability. Buildings are responsible for significant energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. Using a LEED-gold-certified green office building we built a unique experimental testbed for a multi-disciplinary research project on energy efficiency. We collected the building energy data for almost a year’s period through a networked metering infrastructure. In this paper, we systematically evaluate and analyze this data. The findings show that due to the centrally controlled Heating, Ventilation, Air-conditioning, and Cooling (HAVC) systems, the total energy consumption in large office buildings of this type is not proportional to the actual usage and occupancy. Even correlation to outside weather is low. Through the lessons learned from <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> efforts in <b>computer</b> industry, we envision an Energy-Proportional Building design in future. The energy consumption of such buildings would be proportional to the actual usage and occupancy. We also discuss the key ideas we learned from computer industry for such buildings...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of ethanol {{as a substitute}} for liquid petroleum fuel sources has been considered since internal combustion engines were developed. Alcohol fuel can be produced in small-scale systems using locally grown and lower quality fermentation products, such as damaged corn. The traditional high investment costs for controlling the alcohol distillation system to improve efficiency and reduce labor cannot be justified in small scale systems. However, other approaches to controlling the small scale distillation system using a control/benefit analysis may be implemented at far lower costs. ^ A steady-state computer simulation model was developed to characterize the performance of a small-scale, sieve tray ethanol distillation system using direct steam injection. The model was used to characterize the potential benefits of controlling specific distillation system parameters with the objective of reducing operating costs. ^ The model predictions were compared to the actual performance of the 68 kg (25 gallon) per hour distillation system under various control strategies. The agreement between model predictions and actual data was accurate to (+OR-) 6. 0 percent. ^ Results from both the model predictions and field tests indicated that as much as 20 percent of the energy required for distillation could be saved by reducing the reflux ratio as much as possible and by increasing the beer feed concentration and the beer pre-heat temperature. The specific strategies included were for control of: steam line pressure, condenser water temperature, and reflux rate. <b>Energy</b> <b>savings</b> with steam pressure control were as high as 23 percent while reflux control was ineffective and caused unstable system performance. Control of condenser water temperature reduced operator adjustment time considerably but was not important in terms of <b>energy</b> <b>savings.</b> ^ The <b>computer</b> simulation model developed may be used interactively for a variety of alcohol distillation systems using direct steam injection to predict the performance of different operating and control strategies. ...|$|R
