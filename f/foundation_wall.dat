5|$|After 1728, Hylton's second son, John Hylton, de jure 18th Baron Hylton added a {{complementary}} south wing (its <b>foundation</b> <b>wall</b> still extant), crenellations to both wings {{and removed the}} door on the north wing. He also changed the circular bartizan on {{the north end of the}} west front, to an octagonal turret and removed the portcullis from the west entrance.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, the {{construction}} process {{began with the}} sinking of the first caisson for the tower into the bedrock. In April, construction began on the foundation below the Chicago River. In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices in a corner where the <b>foundation</b> <b>wall</b> meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side. After several other failed attempts to correct the problem, they drove a steel plate next to the gap and filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the stone}} taken from the castle was used to {{construct}} the mid-eighteenth-century grade II-listed buildings at 43 and 45 Castle Street, and other buildings known to have used the stone, but no longer extant, include old houses demolished to build the Castle Mill textile factory. The mill, now demolished, {{was said to have}} been built on castle foundations up to 4m (12ft) thick; 15 Castle Street also rests on the old <b>foundation</b> <b>wall.</b> It is likely that the former Melbourne Furnace and the Furnace Farm barn also used recycled castle material.|$|E

25|$|Shaky Foundation - In {{the sixth}} season debut, Mike and crew {{arrive at a}} new home at which the homeowners had {{discovered}} that the foundation concrete was woefully weak— as little as one-third of the minimum code requirement— and which had slipped past the building inspectors, who had only compared the weak <b>foundation</b> <b>wall</b> concrete {{to that of the}} foundation floor (without considering that the floor may have also been weak).|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} also {{opened its}} grounds to archeological digs in 1994. Estimates of human occupation on Shooter's Hill go {{back as far}} as 3,000 BC. Shooter's Hill had been occupied by Native Americans, a mansion (in the 1830s and 1840s), a log cabin, Fort Ellsworth, a reservoir for the city's fresh water system, a park for outdoor dancing, and the Alexandria Golf Course among many others. Alexandria city archeologists used ground-penetrating radar to help identify sites of interest on Shooter's Hill, including a brick <b>foundation</b> <b>wall.</b> In the dig's first three seasons, a stone ax, pieces of ceramic pots, Civil War ammunition, various kinds of colored glass, a piece of jewelry shaped like a scarab, a Colonial-era mug imported from England, Native American spear points, a silver-plated spoon, a stoneware jar, and the bisque heads of dolls manufactured in Germany were found. In 2002, the memorial opened an exhibit designed to showcase some of the archeological evidence unearthed on the memorial grounds.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{the former}} {{buildings}} {{only a few}} <b>foundation</b> <b>walls</b> are recognisable. Still easy to make out are the <b>foundation</b> <b>walls</b> of the two gatehouse towers. Little is known of its history. The castle was probably built in the 11th century. First mentioned around 1326, the site was already recorded as devastated by about 1600. Among its former owners were the Lords of Kneitlingen and the Counts of Stolberg.|$|R
25|$|Dyson also {{produced}} buildings with arced forms. The Lencioni house (1985) in Sanger, California, produced a particularly unique two story oval form {{that was also}} widely recognized. Appearing in popular magazines, professional journals, architectural yearbooks, and most recently in a college textbook, the composition was cited by important critics such as Bruno Zevi as a superior expression of organic architectural principles. In the award-winning Tuxford-Barrett residence (1987) in Richland Center, Wisconsin, curvilinear massing was refined {{through the development of}} two successive schemes. Unfolding in shape from a natural resonance with the slope of the hillside, the curvature of the earth-enclosed <b>foundation</b> <b>wall</b> embraced an interior space divided into living, working, and sleeping areas. A terrace extruded by the use of earth from the construction excavation extended the living space into an arboreal setting of trees rooted down grade of the building. This house was also lauded by Bruno Zevi in the same article where he extolled the Lencioni house design. Two unbuilt house designs by Dyson used similar oval pod forms. The plan for the Carlson residence (1981) in Van Nuys, California, occupied an exceptionally steep building site with an integrated system of cantilevered pods. The Millerton house project (1984) in Madera County, California, for a similarly difficult site grouped the pods with a connecting bridge over a rocky cleft and also responded to an environmentally exposed position by incorporating a Teflon roof covering supported by a steel frame for thermal regulation. Dyson further developed a curvilinear form for the Glynns Restaurant (1984) in Fresno, California, that incorporated round light tower elements which would evolve and feature significantly in later projects.|$|E
2500|$|Baulks {{were used}} to support strap rails or bridge rail. [...] These early rails would have been {{replaced}} with flanged T-rails by 1840.

2500|$|In February 1896, the Stimson House was {{the target}} of a bizarre bombing attack.

[...] A [...] "stick of giant powder" [...] was placed against the foundation of the house, directly under Stimson’s bedroom. [...] A large hole was torn {{in the side of the}} house by the explosion, but the thick <b>foundation</b> <b>wall</b> was not damaged. [...] Reports indicated that a frame house would have been shattered into fragments by the explosion, but the solid stone structure withstood the blast. [...] Two neighbors witnessed the culprit lighting the fire on the dynamite, grabbed their guns, ran across the lawn, and were thrown off their feet by the explosion. [...] On regaining their balance, the neighbors saw a man running away from the scene and fired several shots in his direction, but the man escaped.|$|E

2500|$|In 2017, Buffalo Trace Distillery {{unveiled}} the much talked about O.F.C. Building, better {{known by its}} nickname “Bourbon Pompeii.” This building is a true historic gem in the chronicles of American bourbon distilling, with the original <b>foundation</b> <b>wall</b> built by Taylor in 1869, and then a second foundation Taylor built in 1873 when {{he set out to}} build the industry’s first “modern” distillery. The fermenting vats inside were found intact and date back to 1883. The foundation and the vats were covered with a cement floor when the building was decommissioned in 1958 and forgotten, until 2016 when Buffalo Trace began work on the O.F.C. Building to turn it into meeting and event space. That plan was altered upon discovery of this rare archeological treasure, although the upper levels of the building will still be used as event space as originally planned. One of Taylor’s fermenters will also be re-lined with copper as Taylor had originally designed it, for usage in the near future. These are unique finds, and may arguably be called the oldest, most intact distillery in existence in the United States; as intact remains of early buildings and equipment on most distilleries are completely removed during development and expansion.|$|E
60|$|Drawing {{closer to}} the opening leading into the bright daylight, Bradley {{surveyed}} what lay beyond.
