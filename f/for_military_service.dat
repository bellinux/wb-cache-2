5|$|Leopold viewed {{a strong}} {{military}} {{as the key}} to maintaining Belgian independence against France and, after the Franco-Prussian War, an expansionist Germany. After cutting the defense budget in the 1860s, the government was advised by a military commission to increase the size of the army and to abolish the system of Remplacement, whereby rich Belgians selected <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>service</b> by lot could pay for a substitute to take their place. Leopold II personally lobbied successive governments to implement the findings of the report and institute a fundamental reform of the army. Reform was opposed by both the Liberal and Catholic Parties, which viewed the army with suspicion and Remplacement as a key civil right. In a move supported only by the socialists, Remplacement was abolished in 1909. This was the last legal document signed before Leopold's death. Under the new system, one son per family would be liable <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>service</b> regardless of social class but the total size of the military remained the same.|$|E

5|$|The Notitia lists {{a number}} of barbarian {{military}} settlements in the empire. Known as laeti or gentiles ("natives"), these were {{an important source of}} recruits for the army. Groups of Germanic or Sarmatian tribespeople were granted land to settle in the Empire, in return <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>service.</b> Most likely each community was under a treaty obligation to supply a specified number of troops to the army each year. The resettlement within the empire of barbarian tribespeople in return <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>service</b> was not a new phenomenon in the 4th century: it stretches {{back to the days of}} Augustus.

Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve {{on the front lines}} against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.|$|E
