40|$|This work {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the explosion severity on hydrogen enrichment in methane-air mixture explosion. For this purpose, different hydrogen mixture compositions ranges between 4 to 8 % v/v were considered. This work was performed using CFD tool FLACS that has been well validated for safety studies on both natural gas/methane and hydrogen system. FLACS is used to validate the maximum pressure and <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> predicted by the CFD tool for combustion of premixed mixtures of methane and hydrogen against the experimental data. Experimental work {{was carried out in}} a closed pipe containing 90 - degree bends with a volume of 0. 41 m 3, operating at ambient conditions. From the experiment observation, it shown that the coupling effect of bending and thermal diffusivity gave the dramatic influent on explosion severity in hydrogen-methane/air at very lean concentration. However, simulation results showed that FLACs is under-predicting the overpressure at very lean concentration of hydrogen in methane/air mixtures. It can be said that lower hydrogen content in methane/air mixture limits the hydrogen diffusivity, leading to the decrease of the burning rate and <b>flame</b> <b>speeds.</b> It is also demonstrated that the presence of 90 -degree bend in closed pipe system increases the simulated <b>flame</b> <b>speeds</b> to the <b>factor</b> of 2 - 3, as compared to the experimental data.

This thesis aims at looking into the prospects of Gas to Liquid (GTL) fuel as an alternative fuel for Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs), by investigating the <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> of GTL fuel and its 50 / 50 (by volume) blend with conventional diesel. The tests were conducted in a newly designed {{state of the art}} cylindrical bomb test rig capable of measuring laminar <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> at different initial temperatures and equivalence ratios, employing pressure signal for measuring <b>flame</b> <b>speeds.</b> The bomb measurements for conventional diesel were found in an excellent agreement (error of 1. 5 %) when compared with the literature. The GTL and its 50 / 50 blend were investigated for their laminar <b>flame</b> <b>speeds,</b> along with the effect of changing the equivalence ratio and initial temperature on the <b>flame</b> <b>speed.</b> It was found that the pure GTL has highest <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> (SN= 88. 3 cm/s) as compared to conventional diesel, near and at stoichiometric mixtures (Φ= 1. 1), which was 5 cm/s more than conventional diesel. At lean and rich mixtures, the <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> of GTL get slightly lower than conventional diesel. The 50 / 50 blend gave a lower <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> at lean and rich mixture conditions as compared {{to the rest of the}} fuels.

The fuels employed include a conventional fuel oil plus various blends JP 7 with stocks containing single-ring and mullti-ring aromatics. The results for stoichiometric mixtures show that flame propagation cannot occur in mixtures containing mean drop sizes larger than 300 to 400 microns, depending on the fuel type. For smaller drop sizes, down to around 60 microns, <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> is inversely proportional to drop size, indicating that evaporation rates are limiting to <b>flame</b> <b>speed.</b> Below around 60 microns, the curves of <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> versus mean drop size flatten out, thereby demonstrating that for finely atomized sprays <b>flame</b> <b>speeds</b> are much less dependent on evaporation rates, and are governed primarily by mixing and/or chemical reaction rates.

Laminar <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> has been found useful not only for validating chemical kinetics mechanisms but also for developing empirical scaling laws for practical combustion systems. The thesis addresses the lack of laminar <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> data of C₁-C₃ alkanes at preheat (300 - 650 K), pressure (1 - 10 atm) and significant oxidizer dilution (15 - 21 vol% O₂). Over 400 measurements are reported {{over a wide range}} of conditions along with comparison to predictions from leading chemical mechanisms. Unstretched <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> measurements were performed using a modified Bunsen flame technique based on reaction zone area from chemiluminescence imaging, whereas the strain sensitivity measurements were performed using a bluff-body stabilized stagnation flame with high resolution PIV. These measurements are used to: (i) discern the uncertainties associated with the measurements, (ii) understand the effect of fuel mixture and vitiation on <b>flame</b> <b>speed,</b> and (iii) validate the performance of the leading chemical kinetics mechanisms. Extensive testing shows the unstretched <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> measurements from the modified Bunsen technique are reasonably accurate. Vitiation studies for methane and propane flames at high preheat show the reduction in <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> results primarily from the thermal effect of the diluent and that the relative change in <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> from the undiluted mixture is well correlated to the fractional change in the adiabatic flame temperature over a range of conditions. Significant difference in the measured and predicted <b>flame</b> <b>speeds</b> were observed for rich, atmospheric pressure, propane and lean, high pressure, methane/ethane mixtures with dilution. This highlights possible avenues for improvements in the chemical kinetics mechanisms. Systematic errors were also identified in the Bunsen flame measurements at certain conditions, such as for rich flames with dilution, indicating a need for better understanding of the Bunsen flame technique at these conditions. The difference in the measured and predicted <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> does not show any clear correlation with the flame height or the strain sensitivity of the mixture.

The coexistence of these factors complicates the choice of <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> subgrid models for full-star Type Ia simulations. Both processes can stretch and wrinkle the flame surface, increasing its area and, therefore, the burning rate.

A kinematic model of the flame dynamics, developed by Dowling, is extended to allow for the effects of turbulent <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> development on the heat release in the system. For this purpose, an expression for developing turbulent <b>flame</b> <b>speed,</b> obtained by two of us [13], is incorporated into the model of Dowling. A theoretical solution for the transfer function between the oncoming flow velocity and total heat release rate is found by considering weak velocity oscillations and using a simplified expression for the developing <b>flame</b> <b>speed.</b> Numerical solutions are obtained for various magnitudes of the velocity oscillations and using the full model for the <b>flame</b> <b>speed.</b> Both solutions indicate that the development of turbulent <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> notably changes the phase difference between the oscillations of the oncoming flow velocity and total heat release rate in the combustor.

The results show that the zirconium flame has a spherical shape, whereas the lycopodium flame has a very complex structure which makes <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> calculation difficult and the lycopodium <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> needs to be determined through statistical averaging of multiple measurements. This discrepancy between the flame structure of lycopodium and zirconium is attributed to the <b>flame</b> <b>speed.</b> In case of lycopodium, the <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> is much lower, which makes the flame structure and propagation very sensitive to turbulent fluctuations of the flow field at the time of ignition.

Also, the measured Markstein lengths of the atmospheric mixtures are compared and do not demonstrate a strong impact from any one factor but the ratio of hydrogen and carbon monoxide plays a key role.

This paper investigates the relationship between fuel properties and engine operation parameters, their influence on flame velocity and their ability to calculate the time delay from ignition to 50 % mass fraction burned (MFB) that is used for adjusting the spark advance. The GT-Power software is employed to simulate the combustion process of a spark-ignition (SI) engine. The <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> mean value model is applied to determine the laminar <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> under different amounts of unburned mixture, temperatures and pressures. The results show that mixture with less than the stoichiometric ratio has the greatest laminar <b>flame</b> <b>speed.</b> At higher temperature, the difference between poor and rich mixture is significant for laminar <b>flame</b> <b>speed.</b> On the other hand, the relationship between turbulence intensity and engine speed is almost linear. The cylinder pattern used to create turbulence during the intake and compression strokes defines the slope between the engine <b>speed</b> and turbulent <b>flame</b> <b>speed.</b> The mean value <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> model was capable of determining the combustion phasing and predicting spark ignition in advance...|$|R

A few hundred ppm of iron pentacarbonyl are known to reduce the <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> of stoichiometric methane–air flame by almost 50%. However due to its toxic nature it has not been used widely as a flame retardant.|$|R

Data for analysis are obtained from direct numerical simulations of a laminar mixing layer with a uniformly approaching velocity field. The structure that evolves {{under such conditions}} is a triple flame, which consists of two premixed wings and a trailing diffusion flame. Heat release increases the <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> over that of the corresponding planar premixed flame. In agreement with previous analytical work, reductions in the mixture fraction gradient also increase the <b>flame</b> <b>speed.</b> The effects of heat release and mixture fraction gradients on <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> are not independent, however; heat release modifies the effective mixture fraction gradient {{in front of the}} flame. For very small mixture fraction gradients, scaling laws that determine the <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> in terms of the density change are presented. © 1995 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of orthotropic wall materials, which have enhanced thermal conductivity in the axial direction, on the <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> is explored via an analytical model {{in a parallel}} plate microcombustor. The model accounts for 2 D conjugate heat transfer (both in wall and gas) and fuel species transport in the micro-channel. The effects of heat loss, orthotropic wall thermal conductivities, and wall thickness on the <b>flame</b> <b>speed</b> are explored. The results indicate that as the axial thermal conductivity of the wall is increased, the allowable heat losses to the ambient by the burner also increased. Thicker walls showed increased benefit to the thermal conductivity tailoring than thinner wall designs; both in increased <b>flame</b> <b>speeds</b> {{as well as the}} ability to tolerate higher heat losses without extinction. Total heat recirculation is shown to be the primary parameter to control the <b>flame</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|R
