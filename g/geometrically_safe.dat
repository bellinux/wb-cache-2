Calculations made {{to estimate the}} capacities of equipment which is <b>geometrically</b> <b>safe</b> with respect to control of nuclear criticality indicate 100 kg/day or more of uranium for a single nitrate extraction line with four batch loading contactors. The four batch contactors might {{be replaced by a}} single continuous resin loading contactor of a modified Higgins contactor design. The resin loading process using solvent extraction of nitrate appears practical for use in a commercial-scale HTGR fuel recycle plant. (auth...|$|E
