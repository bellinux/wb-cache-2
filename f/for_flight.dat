5|$|Also, fledging. The {{stage in}} a young bird's life when the {{feathers}} and wing muscles are sufficiently developed <b>for</b> <b>flight,</b> or the act of a chick's parents in raising it to that time threshold.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Air Traffic Control Officer John Davis, who was {{responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>Flight</b> 712 and had first spotted the port engine fire from the ground, was appointed MBE.|$|E
50|$|Generally speaking, the {{threshold}} for compensation is 3 hours. <b>For</b> <b>flights</b> under 1,500 km, compensation is €250. <b>For</b> <b>flights</b> 1,500 km to 3,000 km, compensation is €400. <b>For</b> <b>flights</b> {{of more than}} 3,500 km outside the EU, compensation is set at €600.|$|R

50|$|The {{airlines}} {{agreed to}} attempt as many point-to-point transit flights as possible, although {{they would still}} have to operate some flights via a hub-and-spoke network. Specifically, SAS would degrade Stockholm-Arlanda Airport and Oslo Airport, Fornebu from hub, and instead focus its traffic in Copenhagen, which would become the main hub <b>for</b> <b>flights</b> to China and Japan. Swissair's hub at Zürich Airport would become the main hub <b>for</b> <b>flights</b> to Africa and South-East Asia, KLM's hub at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport would become the main hub <b>for</b> <b>flights</b> to South America, while Austrian's hub at Vienna International Airport would become the main hub <b>for</b> <b>flights</b> to Eastern Europe.|$|R
5|$|Luis de Florez {{graduated}} from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1911 before joining the Navy. During World War I he became a naval aviator. Commander de Flores is credited with numerous inventions which made better flight simulators and equipment <b>for</b> <b>flight</b> safety.|$|E
5|$|The {{forewings}} of beetles are {{not used}} <b>for</b> <b>flight,</b> but form elytra which cover the hind {{part of the body}} and protect the hindwings. The elytra are usually hard shell-like structures which must be raised to allow the hind wings to move <b>for</b> <b>flight.</b> However, in the soldier beetles (Cantharidae), the elytra are soft, earning this family the name of leatherwings. Other soft wing beetles include the net-winged beetle Calopteron discrepans, which has brittle wings that rupture easily in order to release chemicals for defence.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most archosaurs, {{the nasal}} and antorbital {{openings}} of pterodactyloid pterosaurs merged {{into a single}} large opening, called the nasoantorbital fenestra. This feature likely evolved to lighten the skull <b>for</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{requirement}} <b>for</b> <b>flights</b> to {{be scheduled}} between 6:30am and 9:30pm. The {{exception to this}} is <b>for</b> delayed <b>flights</b> where extensions may be granted.|$|R

50|$|The airport has two terminals: Terminal 1 is used <b>for</b> {{international}} <b>flights,</b> and Terminal 2 <b>for</b> domestic <b>flights.</b> Terminal X <b>for</b> charter <b>flights</b> {{opened in}} February 2014.|$|R
5|$|A third Saturn IB test, AS-203 {{launched}} from pad 37, went into orbit to support {{design of the}} S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nosecone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready <b>for</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Loisel {{attended}} Wayne State Teacher's College, Nebraska (now Wayne State College) and the University of Nebraska from 1938 to 1941. He then entered the USAAF <b>for</b> <b>flight</b> training at Mather Field, California on March 10, 1941 and received his pilot wings on October 31, 1941.|$|E
5|$|All Eurasian {{composite}} bows {{derive from}} the same nomad origins, but every culture that used them has made its own adaptations to the basic design. The Turkish, Mongolian, and Korean bows were standardized when archery lost its military function and became a popular sport. Recent Turkish bows are optimized <b>for</b> <b>flight</b> shooting.|$|E
50|$|Following the free-flight tests, Enterprise was {{prepared}} <b>for</b> ferry <b>flight</b> tests, which {{were intended to}} ensure that the SCA/orbiter configuration was viable <b>for</b> <b>flights</b> of the duration between landing and launch sites.|$|R

5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable <b>for</b> <b>flight</b> operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|At a {{memorial}} service held on 8 September 1978 <b>for</b> <b>Flight</b> 825's passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral, about 2,000 people crowded inside, with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets. Prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel, as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including PK van der Byl, the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|Because {{pterosaur}} anatomy {{has been}} so heavily modified <b>for</b> <b>flight,</b> and immediate transitional fossil predecessors have not so far been described, the ancestry of pterosaurs is not fully understood. Several hypotheses have been advanced, including links to the avemetatarsalian-like Scleromochlus, an ancestry among the basal archosauriforms, like Euparkeria, or among the protorosaurs.|$|E

5|$|By early 1984, work on Mir had halted {{while all}} {{resources}} were {{being put into}} the Buran programme in order to prepare the Buran spacecraft <b>for</b> <b>flight</b> testing. Funding resumed in early 1984 when Valentin Glushko was ordered by the Central Committee's Secretary for Space and Defence to orbit Mir by early 1986, {{in time for the}} 27th Communist Party Congress.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties in {{accurately}} locating Flight 11 {{caused a}} delay of five minutes, to 8:43am, before the scramble order was given and pilots Duffy and Nash could respond. When Flight 11 hit the North Tower at 8:46, the two jets were still readying <b>for</b> <b>flight</b> {{and did not}} take off until 8:52am.|$|E
5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready <b>for</b> <b>flight</b> just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E

5|$|In {{the course}} of a 25-minute test an early R engine would consume 60Imperial gallons (gal) (270L) of {{pre-heated}} castor oil. The majority of this was spat out of the exhaust ports and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known laxative. Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just to warm the engine to operating temperature. The same coarse-pitch propeller used <b>for</b> <b>flight</b> trials was fitted throughout these tests.|$|E
5|$|Like other bows, {{they lost}} {{importance}} {{with the introduction}} and increasing accuracy of guns. In some areas composite bows were still used and were further developed for leisure purposes. Later Turkish bows are specialized <b>for</b> <b>flight</b> archery (shooting for distance). Composite bows are still made and used in Korea and in China, and the tradition has been revived elsewhere. Modern replicas are available, often made with fiberglass bellies and backs with a natural or man-made core.|$|E
5|$|Most birds can fly, which distinguishes {{them from}} almost all other {{vertebrate}} classes. Flight {{is the primary}} means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations <b>for</b> <b>flight,</b> including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, {{as well as a}} modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.|$|E
