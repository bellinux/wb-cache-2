2500|$|The {{speed at}} which a fuse blows {{depends on how much}} current flows through it and the {{material}} of which the fuse is made. The operating time is not a fixed interval, but decreases as the current increases. Fuses have different characteristics of operating time compared to current. [...] A standard fuse may require twice its rated current to open in one second, a <b>fast-blow</b> <b>fuse</b> may require twice its rated current to blow in 0.1 seconds, and a slow-blow fuse may require twice its rated current for tens of seconds to blow.|$|E

2500|$|Fuse {{selection}} {{depends on}} the load's characteristics. Semiconductor devices may use a fast or ultrafast fuse as semiconductor devices heat rapidly when excess current flows. The fastest blowing fuses are designed for the most sensitive electrical equipment, where even a short exposure to an overload current could be very damaging. [...] Normal <b>fast-blow</b> <b>fuses</b> are the most general purpose fuses. [...] The time delay fuse (also known as anti-surge, or slow-blow) are designed to allow a current which is above the rated value of the fuse to flow {{for a short period}} of time without the fuse blowing. [...] These types of fuse are used on equipment such as motors, which can draw larger than normal currents for up to several seconds while coming up to speed.|$|R
