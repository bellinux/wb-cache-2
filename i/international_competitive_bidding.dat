25|$|In 2002, the Ministry of Construction {{issued a}} policy {{paper on the}} commercialization of public utilities. Subsequently, in October 2003, the central {{government}} decided that state-owned enterprises had {{to be separated from}} Ministries and/or provincial governments and had to be commercialized. Competitive bidding for contracts, private sector participation and commercial financing are important element in the transition to a market economy. In the 1990s, the first BOT contracts were signed for wastewater treatment plants. More than 200 wastewater treatment plants were built with some form of private sector participation in their financing and/or management, usually using the BOT formula. Early BOTs saw governments implementing the process without the benefit of financial, legal, and technical advisers, finding to their chagrin that the process becomes more complex in the absence of expert knowledge. Learning from the experience of past BOTs in the sector, local governments sought expert advice on bidding and public tender. In about 2000 for the first time, a BOT water project (Chengdu No. 6 Water Supply Plant) was awarded on the basis of transparent <b>international</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>bidding,</b> with support from the ADB. In 2004, a landmark international competitive bid for the entire water supply and sanitation system of Shenzhen was won by a joint venture including the French firm Veolia.|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} of Liberia {{signed a contract}} in 2012 with CICO to rehabilitate the Monrovia-Gbarnga-Ganta highway, one of West Africa's key roads, which had decayed following the Second Liberian Civil War. The $166-m project, funded by the World Bank and European Union, involves the paving of 180 km of road through 12 counties of the country, and the project contract contained provisions for the participation of Liberian-owned subcontractors. The government's goal in the project is to upgrade road connections to neighbouring countries that form the Mano River Union. In another World Bank funded project in Liberia, CICO was contracted in 2008 after the <b>International</b> <b>Competitive</b> <b>Bidding</b> process to build a $16-m Vai Town Bridge, which had earlier collapsed in 2007. The completed bridge was dedicated {{at the end of}} 2011.|$|E

The project was proposed to be implemented on build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis for a concession period of 35 years with an extension clause of another 10 years. The MMRDA estimated the project would cost , while Reliance Infrastructure estimated it would cost 11,000 crore. Construction was planned to begin in August 2010 and be completed by mid-2013. However, construction work had yet to begin by December 2012, leading to calls for Line 2 to be cancelled outright.|$|E

Several <b>competitive</b> <b>bidding</b> experiments have been conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to determine reimbursement prices. This paper investigates the use of <b>competitive</b> <b>bidding</b> to set reimbursement prices for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies. First, the <b>competitive</b> <b>bidding</b> process is examined on a theoretical level. It is shown that the CMS <b>competitive</b> <b>bidding</b> process (auction) is inefficient, leads to price increases, and may cause decreases in the quality of services. Next, data supporting the theoretical predictions are presented. Finally, we suggest that a descending variant of the Ausubel, Cramton, and Milgrom (2006) clock-proxy auction be used...|$|R
50|$|The two {{concession}} contracts were for 25 years and included targets concerning coverage and service quality. One {{objective was to}} increase water coverage in Metro Manila to 96 percent by 2006, another to increase access to sewerage to 66 percent in West Manila, and 55 percent in East Manila {{by the end of}} the concessions. There were no contractual targets to increase efficiency; the companies' financial models used to set the tariffs in their bids assumed a rapid reduction of water losses and a reduction in staffing levels. The two concession holders were to inherit the debt of MWSS; the debt was not shared equally between the two concessions. Because the Western concession was considered more dense and more prosperous, 90 percent of the debt was assigned to it. The concessions were awarded through <b>international</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>bidding,</b> with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group advising the government on the design and bidding of the two {{concession contracts}}.|$|E
50|$|Private {{companies}} are typically selected through <b>international</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>bidding</b> {{and need to}} have demonstrated previous experience. Selection is either done {{through a combination of}} price and quality, or solely based on price. In the case of a management contract, the price is the management fee (fixed fee plus performance-based fee); {{in the case of a}} lease it is the lease fee per unit of water sold; in a concession it is the water tariff; and in an asset sale it is the price paid for the company. In some cases - such as in Casablanca in 1997 and in Jakarta in 1998 - private companies have been selected through direct negotiations without competitive bidding. In other cases - such as in Cartagena (Colombia) in 1995, Cochabamba (Bolivia) in 1999 and Guayaquil (Ecuador) in 2000 - only a single bid was submitted. If development aid agencies are involved in directly financing private sector participation, they systematically require competitive bidding. However, in some cases - such as in Timişoara, Romania - the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has financed parallel investments, while a concession was awarded by the government after direct negotiations.|$|E

40|$|A lower {{percentage}} of product value {{is invested in}} research in the forest sector than in many other sectors of the economy. Moreover, while it has been possible to reach a stable funding environment for research {{in some parts of}} the sector - notably in forest products - other aspects of forestry research are increasingly unattractive to funding agencies. The funding environment for forestry research is changing. Increasingly, state funding for commercial or proprietary research is being withdrawn in the expectation that such research will be taken up by the private sector. State funding is being applied to the issues that governments rate as important, either as a result of perceived public concern or as a result of <b>international</b> agreements. <b>Competitive</b> <b>bidding</b> is increasingly being used as a mechanism to allocate funds. This process has tended to favour small disciplinary teams doing component research at the expense of multi-disciplinary teams working at the systems level. In the Developed World the task is to improve the perceived value of forestry research; to adapt smoothly to the new research agenda created by changed demands placed upon forests and to maintain a balanced and progressive programme. In the Developing World the task is to build a research-capacity, an essential component of soundly-based, locally adapted development solutions, where often none exists. Given that state funding for many aspects of forestry research is not likely to increase and may decline, new sources of funding must be found. It is proposed that the role of Foundations, the GEF, Climate Change mitigation funds, the private sector and the commercial exploitation of research products be reviewed...|$|R

50|$|Private sector {{participation}} {{in the provision of}} water supply and sanitation in Turkey is mostly limited to the operation of water and wastewater treatment plants without direct contact with customers. An exception is the lease contract in Antalya from 1996 to 2002, where a private company directly provided water and sewer services to customers. In 1996 the city signed a lease contract with a private company to provide water and sanitation services for 10 years. The decision to opt for a lease was taken on the advice of a UK consulting firm without an options study that would have compared different alternatives of private sector participation. The contract was awarded after <b>international</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>bidding</b> with three bids submitted. It was awarded to the lowest qualified bidder called ANTSU, a consortium between the French water company Lyonnaise des Eaux (today Suez Environnement) and the Turiksh firm ENKA (the latter left the consortium shortly after the contract was signed). Ownership of assets remained with the public company, Antalya Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (ASAT). ANTSU received an agreed remuneration per cubic meter of water collected from ASAT customers. Investments were partially financed through loans from the World Bank and the European Investment Bank. There were some slight improvements during the contract period, such as an increase of the continuity of water supply from 19 to 23 hours per day. However, an important indicator, non-revenue water, stagnated at a high level of about 60%, while the private operator had aimed at reducing it to 30% within three years. Half way through the contract period the private operator said it lost money and asked to increase its remuneration. When the municipality refused, ANTSU said it was obliged under Turkish law to liquidate itself. ASAT then assumed responsibility for operations in 2002 and the contract ended amidst compensation claims by both sides. In its completion report for the project that supported the lease, the World Bank concluded that the outcomes were unsatisfactory. However, there were also successes: For example, funds provided through the World Bank loan contributed to increase the share of sewerage connections from zero in 1996 to 35% of the urbanized area in 2003.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} competition and decrease price, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria recently began asking some grant recipients to use <b>international</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>bidding</b> processes for certain drug purchases. Unfortunately, for countries like Kenya, this request has caused more harm than good. After awarding the tender for its annual supply of the anti-malarial artemether-lumefantrine to the lowest bidder, Ajanta Pharma, Kenya experienced wide stock-outs {{in part due to}} the company's inability to supply the order in full and on time. Similar problems could arise in Uganda. Despite Kenya's experience, Uganda has awarded its next tender for artemether-lumefantrine to Ajanta Pharma. Uganda is already facing wide stock-outs and risks exacerbating an already dire situation the longer it takes to fulfil the procurement contract. A tender process based primarily on price cannot account for a company's ability to consistently supply sufficient product in time. </p...|$|E
