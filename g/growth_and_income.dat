Unlike neoliberalism, which “defines well-being as utility maximization”, economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>income</b> are considered {{a means to an}} end rather than the end itself. Its goal is to “wid people’s choices and the level of their achieved well-being” through increasing functionings (the things a person values doing), capabilities (the freedom to enjoy functionings) and agency (the ability to pursue valued goals).|$|E

In a prototypical forward-looking New Keynesian model, I develop a general linear-quadratic method to solve for the optimal delegation parameters that generate the optimal amount of inertia in a Markov-perfect equilibrium. I study the optimal design of some policy regimes that are nested within this framework: inflation, output-gap <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> nominal <b>income</b> <b>growth</b> targeting; <b>and</b> inflation and output-gap contracts. Notably, since the timeless-optimal equilibrium is time-consistent, so is any delegation scheme that implements it. inflation, output gap <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> nominal <b>income</b> <b>growth</b> targeting.; discretion <b>and</b> commitment; inertia; optimal delegation; stabilization bias; time inconsistency; timeless-optimal policy...|$|R
