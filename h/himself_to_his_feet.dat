60|$|He heaved <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> warmed and {{heartened by}} the thought; his eye sparkled, {{and there was}} a deeper flush than usual upon his cheek.|$|E
60|$|The man cursed {{and flung}} the empty gun from him. He groaned aloud {{as he started}} to drag <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> It was a slow and arduous task.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Harvey {{had managed to}} crawl from his place of concealment, and, {{at the expense of}} severe pain, raised <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{directly}} in front of the prisoner.|$|E
60|$|Brooke lifted <b>himself</b> shakily <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{and blinked}} in a curious, heavy fashion at the man.|$|R
60|$|Peace-loving Lord Gervase had heaved <b>himself</b> {{suddenly}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> at Westmacott's last words, still {{intent upon}} saving the situation.|$|R
60|$|But John William had a soul above tumbles. In {{an instant}} he jerked <b>himself</b> up <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> dropped the pole, and dashed after the sled.|$|R
60|$|He laid hold of {{the piano}} and pulled <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and seemed to become aware, for the first time, of his wife, where she stood with their boy beside her.|$|E
60|$|Breckenridge sat {{blinking}} {{at him a}} moment, and then very shakily dragged <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and stood before the man, with one hand clenched. His face was white and drawn {{and there was a}} red smear on his forehead.|$|E
60|$|A swift change {{came over}} Trenchard. His {{drunkenness}} fell from {{him like a}} discarded mantle. He sat like a man amazed. Then he heaved <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> in a fury, and smashed down his pipestem on the wooden table, sending its fragments flying.|$|E
60|$|The first {{interruption}} {{came from}} James <b>himself.</b> Leaping <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{with a sudden}} bound, he exclaimed, 'There they are!' and stood transfixed in a gaze of ecstasy.|$|R
60|$|Garnache {{opened his}} eyes and stared a second dully at the disturber of his feigned slumbers. Then, as if being more fully awakened he {{recognized}} his master, he heaved <b>himself</b> suddenly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and bowed.|$|R
60|$|But all {{the same}} he raised <b>himself</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and began <b>to</b> put on <b>his</b> clothes. They sauntered back to the village, drank a bowl of kava with the chief, and then, after a joyful {{farewell}} from all the lazy villagers, drove home.|$|R
60|$|The {{noise of}} Jack's fall {{might have seemed}} to her bewildered fancy {{as a part of}} her frantic act, for she fell forward vacantly on the railing. But by this time Jack had grasped her arm as if to help <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
60|$|Clayton {{opened his}} fingers. Spider {{was the first}} to see the date, and ere any knew what his {{intention}} was he raised <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and lunged {{over the side of the}} boat, to disappear forever into the green depths beneath--the coin had not been the 1875 piece.|$|E
6000|$|Mitchy, after {{a minute}} of much intensity, had stopped {{watching}} her; changing his posture and with his elbows on his knees he dropped for a while his face into his hands. Then he jerked <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "There's something I wish awfully I could say to you. But I can't." ...|$|E
5000|$|Phrabat Somdej Phrachaoyuhua - King of Thailand (Siam), {{the title}} {{literally}} means [...] "The {{feet of the}} Greatest Lord {{who is on the}} heads (of his subjects)" [...] (This royal title does not refer directly <b>to</b> the king <b>himself</b> but <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> according <b>to</b> traditions.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Preah Karuna Preah Bat Sâmdech Preah Bâromneath - King of Cambodia Khmer, {{the title}} {{literally}} means [...] "The {{feet of the}} Greatest Lord {{who is on the}} heads (of his subjects)" [...] (This royal title doesn't refer directly <b>to</b> the king <b>himself</b> but <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> according <b>to</b> traditions.) ...|$|R
60|$|Then it {{was that}} Sheldon struck out, coolly and deliberately, with all the {{strength}} of his arm, and Tudor, caught on the jaw, fell sideways, crumpling as he did so and crushing a chair to kindling wood beneath the weight of his falling body. He pulled <b>himself</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> but did not offer to rush.|$|R
60|$|Sally, {{watching}} her brother heave <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> as the cheers died away, {{felt her heart}} beat a little faster with anticipation. Fillmore was a fluent young man, once a power in his college debating society, and it was for that reason that she had insisted on his coming here tonight.|$|E
60|$|And now {{he raised}} <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and swaying like a drunken man {{he turned toward}} the studio, calling to his guard to follow him. But she was still between him and that door, between this raving, bloodthirsty maniac and a {{helpless}} man who was lying wounded and in a drugged sleep {{on a bed of}} sickness.|$|E
60|$|But here Bishop {{interrupted}} him. He had heaved <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> at last, and was venting his fury in unprintable abuse. Captain Blood, who {{had also}} risen, stood apparently impassive, for the storm to spend itself. When at last this happened, he addressed himself quietly to Lord Julian, as if Colonel Bishop had not spoken.|$|E
6000|$|... "Anna Held'll jump at it," [...] said Mr. Skidder <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> putting <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{up against}} the lambrequins and disappearing {{in a cloud of}} smoke like an aerial cuttlefish.|$|R
60|$|But quietly he {{disengaged}} <b>himself</b> and got <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>his</b> face {{pale and}} set, obstinate as she said. He put his hat on, {{and took his}} little bag. She watched him curiously, still crouching by his chair.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hamlin laughed. But {{even then}} he {{suddenly}} felt the grasp of Gabriel relax, found <b>himself</b> slipping <b>to</b> <b>his</b> companion's <b>feet,</b> and the next moment was deposited carefully but ignominiously on the ground by Gabriel, who strode quietly and composedly up to the muzzle of the sheriff's pistol.|$|R
6000|$|Nerle {{was much}} bruised by the fall, {{and as he}} painfully raised <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> a great lump was {{swelling}} behind his left ear, where his head had struck the floor, {{and he was so}} dizzy that the room seemed swimming around him in a circle. But he gave a happy little laugh, and said to the prince, gratefully: ...|$|E
60|$|When the Fiddler had {{gathered}} his wits together, and <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{he saw that}} he lay in a beautiful garden of flowers and fruit-trees and marble walks and what not, and {{that at the end}} of it stood a great, splendid house, all built of white marble, with a fountain in front, and peacocks strutting about on the lawn.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew your}} father, {{and a very}} good man he was; only he shouldn't have taken to farming. People think they can farm without {{learning}} the trade, but that's a very great mistake. I can farm, because I've learned it. Don't you think you'd better get up?" [...] Whereupon Johnny raised <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "Not but what you're very welcome to lie there if you like it. Only, in October, you know--" ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not until}} nearly midnight that Roger heard the {{expected}} signal. No sooner was the second call given, than he pulled the knot which kept the cords together, raised <b>himself</b> noiselessly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and sprang upon the Aztec. Taken by surprise, the man {{was no more than}} a child in Roger's strong grasp. In a moment he was thrown down, his cloth was twisted round his mouth, so as to prevent any cry from escaping him, and his arms were bound behind him with Roger's rope.|$|R
60|$|With resolve came action. He pulled <b>himself</b> stiffly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> break camp. He packed the rolled blankets, the frying-pan, rifle, and axe on the sled, and passed a lashing around the load. Then he warmed his {{hands at the}} fire and pulled on his mittens. He was foot-sore, and limped noticeably as he took his place {{at the head of}} the sled. When he put the looped haul-rope over his shoulder, and leant his weight against it to start the sled, he winced. His flesh was galled by many days of contact with the haul-rope.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not as}} if Graham had kissed her, he pondered. It was Paula who had kissed Graham. That was love, and passion. He {{had seen}} it, and as it burned again before his eyes, he felt his heart surge, and the premonitory {{sensation}} of suffocation seized him. With a sharp effort of will he controlled <b>himself</b> and got <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
60|$|Morganson dashed up the hillside--at {{least he}} started to dash up. The next {{he knew he was}} coming out of a faint and {{dragging}} <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> He went up more slowly, pausing {{from time to time to}} breathe and to steady his reeling senses. At last he crawled over the trunk. The moose lay before him. He sat down heavily upon the carcase and laughed. He buried his face in his mittened hands and laughed some more.|$|E
6000|$|The old farmer jerked <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> again. [...] "It's like this: I paid my dolla' to {{hear about}} a country where there wa'n't no co'perations nor no monop'lies nor no buyin' up cou'ts; and I ain't agoin' to have no allegory shoved down my throat, instead of a true history, noways. I know all about how it is here. Fi'st, run their line through your backya'd, and then kill off your cattle, and keep kerryin' on it up from cou't to cou't, till there ain't hide or hair on 'em left--" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{when the}} boyar had gone, Boris Godunov heaved <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and strode {{over to the}} fire, his great head sunk between his massive shoulders. He was a short, thick-set, bow-legged man, inclining to corpulence. He set a foot, shod in red leather {{reversed}} with ermine, upon an andiron, and, leaning an elbow on the carved overmantel, rested his brow against his hand. His eyes stared into {{the very heart of}} the fire, as if they beheld there the pageant of the past, upon which his mind was bent.|$|E
60|$|No {{sooner had}} the theft been {{accomplished}} than Villon shook <b>himself,</b> jumped <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and began helping to scatter and extinguish the embers. Meanwhile Montigny {{opened the door}} and cautiously peered into the street. The coast was clear; there was no meddlesome patrol in sight. Still it was judged wiser to slip out severally; and as Villon was himself in a hurry to escape from the neighbourhood of the dead Thevenin, and the rest were in a still greater hurry {{to get rid of him}} before he should discover the loss of his money, he was the first by general consent to issue forth into the street.|$|R
6000|$|The old man lifted <b>himself</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> with {{mechanical}} politeness, and cautiously took March's hand. [...] "Yes, {{my name is}} Lindau," [...] he said, slowly, {{while he}} scanned March's face. Then he broke into a long cry. [...] "Ah-h-h-h-h, my dear poy! my gong friendt! my-my--Idt is Passil Marge, not zo? Ah, ha, ha, ha! How gladt I am to zee you! Why, I am gladt! And you rememberdt me? You remember Schiller, and Goethe, and Uhland? And Indianapolis? You still lif in Indianapolis? It sheers my hardt to zee you. But you are lidtle oldt, too? Tventy-five years makes a difference. Ah, I am gladt! Dell me, idt is Passil Marge, not zo?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now though Sir Ector {{heard the}} sound of the {{footsteps}} of the horse as Sir Percival drew nigh, yet he neither ceased his orisons nor turned his head, but ever continued very steadfastly <b>to</b> recite <b>his</b> prayers. And so Sir Percival drew rein at a little distance and waited until Sir Ector was done his prayers, nor did he disturb the kneeling knight in any wise until he had crossed <b>himself</b> and arisen <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
