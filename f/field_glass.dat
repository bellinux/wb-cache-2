[...] When daylight came we saw them behind us. [...] I was the leader. [...] We turned back to fight the Crows. [...] I killed one and took his scalp and a <b>field</b> <b>glass</b> and a Crow necklace from him. [...] We chased the others back a long way and then caught up with our own men again and went on. [...] It was a very cold winter. [...] There were twenty of us and each had four horses. [...] We got them home all right and it was a good trip that time. [...] We had a scalp dance when we got back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lundgren's biggest {{weakness}} as {{a pitcher}} was lack of control. Even in 1907, his best year, Lundgren averaged 4.0 walks per nine innings pitched. In 1909, he averaged 8.3 walks per nine innings before being released. A profile of Lundgren published in 1913 by The Atlanta Constitution discussed his strengths and weaknesses:"He had everything including speed to burn green hickory {{and an assortment}} of curves that would keep a criptograph specialist figuring all night but he was wild as a March hare in a cyclone and couldn't locate the plate with a <b>field</b> <b>glass.</b> ... He had a strange hold on the art of steering the ball away from the plate that would make Wild Willie Donovan and Cy Seymour look like a brace of pikers who had been touched for their meal tickets." ...|$|E

60|$|And then suddenly--could that be they? An {{officer with}} a {{telescope}} stared intently and pointed. Another and another turned a steady <b>field</b> <b>glass</b> towards the same place. And then the men could see also, {{and a little}} murmur of interest ran down the ranks.|$|E
60|$|Gregory knew that, at Wad Gamr's house, but few {{signs of}} the tragedy had been found when General Brackenbury's troops entered. Bloodstained visiting cards of Stewart's, a few scraps of paper, and a <b>field</b> <b>glass</b> had, alone, been discovered, besides the boxes of papers.|$|E

"That is so," [...] the Major agreed, as he {{examined}} them through his <b>field</b> <b>glass.</b> [...] "I suppose stone is scarce in this neighbourhood, {{but it is}} probable that the walls are of brickwork, and very thick.

60|$|Whenever {{the rangers}} rode {{out on the}} brow of a knoll or ridge or an eminence, before {{starting}} to descend, Ladd required of Gale a long, careful, sweeping survey of the desert ahead through the <b>field</b> <b>glass.</b> There were streams of white dust to be seen, streaks of yellow dust, trailing low clouds of sand over the glistening dunes, but no steadily rising, uniformly shaped puffs that would tell a tale of moving horses on the desert.|$|E
60|$|At {{daylight}} the Major and {{his officers}} mounted and rode quietly down towards the parade ground. Bathurst and Mr. Hunter, {{with several of}} the servants, took their places at the gates, in readiness to open and close them quickly, while the Doctor and the other Europeans {{went up to the}} roof, where they placed in readiness six muskets for each man, from the store in the courthouse. Isobel Hannay and the wives of the two Captains were too anxious to remain below, and went up to the roof also.

60|$|But {{as the day}} wore on my task grew harder. The wind, {{which had}} been blowing hard all the morning, became a hurricane, {{and even in the}} house, with closed doors and windows, we could hear the far-off thunder of the sea {{sweeping}} in against the cliffs. Every one in the household became strangely restless and anxious.

50|$|At {{the train}} station, Aziz is {{arrested and charged}} with sexually assaulting Adela in a cave. The run-up to his trial {{releases}} the racial tensions between the British and the Indians. Adela says that Aziz followed her into the cave and tried to grab her, and that she fended him off by swinging her <b>field</b> <b>glasses</b> at him. The only evidence the British have is the <b>field</b> <b>glasses</b> in the possession of Aziz. Despite this, the British colonists believe that Aziz is guilty. They are stunned when Fielding proclaims his belief in Aziz's innocence. Fielding is ostracised and condemned as a blood-traitor. But the Indians, who consider the assault allegation a fraud, welcome him.|$|R
