5|$|Huggins handled 19 fielding chances, 11 putouts {{and nine}} assists, without {{committing}} {{an error in}} a game with the Saints in 1902; the previous Major League Baseball (MLB) record being 18, set by Fred Dunlap in 1882. In 1903, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> off the first delayed steal in recorded baseball history.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E
5|$|Asashōryū {{got off to}} a bad {{start in}} the July tournament by losing to Toyonoshima on the first day. After a second loss to maegashira Tochinonada on day five, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> out of the tournament on the sixth day citing pain in his elbow. The September tournament {{unfolded}} in a similarly poor fashion. After compiling a lacklustre 5–4 record through the first nine days, Asashōryū forfeited his tenth-day match to maegashira Gōeidō and withdrew. He had elbow pain, and presented a medical certificate.|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, suppose <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> gently a minute, {{and then}} {{stops and looks}} round, and then I tell him to go on, and <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> a minute again, and then stops and looks round.” ...|$|R
5000|$|... 10. Paul: Paul {{is unable}} {{to resist the temptation}} to pull Leslie's pigtails. When <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> on them, Leslie yells out in pain. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> one of her pigtails, earning him his name on the board, and then, after a brief {{struggle}} (including a hallucination of the other pigtail talking), <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> the other pigtail, thus earning him a checkmark. He figures that <b>he</b> can <b>pull</b> Leslie's pigtails twice a day with impunity, until Leslie yells out in pain again. Paul's name is then circled and he is sent home early; it is suggested that Paul did not actually pull Leslie's pigtails the third time, and that Leslie's yell was unprovoked so he would go home.|$|R
50|$|Shuriken: Multicolored shuriken, which <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> {{from his}} belt buckle.|$|R
5|$|At the World Championships Chambers {{finished}} {{sixth in}} 100m final with a season's best of 10.00seconds. He {{was the only}} sprinter from outside the Americas in the final and was some distance behind Bolt who ran a world record of 9.58seconds. However, he was very pleased with his performance {{and said he was}} happy just {{to be involved in the}} fastest 100m race ever. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> out of the 200m with a calf injury and called an end to his season.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> me in {{and pointed}} to the bed. His whole body was {{trembling}} violently. He was screaming there were two Mexicans hiding under his bed with long daggers. To humor him, I looked under the bed and when I rose to assure him there was no one hiding there, he staggered and fell, a dead weight, in my arms. I ran across the hall and called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E
5|$|On the surface, Ambrose thanks the Doctor for {{not letting}} the Silurians execute her for killing Alaya, and the Doctor asks {{her to help}} prepare {{humanity}} for their next encounter with the Silurians. The Doctor and Amy return to the TARDIS, where Amy sights her future self on the hillside without Rory. The Doctor takes out the object <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> from the crack: a burnt piece of the TARDIS's sign. He worriedly compares it to the real thing. Aside from the damage, they appear identical.|$|E

5|$|The McCanns {{and their}} friends left the {{restaurant}} roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine's father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05. The children were asleep and all was well, except that he recalled having left the children's bedroom door slightly ajar, and now it stood almost wide open. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> it nearly closed again {{before returning to the}} restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{fragments of}} the building— the wash-basin and two memorial tables from the forecourt, {{as well as some}} parts of a column— were saved by Ivo Kraus. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> them from the rubble shortly after the end of World War II. The wash-basin and the memorial tables are now in the Zagreb City Museum. The column fragments are kept by the Jewish Community of Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing in}} the Heat's first eight games of the 2014–15 season, Wade missed seven {{consecutive}} games due to a hamstring injury. He returned to action on November 30 against the New York Knicks to score a then season-high 27 points in an 88-79 win. On December 17, despite Wade's season-high 42 points, the Heat were defeated 105-87 by the Utah Jazz. He was named an All-Star for the 11th time, however, on February 11, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> {{out of the game}} due to another hamstring injury and was replaced by Kyle Korver. The Heat finished the season with a 37-45 win/loss record, as Wade missed the post-season for just the second time in his career.|$|E

5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde {{included}} lighting {{changes and}} makeup designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions {{and changes in}} posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently than he did as Jekyll. The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> down to complete the change.|$|E
5|$|Having not {{appeared}} since 2013, Carrick {{was named}} in the squad for the November 2014 matches with Slovenia and Scotland. However, on 12 November, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> out of the squad after sustaining a groin injury. On 27 March 2015, Carrick made his first appearance for England in 17 months, starting the 4–0 UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying defeat of Lithuania at Wembley Stadium. On 31 March 2015, Carrick made his 33rd appearance for the national team {{as a substitute for}} Manchester United teammate and defender Chris Smalling, performing impressively to help England earn a draw against Italy in an international friendly match.|$|E
5|$|He succeeded Balthasar for {{the second}} time as JG 2 commander, who had died in combat with Spitfires over {{northern}} France when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> the tail off his Bf 109F in a dive. The Bf 109F-2 proved an excellent match to the Spitfire V, but Oesau disliked its reduced armament compared to the 'Emil', and continued to fly an E-4 model in preference to the Bf 109F, until lack of spares forced him to switch to the newer variant. Upon his appointment on 4 July 1941, he addressed JG 2 with the following words.|$|E

5|$|However, Glasgow was now {{exposed to}} fire from three ships, so Howe decided to break off the battle, {{in order to avoid}} being boarded, and made sail for Newport. Despite {{extensive}} damage to the sail and rigging, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> away from the pursuing fleet, which was fully laden with its captured goods. Hopkins called off the chase after several hours in order to avoid an encounter with the British squadron at Newport. His only prize was Glasgow tender, which the fleet brought to anchor in New London, Connecticut on April 8.|$|E
5|$|In the 1936 senatorial {{contest in}} Kentucky, {{incumbent}} Democrat Marvel Mills Logan {{was seen as}} vulnerable, and Chandler backed Democratic challenger J. C. W. Beckham in the Democratic primary. This endorsement drew the ire of Chandler's former ally, Democratic Congressman John Y. Brown, Sr., who believed that, {{in exchange for his}} support of Chandler in the 1935 gubernatorial race, Chandler would support him in the U.S. Senate contest. An embittered Brown entered the race anyway, and the votes <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> from Beckham likely allowed Logan to retain the seat. Brown remained Chandler's political enemy {{for the rest of his}} political career.|$|E
5|$|Mark Cavendish and Daniele Bennati, stage {{winners in}} the past two editions of the Giro, were absent from this race, but several top sprinters took the start in Amsterdam. These {{included}} Tyler Farrar, André Greipel, and Alessandro Petacchi, all of whom had themselves won Grand Tour stages in 2009 and figured to be top favorites for the Giro's flat stages. Former Tour de France points classification winner Óscar Freire intended to make his Giro debut in this race, but <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> out due to sinusitis shortly before the race started. Other sprinters in the Giro peloton included Robbie McEwen, Freire's teammate Graeme Brown, Baden Cooke, Leonardo Duque, Sebastian Haedo, Wouter Weylandt, and Greg Henderson.|$|E

5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{entered a}} {{classroom}} {{on the second}} floor, room 206, where teacher Sandra Smith taught Honors English. When Smith {{asked him what he}} was doing in the classroom, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> out his handgun and ordered her, all of the male students, and several female students to leave. He then fired one shot into the air after Smith tried to speak to him again. After Smith and the male students left the classroom, Morrison instructed the seven remaining students to stand facing the chalkboard. He later released one student at approximately 12:15 p.m., before law enforcement arrived at the scene.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 1977, {{just two}} weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> himself together, and began {{running up and down the}} flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.|$|E
