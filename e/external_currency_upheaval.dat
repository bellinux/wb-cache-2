40|$|The 14 Pacific {{developing}} {{member countries}} (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have opted for very different exchange rate regimes {{with varying degrees}} of flexibility. Whereas several microstates have adopted an <b>external</b> <b>currency</b> as their legal tender, others have decided to use a basket currency and yet others have chosen a managed float. The choice of exchange rate regime can have far reaching economic consequences. In this paper, we first build a simple exchange rate model that illustrates how monetary authorities should best determine the weights of the basket currencies in order to keep fluctuations in gross domestic product (GDP) and in exchange rates to a minimum. We add to the literature by explicitly modeling tourism flows. In {{the second part of the}} paper we study the recent developments of the Pacific DMCs in terms of the volatility of their exchange rates, their GDP and their balance of trade. We find that Pacific DMCs with <b>external</b> <b>currencies</b> systematically exhibit lower GDP volatility compared to Pacific DMCs with basket currencies or floats. We conclude that Pacific DMCs with basket currencies or floats seem to have managed their exchange rate with the objective to minimize fluctuations of exchange rates, rather than those of their GDP. Our model therefore provides valuable guidance for those monetary authorities in the Pacific that would like to lower GDP fluctuations...|$|R

Central, cross-industry wage agreements ended in the late 1970 s or early 1980 s in Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden, some time later in Norway and, {{in the form of}} central award setting, in New Zealand and Australia in the 1990 s. They continued in Finland, Belgium and Greece, usually with much help or pressure from the government. Tripartite social pacts and agreements became the format for wage setting in Ireland from 1987 to 2009, during some years in the 1980 s and 1990 s in Portugal, from 1994 in Slovenia and from 2005 in Romania. There never were central wage agreements in Germany, Switzerland, the UK, Canada, the USA, Japan and the other non-European countries. The UK went through a phase of union-government ‘social contract’ bargaining in the 1970 s, and there were similar social pacts in Australia in the 1980 s, in South Korea during the Asian crisis (1997) and in Chile after the end of dictatorship in 1990. There were sparse pacts in CEE and the tripartite social dialogue over the national minimum wage, introduced in many CEE countries during or after transition, sometimes served as an Ersatz for wage negotiations based on bargaining power of employers and unions. Political and social considerations were often preponderant, but employers could retaliate by not complying and payment below the minimum or re-arranging employment contracts in works contracts outside the scope of minimum wage laws was a widespread practice (EC 2004).|$|R

In the case of multilateral trade between the US {{and the rest of the}} world, on the other hand, the evidence indicates that a depreciation of the dollar would not substantially reduce the US global trade deficit. In the case of Asia’s exports, results presented here and elsewhere indicate that: (i) sophisticated exports produced within regional production networks depend on exchange rates throughout the region; (ii) labor-intensive exports from developing Asian countries are strongly influenced by each country’s own exchange rate; (iii) developing Asian countries compete extensively with each other in exports to third markets; (iv) a currency appreciation in developing Asia would increase capital and consumption goods imports; and (v) exchange rate volatility deters parts and components trade in Asia.

40|$|Helm (2008) asked: 'Climate change policy: why has {{so little}} been achieved?' Cultural Theory (CT) {{has been used}} to analyse the debate over climate change, arguing that {{competing}} worldviews mandate divergent policy responses (Rayner & Malone 1998). CT's framework suggests the monolithic structure of the UNFCCC process fails to integrate these multiple worldviews, hindering effective action. This thesis uses a complementary framework, Fiske's (1992) Relational Model's Theory (RMT). Whereas CT analyses the debate at the societal level, RMT proposes a framework of individual social cognition comprising four models of social exchange: 'Equality Matching', based upon reciprocity; 'Communal Sharing', based on equal entitlement within a community; 'Authority Ranking', based upon established status; and 'Market Pricing', based on an <b>external</b> <b>currency</b> of merit. RMT implies that the relational models found in individual cognition should be mirrored in any debate at the societal and inter-personal levels. Content analyses of media articles and focus group interviews support the view that there are four coherent Standpoints matching these relational models in the debate. Survey respondents who believe in climate change used different models from those who did not, but survey evidence also gave support to the view that individuals use multiple models to reason over novel or contested issues such as climate change. CT explicitly argues that one of the four hypothesised worldviews, the 'fatalist', is not active in shaping policy. In contrast, these empirical studies suggest that the closest equivalent relational model, Equality Matching, generates the Commons Dilemma (Hardin, 1968) that actually drives much of the debate. The studies also raised new questions about the structure connecting the four relational models, or the worldviews. Lastly, the framework confirms {{it will be difficult to}} get concerted action before climate change impacts intensify, at which point social as well as climate thresholds will have been crossed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Japan's {{strategy for}} Asian monetary integration. It argues that Japan faces three major policy challenges when promoting intraregional exchange rate stability. First, {{there must be}} some convergence of exchange rate regimes in East Asia, and the most realistic option is for the region's emerging economies to adopt similar managed floating regimes - rather than a peg to an <b>external</b> <b>currency.</b> This requires major emerging economies - particularly the People's Republic of China (PRC) - to move to a more flexible regime vis- 0 -vis the US dollar. Second, given the limited degree of the yen's internationalization and the lack of the renminbi's (or the prospect of its rapid) full convertibility, it {{is in the interest of}} East Asia to create a regional monetary anchor through a combination of some form of national inflation targeting and a currency basket system. Emerging economies in the region need to find a suitable currency basket for their exchange rate target, such as a special drawing rights-plus (SDR+) currency basket - i. e., a basket of the SDR and emerging East Asian currencies. Third, if the creation of a stable regional monetary zone is desirable, the region must have a country or countries assuming a leadership role in this endeavor. There is no question that Japan and the PRC are such potential leaders, and the two countries need to collaborate closely with each other. To assume a leadership role, together with the PRC, in creating a stable monetary zone in Asia, Japan needs to make significant efforts at the national and regional levels and further strengthen financial cooperation. Practical steps that Japan could take include (i) restoring sustained economic growth through Abenomics; (ii) transforming Tokyo into a globally competitive international financial center; (iii) further strengthening regional economic and financial surveillance (Economic Review and Policy Dialogue and ASEAN+ 3 Macroeconomic Research Office) and regional financial safety nets (Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization) and creation of an Asian currency unit index; and (iv) launching serious policy discussions focusing on exchange rate issues to achieve intraregional exchange rate stability...|$|R

Therefore, the choice of different monetary policy tools is not neutral when affecting output. Var model, external debt, exchange rates, monetary policy...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the South Caucasus and Central Asia {{countries}} (CCA- 6) {{have received}} significant foreign exchange inflows. While a healthy reserve buffer is desirable to selfinsure against external crises, holding international reserves also involves costs. We analyze {{the adequacy of}} CCA- 6 reserves using widely recognized rules of thumb, and simulate optimal reserve levels applying the Jeanne (2007) model. Both the adequacy measures and the model-based simulations indicate that, {{with the exception of}} Tajikistan, CCA- 6 reserves had increased to broadly comfortable levels by 2006. More recently, reserve adequacy has been tested in Kazakhstan, which has been affected by the 2007 global liquidity crunch.

40|$|Paper 1 : We {{investigate}} the international distribution of external balances using a world economy model featuring country-specific macroeconomic uncertainty. Incomplete international financial markets and a collateral constraint on borrowing both serve to limit risk-sharing opportunities. In this environment, insurance against uncertainty {{takes the form}} of physical capital accumulation and intertemporal trade between countries. The cross-country dispersion of net foreign assets is close to its empirical counterpart. Macroeconomic uncertainty accounts for about one third of the international variation of cross-border asset holdings in the model. Approximations suggest that decreases in financial frictions were an important driver of increases in the international dispersion of external balances observed in the data. Paper 2 : I {{investigate the}} effect of real exchange rate movements on the international distribution of external balances in a model world economy featuring incomplete markets. Intertemporal trade between nations is the only means of insuring against country-specific uncertainty. By changing the return to delaying consumption, fluctuations in the real exchange rate influence the accumulation of foreign assets. In a plausibly calibrated approximation of the model, the proportion of the cross-country dispersion of net foreign assets, the current account and the trade balance that {{can be attributed to the}} effect of real exchange rate movements is 23, 35 and 53 percent respectively. Paper 3 : The link between exchange rate flexibility, the international balance sheet and economic recoveries is analysed in this paper through the application of OLS and two-stage least squares estimators to a dataset covering 201 recovery episodes occurring between 1971 and 2007. An instrument representing the history of exchange rate regime choice in the years immediately preceding the recovery is used to identify exogenous variation in exchange rate flexibility for the two-stage least squares procedure. Our results suggest that when <b>external</b> foreign <b>currency</b> denominated debt liabilities are relatively large, a pegged regime is associated with significantly faster real GDP growth than a non-pegged arrangement during a recovery. This finding can be rationalised on the basis that when <b>external</b> foreign <b>currency</b> denominated borrowing becomes sufficiently large, the adverse balance sheet effects associated with higher levels of exchange rate flexibility begin to significantly outweigh the beneficial expenditure switching effects...|$|R
40|$|The author {{advances}} {{his main}} thesis {{in his second}} sentence: {{the question of the}} amount and nature of the reserves (<b>external</b> <b>currencies</b> and gold) held by countries is "a major problem and indeed the most important problem confronting those responsible for economic affairs of the free world". One senses exaggeration here: is it because the author is an Englishman, for no other country seems to experience in degree of intensity these recurrent balance of payments' crises - the latest still with us - in the manner of the U. K. ? Ireland cannot take a detached view of these U. K. difficulties since, because of our preponderant and increasing trade relations with our great neighbour, parity of exchange rates must continue unaltered. The quotation is puzzling for other reasons. It is quite obvious from the author's excellent chapter (the best in the book) on the International Monetary Fund that the author aspires, as every sensible man must, towards converting the International Monetary Fund into a world bank in which the cash reserves would be lodgments by countries of whatever currencies they care to hold, pending the establishment of an international currency unit. On such cash reserves could be built a large volume of credit to tide countries over temporary balance of payments difficulties. Exactly {{as in the case of}} a commercial bank vis-a-vis its customers, the International Monetary Fund could build a large volume of credit on its cash reserves. With a world bank, existing reserves would then be more than adequate and the present absurdity of each country sitting on its little store of reserves in fear and trembling, like the insects in Capek’s Insect play, would cease. Even as matters stand, however, the reviewer has doubts about the validity of the author's supporting argument, which is simply that international trade has increased since pre-war much more than reserves. Surely one would expect that~ with increasing intimacy of relationship between central banks, international trade can now be conducted on a lower volume of reserves? The author does not attempt to evolve a formula relating minimum level of reserves necessary for the conduct of international trade...|$|R
