60|$|In {{consequence}} of pending treaty negotiations {{the government had}} become particular about the privileges it granted. One of the first counter-moves to foreign insistence on <b>exterritoriality</b> was the restricting of passports to a fortnight's time. You might lay out any tour you chose, and if granted by the government, the provinces designated would all be duly inscribed in your passport, {{but you had to}} compass them all in the fortnight or be punished. Of course this could be evaded, and a Japanese friend in the foreign office had kindly promised to send me an extension on telegraph. But the dislike of being tied to times and places made me sinfully prefer the risk of being marched back to Tokyo under the charge of a policeman, a fate I had seen overtake one or two other malefactors caught at somewhat different crimes, whom we had casually met on the road. The Harinoki toge was largely to blame for the delay, it is true. But then unluckily the Harinoki toge could not be arrested, and I could.|$|E

5000|$|In November 1653 Gerard {{appeared}} as a witness at the trial of Don Pantaleone Sá, a brother of the Portuguese ambassador, {{for the murder of}} an Englishman. The night before the murder Gerard had overheard Pantaleone Sá and his friends talking of English affairs in the street and had given them the lie, whereupon they had attacked him, and, though a little man, yet [...] "he threw him off that was upon him, and so was hustling with him a good while", but was rescued by a passer-by, after he had received a stab in the shoulder. Don Pantaleon Sá was affronted by what he perceived to be a slight on his honour and he returned to the location the next day with an armed retinue to seek revenge. He mistook another man for Gerard and killed him. Pantaleone Sá sought sanctuary in the ambassador's residence, but the Lord Chief Justice, Henry Rolle,supported by other expert opinions, decided that <b>exterritoriality</b> coved the ambassador and not members of his household in cases of murder, so Pantaleone Sá was arrested tried and found guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged.|$|E

40|$|The author’s main {{objective}} was to present the principles concerning extradition. The European Convention on Extradition drawn up in Paris on 13 Dec 1957 is a significant legal act that is {{the starting point for}} presenting principles of extradition in legal acts at the constitutional level in different countries. This article deals with the principles of the constitutions of selected federal countries, such as the USA or Switzerland, as well as some others, e. g. Italy or Spain. A discussion is presented of the principle of <b>exterritoriality</b> of some other countries in reference to extradition as well as the institution of the European warrant of arrest, which is to come into force on 1 st Jan 2004. The analysis of the international agreements signed by Poland, the forms of accepted solutions as well as the temporary schemes of conclusions all bear out the significance of the accepted political system and its role in promoting the image of Poland as a democratic country and a reliable partner in negotiations that respects internationally recognised rules. The institution of extradition urgently requires the simplification of procedures; it imposes a very difficult task upon the national legislator and international institutions. At the present stage Poland faces the challenge of developing an effective execution of the law...|$|E

40|$|The Dissertation {{entitled}} "The Status of the Diplomatic Mission of a State in the 1961 Vienna Convention Perspective and the Progress of Diplomatic Law ", aims {{to identify}} and analyze the inviolability of the diplomatic premises in the receiving state {{as stated in the}} 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the jurisdiction of sovereign state, and the status of diplomatic missions in applying extraterritorial jurisdiction to take measures that are inconsistent with the provisions of Article 41 paragraph (3) of the Vienna Convention and the progress of diplomatic law after the 1961 Vienna Convention setting up. Some theories are used to analyze the issues raised in this dissertation such as: the extraterritorial/ <b>exterritoriality</b> jurisdiction theory, the functional necessity theory, the sovereignty theory, the perfect equality of state theory, the territorial jurisdiction theory and the reciprocity theory. This prescriptive legal research focused on law enforcement and it was aimed explaining to determine the truth of law. The study based on the provisions of international law, particularly in the diplomatic law, namely the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and other laws (das-Sollen), as well as the application (das-Sein). The status of inviolability of diplomatic premises in the receiving state has not been absolute anymore. The progress of diplomatic law has shown that the situation can changes the status of inviolability. The protection of the citizens of the sending state who are involved in criminal act in the receiving state can be done based on the rights of extraterritorial jurisdiction. In the event of the receiving state has failed to implement international obligations to give mandatory access on consular notification and when the failure has caused harm to the citizens, the sending state is entitled to bring the case to international court. The granting of diplomatic asylum in spite of being contrary to the Convention of Diplomatic Relations has evolved into customary international law...|$|E
40|$|Diplomatic {{immunity}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} elements of foreign relations, dating back as far as Ancient Greece and Rome. Today, it is a principle that has been codified into the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations regulating past customs and practices. Consuls and international organizations, although their privileges and immunities are similar to diplomatic personnel, do differ and are regulated by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the United Nations International Immunities respectively. These Conventions have been influenced by past practices and by three theories during different era’s namely <b>exterritoriality,</b> personal representation and functional necessity. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations further provides certain immunities and privileges to different levels of diplomatic officials, their staff and families. Privileges and immunities will be considered under various main categories, namely the diplomatic mission, the diplomatic official, diplomatic staff, and families. Each category receives privileges and immunities, for example immunities enjoyed by the diplomatic mission include mission correspondence and bags. Diplomatic officials enjoy personal inviolability, immunity from jurisdiction and inviolability of diplomats’ residences and property. The staff and families of diplomatic officials too enjoy privileges and immunities. The problem of so many people receiving privileges and immunities is that there is a high likelihood of abuse. Abuses that arise are various crimes committed by diplomats, their staff and families. They are immune from local punishment and appear to be above the local law. Although the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations provides remedies against diplomats, staff and families who abuse their position, it gives the impression that it is not enough. Various Acts in the United Kingdom, United States and the Republic of South Africa will be analysed in order to ascertain what governments have done to try and curb diplomatic abuses. Each will be considered and found that although they have restricted immunity from previous practices it still places the diplomats’ needs above its own citizens. Thus several suggestions have been put forward and argued whether they are successful in restricting immunity comprehensively. Such suggestions are amending the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations; using the functional necessity theory to further limit immunity; forming bilateral treaties between States as a possible means to restrict or limit; and lastly establishing a Permanent International Diplomatic Criminal Court. The key question to be answered is whether diplomatic immunity is needed for the efficient functioning of foreign relations between States...|$|E
