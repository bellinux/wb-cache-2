2500|$|On {{his return}} to China in AD 645, Xuanzang was greeted with much honor but he refused all high civil {{appointments}} offered by the still-reigning emperor, Emperor Taizong of Tang.

Manifestly there is no a priori improbability. I have seen the archaic patterns of concentric circles and fish spines, (or whatever we call the medial line with slanting side lines,) neatly designed in white on the flag stones in front of cottage doors in Galloway. The cottagers dwelt near the rocks with similar patterns on the estate of Monreith, but {{are not likely to}} have copied them; the patterns, I presume, were mere survivals in tradition.|$|R
50|$|Stephen Victor Tracy (born 1941) is an American {{scholar of}} Classics specializing in ancient Greek Epigraphy. Inscriptions {{are one of}} the most {{important}} classes of primary evidence that comes down to us from antiquity. Tracy is best known for devising a method for recognizing the work of individual <b>inscribers.</b> It was long thought that the intractability of the medium (hammer and chisel on marble) made this impossible. But by treating the inscribed letters as a kind of handwriting he has been able to establish careers for many cutters, to join discrete fragments, to date inscriptions more accurately than in the past, and often thereby make it possible to reach a new understanding of historical events.|$|R
60|$|An {{inscription}} which, {{though in}} a sense not less intrusive than the contrasted ones of the stranger, did not, as it seemed, provoke any corresponding derision or surprise, much less indignation; and still less, to all appearances, did it gain for the <b>inscriber</b> the repute of being a simpleton.|$|E
60|$|The similarity, {{intellectual}} and moral, between the Judge and his ancestor {{appears to have}} been at least as strong as the resemblance of mien and feature would afford reason to anticipate. In old Colonel Pyncheon's funeral discourse the clergyman absolutely canonized his deceased parishioner, and opening, as it were, a vista through the roof of the church, and thence through the firmament above, showed him seated, harp in hand, among the crowned choristers of the spiritual world. On his tombstone, too, the record is highly eulogistic; nor does history, so far as he holds a place upon its page, assail the consistency and uprightness of his character. So also, as regards the Judge Pyncheon of to-day, neither clergyman, nor legal critic, nor <b>inscriber</b> of tombstones, nor historian of general or local politics, would venture a word against this eminent person's sincerity as a Christian, or respectability as a man, or integrity as a judge, or courage and faithfulness as the often-tried representative of his political party. But, besides these cold, formal, and empty words of the chisel that inscribes, the voice that speaks, and the pen that writes, for the public eye and for distant time,--and which inevitably lose much of their truth and freedom by the fatal consciousness of so doing,--there were traditions about the ancestor, and private diurnal gossip about the Judge, remarkably accordant in their testimony. It is often instructive to take the woman's, the private and domestic, view of a public man; nor can anything be more curious than the vast discrepancy between portraits intended for engraving and the pencil-sketches that pass from hand to hand behind the original's back.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the whole}} amusing history of impostures, {{there is no}} more {{diverting}} chapter than that which deals with literary frauds. None contains a more grotesque revelation of the smallness and the complexity of human nature, and none--not even the records of the Tichborne trial, nor of general elections--displays more pleasantly the depths of mortal credulity. The literary forger is usually a clever man, and it is necessary for him to be at least on a level with the literary knowledge and critical science of his time. But how low that level commonly appears to be! Think of the success of Ireland, a boy of eighteen; think of Chatterton; think of Surtees of Mainsforth, who took in the great Sir Walter himself, the father of all them that are skilled in ballad lore. How simple were the artifices of these ingenious impostors, their resources how scanty; how hand-to-mouth and improvised was their whole procedure! Times have altered a little. Jo Smith's revelation and famed 'Golden Bible' only carried captive the polygamous populus qui vult decipi, reasoners a little lower than even the believers in Anglo-Israel. The Moabite Ireland, who once gave Mr. Shapira the famous MS. of Deuteronomy, but did not delude M. Clermont-Ganneau, was doubtless a smart man; he was, however, a little too indolent, a little too easily satisfied. He might have procured better and less recognisable materials than his old [...] "synagogue rolls;" [...] in short, he took rather too little trouble, and came to the wrong market. A literary forgery ought first, perhaps, to appeal to the credulous, and only slowly should it come, with the prestige of having already won many believers, before the learned world. The <b>inscriber</b> of the Phoenician inscriptions in Brazil (of all places) was a clever man. His account of the voyage of Hiram to South America probably gained some credence in Brazil, while in England it only carried captive Mr. Day, author of 'The Prehistoric Use of Iron and Steel.' But the Brazilians, from lack of energy, have dropped the subject, and the Phoenician inscriptions of Brazil are less successful, after all, than the Moabite stone, about which one begins to entertain disagreeable doubts.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the arrival}} of Islam during the Tang Dynasty (beginning in the mid-7th century), many Arabic or Persian {{speaking}} people migrated into China. Centuries later, these peoples assimilated with the native Han Chinese, forming the Hui ethnicity of today. Many Chinese Muslim students attended madrasas to study Classical Arabic and the Qur'an. Because these students had a very basic understanding of Chinese characters but {{would have a better}} command of the spoken tongue once assimilated, they started using the Arabic script for Chinese. [...] This was often done by writing notes in Chinese to aid in the memorization of surahs. This method was also used to write Chinese translations of Arabic vocabulary learned in the madrasas. Thus, a system of writing the Chinese language with Arabic script gradually developed and standardized to some extent. Currently, the oldest known artifact showing signs of Xiao'erjing is a stone stele in the courtyard of [...] in Xi'an in the province of Shaanxi. The stele shows inscribed Qur'anic verses in Arabic as well as a short note of the names of the <b>inscribers</b> in Xiao'erjing. The stele was done in the year AH 740 in the Islamic calendar (between July 9, 1339 and June 26, 1340). Some old Xiao'erjing manuscripts (along with other rare texts including those from Dunhuang) are preserved in the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, Russia.|$|R
40|$|The {{inscriptions}} from Khirbet Beit Lei and Khirbet el-Q?m {{were originally}} situated in hewn burial caves {{in the southern}} Shephelah. Since their original publication in 1963 and 1970 respectively, new technologies have become available for photographing epigraphic material. Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is a technique that combines multiple light angles to facilitate enhanced views of the object. This dissertation uses new photographs {{as the basis for}} a fresh assessment of the cave inscriptions. Building upon previous paleographic and archaeological analyses of the inscriptions and their setting, this study presents an integrative analysis of the source and purposes of the inscriptions in context. Viewing the inscriptions as physical objects, the production and preservation of which involved numerous processes, each of which were socially and culturally informed, facilitates a more holistic treatment of the inscriptions. When the inscriptions are examined in the context of various classifications of inscribing, such as informal inscribing, ritual inscribing and mortuary inscribing, a number of themes emerge. The cave inscriptions represent commemorative inscribing, physically memorializing identities and events on the tomb walls. Overwriting and other repetitious inscribing illustrate the importance of the act of inscribing and hint at a ritual or performative use of writing. The unique combination of texts and images along with the burial setting and placement of the inscriptions betray an innovative use of both the content and the space. Given the context of conflict besetting the kingdom of Judah during much of the Iron Age IIB, there are multiple possibilities regarding the more specific impetus for the inscriptions. While {{it is not possible to}} ascertain whether or not the inscriptions were associated with the burial use of the tombs, this contextual study highlights the fact that the <b>inscribers</b> would have already been affiliated with the space and that they selected the tomb setting because the meaning of the space aligned with the purposes of the inscribing...|$|R

40|$|For several decades, Ecuadorian, U. S. American, and European social {{scientists}} have studied Ecuadorian {{migration to the}} European Union. Yet little academic research {{has been devoted to}} the comparative study of literary and filmic representations of diasporic Ecuadorians. This disparity between social science and literary studies research is especially evident in scholarship published in English, a gap this dissertation proposes to fill. I investigate the discourses, cultural production, representations, and self-representations of diasporic Ecuadorians in Southern/Mediterranean Europe, specifically in Spain and Italy, where the largest diasporic communities of Ecuadorians in the European Union reside. I focus on a selection of works of fiction, poetry, and films, with particular attention given to texts by diasporic Ecuadorians. I argue that some of these recent texts point to a shift in epistemological standpoints, self-representational strategies, and political coalitional projects that differ from previous understandings and representations of the Ecuadorian migrant. I suggest that they gesture toward the narrative of a subject who not only exposes her subjectivities and experiences, but also connects these within larger translocal histories, revealing the global subalternization of migrants and critiquing dominant systems of power. Since the mid- 1990 s, approximately 1. 5 million Ecuadorian women and men from diverse geographical, social, and ethnoracial backgrounds (roughly 10 percent of the total population) have migrated to the European Union, particularly to Southern/Mediterranean Europe. Ecuadorian women often work as caretakers of the elderly, disabled, or the ill, while men work in construction and other manual labor. Unlike previous Ecuadorian migrations to the U. S., this migration was predominantly female and with a higher formal education than that of the average Ecuadorian population. As subalternized, ethnicized, and racialized migrants, Ecuadorians are seldom viewed by mainstream European societies as narrators and <b>inscribers</b> of their own experiences and subjectivities, or as agents of knowledge production and self-representation. I suggest that intercultural projects such as poetry contests, developed by diasporic Ecuadorians in Genoa, have countered certain discursive formations regarding Ecuadorian youth in Italy by fostering their self-presentation as creators and producers of knowledge and culture. The texts analyzed advance the documentation of translocal Ecuadorian narratives in Southern/Mediterranean Europe...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{inspired}} by the "follow the things" movement that trace and document the history and travels of ordinary consumer goods such as jeans, shopping bags, food, blouses or hair extensions (see [URL] for a collection of travel reports). Narratives about products' origins and transformations {{have become part of}} the discourse on sustainable consumption, and {{it has been suggested that}} the post consumption phases of goods should be included in these narratives (Gregson et al (2010). This study can be seen as a response to their call, and we start our inquiry at the containers for textile recycling at the ReTuna mall - the world's first mall for reused goods - (see www. retuna. se). The narratives of garments will be documented through interviews with the donors, and we will shadow the garments through the re-cycle process at the ReTuna mall. ReTuna Mall aims for reuse, i. e., to re-introduce disposed garments to the fashion consumers visiting the mall. Accordingly, some garments will re-enter the consumption phase, but most garments are likely to be sorted out and re-defined into other purposes than being wearable.   Reuse is one of the most common strategies used by fashion companies in their attempt to make the supply chain sustainable (Kant Hvass, 2016). Obviously, reuse of fashion reduces the demand for new garments, which in turns reduce the negative environmental impact of the textile production processes (Woolridge, Ward, Phillips, Collins, & Gandy, 2006; Farrant, Olsen, & Wangel, 2010; Castellani, Sala, & Mirabella, 2015). Reuse of fashion goods has the same basic structure as that of waste management, i. e., organized in three separate phases: collection, sorting and reprocessing. The literature on reuse in general is extensive, and studies on fashion reuse have become popular too. To give some examples, studies of consumers fashion disposal behaviour concentrate in most cases on disposal channels, behavioural motivations, disposal reasons and demographics of consumers that behave in specified ways (Laitala, 2014). Studies that focus on donation of fashion as disposal method on the other hand (i. e. Ha-Brookshire and Hodges (2009), Ekström, Hjelmgren, and Salomonson (2015) describes general motives for the disposal, but do not uncover the actual process or the activities that are involved in the donation - i. e. why is the individual garment donated and how is the sorting performed. These type of questions are touched upon in studies of the practices of sorting (Jana M. Hawley, 2006; Botticello, 2012), but these do not follow the garments through the whole process. Of interest for us is also studies on waste management in general, e. g., Åkesson's (2012) study on how a disposed goods are transformed and given new meanings as they travel through the phases of reuse; that what is waste at one phase will transform into a resource in another. Disposed goods can also, with or without disassembling, re-appear in different shapes with different meanings at another stage in the process (Gregson, Crang, Ahamed, Akhter, & Ferdous, 2010).   As stated above, we trace and document the travel of donated fashion garments through the collection, sorting and reprocessing activities at the mall. For each step we pose two major questions: what happens and who/what are involved in this. In doing so, we take on the ANT approach to our objects of study and consider non-humans as equally possible instigators of actions and <b>inscribers</b> of meaning as humans. From our literature review, we believe that our study provides a somewhat novel approach to fashion reuse, and that it has the potential to contribute to the growing body of knowledge of sustainable fashion...|$|R

50|$|In 1935, {{inventor}} Fritz Pfleumer {{took the}} electromagnetic recording idea {{and took it}} to the next level. Rather than using heavy, expensive, and dangerous steel wire like Poulsen, Pfleumer realized that he could coat normal strips of paper with tiny particles of iron.

The magnetophon operated with a process nearly identical to that of the telegraphone. An <b>inscriber,</b> called the recording head, passes over the electromagnetic paper strip, creating patterns of varying magnetic polarity within it, which can later be played back. The playback is achieved using a reversal of the recording process. The pre-magnetized paper, which had come to be known as tape, passed over a coil, creating changes in magnetic flux. These changes were translated into an electric current, which when amplified produced a replica of the previously recorded sounds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} similarities and differences in the inscriptions of runestones in today's county of Kronoberg, the former county of Värend and, in addition, a part of the former county of Sunnerbo. The study is based on 27 remaining runestones which are analysed through choice of words and runes, orthography and decorations. The section of choice of words and runes are categorised and based on the choice of choosing one particular word over another and of choosing one particular rune over another. Orthography is based on the spelling of five particular words; efter, sten, reste, hjälpe and och. Monophtongisation is discussed and analysed. The section of decorations has two subsections; 1) crucifixes and ”suns”, and 2) other forms of decoration. The study showed that the runestones had some significant numbers of similarities and differences. The study also showed that the option of choosing one word, or rune, over another was probably a conscious choice made by the runic <b>inscriber</b> himself. The spelling of the five words revealed a limited number of spelling choices, and that monophtongisation had occurred in some words. The majority of the runestones had some form of decoration, usually a crucifix, which were categorised. However, attribution could only be made in a few cases, due to the limited amount of criteria used.

40|$|As {{new media}} become more ubiquitous, our {{emotional}} experiences in digital space are increasing exponentially as well. While {{there is much}} talk of “affective” computing and “affective” new media art, a disconnect exists between networked emotions and the popular media that they inhabit. This research presents a theoretical framework for assessing “digital emotions”—a term that describes the feedback process between digital technologies and the body with respect to short, networked inscriptions of emotion and the (re) experience of those inscriptions within the body and through digital space. Digital emotions display five basic characteristics {{that can be applied}} to a variety of media environments: (1) They describe a process of feedback that link short, emotive inscriptions in digital environments to users and their (re) experiences of those inscriptions; (2) This feedback process includes, but is not limited to, the <b>inscriber,</b> the medium, and the receiver and the emotive experience fuels the initial connectivity and any further connectivity; (3) The emotional value varies depending on the media, the community of users, and the aesthetic experience of the digital emotion; (4) Digital emotions influence our emotional repertoire by normalizing our paradigm scenarios; and (5) They are highly malleable based on changes in technologies and their ability to both expand and contract emotional experiences in real time. The core characteristics of digital emotions are applied to three broad and overlapping categories: technology, community, and aesthetic experience. Each of these aspects of digital emotions work together, yet they exist along the massive spectrum of our online, emotional experiences—from our casual click of the “like” button to digital community artworks. Applied to digital spaces along this spectrum, digital emotions illuminate the feedback process that occurs between the media, the network, and the environment. The framework ultimately suggests that the process of digital emotions explicates emotions experiences that could only occur in digital space and are therefore unique to digital culture...|$|E
