50|$|The {{original}} {{standard was}} a 16-bit bus, {{designed to fit}} within the existing Eurocard DIN connectors. However, {{there have been several}} updates to the system to allow wider bus widths. The current VME64 includes a full 64-bit bus in 6U-sized cards and 32-bit in 3U cards. The VME64 protocol has a typical performance of 40 MB/s. Other associated standards have added hot-swapping (plug-and-play) in VME64x, smaller 'IP' cards that plug into a single VMEbus card, and various <b>interconnect</b> <b>standards</b> for linking VME systems together.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Multimedia traffic {{presents}} {{some special}} requirements that are unattainable with a best-effort service. Current <b>interconnect</b> <b>standards</b> provide mechanisms {{to overcome the}} limitations of the best-effort model, but they do not suffice to satisfy the strict requirements of video transmissions. This problem has been extensively addressed at the general networking community. Several solutions have arisen, but they are too complex to be applied to high speed-interconnects. In this paper, we propose a network architecture that {{is at the same time}} compatible with the requirements of high-speed interconnects and provides video traffic with the QoS it demands...|$|R
50|$|The Scalable Coherent Interface or Scalable Coherent Interconnect (SCI), was a {{high-speed}} <b>interconnect</b> <b>standard</b> for shared memory multiprocessing and message passing {{used in the}} 1990s. The goal was to scale well, provide system-wide memory coherence and a simple interface; i.e. a standard to replace buses in multiprocessor systems without the inherent scalability and performance limitations of buses. The IEEE Std 1596-1992, IEEE Standard for Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) {{was approved by the}} IEEE standards board on March 19, 1992.|$|E
50|$|Switches: Since PCI Express is a {{point-to-point}} serial <b>interconnect</b> <b>standard,</b> {{it requires}} a switch to connect a single PCI Express port from a processor or chipset to multiple end-points. PLX started with the PCIe 1.0 family at 2.5 Gigatransfers per second in 2004, followed by PCIe 2.0 products in late 2007, where the data rate doubled to 5.0 Gigatransfers per second.The company offers more than 18 PCIe 3.0 products at 8 Gigatransfers per second.Such chips can be optionally installed by motherboard manufacturers {{to increase the number}} of available PCIe lanes.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, RapidIO was {{selected}} by the Next Generation Spacecraft <b>Interconnect</b> <b>Standard</b> (NGSIS) working group {{to serve as the}} foundation for standard communication interconnects to be used in spacecraft. The NGSIS is an umbrella standards effort that includes RapidIO Version 3.1 development, and a box level hardware standards effort under VITA 78 called SpaceVPX or High ReliabilityVPX. The NGSIS requirements committee developed extensive requirements criteria with 47 different elements for the NGSIS interconnect. Independent trade study results by NGSIS member companies demonstrated the superiority of RapidIO over other existing commercial protocols, such as InfiniBand, Fibre Channel, and 10G Ethernet. As a result, the group decided that RapidIO offered the best overall interconnect for the needs of next-generation spacecraft.|$|E

In this paper, we cover the weaknesses of that proposal and, not only we reduce VCs, but we also improve performance due to the flexibility assigning buffer memory. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{link system}} was {{upgraded}} {{to a new}} 100 MHz mode, but unlike the previous systems the links were no longer downwardly compatible. This new packet-based link protocol was called DS-Link, and later {{formed the basis of}} the IEEE 1355 serial <b>interconnect</b> <b>standard.</b> The T9000 also added link routing hardware called the VCP (Virtual Channel Processor) which changed the links from point-to-point to a true network, allowing for the creation of any number of virtual channels on the links. This meant programs no longer had {{to be aware of the}} physical layout of the connections. A range of DS-Link support chips were also developed, including the C104 32-way crossbar switch, and the C101 link adapter.|$|E

To analyse the performance of a SCI cluster the messages passing between the nodes must be sampled. A logic analyser can be used to collect this data but it has two significant drawbacks.

40|$|To build a {{system-on-chip}} (SoC) {{a common}} interface standard {{is necessary to}} connect ready-to-use components (IPs) from different vendors. Today several SoC <b>interconnect</b> <b>standards,</b> such as AMBA, Wishbone, OPB, and Avalon, are in use. We show in this paper that those standards have a common drawback for on-chip interconnections: They are built {{on the model of}} a common backplane bus that does not fit very well for on-chip interconnections. We provide a new, simple on-chip interconnect specification for the well accepted master/slave model. It is intended to provide pipelined access to devices such as on-chip peripherals and on-chip memory controller with minimum hardware resources. ...|$|R
50|$|Use {{of digital}} <b>interconnect</b> <b>standards,</b> such as CCIR 601 and SMPTE 292M, which operate without the {{non-linearities}} {{and other issues}} inherent to analogue broadcasting, do not introduce colour shifts or brightness changes; thus the requirement to detect and compensate for them using this reference signal has been virtually eliminated. (Compare with the obsolescence of stroboscopes as used to adjust the speed of record players). On the other hand, digital test signal generators do include test signals which are intended to stress the digital interface, and many sophisticated generators allow the insertion of jitter, bit errors, and other pathological conditions that can cause a digital interface to fail.|$|R

40|$|Virtual {{channels}} (VCs) are {{a popular}} {{solution for the}} provision of quality of service (QoS). Current <b>interconnect</b> <b>standards</b> propose 16 or even more VCs for this purpose. However, most commercial implementations do not offer so many VCs because it is too expensive in terms of silicon area. Therefore, a reduction of the number of VCs necessary to support QoS can be very helpful in the switch design and implementation. We have shown that this number of VCs can be reduced if the system is considered as a whole rather than each element being taken separately. Some of the scheduling decisions made at network interfaces can be easily reused at switches without significantly altering the global behavior. In this paper, our aim is to explore the scalability of the technique, considering the restrictions of the final chip implementation...|$|R
40|$|In {{communication}} centric application domains flexible interfaces {{are required}} to support the variety of recently emerged and still evolving high-speed serial <b>interconnect</b> <b>standards.</b> To develop such interfaces, typical application scenarios have to be identified, and common functionality and specific characteristics of the selected standards need to be analyzed.

We use Click models for analysis and abstraction of the communication protocols and explore flexible interfaces within a cycle-accurate architecture development framework. Our results show the feasibility of implementing a flexible interface on a packet engine similar to those used in network processors. Based on our findings, we believe that flexible interfaces will form a new family of building blocks for future Systems-on-Chip. ...|$|R

InfiniBand {{is a new}} industry-wide general-purpose <b>interconnect</b> <b>standard</b> {{designed to}} provide {{significantly higher levels of}} reli-ability, availability, performance, and scalability than alternative server I/O technologies. After more than a year since its official release, many are still trying to understand what are the profitable uses for this new and promising interconnect technology, and how this technology might evolve. In this article, we provide a summary of several industry and academic perspectives on this issue expressed during a panel discussion at the Workshop for Communication Architecture for Clusters (CAC), held in conjunction with the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS) in April 2001, in hopes of narrowing down the design space for InfiniBand-based systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{the size and}} {{complexity}} of many FPGA designs exceeds the time and resources available to most design teams, making the use and reuse of Intellectual Property (IP) imperative. However, integrating numerous IP blocks acquired from {{both internal and external}} sources can be a daunting challenge that often extends, rather than shortens, design time. As today's designs integrate increasing amounts of functionality, it is vital that designers have access to proven, up-to-date IP from reliable sources.
