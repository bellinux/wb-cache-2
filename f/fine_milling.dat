40|$|<b>Fine</b> <b>milling</b> in {{combination}} with thinbed mash filters has been introduced into the brewing industry more than 20 years ago. Although clearest worts can be obtained at highest gravity, {{in combination}} with high extract yield and improved starch conversion, a majority of brewers still use the conventional coarse milling {{in combination with}} lautertuns. Brewers seem still afraid having a negative impact of <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> on wort and beer quality {{especially with regard to}} over extraction of polyphenols, proteins and oxidative enzymes. A lack of detailed data comparing both wort production methods could be a reason. In this study, the faster wort filtration as well as higher extract yield has been confirmed when using <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> and a thin bed filter. A higher concentration of fermentable sugar led to this increased yield and not an increased level of proteins and polyphenols. On the contrary, <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> in combination with thicker mash and thin bed filtration results in a lower level of haze sensitive protein in the pitching wort in comparison to coarse grist and the use of a lautertun. No striking differences have been found comparing analyses of fresh beer. Also during forced ageing of the beers at 30 [*]°C, no difference in the formation of flavour negative compounds or degradation of bitterness has been noticed. Both wort production methods result in highly comparable beers with equal flavour stability. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two mains parts: an introduction giving a literature review of key topics relevant for design and interpretation of the experiments carried out in this thesis, and an experimental part. Recent reports from FAO have highlighted the need for increased utilization of more low cost material in food production industries. Aquaculture industry may play an increasingly important role in providing high quality food, and {{approximately half of the}} production costs are related to feed. It is, thus, becoming increasingly important to utilize non-food and low cost ingredients in fish feed. Nile tilapia is a major farmed fish species. Moreover, it has high capacity to tolerate a wide range of environmental stresses and the presence of antinutrients compounds in diet, making it an ideal target species for upgrading low-quality ingredients to high quality food. Secondary products from rapeseed oil processing are highly abundant and represent an inexpensive source of protein. The major challenge for increased use is the presence of certain glucosinolate derivatives such as isothiocyanate and progoitrin, which previously have been reported to cause metabolic problems or reduce feed acceptability for fish. Secondary products of rapeseed also contain other antinutritional factors such as phytic acid and tannins that may represent metabolic challenges. Several of these factors can be reduced by relatively intense moist heating. The overall aim of the research in this research was to find out if simple processing such as <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> or moist heating influenced the nutritional value of rapeseed cake (RSC), a secondary product from rapeseed oil processing. Two experiments were carried out. The first experiment aimed at defining a dietary inclusion level to which Nile tilapias were sensitive to changes in nutritional quality of RSC. The second experiment was carried out to assess the effects of <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> or the combination of <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> and autoclaving of RSC. The first experiment was designed on the base of a regression analysis to define the dose response of tilapia to inclusion of rapeseed cake (RSC) in diet. Five different isoenergetic and isonitrogenous, plant ingredient-based diets were produced with different level of inclusion of RSC. Crude protein from soybean meal (SBM) was gradually replaced by crude protein from RSC at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of replacement. The feeding trial was performed in two replicate tanks of Nile tilapia for each experimental diet. Each tank contained 20 tilapias with average weight of 19. 9 g. Feeding was in excess, 3 times (40 min) per day. Feed was quantified on a daily basis for the first 3 weeks, and as a pooled value over the whole 6 week feeding period. The findings from Exp. 1 demonstrated a decline in feed intake and growth along with increasing the level of RSC in diet. A threshold effect was observed in the regression curve near of 50 % replacement. A possible explanation for these results may be the presence of bitter component in RSC which caused poor palatability of RSC containing diet and reduces feed intake. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) (g DM intake (g gain) - 1) was almost close to 1 g g- 1 for all levels, except for the groups feed 100 % replacement of CP from RSC, where it was slightly elevated. No diet-related trends were observed apparent digestibility or retention of crude protein, mineral (Ca, P, Mg, Mn, Zn) absorption or concentration in blood plasma, energy content of whole body and energy and protein retention along with different inclusion of RSC in diet, indicating that protein from RSC and SBM had comparable availability, and that the effects of phytic acid from the two protein sources had comparable effects. Moreover, thyroid hormone (T 4) in blood plasma was not markedly different for different treatments, indicating that glucosinolate derivatives may not have been a main factor in explaining the reductions in feed intake and growth. The lipid content of whole body composition decreased in treatments fed diet from 0 % until 50 % replacement and then increases up to 100 % replacement of CP from RSC with CP from SBM. The same pattern was seen in content of DM which can be the result of lipid content of body. It is assumed that presence of higher content of tannin in RSC on the base of feed intake pattern causes higher visceral fat deposition in fish after 50 % replacement. The ration of liver weigh to body weight was increased from 0 % until 50 % replacement level and after that tended to reduce up to 100 % replacement of CP from RSC with CP from SBM. Since the deposition of lipid in liver decreases by increasing content of tannin in diet, the pattern given from ratio of liver weight to body weight may be caused by this fact. The aim of second experiment (Exp. 2) was to assess whether <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> and/or combination of <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> and autoclaving the RSC applied in diet may affect the nutritional quality of feed for tilapia. Exp. 2 was performed according to the results from Exp. 1, on the 50 % level of replacement of CP from SBM with CP from RSC in diet which causes more sensitivity in fish to nutritional quality of diet. This experiment was designed on the base of ANOVA analysis. A 3 weeks trail feeding tilapia was conducted with 3 different experimental diets. The RSC used in different experimental diets were 1 mm ground (the same as Exp. 1), milled to 0. 5 mm of particle size, or milled to 0. 5 mm and autoclaved for 10 min in 120 oC. Each diet fed to tilapia in 3 replicate tanks. Each tank contained 20 fish with the average weight of 37. 3 gr. Feeding and monitoring of daily feed intake was the same as Exp. 1. Feed intake and gain were significantly (P 0. 05). This may be due to autoclaving having a negative effect on the palatability of RSC due to production of glucosinolates breakdown products. A linear relationship was seen between feed intake and gain which may demonstrate that the main reason of growth depression is related to decrease of FI. The finding of increased glucose concentration in the diet with autoclaved RSC, probably originating from hydrolysis of glucosinolates, supports this hypothesis. A significant decrease (P 0. 05) among different treatments. Also the content of minerals (except zinc) in blood plasma among different treatments fed different experimental diets was the same (P> 0. 05). However, the content of zinc in blood plasma of tilapia fed with diet containing fine milled and fine milled and autoclaved RSC tended (0. 050. 05). It may prove that the certain level of inclusion of secondary compounds of RSC used in these diets may not have any goitrogenic effect on tilapias thyroid. To conclude, this research show that presence of RSC in tilapia diet may reduce feed acceptability. However, it did not show different effects on metabolic function of fish than those caused by SBM. <b>Fine</b> <b>milling</b> did not affect the nutritional value of RSC, while autoclaving of RSC has negative effect on feed intake, energy utilization, and consequently on growth...|$|E
40|$|Base metal {{resources}} {{are becoming more}} fine-grained and refractory and minerals separation processes require these ores to be milled to increasingly finer sizes. To cope with very fine grinding to below a P- 80 of approximately 15 mum stirred milling technology has been adopted from other industries Neither this technology, nor the basic concepts of fine grinding, are well understood by the minerals processing industry. Laboratory studies were therefore carried out in order to investigate <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> using different types of stirred mills.

The results of the testwork have shown that all of these variables affect the grinding efficiency. The ratio of media size to material size was found to be of particular significance. The results were also analysed using the stress intensity approach and the optimum stress intensity ranges for the most efficient grinding were determined.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research project is to study the impact of an innovative wort production method on flavour quality and flavour stability of lager beer. The innovation comprises 1) thick and fast mashing under anti-oxidative conditions to save time and energy; 2) high mashing-off temperature (95 &# 176;C) compared to conventional mashing-off temperature of 78 &# 176;C; 3) acidified sparging; and 4) in-line wort stripping with culinary steam and in-kettle stripping during filling of the kettle (till kettle is full) for continuously stripping of unwanted volatiles. After wort filtration and in-line stripping, no additional boiling is required. Special {{attention was paid to}} mashing-in conditions (O 2, pH, temperature), in order to prevent early oxidation. During transfer of the mash to the mash vessel, the malt aldehydes are to be stripped off as much as possible. Clean steam injectors in combination with over-sized chimneys and condensate traps and high mashing-off temperatures should facilitate the release and stripping of unwanted volatile aldehydes. Mashing-off at temperatures above 95 &# 176;C has three aims: 1. strip off unwanted volatile aldehydes; 2. partially degrade of SMM to DMS (flavour of Brussels sprouts); 3. coagulate and flocculate high molecular weight proteins. The holding time of the elevated mashing-off temperature will depend on these three items. The fastest and thickest mashing conditions were first evaluated to produce concentrated mashes in the shortest time frame. A thick mash results in smaller total volumes so that low water and reduced energy input is required during mashing. An efficient sparging will then lead to lowest volumes for boiling with highest extract content which is again beneficial in view of energy consumption and brewhouse capacity. <b>Fine</b> <b>milling</b> in combination with thinbed wort filtration resulted in highly comparable wort, beer, and ageing profiles compared to conventional coarse milling/lautertun operations. High mashing-off temperature resulted in a fast wort filtration, bright sweet wort and a low heat load (based on the TB-Index). Due to the high mashing-off and wort filtration temperature, SMM is already transformed into free DMS which evaporates partially at mashing-off. Sufficient conversion of SMM and removal of DMS is possible by in-line and in-kettle clean steam injection during filling of the combination vessel. Sparging with acidified water at high temperature minimised the extraction of extra proanthocyanidins during the sparging step ending up with comparable amounts compared to conventional wort production. High mashing-off temperature also resulted in decreased levels of haze sensitive proteins, in comparison with conventional mashing-off temperature. The use of steam to form and strip DMS however results in the formation of a low trub content, but the small protein flocks are difficult to remove. No striking differences have been found when comparing conventionally produced beers with the innovative beers. However, important differences have been observed when the beers were subjected to ageing. Due to the acidified sparging, high aldehyde contents have been found in the pitching wort upon innovative wort production. The low pH of sparging liquor seems to result in an enhanced release of imine-bound aldehydes. As apparent from analysis of pitching wort, these free aldehydes have not been efficiently stripped off (in contrast to DMS), but after fermentation, comparable levels of free aldehydes were found in the fresh beers. However, during ageing of the innovative beer, lower levels of aldehydes were found resulting in significantly lower overall ageing sensory scores. The release of aldehydes during acidified sparging, even at conventional sparge temperatures of 78 &# 176;C, is also malt dependent. In conclusion, the innovative wort production, executed in less than 3. 5 hours, results in a highly comparable fresh beer, but with an extended flavour stability compared to conventional beer production. Concentrated mashes and highest extract content due to low sparge rates will result in a decreased need of energy for wort production. The high throughput of the two vessel brewhouse with a thinbed filter will also reduce the investment cost.

40|$|Polishing {{is applied}} to {{manufacture}} steel surfaces with a low roughness and glossy shine up to a highly reflective mirror finish. As moulds and dies are mostly freeformed, no automated process is capable of polishing the surfaces so that the process is realised manually. Investigations are made to develop a robot polishing system and to elaborate robust process strategies. In this paper, the progress is shown {{by means of a}} mirror finish on a free-formed steel surface realised by automated polishing. The investigations of machining parameters (e. g. pressure, revolutions, feed rate) as well as path related parameters (e. g. trochoid radii, offsets) lead to an optimal process strategy. The free-form out of X 38 CrMoV 5 -l ESR was finished using six steps as illustrated in figure 2. Roughness values of Ra = 0. 5 micrometer and Rt = 12 micrometer are common after <b>fine</b> <b>milling.</b> Grinding realises Ra = 0. 3 micrometer and Rt = 4 micrometer. After lapping the matte surface exhibits Ra = 0. 15 micrometer and Rt = 2 micrometer. The final surface quality is based on Ra = 5 nm and Rt = 55 nm revealing a defect-free mirror finish. Next steps will be the development of new strategies to finish other tool steels and the extension of available tools and paths to process more complex free-forms...|$|E
40|$|Dry {{fractionation}} {{offers an}} attractive route to sustainably produce protein-enriched plant-based ingredients. For example, <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> of peas followed by air classification separates starch granules from the protein matrix. Unlike conventional wet isolates, dry-enriched pea fractions {{consist of a}} mixture of protein, starch and fibre, but have the advantage that protein retains its native state. In this context, dryenriched pea ingredients were assessed for their functionality in terms of gelatinization and phase behaviour. After suspension in water, starch, protein and fibre separated into distinctive layers. The top layers were concentrated by ultrafiltration into a native protein-rich concentrate with a purity of 67 g protein/ 100 g dry matter and a protein yield of 63 %. Upon heat-induced gelatinization, gel firmness was mainly increased {{by the presence of}} starch, while the presence of dispersed components (i. e. protein and/or fibre patches) in the gel weakened its structure. The heating and cooling rates influenced the firmness of the gel prepared from flour. The fine fraction could be gelled by protein crosslinking using transglutaminase. The increased protein gel strength in the presence of dispersed fibre and starch was explained by their water absorption leading to concentration of the protein phase. In conclusion, all pea fractions could be used to prepare firm gels, despite their different compositions, which supports recent insight that development of novel food ingredients should focus on functionality rather than on molecular purity. Finally, the combination of dry and aqueous phase separation is proposed as a more sustainable route compared to conventional wet extraction processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} 3 corn {{particle}} sizes (d gw : 375, 1117, and 2402 µm) combined {{with or without}} organic acids (0. 3 g/kg of Galliacid S ®) was investigated on broilers from Day 1 to Day 21; 540 1 -day old Ross 708 males were raised in 36 pens (3 x 2 factorial design, 6 blocks each). We measured: body weight, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, liver weight, pH weight and height of empty gizzard, pH and length of intestine and caeca, height and width of ileal villi, crypt depth/gland diameter, total bacteria count. Different corn particle sizes and organic acid supplements only affected feed intake (Days 14 and 21), feed conversion ratio (Day 14), villus height, and crypt depth. On Day 21, <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> had negative effects on body weights compared with larger feed particle size (816 vs 848 and 844 g); acidic additive had {{a positive effect on}} broiler growth (859 vs 813 g). Length of small intestinal villi and crypt depth were affected by both particle size and organic acids (fine to coarse small intestinal villi: 1869 a, 1401 c, and 1039 d µm in non-acidified; 1708 b, 1535 c, and 942 e µm in acidified. Fine to coarse crypt depth: 102 ab, 98 b; 65 c µm in non-acidified; 106 a, 70 c, and 66 c µm in acidified). No difference was observed in total bacteria counts of the gut in relation to the different treatments. Use of organic acids during starter phase is useful, especially when the milling process is inappropriate...|$|E

This work is done in collaboration with a local company and a foreign tool maker. Though several research papers found on comparative analysis of copper and graphite milling, they are not applicable to the selected foreign tool maker, since the machines used are different and it is totally applications-driven and so much depends on {{what has to be}} done on the shop floor in the way of support equipment. In this work, a tool is developed to be used on the shop floor for a collaborated work done by a local company and a foreign tool maker for the comparative analysis of milling of copper and graphite electrodes for EDM. Machine capabilities of copper and graphite milling are analyzed by experimental methods with the optimum parameters set in the machines. Material removal rate for rough milling and surface finishing rate for <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> are found to be indicators of machine capabilities. An experienced tool maker can provide the necessary inputs to calculate the cost and time of producing electrodes, leads to a proper comparison of EDM electrode milling in economical terms rather than a guess, which is the current practice. With the use of the calculator the costs and time of producing electrodes are analyzed and recommendations made based on the data available with EDM machines in general. The cost calculator improved by EDM analysis is to be integrated with the existing costing system of the company. Also the flexibility is provided in the cost calculator to change the values fed in the calculator, so that it can be customized for the use of any other tool shop.

40|$|Thesis (MIng (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2001 Hydrometallurgical {{processing}} of sulphide concentrates {{is an attractive}} method for the selective extraction of valuable metals. The dissolution of minerals in a leaching process involves several electrochemical parameters {{that need to be}} investigated• to ensure the development and growth of the base metal industry in South Africa. A study has been carried out to elucidate the leaching mechanism of a nickel-coppercobalt sulphide concentrate in an oxidative pressure-acid medium. The sulphide concentrate studied in this research, comprises mainly of the minerals pyrrhotite, (Fe 1 _xS) with x = 0 to 0. 2, pentlandite, (Ni,Fe) 9 S 8 and chalcopyrite, (CuFeS 2). The leaching behaviour of these minerals was successfully studied by means of Atomic Absorption (AA) measurements, Scanning '•Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Moss bauer spectroscopy, after leaching took place in an oxidative pressure-acid medium. The dissolution of the valuable metals was achieved effectively with recoveries of well over 90 % for nickel, copper and cobalt under the specific conditions studied. Mechanical activation by means of ultra <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> improved metal extraction with an average of approximately 40 %, after a leaching period of 150 minutes. The most suitable conditions for the oxidative pressure-acid leaching of the mechanically treated nickel-copper-cobalt sulphide concentrate in a dilute sulphuric acid medium were found to be: particle size 80 % - 10 J. Lm; temperature l 10 °C; oxygen partial pressure 10 bar; sulphuric acid concentration 30 kg/ton; solids content 15 % by mass and an impeller agitation rate of 800 r/min. The values of the apparent activation energies of nickel, copper and cobalt, extracted from the sulphide concentrate, were found to be 20. 6 (± 4. 4) kJ/mol K, 33. 6 (± 4. 2) kJ/mol K and 17. 4 (± 3. 5) kJ/mol K respectively.
