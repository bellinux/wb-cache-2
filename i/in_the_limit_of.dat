25|$|For example, Einstein's special {{relativity}} satisfies the correspondence principle, because it reduces to classical mechanics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> velocities {{small compared to}} {{the speed of light}} (example below).

Laplace's theory of celestial mechanics reduces to Kepler's when interplanetary interactions are ignored, and Kepler's reproduces Ptolemy's equant in a coordinate system where the Earth is stationary. Statistical mechanics reproduces thermodynamics when the number of particles is large. In biology, chromosome inheritance theory reproduces Mendel's laws of inheritance, in the domain that the inherited factors are protein coding genes.|$|E

25|$|Grain {{boundaries}} are in general {{only a few}} nanometers wide. In common materials, crystallites are large enough that grain boundaries account for {{a small fraction of}} the material.
