5|$|Due to <b>his</b> <b>size,</b> McGrattan {{believed}} his {{best chance of}} {{making it to the}} NHL was as an enforcer.

5|$|Due to {{his wide}} range of skills, Rodríguez is known for being equally adept at {{defending}} as he is going forward. Although usually a left-back, <b>his</b> <b>size</b> and physique have also seen him be deployed as a centre-back on occasion. Experts consider him as an accomplished defender and note his strong heading ability, as well his personality. He is also considered a continual attacking threat, and has been noted by analysts for his exceptional stamina and pace, which allow for his constant, buccaneering runs up the wing; he has also drawn praise from pundits for rarely conceding careless fouls. Conversely, he has been criticised for giving too much room to opposition attackers, taking up poor positioning and lacking in defensive discipline, while other analysts have criticised his concentration.|$|E

It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself.

He recovered and carried Hart {{to the middle of the}} ring, but Hart removed the protective padding on the turnbuckle in the corner of the ring.

5|$|Schneider {{plays in}} the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, dropping to his knees with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. He honed the style with goaltending consultant Brian Daccord, beginning {{at the age of}} 15. After joining the Canucks as a backup in 2010–11, Schneider began working with the team goaltending coach Roland Melanson, who encouraged him to play shallower in his crease. Schneider adopted the style which required him to be more athletic on first shots, but better prepared him for rebounds and cross-crease plays. Schneider's strengths are <b>his</b> <b>size</b> and athleticism. His coach with the Moose, Scott Arniel, has also heralded his ability to get into position ahead of time, anticipating plays.|$|E

5|$|During {{principal}} photography, Noonan {{asked that}} no one playing his victims and pursuers be allowed to see him, while those he did speak to should address him by his character's name, Francis. The first time Noonan met Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window during the filming of the climactic fight scene. Noonan admits that, because of his request, the atmosphere on set became so tense that people actually became afraid of him. He had also begun body-building {{to prepare for the}} role and felt that <b>his</b> <b>size</b> intimidated the crew when filming began, as the first scene to be shot was his character's interrogation and murder of another. Noonan claims that this led him to take separate flights and stay in separate hotels {{from the rest of the}} cast, and while on the film's sets, he would remain in his trailer alone in the dark to prepare himself, sometimes joined by a silent Mann.|$|E
