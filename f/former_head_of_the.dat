5|$|After {{relative}} stability {{at the senior}} executive level for three decades, there has been significant turnover in the positions since the 1990s. The team had eight general managers in eight years, for example, between 1996 and 2003. The current GM is Jim Popp who was appointed {{at the end of}} 207 February 2017. Chris Rudge, <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Olympic Committee, took over as president and CEO from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2015, when Michael Copeland took over.|$|E
5|$|Going Clear {{is based}} closely on Lawrence Wright's book, {{covering}} {{much of the}} same ground with the aid of archive footage, dramatic reconstructions, and interviews with eight former Scientologists: Paul Haggis, the Oscar-winning director; Mark Rathbun, the church's former second-in-command; Mike Rinder, the <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church's Office of Special Affairs; the actor Jason Beghe; Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor, former liaison to John Travolta; and former Scientologists Tom DeVocht, Sara Goldberg, and Hana Eltringham Whitfield.|$|E
5|$|Protests {{were not}} as large on 27 January while {{preparations}} were made for planned large-scale events {{on the following day}} (Friday). The Muslim Brotherhood declared its full support of the protests, and members planned to take part during Friday's demonstrations. Leader of the National Association for Change and <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei returned that day.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, three others, Julián Sancristóbal, Juan Alberto Perote and Francisco Álvarez, were {{implicated in}} the case. Sancristóbal had been the former {{director}} of state security, Perote the <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish secret service, while Álvarez had been head of the anti-terrorist squad. They all denied the accusations. The Monbar case was closed in October 2001, with Garzón declaring that, although suspicions remained about involvement of some of those accused, there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposal}} {{was made to}} call a special session to repeal the law, and Bradley {{was in favor of}} the action, but a poll of the legislators showed that too many of them were noncommittal to justify the call. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats – W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state railroad commission.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, Cy Feuer and Ernie Martin started {{producing}} musicals together. Feuer was the <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music {{department at}} low-budget Republic Pictures; Martin was a television executive. Having secured {{the rights to}} the farce Charley's Aunt, they produced it as the musical comedy Where's Charley?, with a score by Frank Loesser. Among the backers of Where's Charley? were Rodgers and Hammerstein, which helped secure additional investment. The show was a hit and helped establish Feuer and Martin on Broadway—they would go on to produce Guys and Dolls.|$|E

5|$|The Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) was a United States {{military}} agency {{responsible for}} those aspects of nuclear weapons remaining under military control after the Manhattan Project was succeeded by the Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947. These responsibilities included the maintenance, storage, surveillance, security and handling of nuclear weapons, as well as supporting nuclear testing. The AFSWP was a joint organization, staffed by the United States Army, United States Navy and United States Air Force; its chief was supported by deputies from the other two services. Major General Leslie R. Groves, the <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Project, was its first chief.|$|E
5|$|FairTax proponents {{argue that}} the {{proposal}} would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning {{a large share of}} money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House Ways and Means Committee, asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters {{argue that the}} U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.|$|E
5|$|France even {{linked the}} issue of the seat to the ongoing dispute {{regarding}} the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as the <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>Heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Local Government Board are Iskander Izmaylovich Badayev and Sergey Petrovich Bykov. On September 28, 2008 Sergey Bykov {{was removed}} from the {{candidate}} list for the October 12 elections by the court decision.|$|R

5|$|Goebel {{was chosen}} {{president}} pro tem of the Senate for the 1898 legislative session. On February 1, 1898, he sponsored a measure later called the Goebel Election Law. The law created a Board of Election Commissioners, {{appointed by the}} General Assembly, who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of Kentucky's counties and were empowered to decide disputed elections. Because the General Assembly was heavily Democratic, the law was attacked as blatantly partisan and self-serving to Goebel; it was opposed even by some Democrats. Nevertheless, Goebel was able to hold enough members of his party together to override Governor Bradley's veto, making the bill law. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked {{the members of the}} Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats—W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state railroad commission. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Court of Appeals found it constitutional.|$|E
5|$|In November 1934, Butler {{told the}} {{committee}} that one Gerald P. MacGuire told him {{that a group of}} businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with Grayson M–P Murphy & Co. The New York Times reported that Butler had told friends that General Hugh S. Johnson, <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was no truth in the story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.|$|E

5|$|Leonid Brezhnev awarded Tikhonov the Hero of Socialist Labour, {{after being}} advised {{to do so}} by Konstantin Chernenko. Upon Brezhnev's death in 1982, Tikhonov {{supported}} Chernenko's candidacy for the General Secretaryship. Chernenko lost the vote, and Yuri Andropov became General Secretary. It has been suggested that Andropov had plans of replacing Tikhonov with Heydar Aliyev. Historian William A. Clark noted how Aliyev, a <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Azerbaijani KGB, was appointed to the First Deputy Premiership of the Council of Ministers without Tikhonov's consent; however, Andropov's death in 1984 left Tikhonov secure in his office. Some Western analysts speculated that the appointment of Andrei Gromyko to the First Deputy Premiership, again without Tikhonov's consent, was a sign that his position within the Soviet hierarchy was weakened. Tikhonov was on a state visit to Yugoslavia when Gromyko was appointed to the First Deputy Premiership.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1971, he was {{appointed}} {{as the head of}} the Press and Public Relations of Mexico City alongside Alfonso Martínez Domínguez. However, Buendía turned down the position in June following the massacre of student demonstrators. A year later, Buendía worked as an advisor to Guillermo Martínez Domínguez, the former head of Nacional Financiera, a bank of Mexico's Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP). In Nacional Financiera, Buendía befriended Gerardo Bueno Zirón, who shortly after being appointed as director of the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) offered him a position as director of the institution's Press and Public Relations department in 1973. That year, Henrique González Casanova, the <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Political Science department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), invited Buendía to work as a part-time professor, a job that the journalist held until his death in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Takla Sadeq Makuriya (1913–2000), {{historian}} and <b>former</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Archives and Library of Ethiopia, wrote various works in Amharic {{as well as}} foreign languages, including a four-volume Amharic-language series {{on the history of}} Ethiopia from ancient times until the reign of Selassie, published in the 1950s. During the 1980s he published a three-volume tome exploring the reigns of 19th-century Ethiopian rulers and the theme of national unity. He also produced two English chapters {{on the history of the}} Horn of Africa for UNESCO's General History of Africa and several French-language works on Ethiopia's church history and royal genealogies. Some volumes from his vernacular survey on general Ethiopian history have been edited and circulated as school textbooks in Ethiopian classrooms by the Ministry of Education. Kebede Michael (1916–1998), a playwright, historian, editor, and director of archaeology at the National Library, wrote works of world history, histories of Western civilization, and histories of Ethiopia, which, unlike his previous works, formed the central focus of his 1955 world history written in Amharic.|$|E
