40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{the present}} work is to study the effect of {{annealing}} on the vibration damping capacity of high-chromium (16 %) ferromagnetic steel. The alloys were prepared from raw materials of 99. 9 % purity melted in a <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>induction</b> <b>furnace</b> under high vacuum. The samples were heat-treated in vacuum at various temperatures (800 to 1200 ºC) for 1 hour followed by slow cooling (120 ºC/h). The inverted torsional pendulum method {{was used to evaluate}} the vibration damping capacity. The results indicated that the vibration damping capacity of the alloys is influenced by annealing and there exists a critical annealing temperature after 1000 ºC. The damping capacity increases quickly below the critical temperature since the magnetic domains move more easily. Keywords—Vibration, Damping, Ferromagnetic, Steel. I...|$|E

For instance, the total current measured is above the rated value for the main breaker, leading to unacceptable overheating and frequent tripping of the breaker which is now superficially overcome by the installation of a big standing fan to dissipate the generated heat. This {{is a source of}} energy waste, and can be avoided by the replacement of the main breaker, especially {{due to the fact that}} the contacts may melt completely and results into shutdown and loss of production man-hours. Furthermore, based on the measured total dissolved solid (TDS) value of the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>induction</b> <b>furnace</b> cooling water system, it is inferred that the ion exchange resin has expired and is therefore due for recharging or replacement to avoid scale formation and rust along the piping network.|$|E

(2) Microstructure of castings chnged with varying stripping time. The change of microstructure was caused due to variation of solidifying process;from ledeburite eutectic transformation to austenite-graphite one,rather than selfannea 1 ing of castings.

Accordingly, {{it is very important}} to extract metallic components from used PCB’s from the point of view of recycling the used resources as well as the environmental protection. In this study, a high temperature pyro-metallurgical process was investigated to extract valuable metallic components from the used PCB’s. For this purpose, used PCB’s were shredded and oxidized to remove plastic materials, and then, a <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>induction</b> <b>furnace</b> was used to melt and separate metallic components in molten state from the remaining oxides.

The influences of various carbon materials on the properties of cast iron melt were investigated by examining the micro-structure and the average carbon contents of samples obtained. In the case of electrode graphite, although carburizing into solid iron was very difficult, the dispersion of graphite into liquid iron occured easily and thus the electrode graphite promoted the nucleation and growth of stable graphite-γ eutectic. In the case of non-graphitizing carbon materials, although carburizing into solid and liquid iron was easier with {{a decrease in the}} degree of graphitization, and the dispersion of carbon matelials into liquid iron were promoted with an increase in the degree of graphitization. The nucleation and growth of graphite-γ eutectic were more difficult with a decrease in the degree of graphitization, while those of the metastable cementite-γ eutectic were promoted. Though carbon content in the melts at 1873 K hardly changed for all carbon meterials, their behavior to the iron differed remarkably by the sort of carbon precursor and graphitization temperature of carbon materials. These facts indicate clearly that the properties of carburized melt (the state of the presence of carbon-microgroups) depend on the structural characteristics of carbon materials...|$|E

40|$|To stay {{competitive}} in the steel industry, steelmakers are utilizing different production methods to reduce production cost without compromising {{on the quality of}} their products. In steelmaking, the production process plays a significant role on the steel cleanliness. Recent increasing demands on the cleanliness level therefore require optimization of production process to meet the requirement. Often, the types and distribution of non-metallic inclusions in steel determines the steel cleanliness. In order to optimize the production process, complete assessment of the non-metallic inclusions in the steel is necessary, leading to implementation of measures to control and/or remove non-metallic inclusions in the steel. The present study was performed to investigate the cleanliness level of steel bars produced from a <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>induction</b> <b>furnace</b> (HF) route at Uddeholms AB. Experimental studies were carried out and characteristics such as number, composition, size distribution and morphology of non-metallic inclusions were investigated. Total oxygen and total nitrogen content were also measured for indirect assessment. Further, the production operations at the HF were observed and evaluated to determine their influence on the inclusion characteristics. The characteristics obtained were compared with characteristics of inclusions in steel bars produced from an electric arc furnace production (EAF) route at Uddeholms AB and a competitor producer sample. The results showed that the level of cleanliness varies from different production routes and is hence dependent on the process at each production route. The number, maximum and mean size of inclusions were found to be higher in the HF route compared to the other routes. More so, there were differences in the types of oxide inclusions observed from each process route. However, sulphide inclusions exhibit similar characteristics from the different process routes. Further, the compositions of oxide inclusions observed from the HF route were found to be closely related to the steel chemistry. More importantly, the types of inclusions formed in the HF route were found to be sensitively affected by the extent of aluminium and calcium contents in the steel. Thus, the oxide inclusion types in the HF samples could be traced to the extent of different additions and operations such as deoxidation and calcium treatment that were carried out during the steelmaking process...|$|E

To carry out this experiment, suitable casting conditions, with which grey iron should be taken in the as-cast condition, were picked out, and the test pieces, JIS 8 C type tensile strength test pieces, were casted using two kinds of cast iron mold which has respectively mold ratio 6. 5 and 9. 0. The mold were coated with two layers of coating material, diatomaceous earth and soot.

For purpose of reference, test pieces with same type were casted into green sand mold. The results obtained are as follows: (1) The microstructure of the permanent mold cast iron with a grey fracture in the as-cast condition is composed of ferritic and pearlitic matrix containing eutectic and fine flaky graphite, and higher Sc is, more the ferrite among the matrix becomes. (2) Strength of the permanent mold cast iron is better than that of the sand mold casting with same Sc:the tensile strength and the hardness of the permanent mold cast iron is respectively 24 to 32 kg/mm＾ 2) and 220 to 260 Hv(20). Density of the permanent mold cast iron is higher than that of green sand mold cast iron. (3) In case of grey iron permanent molding,it is necessary to select the chemical composition and the cooling conditions to keep away from tending to be white or mottled cast iron, and hence it tends to have similar structure and mechanical properties. Therefore,it will be recommended,in case of permanent mold casting,to controll strictly the casting conditions using the iron with higher Sc which has less chilling tendency.

The {{effects of}} {{titanium}} modification, which was added {{along with the}} pouring liquid in ladles, on the shrinkage porosity and cavity of cast steel ZG 45 smelted in intermediate <b>frequency</b> <b>induction</b> <b>furnace</b> were studied. The metal liquid fluidity was measured by casting spiral samples. 0. 2 wt. % titanium modification achieved the highest fluidity for steel liquid. Proper content of titanium could effectively increase the volume of concentrated shrinkage cavity, and restrain the forming of shrinkage porosity. By scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy disperse spectroscope (EDS) analysis, {{it was found that}} TiC, acting as heterogeneous nuclei, could refine the structure grains, diminish the strong dendrite, and increase the fluidity and feeding capacity of steel liquid. However, overdoes titanium modification easily caused mass oxide TiO 2, which kept solid phases with high meting point in metal liquid to increase its viscosity and decrease the fluidity. Meanwhile, these solid state titanium compounds enlarged the composition supercooling, so the metal liquid changed from sequential solidification to simultaneous solidification, resulting in inadequate metal liquid feeding, less oncentrated shrinkage cavity and serious shrinkage porosity...|$|R

In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the pitting corrosion of TiN coated dental cast alloy with casting methods, three casting alloys(A: 63 Co- 27 Cr- 5. 5 Mo, B: 63 Ni- 16 Cr, C: 63 Co- 30 Cr- 5 Mo) were prepared for fabricating partial denture frameworks with various casting methods. The casting morphologies were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy(FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDS), and optical microscopy(OM). TiN coatings were carried out by using RF-sputtering. The pitting corrosion properties of the samples were examined through electrochemical method in 0. 9 % NaCl solutions at 36. 5. The casting defects of alloy decreased {{in the order of}} centrifugal casting, <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>induction</b> casting, and vacuum pressure casting.

Therefore, to control the microstructure of slurry, slurry making by new rheo die casting was studied. To continuously fabricate grain controlled material, cup was cleaned and heated up to about 200 ℃ to prevent the abrupt decrease of molten metal and transferred to the slurry making machine. In slurry making machine, molten metal was poured into a preheated cup and the initial temperature was about 650 ℃. The used material, in this experiments, was A 356 aluminum alloy. In the 4 cooling stages, a respective air cooling time was changed from 5 sec to 60 sec to make slurry temperature below 600 ℃. <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>induction</b> heating was given during about 55 seconds. After these processes, grain controlled aluminum material was made.

40|$|Purpose: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effect of workpiece preheating with <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>induction</b> heating on improvement of machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V during end milling using PVD TiAlN coated inserts. Tool life, cutting force and vibration were investigated during the experiments. Design/methodology/approach: End milling tests were conducted on Vertical Machining Centre (VMC ZPS, Model: MCFV 1060 with quarter immersion cutting. Titanium based alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V bar was used as the work-piece. Machining was performed with a 20 mm diameter end-mill tool holder (R 390 - 020 B 20 - 11 M) fitted with one insert. PVD TiAlN coated carbide inserts (R 390 - 11 T 3 08 E-ML 2030) were used in the experiments. All of the experiments were run at room temperature and preheated conditions. The preheated temperature was maintained at 420 ºC and no phase change of the workpiece in preheating was ensured from the phase diagram of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>induction</b> heating was utilized to run the preheated machining. Findings: Preheating helps in substantially increasing tool life and in lowering down the cutting force value, lowering the amplitude of vibration and dynamic forces. Practical implications: The cost of machining Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is extremely high because of the relatively low machining speed and short tool life. Therefore, improving the machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is a research topic of much interest, with a number of approaches reported with varied results, such as, cryogenic cutting, high-pressure coolant, rotary-tool, and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL). Originality/value: A new approach of induction preheating to overcome the difficulties in machining of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is presented in this paper. In preheated machining, <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>induction</b> heating is used as an external heat source to soften the work material surface layer in order to decrease its tensile strength and strain hardening. An experimental study has been performed to assess the effect of workpiece preheating using induction heating system to enhance the machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. The preheating temperature was maintained below the phase change temperature of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V...|$|R
