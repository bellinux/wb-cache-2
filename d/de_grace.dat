5|$|In Harford County, high {{waves and}} {{the storm surge}} caused {{moderate}} flooding in areas, forcing 55 to evacuate along the Bush River and 12 to evacuate along the waterfront to Havre <b>de</b> <b>Grace.</b> The promenade boardwalk in Havre <b>de</b> <b>Grace</b> was destroyed. Moderate winds left 51,600residents in the county without power. Damage in the county totaled at least $12.5million (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} it was {{uncertain}} which submarine had launched the torpedoes. Its periscope remained visible as lifeboats were lowered. The submarine waited until the lifeboats were well clear before firing a coup <b>de</b> <b>grâce</b> at 9:31 am. Irish Plane, Irish Rose and Irish Ash responded to the SOS. The survivors were located by Irish Plane at 4:20 pm.|$|E
5|$|Desperate, yet determined, {{units of}} FANK soldiers, {{many of whom}} had run out of ammunition, dug in around the capital and fought until they were overrun as the Khmer Rouge advanced.

5|$|MD7 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US40 {{just west of}} Havre <b>de</b> <b>Grace.</b> The highway heads northeast as two-lane Revolution Street, crossing the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and passing through an industrial area before entering a residential area upon entering the city limits. MD7 veers east to enter the street grid at Bloomsbury Avenue. The state highway turns north onto Union Street, which heads south as MD490, adjacent to Harford Memorial Hospital. The route heads through the Havre <b>de</b> <b>Grace</b> Historic District, passing through a residential area about four blocks from the Susquehanna River waterfront through Congress Street, where the highway begins to approach the waterfront. Immediately after passing under the Amtrak Susquehanna River Bridge, MD7 turns west onto Otsego Street. The highway reaches its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with Otsego Street, MD155 (Ohio Street), and US40 (Pulaski Highway), which crosses the Susquehanna River a short distance to the east on the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{several areas}} in Harford County {{were used for}} filming season 2, {{including}} areas in Bel Air and Edgewood. Havre <b>de</b> <b>Grace</b> {{had been used in}} season 1 to depict Underwood's home district in South Carolina. The Liriodendron mansion was the scene of filming on August 12 and 13. Bel Air police were paid $1550 for August 13 duties at another filming location.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{widen the}} {{existing}} road further, the Maryland State Roads Commission {{decided to build}} a new Philadelphia Road, later known as Pulaski Highway, as a divided highway on a new alignment between Baltimore and Aberdeen and to expand the newly relocated highway through Aberdeen to Havre <b>de</b> <b>Grace</b> to a four-lane divided highway. The new US40 was started in 1935 and completed in 1938. The original Philadelphia Road between Baltimore and Aberdeen became the first section of MD7. The next sections of the old highway to be bypassed were in Havre <b>de</b> <b>Grace</b> and Perryville when the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge and its approaches opened in August 1940, replacing the double-decked converted railroad bridge. The portions of the old highway {{on either side of the}} river became additional sections of MD7. Construction on the new Philadelphia Road in Cecil County began in 1938 and was completed in 1941. Transfer of US40 to its new alignment resulted in the addition of two more sections of MD7 from west of Charlestown through North East to west of Elkton and through Elkton.|$|E

5|$|The coup <b>de</b> <b>grace</b> for the Hammurabi's Amorite Dynasty {{occurred}} in 1595 BC, when Babylon was sacked and conquered {{by the powerful}} Hittite Empire, thereby ending all Amorite political presence in Mesopotamia. However, the Indo-European-speaking Hittites did not remain, turning over Babylon to their Kassite allies, a people speaking a language isolate, from the Zagros mountains region. This Kassite Dynasty was to rule Babylon for over 400 years, adopting parts of the Babylonian culture, including Hammurabi's code of laws.|$|E
5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup <b>de</b> <b>grâce</b> immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which did not move.|$|E
5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, {{there was a}} lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup <b>de</b> <b>grâce</b> by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E

5|$|As Galván left a Farmacia Guadalajara {{drugstore}} {{near his}} home in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, on the evening of 27 February 2014, he was kidnapped along with businessman Miguel Ángel Ortiz. His vehicle was discovered abandoned with open doors in the pharmacy's parking lot by his wife. The following day, a disfigured corpse found in the trunk of a pickup truck in the town of García, Nuevo León, was taken to the hospital of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León. After more than a month of forensic examination, experts officially identified the corpse as that of Galván on 31 March 2014. Post-mortem reports concluded that Galván had been tortured before being killed with a coup <b>de</b> <b>grâce.</b> The exact location of Galván's murder remains unknown, although authorities tend to believe he was most likely killed in Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|In June 1943, Mayer {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force. Johnson's P-47 Thunderbolt had been badly shot-up by some Focke Wulf Fw 190s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped home, with a canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his windscreen, Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw 190. Mayer looked the wounded P-47 over, and then circled to come in from Johnson's six-o'clock {{to give it the}} coup <b>de</b> <b>grâce.</b> The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also saw that a 20mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible to open his canopy.|$|E
5|$|It was {{now that}} Philip applied the coup <b>de</b> <b>grace.</b> He had persuaded the Athenians and other Greeks {{that he and}} his army was heading for Halos, but it seems certain that he also sent other units {{straight}} to Thermopylae. All of central and southern Greece was now at Philip's mercy, and the Athenians could not now save Phocis even if they abandoned the peace. Philip could be certain of dictating the terms {{of the end of the}} Sacred War, since he could now use force against any state that did not accept his arbitration. He began by making a truce with Phalaikos on 19 July; Phalaikos surrendered Phocis to him, in return for being allowed him to leave, with his mercenaries, and go wherever he wished. Philip then declared that the fate of Phocis would not be decided by him, but by the Amphictyonic Council. However, it is clear that Philip was dictating the terms behind the scenes; allowing the Amphictyons the formal responsibility allowed him to dissociate himself from the terms in the future.|$|E

5|$|MD7 {{is the old}} {{alignment}} of US40 in northeastern Maryland. The route was first laid out early in colonial times and later formed part of the post road between Baltimore and Philadelphia and between {{the northern and southern}} colonies. The highway in Baltimore and Harford counties became a turnpike in the 19th century. The Maryland State Roads Commission marked portions of {{what became known as the}} Philadelphia Road close to Baltimore and between Perryville and Elkton for improvement as state roads in 1909. Those sections and the highway between Aberdeen and Havre <b>de</b> <b>Grace</b> were constructed as modern roads in the early to mid-1910s. The remainder of the highway was constructed in the 1920s and designated US40 in 1927. The high volume of traffic and the required continuous expansion of the highway led the Maryland State Roads Commission to construct the modern Pulaski Highway between 1935 and 1941. Old sections of US40 became segments of MD7 between 1938 and 1941 as portions of the new four-lane divided highway opened from Baltimore to Elkton.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the mouth}} of the Argolic Gulf a Staffel of nine Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers from Jagdgeschwader 77 {{attacked}} the convoy at either 06:45 or 07:15. Slamat was hit, set afire and began to abandon ship. Calcutta ordered Diamond to go alongside Slamat to rescue survivors {{while the rest of the}} convoy continued to try to reach Souda Bay in Crete. At 08:15 Diamond reported that she was still rescuing survivors and still under air attack. By then three destroyers had reinforced the convoy so Calcutta sent one of them, , to assist Diamond. Slamat was afire from stem to stern when Diamond fired a torpedo that sank her in a coup <b>de</b> <b>grâce.</b> Diamond reported at 09:25 that she had rescued most of the survivors and was proceeding to Souda Bay. An hour later Wryneck signalled a request for aircraft cover.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{infantry}} used in {{the invasion}} was probably a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, {{there was at least}} a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting. The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a bow, 'short spear' and sword, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin. The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a corslet of scale armour. Some contingents would have been armed somewhat differently; for instance, the Saka were renowned axemen. The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, Medians, Cissians and the Saka; Herodotus specifically mentions the presence of Persians and Saka at Marathon. The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup <b>de</b> <b>grace</b> with spear and sword.|$|E

5|$|Although still wary of one another, the Russian and Austrian commanders were {{satisfied}} with the result of their cooperation. They had outfought Frederick's army in a test of nerve, courage and military skills. Elizabeth of Russia promoted Saltykov to Generalfeldmarschall and awarded a special medal to everyone involved. She also sent a sword of honor to Laudon. The price of this rout, though, was high: 26 percent Austrian and Russian losses would not usually qualify as a victory. The storming of field works typically resulted in a disproportionate number of killed over wounded. The conclusion of the battle in hand-to-hand struggle also increased casualties on both sides. Finally, subsequent cavalry charges and the stampeding flight of men and horses had caused many more injuries. Regardless of the losses, though, Saltykov and Laudon remained on the field with intact armies, and with extant communications between one another. The Prussian defeat remained without consequences when the victors did not capitalize on the opportunity to march against Berlin, but retired to Saxony instead. If Saltykov had sought the coup <b>de</b> <b>grâce</b> in the last hour of the battle, he did not follow through with it.|$|E
5|$|Attacks on two brigantines were {{reported}} by Renato Beluche on February 12, 1824, and published in El Colombiano several days later. The first was Boniton, captained by Alexander Murdock, which sailed with a load of cocoa from Trinidad and was intercepted en route to Gibraltar. The second, Bonne Sophie, sailed from Havre <b>de</b> <b>Grace</b> {{under the command of}} a man named Chevanche with dry goods bound for Martinique. In both cases, the sailors were beaten and imprisoned and the ships plundered. The ships were part of a convoy escorted by the Bolívar off Puerto Real, Cabo Rojo, and Cofresí captained a ship identified by Beluche as a pailebot (a small schooner). Although Bolívar could not capture her, her crew described the vessel as painted black, armed with a rotating cannon and having a crew of twenty unidentified Puerto Rican men. Cofresí was presumably leading the vessels to dock at Pedernales, where Mendoza and his brother could facilitate the distribution of loot with the aid of official inertia. From there, other associates usually used Boquerón Bay for transportation and ensured that the loot reached stores in Cabo Rojo and nearby towns.|$|E
5|$|In 1603, {{he painted}} a double {{portrait}}, {{now in the}} Metropolitan Museum, New York, of the prince and his boyhood friend John Harington, son of Lord Harington of Exton (see above). The double portrait is set outdoors, a style introduced by Gheeraerts in the 1590s, and Peake's combination of figures with animals and landscape also foreshadows the genre of the sporting picture. The country location and recreational subject lend the painting an air of informality. The action is natural to the setting, a fenced deer-park with a castle and town in the distance. Harington holds a wounded stag by the antlers as Henry draws his sword to deliver the coup <b>de</b> <b>grâce.</b> The prince wears at his belt a jewel of St George slaying the dragon, an allusion to his role as defender of the realm. His sword is an attribute of kingship, and the young noble kneels in his service.• Strong English Icon, 234. The stag is a fallow deer, a non-native species kept {{at that time in}} royal parks for hunting. A variant of this painting in the Royal Collection, painted c. 1605, features Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, in the place of John Harington and displays the Devereux arms.|$|E
