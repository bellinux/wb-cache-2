5|$|In September 1933, Bruce was {{appointed}} by Lyons to replace the ailing Sir Granville Ryrie as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, giving him ambassadorial rank. He formally resigned from parliament on 7 October 1933. Bruce would excel in the new post, becoming a trusted confidant among Conservative politicians and a familiar face in British government circles, which led to him at one point considering entering British politics formally. Bruce was particularly close to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, with whom he frequently consulted, and was notably influential in pressing for Edward VIII's abdication in 1936. His importance and power in London was {{due in part to}} the free rein that Lyons gave him a rarity in the history of the position. Combined with the turmoil and frequent ministerial changes within the Commonwealth Department of External Affairs, Bruce was generally credited as Australia's most influential and credible <b>international</b> <b>representative</b> during his posting, often determining matters of foreign policy in his own right.|$|E

25|$|During that time, Fleva was {{especially}} interested in the fate of Romanians living in Transylvania or {{in other parts of}} Austria-Hungary, many of whom were complaining about government abuse and Magyarization policies (Transylvanian Memorandum).

In essence the union's affirmative action officer, Thompson met with the leadership of UE locals around the country to develop and implement action plans to force employers to hire more black workers, and to give African Americans opportunities to advance into skilled trades jobs. In the midst of the Cold War assaults on UE, the union's newspaper reported such success stories as the promotion of a black worker at Johnson Machine to lathe operator. The company had insisted that this worker was unqualified and refused to train him, so white union members had taught him the job during their lunch breaks.|$|E
25|$|Although his wire bending job {{was only}} {{supposed}} to be summer employment, Bieber stayed and did not go on to college. Bieber was elected a shop steward of Local 687 (which covered Grand Rapids {{and most of the}} immediate surrounding area) in 1949, and in 1951 was elected to the local's executive board. He was elected to Local 687's collective bargaining committee in 1955, and became the local's president in 1956. In 1961, he became a part-time union organizer for the international union. Bieber retired as Local 687's president in 1962, and took a full-time position as an <b>international</b> <b>representative</b> and organizer with the UAW. Bieber worked closely with Kenneth W. Robinson, the Director of UAW Region 1D (then the largest region in the international union). Robinson promoted Bieber to servicing representative in 1964, and made him his personal aide.|$|E

25|$|LTTE had {{developed}} a large international network {{since the days of}} N. S. Krishnan, who served as its first <b>international</b> <b>representative.</b> In the late 1970s, TULF parliamentarian and opposition leader A. Amirthalingam provided letters of reference for fundraising, and V. N. Navaratnam, who was an executive committee member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), introduced many influential and wealthy Tamils living overseas to Tamil insurgent leaders. Navaratnam also introduced LTTE members to the members of Polisario Front, a national liberation movement in Morocco, at a meeting held in Oslo, Norway. In 1978, during the world tour of Amirthalingam (with London-based Eelam activist S. K. Vaikundavasan), he formed the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC), which was later found to be an LTTE front organisation. The global contacts of LTTE grew steadily since then. At the height of its power, LTTE had 42 offices worldwide. The international network of LTTE engages in propaganda, fundraising, arms procurement, and shipping.|$|E
25|$|Tamil United Liberation Front leader Appapillai Amirthalingam, {{who was in}} 1977 {{elected as}} the Opposition leader of Sri Lanka Parliament, clandestinely {{supported}} the LTTE. Amirthalingam believed {{that if he could}} exercise control over the Tamil insurgent groups, it would enhance his political position and pressure the government to agree to grant political autonomy to Tamils. Thus, he provided letters of reference to the LTTE and to other Tamil insurgent groups to raise funds. Both Uma Maheswaran (a former surveyor) and Urmila Kandiah, first female member of the LTTE, were prominent members of the TULF youth wing. Maheswaran was the secretary of TULF Tamil Youth Forum, Colombo branch. Amirthalingam introduced Prabhakaran to N. S. Krishnan, who later became the first <b>international</b> <b>representative</b> of LTTE. It was Krishnan who introduced Prabhakaran to Anton Balasingham, who later became the chief political strategist and chief negotiator of LTTE, which split {{for the first time in}} 1979. Uma Maheswaran was found to be having a love affair with Urmila Kandiah, which was against the code of conduct of LTTE. Prabhakaran ordered him to leave the organisation. Uma Maheswaran left LTTE and formed People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) in 1980.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} secret {{exploratory}} meetings between {{representatives of the}} Colombian government and the FARC began {{taking place in the}} spring of 2011. The FARC report that the first of such meetings took place in March 2011 near the Colombian-Venezuelan border, with the guerrilla represented by Rodrigo Granda (the FARC's main <b>international</b> <b>representative)</b> and Andr√©s Par√≠s (a veteran political theorist and negotiator) and the government by presidential advisers Alejandro √âder and Jaime Avenda√±o. Two further meetings took place by July, where both parties agreed to continue exploratory meetings in Havana, Cuba. These first contacts were meant to settle the details of where, how and when the next stage of the process - secret encounters to set an agenda for talks - would be held. In July 2011, the government appointed senior officials to participate in the process: Frank Pearl, serving as environment minister; Sergio Jaramillo Caro, national security adviser to the president; and President Santos' brother Enrique Santos, former director of El Tiempo. For the magazine Semana, Eduardo Santos' inclusion was a 'gesture of confidence' by President Santos to the guerrilla, because of the familial ties between the two men and Eduardo Santos' past involvement in dialogues with the guerrilla. The FARC negotiating team was joined by Mauricio Jaramillo and Marcos Calarc√°.|$|E
