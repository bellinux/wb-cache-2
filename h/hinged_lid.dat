25|$|Power was {{supplied}} by a solar {{panel on the}} inside of a round <b>hinged</b> <b>lid</b> which covered the instrument bay, which would charge the batteries when opened. A polonium-210 radioactive heat source was used to keep the rover warm during the long lunar nights.|$|E
25|$|As {{the young}} queen larva pupates {{with her head}} down, the workers cap the queen cell with beeswax. When ready to emerge, the virgin queen will chew a {{circular}} cut around the cap of her cell. Often the cap swings open {{when most of the}} cut is made, so as to appear like a <b>hinged</b> <b>lid.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Catholicism, holy water, as well {{as water}} used during the washing of the priest's hands at mass, {{is not allowed to}} be {{disposed}} of in regular plumbing. Roman Catholic churches will usually have a special basin (a Sacrarium) that leads directly into the ground for the purpose of proper disposal. A <b>hinged</b> <b>lid</b> is kept over the holy water basin to distinguish it from a regular sink basin, which is often just beside it. Items that contained holy water are separated, drained of the holy water, and then washed in a regular manner in the adjacent sink.|$|E
50|$|Tic Tacs {{were first}} {{produced}} in 1969. They are usually sold in small transparent plastic boxes with a flip-action living <b>hinge</b> <b>lid.</b> Originally, Tic Tacs were dyed specific colours for different flavours, although {{in many countries}} the transparent plastic boxes are coloured and the actual Tic Tacs are white.|$|R
5000|$|A toolbox is {{used for}} {{carrying}} tools of various kinds. The term implies a container meant for portability rather than just storage, for instance with <b>hinged</b> <b>lids,</b> clasps or locks, reinforced corners, and handles. Toolboxes are usually very sturdy, but unlike a shipping box containing dunnage, {{are not expected to}} fully protect their contents if the box is inverted or upended.|$|R
50|$|Cabinet {{selection}} {{is a term}} for cigars purchased in a large, square, plain Spanish cedar cigar box called a cabinet box, a slide-lid box or SLB, or simply a cabinet). It usually has a wooden slide-lid, although <b>hinged</b> <b>lids</b> are occasionally seen. The cigars are usually packed in amounts of between 20 and 50, but usually 25s or 50s (rarely in amounts of under 15, although Trinidad Robusto Extras and Reyes are both available in cabinets of 12).|$|R
500|$|Eucteniza ( [...] ) is a genus of {{trapdoor}} spiders in {{the family}} Euctenizidae containing at least 14 species occurring in Mexico and the southern United States. Species are distinguished by a softened rear portion of the carapace, and males possess large spines {{on the first two}} pairs of walking legs that are used to hold females during mating. Like other trapdoor spiders they create burrows with a <b>hinged</b> <b>lid,</b> from which they await passing insects and other arthropods to prey upon. Many species are known from only one or two localities, or from only male specimens. More species are expected to be discovered. Eucteniza is closely related to spiders of the genera Entychides and Neoapachella.|$|E
500|$|Like other {{trapdoor}} spiders, Eucteniza species construct burrows in {{the ground}} with a <b>hinged</b> <b>lid,</b> from which they wait to ambush passing prey. Burrows and prey have been studied in E. relata, and other species are believed to have similar behavior. The burrow consists of an un-branched tube, lined with silk and soil, ranging from [...] in depth. The burrow is covered with a cork-like lid composed of silk and soil and hinged with silk. The bottom of the burrow accumulates molted exoskeletons and remains of prey, which include beetles, ants, and millipedes. Burrows of adults and juveniles have been found in close proximity, suggesting individuals do not disperse very far after hatching. Individuals in Texas disperse from their burrows between August and January, and hence are most often collected during this time. In Mexico, the dispersal period extends from June to January.|$|E
60|$|My {{first impulse}} was to drag the thing loose by main strength; but {{fortunately}} I thought better of this and fell to examining the box. I soon {{saw that it was}} covered by a <b>hinged</b> <b>lid,</b> which was held closed by a simple screwhook and eye.|$|E
50|$|Trapdoor spiders hide in an {{underground}} nest they line with their silk, and then conceal {{it with a}} <b>hinged</b> silk <b>lid,</b> the trapdoor.|$|R
50|$|Claret jugs where {{produced}} from about 1830 to 1920 and are nowadays very collectable. The vast majority {{were made of}} cut (sometimes frosted) glass. The silver mounted tops incorporated <b>hinged</b> <b>lids,</b> and handles that extended down halfway or to the base. The mounts were often engraved or chased, and the glass bodies were found in many different shapes and varying ornamentation. Some earlier examples were made entirely of silver. The level of craftsmanship and their aesthetic qualities determine their value. Unusual jugs, such as made by Charles Edwards or Christopher Dresser, or examples with fine engraved scenes may command high prices.|$|R
50|$|When {{issued the}} Karabiner 98k came {{accompanied}} with assorted accessory items including a sling, a protective muzzle cover, and for field maintenance a Reinigungsgerät 34 ("Cleaning Kit 34") or RG34 kit. Introduced in 1934, the Reinigungsgerät 34 {{consisted of a}} flat 85 mm wide by 135 mm long sheet metal container with two <b>hinged</b> <b>lids</b> carried on the person, which held an oiler, a take down tool for removing the floorplate and cleaning the receiver of the rifle, an aluminum barrel pull-through chain, a cleaning and an oiling brush, and short lengths of tow used as cleaning patches. From 1905 until 1945 the German military used Ballistol intended for cleaning, lubricating, and protecting metallic, wooden and leather firearms parts.|$|R
60|$|It was a four-wheeled affair, {{quite large}} and heavy. There was one {{seat in the}} center, and before and behind this were two big boxes, each with a <b>hinged</b> <b>lid.</b> In the rear was a rack for pies and cakes. There was also a box under the seat, and a money drawer which opened with a {{concealed}} push button.|$|E

5000|$|A beer stein (or {{simply a}} stein [...] ) is an English {{neologism}} for a traditional type of beer mug. Steins {{may be made}} of stoneware (rarely the inferior earthenware), pewter, porcelain, silver, glass, or wood. They may have open tops or may have <b>hinged</b> pewter <b>lids</b> with a thumb-lever.|$|R
50|$|In general, Greek {{tables were}} low and often appear in depictions {{alongside}} klinai. The {{most common type}} of Greek table had a rectangular top supported on three legs, although numerous configurations exist, including trapezoid and circular. Tables in ancient Greece were used mostly for dining purposes - in depictions of banquets, it appears as though each participant would have utilized a single table, rather than a collective use of a larger piece. Tables also figured prominently in religious contexts, as indicated in vase paintings, for example the wine vessel associated with Dionysus, dating to around 450 BC and now housed at the Art Institute of Chicago. Chests were used for storage of clothes and personal items, and were usually rectangular with <b>hinged</b> <b>lids.</b> Chests depicted in terracotta show elaborate patterns and design, including the Greek fret.|$|R
50|$|The {{stock was}} made of walnut, and {{featured}} a straight wrist and a low comb butt. A patch box with a <b>hinged</b> brass <b>lid</b> was located {{on the right side}} of the butt. Originally, the Brunswick rifle used a single compartment patch box. Later rifles used a slightly larger patch box with two compartments.|$|R
50|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} oil burning locomotives was a <b>hinged</b> <b>lid</b> provided over the chimney to protect the boiler tubes and flues from sudden cooling when the oil fire was cut off.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "" [...] {{could have}} also {{originated}} from the German word , meaning stoneware jug or tankard. By common usage, stein {{refers to a}} beer container with a handle and <b>hinged</b> <b>lid.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{the top of}} the monument, a <b>hinged</b> <b>lid</b> in the urn {{covers the}} opening to the shaft. The steps in the shaft of the tower are all six inches high, {{allowing}} them to be used for barometric pressure studies.|$|E
50|$|Later hand cannons {{have been}} shown to include a flash pan {{attached}} to the barrel and a touch hole drilled through the side wall instead of the top of the barrel. The flash pan had a leather cover and, later on, a <b>hinged</b> metal <b>lid,</b> to keep the priming powder dry until the moment of firing and to prevent premature firing. These features were carried over to subsequent firearms.|$|R
40|$|A mill lunch basket {{belonging}} to Bernard Keating which {{belonged to his}} father, Sylvester Keating, when {{he worked in the}} cement plant. The basket was used from the mid 1950 s to the 1980 s. Creator unknown, constructed in early 1950 s. Materials used are plywood and metal for handles. The handles were most likely added later by Sylvester Keating, as he was a sheet metal worker. 22 cmx 17. 2 cmx 32. 4 cm. Close up of <b>hinge</b> on <b>lid...</b>|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} hatchback, two {{two-seater}} coupé variants of the Mark III were also produced. A Drophead Coupé convertible, while not common, still considerably outnumbers the Fixed Head Coupé - 84 {{of the former}} were produced, while just five of the latter were built. All five Fixed Head Coupés were built {{close to the end}} of Mark III production and feature the mid-spec DBD engine. Both of these bodystyles feature conventional <b>hinged</b> boot <b>lids</b> rather than the innovative hatch back.|$|R
50|$|A typical Post Office Box is in {{a wooden}} box with a <b>hinged</b> <b>lid</b> and a metal or {{bakelite}} panel showing circuit connections. Coils of wire are wound non-inductively, mounted {{in the body of}} the box, and have a negligible temperature co-efficient.|$|E
50|$|Another design, {{pioneered by}} the Vandoren {{company in the}} 1980s, {{involves}} the reed lying on a stationary table, positioned above a sharp blade. In this design, the cutting is accomplished by lowering a <b>hinged</b> <b>lid</b> which slides the reed tip against the blade.|$|E
50|$|Power was {{supplied}} by a solar {{panel on the}} inside of a round <b>hinged</b> <b>lid</b> which covered the instrument bay, which would charge the batteries when opened. A polonium-210 radioactive heat source was used to keep the rover warm during the long lunar nights.|$|E
50|$|The 400 {{featured}} {{independent front suspension}} with a transverse {{leaf spring}} and a live axle, located by an A-bracket over the differential case and longitudinal torsion bars with transverse arms and brackets at the rear. It featured a lengthy 2895 mm (114 inch) wheelbase and a very BMW-like grille {{at the front of}} its long bonnet. The passenger area was very short, with the spare tyre mounted inside the boot on the first cars, but eventually mounted on the rear <b>hinged</b> boot <b>lid,</b> inside an aluminum cover.|$|R
6000|$|In {{one corner}} that most worthy implement, an Abacus, four feet square, a {{specially}} strengthened piece of ironmongery with rounded corners, awaited the young giants' incipient computations. There were few woolly lambs and such-like idols, but instead Cossar, without explanation, had brought {{one day in}} three four-wheelers {{a great number of}} toys (all just too big for the coming children to swallow) that could be piled up, arranged in rows, rolled about, bitten, made to flap and rattle, smacked together, felt over, pulled out, opened, closed, and mauled and experimented with to an interminable extent. There were many bricks of wood in diverse colours, oblong and cuboid, bricks of polished china, bricks of transparent glass and bricks of india-rubber; there were slabs and slates; there were cones, truncated cones, and cylinders; there were oblate and prolate spheroids, balls of varied substances, solid and hollow, many boxes of diverse size and shape, with <b>hinged</b> <b>lids</b> and screw lids and fitting lids, and one or two to catch and lock; there were bands of elastic and leather, and a number of rough and sturdy little objects of a size together that could stand up steadily and suggest the shape of a man. [...] "Give 'em these," [...] said Cossar. [...] "One at a time." ...|$|R
50|$|Such Steins may be {{made out}} of stoneware, pewter, porcelain, or even silver, wood or crystal glass; they may have open tops or <b>hinged</b> pewter <b>lids</b> with a thumb-lever. Steins usually come in sizes of a half litre or a full litre (or {{comparable}} historic sizes). Like decorative tankards, they are often decorated in a nostalgic manner, but with allusions to Germany or Bavaria. It is believed by some that the lid was implemented during {{the age of the}} Black Plague, to prevent diseased fleas from getting into the beer.|$|R
50|$|It was {{slightly}} wider, and the keys are {{slightly larger than}} the previous model. The display had more contrast, and the keyboard cover is a (removable) <b>hinged</b> <b>lid</b> (clamshell) instead of plastic slipcase. There were also four additional BASIC commands. Programs written on PC-E500 were executable on the PC-E500S.|$|E
50|$|An {{ammunition}} box or cartridge box is a container designed for safe {{transport and storage}} of ammunition. It is typically made of metal and labelled with caliber, quantity, and manufacturing date or lot number.
