50|$|Specifically, {{the effect}} {{describes}} the phenomenon resulting from electrons and electron holes being squeezed into a dimension that approaches a critical quantum measurement, called the exciton Bohr radius.

These are also known as zero-, one- and two-dimensional potential wells, respectively.

50|$|Another peak usually {{appears in}} the PL spectra of TMDC monolayers, which is {{associated}} to different quasi-particles called trions. These are excitons bound to another <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> which can be either an electron or a hole. As a consequence a trion is a negative or positively charged complex. The presence of a strong trion peak in a PL spectrum, eventually stronger than the peak associated with exciton recombination, is a signature of a doped monolayer. It is believed now that this doping is extrinsic, which means that it arises from charged trap states present in the substrate (generally SiO2). Positioning a TMDC monolayer between two flakes of hBN removes this extrinsic doping and greatly increase the optical quality of the sample.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} waveguide configuration that {{is suitable}} for growth on InAs substrates uses highly n-doped InAs for the optical cladding. [...] The high electron density in this layer lowers the refractive index {{in accordance with the}} Drude model. In this approach, the epitaxial structure is grown on an n-type InAs substrate and it also utilizes InAs for the separate confinement layers. For longer-wavelength operation, advantages include the much higher thermal conductivity of bulk InAs as compared to a short-period InAs/AlSb superlattice, as well as a much thinner cladding layer due its larger index contrast with the active region. This shortens the MBE growth time, and also further improves the thermal dissipation. However, the waveguide must be designed carefully to avoid excessive <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption loss in the heavily-doped layers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Free</b> <b>carrier</b> {{concentration}} is {{the concentration of}} free carriers in a doped semiconductor. It {{is similar to the}} carrier concentration in a metal and for the purposes of calculating currents or drift velocities can be used in the same way. Free carriers are electrons (or holes) which have been introduced directly into the conduction band (or valence band) by doping and are not promoted thermally. For this reason electrons (holes) will not act as double carriers by leaving behind holes (electrons) in the other band. In other words, charge carriers are particles/electrons that are free to move (carry the charge). They get charged at the battery/cell, and then flow throughout the circuit, giving energy to any components in the way, then when out of charge and {{towards the end of the}} circuit, they get re-charged by the battery/cell.|$|E
50|$|ITO is {{a heavily}} doped n-type {{semiconductor}} {{with a large}} bandgap of around 4 eV. Because of the band gap, it is mostly transparent in the visible part of the spectrum and its extinction coefficient, k, in this wavelength range is zero. In the ultraviolet (UV), it is opaque, so that k is non zero in the UV spectral range, because of band-to-band absorption (a UV photon can excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band). It is also opaque in the near infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR), because of <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption (an infrared photon can excite an electron from {{near the bottom of}} the conduction band to higher within the conduction band). In this wavelength range k is non-zero, and reaches its maximum value in the IR regime, similar to the behavior of k for metals.|$|E
5000|$|An {{additional}} {{feature that}} differentiates the ICL {{from all other}} laser diodes is its provision for electrically-pumped operation without a p-n junction. This is possible because the injectors function as rectifying barriers that keep the current flowing in a single direction. Nevertheless, it is highly advantageous to dope certain layers in each cascade stage {{as a means of}} controlling the active electron and hole densities, via a design technique called “carrier rebalancing.” [...] While the most favorable combination of electron and hole populations depends on the relative strengths of various <b>free</b> <b>carrier</b> absorption and Auger recombination processes, the studies done thus far indicate that the ICL performance is optimal when at threshold the two concentrations are roughly equal. Since the hole population tends to substantially exceed the electron population in undoped or moderately-doped ICLs, carrier rebalancing is achieved by heavily n-doping the electron injector (typically, with Si) so as to add electrons to the active QWs.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{presence}} of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> in a substance can generate the multiferroic behavior. Namely, if the substance has mixed-valence ions, which can supply <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> and have electric dipole and spin moments, all three types of long-range order (ferromagnetic, ferroelectric and magnetoelectric (ME)) can occur at low temperature. The physical origin of the effect is that charge carriers can mediate the multiferroic behavior via spin - spin (RKKY), dipole-dipole and dipole - spin interactions. Our estimate of the interaction magnitude shows that there exist an optimal carrier concentration, at which the strength of ME interaction is maximal and comparable to that of spin-spin RKKY interaction. This permits to conclude that in substances, where RKKY interaction between local spins is not small, a substantial value of <b>free</b> <b>carriers</b> mediated ME interaction can occur. Our analysis shows that disorder in the above substances does not suppress multiferroic effects. Comment: 4 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
