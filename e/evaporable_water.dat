40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{modified}} metakaolin (MMK) on the <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> and chemically bound water content of hardened cementitious materials have been investigated. Concrete specimens with 0 %, 4 %, 7 % and 10 % of MMK were included. Metakaolin was pre-modified {{in order to}} increase the dispersion and contact angle, which might further improve the workability of the concrete. The experimental results showed that both the <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> and bound water were increased with the increasing of the MMK content. MMK has a special layered structure. Water can get into the layers through this special layer during the mixing of concrete specimens. Part of MMK with water between the layers didn’t participate in the hydration reaction at the early stage of the hydration, which increased the <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> of the cementious materials. The water absorbed in MMK will be released to promote the formation of hydration products and thus the chemically bound water content will increase continuously at the later stages. It also reduced the autogenous shrinkage of the specimens which caused by the decrease of water in capillary pores at low water cement ratio (0. 3) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{changes in}} {{microstructure}} {{and content of}} water phases during hydration of a 3 : 1 BFS:OPC blend are investigated by Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP), freeze-drying, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxometry. MIP indicates that during the blend hydration, {{a reduction in the}} population of capillary pores (larger than about 100 nm) occurs while the population of gel pores (smaller than few tens of nanometres) increases. Between 3 and 90 days, the porosity estimated by MIP decreases from about 36 % down to 18 % while the median pore size decreases from about 140 nm down to 6 nm. 1 HNMR relaxometry shows that after 1 day of hydration, nearly 70 % of the <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> is held in capillary pores while about 30 % is present in gel pores. After two weeks, most of the <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> (90 %) is found in pores smaller than few tens of nanometres. : The amount of <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> detected by freeze drying decreases from less than 20 wt. % after one week of hydration down to about 16. 3 wt. % after 90 days while the amount of chemical ly bound water related to the degree of advancement of the cement hydration and detected by TGA increases from 8 wt. % to 10. 3 wt. %. During hydration the BFS:OPC blend matrix evolves from an open microporous network to one of a poorly connected network of water rich nanopores with increasing amounts of chemically bound water. © 2006 Materials Research Society...|$|E

40|$|High {{strength}} concrete with the compressive strength {{in excess of}} 80 MPa has recently {{been a matter of}} concern in its application to the column or core wall of high-rise reinforced concrete building. High {{strength concrete}} can potentially generate high hydration temperature at early ages due to its relatively high cement conctent. It has been pointed out that a high temperature profile at early ages has a detrimental effect on the strength of high strength concrete, reducing long-term strength development and increasing thermal cracking risk. In this study, a temperature matched curing system(TMC) which can simulate in-situ temperature profiles of the column was developed in order to investigate the influence of high hydration temperature at early ages on the strength development of high strength concretes with and without silica fume. It was found that under sealed conditions, a high temperature of 70 °C at early ages in high strength concretes with silica fume led to a little higher 7 -day strength but no increase in strength beyond 28 days, whilst it had no significant detrimental effect on the strength development in those without silica fume. The <b>evaporable</b> and non-evaporable <b>water</b> content data showed that both the hydration of cement and the pozzolanic reaction of silica fume almost completed after 3 days TMC due to the shortage of water in concrete when high strength concretes with silica fume were subjected to a high temperature of 70 °C at early ages...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} role of water in fly ash-based geopolymers using the less conventional activators; Na 2 CO 3 and Ca(OH) 2. It included the determination of <b>evaporable</b> and combined <b>water</b> at ambient, 105 °C and 1050 °C, and characterization of the micro-structure using SEM, XRD, IR, TGA and NMR. The results obtained suggested that the resulting geopolymer compounds contain a measurable amount of non-evaporable/combined water (which escapes at and above 105 °C) as distinguished from structural water which is rigidly bound, mainly by hydrogen bonding and constitutes {{an integral part of}} the geopolymer matrix in the form of molecular water. The backbone structure of Si-O-T (T=Si, Al) bonds was formed and developed as the reaction proceeds. The majority of the water escapes at below 200 °C, which enables the geopolymer to maintain its structural integrity at 1050 °C. The perception of whether Na-geopolymer is sodium aluminosilicate hydrate (N-A-S-H) was discussed, however, no sufficient evidence from IR, TGA and NMR was found in this research to prove that the geopolymer is a hydrate. The research also addresses the possibility of using red mud as an activator and a filler for fly ash-based geopolymers. The effect of activators such as Ca(OH) 2, waterglass and NaOH on fly ash and red mud-based geopolymers were investigated. The micro-structure of such geopolymers was examined using techniques mentioned above. The results obtained suggested that red mud is not efficient as an activator for fly ash based-geopolymers; NaOH (above 4 M) causes the leaching of sodium resulting in formation of Na 2 CO 3 in red mud-based geopolymers; water glass (mass ratio of SiO 2 to Na 2 O is 2), which is effective for activating fly ash, led to unsatisfactory results with red mud based-geopolymers; 10 % addition of Ca(OH) 2 proved to be effective for red mud and fly ash based-geopolymers. This research provides an in-depth investigation on whether geopolymeric product is a hydrate. It also explores the possibility of non-traditional activators, such as red mud, from a novel angle. Further, it investigates the micro-structure of geopolymers using red mud which is a high Fe containing material, as a raw material...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Backscattered Scanning Electron {{microscopy}} techniques (BSE), {{coupled with}} an image analysis system have been recognised as {{a powerful tool for}} quantitative analysis. This paper investigates the effect of metal additions (Ba, Cu, Ni, Zn, Cr(III), Pb and Cd) to Portland cement to produce a solidified product which meets the durability criteria quantified by the ratio of hydrated products and porosity. In addition, other indicators of the progress of cement hydration such as the bulk density and <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> of the solidified products were also measured. Metal concentrations of 0. 1 and 1 % per weight of cement at a constant water/cement ratio of 0. 4 were examined. The same measurements were conducted on control samples of different water/cement ratio. The results have shown that the control samples at different W/C ratio showed consistent trend in residual cement porosity, density and <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> content. It also showed that low dosage of metal nitrate additions can reduce cement hydration by up to 50 % {{and at the same time}} reduce the observable porosity. Overall, this work has shown that Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and image analysis are powerful tools and could be used to quantify the observable porosity and cement hydration in solidified systems...|$|E

30|$|Extending the seepage theory, a microprestress-solidification {{theory was}} {{proposed}} by Bažant {{and his co-workers}} to predict creep using thermodynamic approach (Bažant 1972; Jirásek and Havlásek 2014). The microprestress is generated by the disjoining pressure of the hindered adsorbed water in the micropores and by very large and highly localized volume changes caused by hydration or drying. However, Bažant maintains that the same equations are valid whether the <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> is capillary, interlayer, or adsorbed. It is, however, necessary to define {{the state of the}} water associated with creep in order to understand and perhaps control the mechanism of creep.|$|E

For this purpose 9 different cement mortars were cast in 90 pycnometers (study of chemical shrinkage and hydration) or 180 glass flasks (study of self-desiccation and hydration). Chemical shrinkage was observed for 14 days and self-desiccation for 70 days. Parallel {{studies were carried out}} on <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> (only cement mortar with sealed curing) and hydration.

40|$|Subject of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the hydration process of Portland limestone cement containing 10 - 35 % limestone. Cements, produced by co-grinding of clinker, limestone and gypsum, were hydrated for periods 6 h to 28 d and were studied by means of TG and XRD. The Ca(OH) (2) content of the cements containing limestone is higher than in pure cements, specifically for 10 % limestone content and ages more than 1 day. These results are in accordance with the strength development of the studied cements. In earlier ages the Ca(OH) a content is slightly lower in the limestone cements and independent of the limestone content. After 1 day curing, the increase of limestone addition causes a relative increase: of the non <b>evaporable</b> <b>water.</b> The XRD patterns indicated the presence of carboalummates in the hydrated limestone cements...|$|E

In particular, the potentially advantageous feature of removing <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> from concrete when it is being kept hot is discussed along with its technological implications. 1. Statement of problem and practical needs So far, utilization of prestressed concrete reactor vessels (PCRV) has been limited to gas cooled reactors [1 - 4] for which the PCRV offers important advan-tages in resisting failure by internal static pressures [5]. Although there were some early suggestions [6] for PCRV utilization and more recently aBritish concept of LMFBR with a PCRV has emerged, no serious effort has been made so far to adapt he PCRV for liquid-metal cooled fast breeder reactors (LMFBR's). The start in this direction was slow, {{due to the fact that}} LMFBR's operate at practically atmospheric pressure...|$|E
40|$|A {{measurement}} setup for in situ sampling of internal relative humidity and temperature in concrete structures was developed. The setup {{was used to}} evaluate the moisture conditions and to determine whether drying of the concrete components within a nuclear reactor containment contributes to the moisture conditions. The {{measurement setup}} was tested for accuracy and thereafter installed in Swedish nuclear reactor containments for in situ monitoring. Results from the measurements confirmed that the setup is suitable, especially for long-term measurements at depths of 50 mm or more. Complementary moisture transport calculations showed that the moisture flux from the concrete to the interior of the reactor containment have a noticeable effect on the environmental conditions in the containments. The calculations of the moisture condition in the concrete show that 15 - 30 % of the <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> in the concrete has been dried out during the 30 years of operation.

40|$|Observing {{the optical}} {{cross-section}} and electron micrographs of mechanically skinned fibres of frog skeletal muscle, {{we found that}} ethylene glycols (EGs) of small (mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-EGs; Mr 62 – 194) and medium (poly-EGs; Mr 900 and 3350) molecular weights efficiently dehydrate the fibres to shrink them radially without microscopic inhomogeneity. The medium-sized poly-EGs at 30 % weight/ weight concentration absorbed almost all the <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> from the fibre. Passive tension measurement at near slack sarcomere spacing indicated that this dehydration by EGs did not accompany longitudinal fibre shrinkage. Chemically relevant fully hydric alcohols (glycerol, threitol, ribitol and mannitol; Mr 92 – 182) showed no appreciable dehydrating ability on fibres. An intimate correlation was found between fibre dehydration and CH 2 -concentration of the solutions. Viscosity measurements indicated that the hydrodynamic radii of the alcohols were compa-rable {{to those of the}} small EGs. Therefore, hydrodynamic radii are not a primary determinant of the dehydrating ability. Additionally, CH 2 -concentration of EGs but not alcohols was found to correlate intimately with the measured viscosity of the bulk solution of EGs. These results suggested that the interaction between water molecules and CH 2 -units in crowded cytoplasm of skeletal muscle affects cytoplasm as a whole to realize anisotropic fibre shrinkage...|$|E
40|$|This paper, {{presents}} the results of a wider experimental programme conducted in the framework of the NNAPICS ("Neural Network Analysis for Prediction of Interactions in Cement/Waste Systems") project funded by the European Commission and a number of industrial partners under Brite-EuRamIII. Based on the fact that bottom ashes from waste incineration are classified as non-hazardous wastes according to the European Waste Catalogue, the aim of the present work was to investigate the feasibility of addressing the potential use of such residues in cement-based mixtures. This issue was suggested by the analysis of the properties of different bottom ashes coming from Italian municipal and hospital solid waste incinerators, which showed a chemical composition potentially suitable for such applications. Different mixes were prepared by blending bottom ash with ordinary Portland cement in different proportions and at different water dosages. The solidified products were tested for setting time and bulk density, unconfined compressive strength and <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> content at different curing times. The results of the experimental campaign were analysed through a statistical procedure (analysis of variance), in order to investigate the effect of mixture composition (waste replacement level and water dosage) on the product properties.

40|$|Cement paste carbonation, i. e., the {{reaction}} between CO 2 and the hydrated cement phases, mainly calcium hydroxide or portlandite, {{can lead to}} a pH decrease, which in turn can give rise to steel corrosion in reinforced concrete. At the same time, the carbonation reaction contributes to combine CO 2 and fix it as calcium carbonate. It is a crucial phenomenon {{from the point of view}} of structure durability and also for cement-based materials sustainability. Cement paste specimens with two w/c ratios and eight types of cements were submitted to different environmental conditions for 4 years and the evolution of calcium carbonate formed or carbon dioxide bound was followed by TG performed in inert atmosphere. The amounts of calcium hydroxide, evaporable and C–S–H gel water were also measured. The CO 2 bound follows the same trend in all samples and environments: at the beginning there is a sharp increase followed by a very slow stretch and reaching a maximum after less than 2 years in most cases. The calcium hydroxide amounts evolve very differently in each environment. While outside it is almost consumed after 1 year, inside there is a decrease in the first year, but an increase in the next 3 years. The behavior of the C–S–H water in both environments is similar to that of the portlandite inside. The <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> diminishes in all cases to 1...|$|E
40|$|After {{processing}} the palm fruit for oil, the nut is usually dried {{in order to}} loosen the kernel from the shell. The drying is necessary to enhance the release of whole kernel when the nut is cracked. A study was carried out to determine the optimum moisture content of nuts for high yield of whole kernels during cracking. Thirteen identical groups of fresh palm nuts with 240 nuts per group were subjected to oven drying at a temperature of 105 oC. Before starting, the initial mass of each nut was noted and at 2 h-intervals, a group was randomly selected {{and each of the}} 240 nuts cracked by impact after weighing for the determination of the nut moisture content. The nuts in the last group were cracked after a drying time of 26 h. The percentage of cracked nuts yielding whole kernels after impact cracking was used to determine the optimum moisture content the average value of which was 2. 5 % wet basis or 2. 57 % dry basis. At this moisture content the proportion of <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> retained in the intact nuts was estimated to be about of 11. 2 %.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the project {{presented}} here was to study and quantify the influence of materials parameters (cement type, silica fume content, w/c ratio, type and dose of superplasticizers) and environmental parameters (carbonation and moisture history) on the nonevaporable water in hydrated cement composites. In order to achieve this, a thermogravimetric method which separates different types of nonevaporable water (bound in different hydrates and hydroxide) and carbonation products was developed. This method was adapted to a thermogravimetric analyzer, which could be programmed to give the weight loss in five separate temperature steps up to 1000 °C. In each temperature step, the temperature remained constant until weight equilibrium was achieved. The analysis gave reproducible results {{that could be used}} for quantification. The experiments were mainly carried out on well cured mortar specimens, but some pastes and concretes were also included. The w/c ratio varied between 0. 30 and 0. 60 and the silica fume addition from 0 to 25 % (CSF/C by weight). The cement type and the dose and type of superplasticizer were also varied. The experimental results show that when silica fume is incorporated into a cement mix, the major part of it reacts pozzolanically with the Ca(OH) 2 released during the cement hydration, combining with the existing CSH phase. In this polymerization process, all the water from the reacted Ca(OH) 2 is converted into <b>evaporable</b> <b>water.</b> The traditional relation between nonevaporable water content and cement hydration (W n = 0. 25. alpha. C) is therefore not relevant for silica fume mixes; it has to be modified with a factor depending on the silica fume addition. It was also shown that, if sufficient water is supplied to a system with moderate silica fume contents, the degree of cement hydration of a standard Portland cement will not be significantly influenced. Silica fume does not prevent carbonation as such. However, it may influence the amount of <b>evaporable</b> <b>water,</b> which in turn affects the ingress of carbon dioxide in gas form into the pores. The proportions between different types of carbonates will change, due to a changed ratio between CSH and Ca(OH) 2 in the gel phase. Carbonation of the CSH also involves a polymerization phase which may cause dehydration. The degree of dehydration caused by carbonation of the CSH reflects the ratio between H 2 O and CaO in the CSH gel. In an already highly polymerized CSF blend, further polymerization becomes difficult and carbonation takes place without dehydration. A certain amount of the polymerization/dehydration that took place can not be attributed to carbonation. It was probably induced by the strains caused by the increased surface tension of the pore water at intermediate relative humidities. The developed thermogravimetric method has been a useful tool to clarify the nature and quantify the chemical influence of silica fume and carbonation. It could be used to study and quantify the influence of other reactive additives and other degradation mechanisms as well as any additive influencing the cement hydration process...|$|E

The free shrinkage from casting to 400 days of aging of four SCCs mixtures based on CEM I 52. 5 N, CEM III/A 52. 5 L containing 62 % slag addition, CEM V 42. 5 N containing 20 % fly ash and 25 % slag additions, and CEM I 52. 5 N+ 15 % of metakaolin (MK) is investigated. The development of cracks due to a restrained shrinkage is studied using ring tests. Nonevaporable and <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> contents, setting times, and compressive and splitting strength are measured. Results show that compared to portland cement SCC, SCCs with SCMs are more sensitive to drying shrinkage at very early ages. However, at long term, they exhibit different behaviors. SCC with 15 % MK presents the best properties, with a significantly low drying shrinkage and a high compressive strength at 28 days and beyond. SCC with CEM III cement presents the highest compressive strength at 28 days onward but also the highest drying shrinkage at long term. In restrained conditions, SCCs with SCMs are more sensitive to early cracking. However, their crack opening is at least 1. 57 times lower than the one of the reference SCC, which presents an important advantage for durability considerations...|$|E
40|$|Cement paste has {{a complex}} {{distribution}} of pores and molecular-scale spaces. This distribution controls the hysteresis of water sorption isotherms and associated bulk dimensional changes (shrinkage). We focus on two locations of <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> within the fine structure of pastes, each having unique properties, and we present applied physics models that capture the hysteresis by dividing drying and rewetting into two related regimes based on relative humidity (RH). We {{show that a}} continuum model, incorporating a pore-blocking mechanism for desorption and equilibrium thermodynamics for adsorption, explains well the sorption hysteresis for a paste that remains above approximately 20 % RH. In addition, we show with molecular models and experiments that water in spaces of ≲ 1 [*][*]nm width evaporates below approximately 20 % RH but reenters throughout the entire RH range. This water is responsible for a drying shrinkage hysteresis {{similar to that of}} clays but opposite in direction to typical mesoporous glass. Combining the models of these two regimes allows the entire drying and rewetting hysteresis to be reproduced accurately and provides parameters to predict the corresponding dimensional changes. The resulting model can improve the engineering predictions of long-term drying shrinkage accounting also for the history dependence of strain induced by hysteresis. Alternative strategies for quantitative analyses of the microstructure of cement paste based on this mesoscale physical model of water content within porous spaces are discussed.

40|$|In cement-based {{materials}} porosity {{plays an}} important role in determining their mechanical and transport properties. This paper describes an improved low–cost embeddable miniature NMR sensor capable of non-destructively measuring <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> loss and porosity refinement in low and high water-to-cement ratio cement-based materials. The sensor consists of two NdFeB magnets having their North and South poles facing each other, separated by 7 mm to allow space for a Faraday cage containing a Teflon tube and an ellipsoidal RF coil. To account for magnetic field changes due to temperature variations, and/or the presence of steel rebars, or frequency variation due to sample impedance, an external tuning circuit was employed. The sensor performance was evaluated by analyzing the transverse magnetization decay obtained with a CPMG measurement from different materials, such as a polymer phantom, fresh white and grey cement pastes with different w/c ratios and concrete with low (0. 30) and high (0. 6) w/c ratios. The results indicated that the sensor is capable of detecting changes in water content in fresh cement pastes and porosity refinement caused by cement hydration in hardened materials, even if they are prepared with a low w/c ratio (w/c = 0. 30). The short lifetime component of the transverse relaxation rate is directly proportional to the compressive strength of concrete determined by destructive testing.

40|$|The use of Geopolymer Concrete (GP*C) {{has been}} on the rise over the last few decades owing to its lower carbon {{emissions}} as compared to Ordinary Portland Cement Concrete (OPC). Recent research has also established the superior thermal properties of GPC and makes it an ideal construction material for specialized application. However, the deformational behaviour of GPC at elevated temperatures has not fully understood. If GPC is {{to be used as a}} main stream construction material for specialized applications, the exact deformational behaviour of the material under thermal loading needs to be investigated. This paper looks into the deformational characteristics of GPC (with natural crushed siliceous aggregates) when dry heated up to 150 °C at near zero loading. The deformations recorded using a clip-on extensometer are used to determine the strains developed in the GPC samples due to thermal loads. Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for the tested GPC samples was found and was comparable to OPC concrete at the tested temperatures. Between ambient (20 °C) and 80 °C the CTE for GPC was determined to be between 10. 3 - 10. 9 x 10 − 6 mm/mm/°C which is similar to OPC concretes. CTE for temperatures between 80 °C and 150 °C was determined to be 9. 3 - 10. 0 x 10 − 6 mm/mm/°C.

Extensive data on acid-soluble chloride concentration (total chloride), free chloride concentration in the pore fluid and the <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> content of hardened concrete were obtained {{in order to determine}} the chloride-binding capacity of the various concrete matrices. Corrosion of rebar electrodes embedded in these matrices was also monitored. The results show that the bound chloride and the chloride concentration decrease with increasing depth into concrete. Higher water-cement ratios or cement contents result in increased bound chloride. The chloride binding near the surface of concrete is not significantly affected by the incorporation of PFA or gbs. At greater depths, the use of PFA or gbs results in a reduction of Cl- bound in the cementitious binder. Replacement of cement with silica fume results in greatly reduced contents of bound chloride. Accelerated penetration of chloride in concrete results in lower binding than under natural exposure conditions.

40|$|Irrigation may {{be needed}} in the Mediterranean context but the {{monitoring}} of the grapevine water stress and the calculation of the irrigation needs are subject to difficulties. To obtain a specific yield {{and quality of the}} harvest, a defined course of water potential, ranging typically from – 0. 1 MPa to – 0. 6 MPa, is targeted by the wine grower. In the Mediterranean context, intense water stress (very negative values of potential) at inappropriate times is possible; it can be avoided by supplying irrigation. The traditional diagnosis method based on predawn water potential measurement requires sampling numerous leaves at night. Another approach is based on the utilization of a water balance model, which includes the regulation of transpiration performed by the grapevine, together with the physical processes occurring in the field: bare soil evaporation and runoff. The soil reservoir is characterized by its Total Transpirable Soil Water, and the maximal grapevine transpiration by a crop coefficient calculated from the geometrical parameters of the vegetation. In the experiment reported here (domaine Cazes, Rivesaltes, France), irrigation was triggered by comparing the calculated grapevine status with successive thresholds of potential in adequation with an objective of yield and quality. The parameters (Total Transpirable Soil Water, runoff curve number, readily and totally <b>evaporable</b> <b>water,</b> crop coefficient) were calculated from field and grapevine observations, and climatic data came from the nearby meteorological station. Total Transpirable Soil Water was estimated at 145 mm from profiles of water content and cultural profile (root distribution) performed in the vineyard, and the crop coefficient for Cabernet vineyard attained 0. 47. The pressure chamber monitoring led to 30 mm (three time 10 mm) irrigation both in 2010 and 2011. The water balance model would have led to 50 mm in 2010 and 30 mm in 2011. These results are considered promising for the water balance monitoring of irrigation at the field scale...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{provides}} {{new research}} related to the mechanisms of creep and shrinkage of hardened Portland cement paste. The emphasis is put {{on the role of}} calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) microstructure and calcium hydroxide the most important phases in hydrated Portland cement paste. Specially designed specimens were used for creep and shrinkage measurements. These were well hydrated and very thin {{in order to avoid the}} occurrence of moisture gradients during the drying process. Length change of specimens following organic solvent exchange was used as a microstructural probe. Length change data of compacted CH powder, pre-conditioned from 11 % to 85 % relative humidity, are presented in order to support inferences on the role of CH in cement paste. Similar measurements were conducted on Portland cement and tri-calcium silicate pastes. It is suggested that the length change on removal of water may be related to surface energy changes not always specific to the C-S-H phase alone. Mass change measurements versus time during exchange were carried out to support the interpretation of the length change behavior. The re-saturation of Portland cement paste systems with synthetic pore solution after several drying pre-treatments was adopted to facilitate electrical measurements in order to investigate the shrinkage, creep, and creep recovery behavior. The state of the water in each pre-treated specimen was characterized using the DTGA methods. The coupling of a. c. impedance spectroscopy (ACIS) and creep and shrinkage measurements established ACIS as an effective method for evaluating pore structure modification as well as the nature of changes to the pore network of cement paste during creep and shrinkage experiments. Cement paste specimens from which all <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> was completely removed were found to creep a significant amount contrary to the hypothesis that they should not creep at all. The compacted calcium hydroxide specimens were found to creep with a creep coefficient less than one. This suggested that calcium hydroxide makes a contribution to the overall deformation of cement paste systems...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out in mortars with alkali {{activated}} blast furnace slag (BFS) as the binder. The slag was replaced by up to 30 % by weight of an ultrafine geothermal slag (GS) which was predominantly siliceous. The activating agents were waterglass and NaOH, commercial lime was added in 4 % to promote pozzolanic activity of both slags. Measurements of non <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> indicated {{that the presence of}} the GS increased the reactivity of the cementitious systems. Also, for the NaOH activation, the replacement with 5 - 10 % of the BFS by GS favored a porosity reduction (as observed by scanning electron microscopy) and the compressive strength improvement. For the waterglass activation, the addition of GS resulted in more compact microstructures; however, in spite of such improvement, during the mixing and castings of such mortars, air bubbles were trapped in the microstructure due to a fast setting, degrading the compressive strength with respect to the neat BFS mortars. After 90 days, the lime was not observed in the microstructure, suggesting that it was consumed by both slags.

Los agentes activantes empleados fueron vidrio soluble y NaOH, agregando 4 % de cal comercial como activante para promover la actividad puzolánica de ambas escorias. Las mediciones de agua no evaporable indicaron que la presencia de la EG incrementó la reactividad de los sistemas cementicios. Asimismo, para la activación con NaOH, la adición de 5 - 10 % de EG favoreció la reducción de la porosidad (por microscopía electrónica de barrido) y la resistencia a la compresión. Al respecto de la activación con vidrio soluble, se observaron las microestructuras mas compactas, sin embargo durante el mezclado y moldeado de morteros con EG se notó la formación de burbujas de aire atrapadas lo que redujo finalmente las propiedades mecánicas al respecto a los morteros sin EG. Después de 90 días no se observó la presencia de cal en la microestructura, lo que indicó que fue consumida por ambas escorias...|$|E

The grain boundary hydration levels tested here span water activities from around unity (wet conditions) down to 10 − 4 (dry conditions) depending on temperature. Four orders of magnitude in water activity result in electrical conductivity variations for about 6 - 7 orders of magnitude at 2 GPa and room temperature. Wet brucite samples containing, initially, about 18 wt% of <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> (i. e. totally removed at temperatures below 393 K in air), display electrical conductivity values above 10 − 2 - 10 − 3 S/m. A. C. electrical conductivity {{as a function of}} temperature follows an Arrhenius behaviour with an activation energy of 0. 11 eV. The electrical conductivity of the same polycrystalline brucite material dried beforehand at 393 K (dry conditions) is lower by about 5 - 6 orders of magnitude at room temperature and possesses an activation energy of 0. 8 - 0. 9 eV which is close to that of protonic diffusion in (001) brucitic planes. Above ca. 873 K, a non-reversible conductivity jump is observed which is interpreted as a water transfer from mineral bulk to grain boundaries (i. e. partial dehydration). Cooling of such partially dehydrated sample shows electrical conductivities much higher than those of the initially dry sample by 4 orders of magnitude at 500 K. Furthermore, the corresponding activation energy is decreased by a factor of about four (i. e. 0. 21 eV). Buffering of the sample at low water activity has been achieved by adding CaO or MgO, two hygroscopic compounds, to the starting material. Then, sample conductivities reached the lowest values encountered in this study with the activation energy of 1. 1 eV. The strong dependency of the electrical conductivity with water activity highlights the importance of the latter parameter as a controlling factor of diffusion rates in natural processes where water availability and activity may vary grandly. Water exchange between mineral bulk and mineral boundary suggests that grain boundary can be treated as an independent phase in dehydroxylation reactions...|$|E
40|$|For most fires, Forensic {{investigation}} {{takes place}} well after building materials have cooled {{and knowledge of}} the structural damage due to heat exposure can reveal the temperature reached during an incident. Recently, there have been significant changes in the characteristics of cementitious materials used in the United Arab Emirates. Few studies focus on the application of thermo-gravimetric and petrographic techniques on newly developed structures and this work aims to address this deficiency by utilising a series of parametric laboratory-based tests to assess the effects of heat on hardened concrete. Specimens were made with a design mix used for low-rise residential homes and storage facilities. The key constituents were: Portland cement (PC), crushed gabbro stone and dune sand with water/cement ratios of 0. 4 - 0. 5. Cement substitutes included slag (GGBS), and silica fume (SF) at replacement percentages of up to 50 % and 4 %, respectively. The concrete cubes were exposed to heat inside an electric furnace with pre-determined temperature regimes of 150 °C, 300 °C, 600 °C and 900 °C. Petrographic examination was utilised to compare the discolouration of the cooled concrete. Data derived from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are reported in order to assess the usefulness of these techniques in fire scene investigation to differentiate between these temperature regimes [...] The results from the TGA indicate {{that the majority of the}} percentage weight loss for all the mixtures occurred in the range 650 - 700 °C, which corresponds to the decarbonation of calcium carbonate, mainly from the aggregates. The endothermic DSC peak at 70 - 120 °C relates to the loss of <b>evaporable</b> <b>water.</b> Since both of these reactions are irreversible, this information can help fire investigators estimate the temperature history of concrete after exposure to fire. On the other hand, the portlandite in the cement matrix dehydroxylates at 450 - 550 °C but then reforms as the concrete cools. The onset temperature for the dehydroxylation of the reformed mineral is always lower than in virgin samples and its enthalpy furthermore depends strongly on the thermal history of the portlandite. Thus, this feature can be used to establish the temperature to which the material was exposed to during a fire incident...|$|E

40|$|Safety {{is the top}} {{priority}} at a nuclear facility. The nuclear power plants are designed to prevent radioactive leakage to the surroundings, both during normal operation {{as well as in}} case of a severe accident. One of the most important structures in a nuclear power plant, with regard to safety, is thus the reactor containment wall. The containment wall is the last main barrier to prevent radioactive leakage, and it is designed to limit and control internal hazards if all other barriers fail. In order to understand and identify the potential deviation of the barrier, the effects of changes in the materials and how these changes occur and propagate have to be understood. The work presented in this thesis concerns the moisture condition within nuclear reactor containment inner walls in addition to other concrete structures within the containments. The study aims to describe earlier, ongoing and future moisture contributions, and redistribution of moisture within and from the concrete structures within the containments. An in situ measurement setup for long term monitoring of relative humidity and temperature in concrete was designed and installed in four reactor containments. The setup was used to monitor the actual conditions within the containments and in the concrete structures, and how they change over time. The measurements showed that all containments within the study complied with the regulated conditions with regard to temperature. The stable humidity in the air within the containments indicated that the dehumidification apparatus at the sites worked as anticipated, and that the measured conditions can be considered as "as-designed conditions", even though there is no regulation regarding permissible humidity. The results from the monitoring campaigns were further used to validate a model which was designed to describe the ongoing drying and moisture redistribution in the concrete structures. The measurements and simulations done in this study show that the concrete structures within the reactor containment are still drying after approximately 30 years of operation, and will continue to dry and contribute with moisture to the ambient compartment for the remaining part of the service life for the reactors. The simulations presents that 35 – 45 % of the initial <b>evaporable</b> <b>water</b> had dried out, until this study, and that the amount for 60 years of operation is 45 – 55 %. The main drying has already occurred, and the moisture contribution to the ambient compartments will continue to decrease, thus contributing less moisture to the air in the containment in the future...|$|E
