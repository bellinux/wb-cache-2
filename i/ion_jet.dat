5000|$|An {{accelerating}} electrode (accelerator) is placed {{directly in front}} of the emitter. This electrode consists of a metal (usually stainless steel) plate where two sharp blades are machined. When thrust is required, a strong electric field is generated by the application of a high voltage difference between the emitter and the accelerator. Under this condition, the free surface of the liquid metal enters a regime of local instability, due to the combined effects of the electrostatic force and the surface tension. A series of protruding cusps, or [...] "Taylor cones" [...] are thus created. When the electric field reaches a value in the order of 109 V/m, the atoms at the tip of the cusps spontaneously ionize and an <b>ion</b> <b>jet</b> is extracted by the electric field, while the electrons are rejected in the bulk of the liquid. An external source of electrons (neutralizer) provides negative charges to maintain global electrical neutrality of the thruster assembly.|$|E

The expansion of a supersonic Ar + <b>ion</b> <b>jet</b> in a low pressure (0. 2 Torr) reactor filled with N 2 and O 2 has been investigated by means of hydrodynamic modelling. The gas velocity fields and the gas temperature distribution in the threedimensional reactor have been determined. The formation of different species through the molecular kinetics triggered by the collision of Ar + ions with N 2 and O 2 molecules has been studied. We have investigated {{the effect of the}} ions velocity and molecular gas flow rates on the gas temperature and species density distributions. We have shown that the main difference between this system and an N 2 -O 2 post-discharge lies in the dissociation degrees of N 2 and O 2. While in an N 2 -O 2 post-discharge the N 2 dissociation degree is low and that of O 2 is high, in the present system this can be varied through the gas flow rate of the molecular gases. We have also shown that the NO(X) molecules formation is governed by the surface processes, that is strongly influenced by the state of the surface.

In Low Earth Orbit (LEO), {{the interaction}} between the Ionosphere and orbiting objects is well studied from a charging perspective. Not well understood is the effect of the Ionosphere on the motion of LEO objects i. e. charged aerodynamics. This paper presents the implementation, validation, and verification of the hybrid electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) - Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code, pdFOAM, to study both the neutral and charged particle aerodynamics of LEO objects. The 2 D aerodynamic interaction of a cylinder with a fixed uniform surface potential of − 50 V in mesothermal O+ and H+ plasmas representative of ionospheric conditions is investigated.
