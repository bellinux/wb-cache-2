However, the [11 C]CH 4 yields from N 2 -H 2 gas target fall short from theoretical amounts, as {{calculated from the}} cross section for the well-known 14 N(p,α) 11 C nuclear reaction 1. The beneficial effect of increased target chamber temperature on [11 C]CH 4 yields has recently been brought forward by us 2 and others 3. In addition to the temperature effect, our attention has also been on the hydrogen content factor. This study intends to examine the N 2 -H 2 target performance in a substantially larger target chamber and at higher temperatures than our setup before and compare the results to the existing data.
