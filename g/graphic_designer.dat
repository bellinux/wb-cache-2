40|$|The {{present study}} investigates what skill set {{employers}} expect from <b>graphic</b> <b>designers,</b> {{based on a}} document analysis of 1, 406 job advertisements from the United Kingdom. In organising the statements made in the advertisements, we describe the skill set of <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> in three main areas: (1) what <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> are expected to deliver (competence areas), (2) what <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> are expected to know (knowledge and skills), and (3) what personal characteristics <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> are expected to have. In analysing advertisements for different types of positions, we compared how employers articulate their interests {{at different levels of}} seniority (junior, middle, and senior) and for different types of positions (internal and external to a company). The results of our study suggest that employers seek a varied skill set from <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> and that the relevance of different skills partly depends on the position advertised. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for design education and practice in terms of how expertise in graphic design is articulated, studied and taught. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Graphic</b> <b>designers</b> {{often need}} to find {{suitable}} pieces of music for their motion graphic designs, animations, etc. Existing music collection search tools and techniques are at best only suitable for ordinary users, and lack powerful mechanisms needed by advanced users such as <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> when they are searching for music. To {{be able to develop}} such search systems, however, we need to better understand how <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> in fact formulate and carry out their search for the right music. Unfortunately very little research has been done in this area. This paper describes a pilot study which was carried out to identify some of the strategies that <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> adopt when searching for the music they need. Although the study was rather limited in its scope, nevertheless, it sheds some light on the largely unknown process by which <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> search for music...|$|R

Billings approached Tom Shaw from Avalon Hill—the company produced many war games that Billings played as a child—and {{one of the founders}} of Automated Simulations to share market data, but aroused no interest. The lukewarm responses made Billings believe he would have to publish SSI's games. After Computer Bismarck was finished in January 1980, he searched for a <b>graphic</b> <b>designer</b> to handle the game's packaging.|$|E
50|$|<b>Graphic</b> <b>designers</b> {{focus on}} the {{aesthetic}} appeal of the design. Information is communicated to the users through text and images.

They develop the overall layout and production design for various applications such as advertisements, brochures, magazines, and corporate reports.|$|R

40|$|Hypermedia systems {{development}} is, in many regards, different from “conventional ” {{systems development}}, chief amongst these differences being its multidisciplinary nature. Foremost amongst the roles in hypermedia development are software engineering and graphic design. However, there {{has traditionally been}} a pronounced tension between software engineers and <b>graphic</b> <b>designers.</b> It is therefore important to {{gain an understanding of}} the differences between the two camps with a view to bringing them closer together. This paper reports on the findings of a survey of hypermedia developers conducted in Ireland. One of the objectives of the survey was to compare and contrast the development approaches, methods, and techniques used by software engineers with those used by <b>graphic</b> <b>designers.</b> It was found that software engineers and <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> are much closer than might be believed in their attitudes on the value and importance of processes and documented working methods. However, <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> primarily base development approaches around the use of specific tools, whereas software engineers are more reliant on traditional and object-oriented software development methods. Regarding diagramming methods, there is some evidence of cross-pollination, as software engineers often use informal techniques such as storyboarding and <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> use software engineering techniques such as use case diagrams. However, <b>graphic</b> <b>designers</b> find software engineering techniques to be less useful than vice versa...|$|R
