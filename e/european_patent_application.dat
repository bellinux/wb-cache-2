The declaration indicates that the EPO search examiner is {{of the opinion that}} Macrossan's application contains nothing of technical merit, but only commonplace technical features (i.e. a computer) for implementing a business method. As a consequence, no meaningful search was considered to be possible. Before a substantive examination report was issued, the application was deemed to be withdrawn in October 2009 after Macrossan failed to pay a maintenance fee.|$|E

In contrast to an intervener however, a person filing observations during opposition proceedings does not become party to the proceedings. This notably means that such person does not acquire the [...] "bundle of procedural rights" [...] created [...] "in respect of the opponent", such as the right to be heard before any decision is taken. Observations by third parties, which must be filed in writing, may be filed by post or online.

5000|$|Article 83 of the European Patent Convention (EPC) {{relates to}} the {{disclosure}} of the invention under the European Patent Convention.

50|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of Article 83 EPC, a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> must contain sufficient information to allow a person skilled in the art, using his common general knowledge, to perceive the technical teaching inherent in the claimed invention and to put it into effect accordingly. In other words, the disclosure of the invention must be reproducible without undue burden, and this must be true over the whole scope of the claim. This requirement must be complied with as from the date of filing because a deficiency in a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> as filed, consisting in an insufficient identification of the subject-matter claimed, cannot subsequently be cured without offending against Article 123(2) EPC which provides that the subject-matter content of a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> as filed may not be extended.|$|E
5000|$|<b>European</b> <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> can {{be filed}} at the EPO at Munich, Germany, at The Hague, Netherlands, at Berlin, Germany, or [...] "if {{the law of}} a Contracting State so permits, at the central {{industrial}} property office or other competent authority of that State". This latter provision is important in some countries. For example, in the United Kingdom, {{it used to be}} required to obtain clearance for all inventions but now it is only prohibited for a UK resident to file an overseas <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> for inventions in certain sensitive technical areas without obtaining clearance through the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office first. <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> cannot be validly filed at the EPO in Vienna, Austria.|$|R

Counts of <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> per million capita are markedly different in the EU 25 during the years 1997 and 2001. Countries are segmented according to their economic development. Analysis deals with this segmentation and is also targeted on price effect, measured via CPLI (Comparative price level indices). Two indices will cover these effects. Economic effect measured via GDP in PPS per capita, clean up from Price effect. And Price effect measured via CPLI which is used for spatial comparisons of relative price levels in the EU 25. Not only has the impact of price effect affected the counts of <b>patent</b> <b>applications.</b> The <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> procedure it self and other possibilities to protect invention together with price effect make up a complex mix, which prejudice the value of patent indicators which are based on <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> <b>applications...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{integration}} of the International Patent Institute into the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organisation led in practice {{to the creation of}} the branch of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO) at Rijswijk in The Netherlands (a suburb of The Hague). This branch still exists and is one of three locations of the EPO (along with Munich and Berlin) where <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> may be filed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office is {{the only}} body that can perform legally {{effective}} publication and registration of <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> and <b>patents.</b> It regularly issues warnings about scams by firms and individuals that invite applicants to register patents in unofficial registers or publications. Such registration services are a well known scam in intellectual property.|$|R
50|$|In other words, {{the grant}} {{procedure}} before the EPO is the procedure {{leading to the}} grant of a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> or to the refusal to grant a <b>European</b> <b>patent.</b> The procedure starts with the filing of an application and ends with the grant of a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> or the refusal of the <b>patent</b> <b>application</b> by the EPO, or {{the withdrawal of the}} application by the applicant, or its deemed withdrawal. The prosecution of <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> <b>applications</b> until grant typically takes several years.|$|R
