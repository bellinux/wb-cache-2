40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read "SAFETY AND HEALTH " in Section F of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE The procedures to be used for determining holidays in epoxy coatings on ferrous materials are described in this method. This method uses an electrical current flow through a low resistance path to trigger an alarm (buzzer) to indicate to the operator the presence of a holiday. Holidays are defined as pinholes and voids in non-conductive coatings that allow current to pass through the protective coating to the metal base material. These discontinuities are such that they may not be visible to a person with normal or corrected vision. B. APPARATUS 1. A low voltage <b>holiday</b> <b>detector</b> tester having an electrical source of 67. 5 to 100 V DC that meets the requiremen...|$|E
