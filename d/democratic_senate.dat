5|$|Ford seriously {{considered}} leaving the Senate and {{running for governor}} again in 1983 and 1991, but decided against it both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in the Senate and desire to become <b>Democratic</b> <b>Senate</b> whip as factors in his decision not to run for governor.|$|E

When Thompson took office in January 2007, he, along with Diane Savino and Jeffrey Klein (both of whom later {{defected}} from the Democrats to form {{the core of the}} Independent Democratic Conference), assumed the chairmanship of the New York <b>Democratic</b> <b>Senate</b> Campaign Committee by assuming control of Democratic campaigns development. He retained this position through the 2008 general election.|$|E

In 2012, Damon, Ben Affleck, and John Krasinski hosted a fundraiser for <b>Democratic</b> <b>Senate</b> nominee Elizabeth Warren.|$|E

5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with <b>Democratic</b> <b>Senate</b> President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E

In doing so, he received the votes of 42% of Republicans and 73% of Independents on top of 96% of those from his own party. He also won all but 13 counties in the western part of the state, a surprising feat in normally heavily Republican Nebraska.|$|E
25|$|Schumer was the {{chairman}} of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, part of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>senate</b> leadership, with primary responsibility for raising funds and recruiting Democratic candidates in the 2006 Senate election. When he took this post, he announced that he would not run for Governor of New York in 2006, as many had speculated he would. This step avoided a potentially divisive gubernatorial primary election in 2006 between Schumer and Eliot Spitzer, then New York's attorney general.|$|E
25|$|The 1938 <b>Democratic</b> <b>Senate</b> primary {{featured}} {{an intense}} showdown between Barkley, liberal {{spokesman for the}} New Deal, and conservative governor Happy Chandler. The governor was a gifted public speaker, combining voice control, emotionalism, and singing with an unusual ability to personalize his speeches. He could remember everyone's name, and in turn they became emotionally involved in his campaign speeches. Barkley's methodical campaigning was bolstered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's strong endorsement. Barkley handily defeated Chandler, with 56% of the vote. Farmers, labor unions, and city machines gave Barkley his margin, a vote which reaffirmed {{the popularity of the}} New Deal in Kentucky. Only a few months later, Chandler was appointed to the state's other Senate seat upon the death of Senator Mills Logan.|$|E

25|$|A 2012 Pew Center {{survey on}} Religion and Public Life {{indicates}} that 74 percent of U.S. Latter-day Saints church members lean towards the Republican Party. Some liberal members {{have stated that}} {{they feel that they}} have to defend their worthiness due to political differences. In recent decades, the Republican Party has consistently won a majority of the LDS vote in most national and state-level elections. As a result, Utah, a state with a majority LDS population, {{is also one of the}} most heavily Republican states in the country. However, Harry Reid of Nevada, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Senate</b> Majority Leader from 2007 to 2014, became an LDS Church convert as a college student. James E. Faust (1920–2007), an apostle and member of the First Presidency, also identified himself as a Democrat prior to his full-time church service as a general authority (1972–2007).|$|E
25|$|During the 1946 <b>Democratic</b> <b>Senate</b> {{primary in}} Mississippi, his last race, Bilbo {{was the subject}} of a series of attacks by famed {{journalist}} Hodding Carter, Jr., in his paper, the Greenville Delta Democrat-Times. He won that primary against three other opponents with 51.0 percent of the vote; one of his rivals was Nelson Trimble Levings, who owned a Mississippi plantation and was an investment banker in New York City. As usual, Bilbo faced no Republican opposition in the 1946 general election. Based on a request by liberal Democratic Senator Glen H. Taylor of Idaho, the newly elected Republican majority in the United States Senate refused to seat Bilbo for the term to which he was elected because of his speeches. He was believed to have incited violence against blacks who wanted to vote in the South. In addition, a committee found that he had taken bribes. A filibuster by his supporters delayed the seating of the Senate for days. It was resolved when a supporter proposed that Bilbo's credentials remain on the table while he returned home to Mississippi to seek medical treatment for oral cancer.|$|E

500|$|Republicans {{attempted}} to defund its implementation, and in October 2013, House Republicans refused {{to fund the}} federal government unless accompanied with a delay in ACA implementation, after the President unilaterally deferred the employer mandate by one year, which critics claimed he had no power to do. The House passed three versions of a bill funding the government while submitting various versions that would repeal or delay ACA, with the last version delaying enforcement of the individual mandate. The <b>Democratic</b> <b>Senate</b> leadership stated the Senate would only pass a [...] "clean" [...] funding bill without any restrictions on ACA. The government shutdown began on October 1. Senate Republicans threatened to block appointments to relevant agencies, such as the Independent Payment Advisory Board and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.|$|E
500|$|During 2013, McCain was {{a member}} of a bi-partisan group of senators, the [...] "Gang of Eight", which {{announced}} principles for another try at comprehensive immigration reform. [...] The resulting Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 passed the Senate by a 68–32 margin, but faced an uncertain future in the House. In July 2013, McCain was at the forefront of an agreement among senators to drop filibusters against Obama administration executive nominees without Democrats resorting to the [...] "nuclear option" [...] that would disallow such filibusters altogether. However, the option would be imposed later in the year anyway, much to the senator's displeasure. These developments and some other negotiations showed that McCain now had improved relations with the Obama administration, including the president himself, as well as with <b>Democratic</b> <b>Senate</b> Majority Leader Harry Reid, and that he had become the leader of a power center in the Senate for cutting deals in an otherwise bitterly partisan environment.
