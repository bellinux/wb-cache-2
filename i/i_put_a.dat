[...] Beatles producer George Martin stated: [...] "Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn't do a roll to save his life", although Martin later added, [...] "He's got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support – that rock-solid back-beat – that made the recording of all the Beatles' songs that much easier." [...] Starr commented: [...] "I've always believed that the drummer is not there to interpret the song"; comparing his drumming to painting, he stated: [...] "I am the foundation, and then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> bit of glow here and there ...

[...] Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian deemed {{it one of the}} album's best songs, writing [...] "FU's mix of raw heartbreak, sub-bass and scathing rhyming from French Montana is devastating." [...] Kitty Empire from The Observer reviewed the song positively, writing [...] "Cyrus liberates her inner Christina Aguilera in the company of rapper French Montana, blending old-time jazzy balladry, <b>I</b> <b>Put</b> <b>a</b> Spell on You, romantic righteousness and dubstep sub-bass."

John Murphy of musicOMH compared the song to works by Lady Gaga and called it [...] "rather excellent." [...] Kyle Fowle from Slant Magazine heavily praised the track while comparing it to the works of Amy Winehouse and Skrillex, writing, [...] "Cyrus plays the femme fatale with an exaggerated Southern drawl, ready to rip into male suitors and their tired pick-up lines." [...] Catriona Wightman of Digital Spy speculated it to be inspired by Cyrus' former fiancé Liam Hemsworth and deemed it the best song of the album.|$|E
