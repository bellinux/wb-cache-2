25|$|A {{limitation}} of the flash distiller is its sensitivity to seawater <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature,</b> as this affects {{the efficiency of the}} condenser coils. In tropical waters, the distiller flowrate must be throttled to maintain effective condensation. As these systems are more modern, they are generally fitted with an electric salinometer and some degree of automatic control.|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{corrosion}} protective {{formation is}} temperature dependent. For example, at 27°C (i.e., a common <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature</b> in the Middle East), rapid film formation and good corrosion protection can be expected within a few hours. At 16°C, it could take 2–3 months for the protection to mature. But once a good surface film forms, corrosion rates decrease, normally to 0.02–0.002mm/yr, as protective layers develop {{over a period of}} years. These alloys have good resistance to chloride pitting and crevice corrosion and are not susceptible to chloride stress corrosion.|$|E

25|$|In {{general in}} service Combined Cycle {{efficiencies}} are over 50% on a {{lower heating value}} and Gross Output basis. Most combined cycle units, especially the larger units, have peak, steady state efficiencies on the LHV (marketing figure) basis of 55 to 59%. Research aimed at 1370°C (2500°F) turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature</b> has led to even more efficient combined cycles and nearly 60% LHV efficiency (54% HHV efficiency) has been reached in the combined cycle unit of Baglan Bay, a GE H-technology gas turbine with a NEM 3 pressure reheat boiler, utilising steam from the HRSG to cool the turbine blades.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} the -6 entered service, an {{increase}} in thrust and therefore core power was required. Unable to increase (HP) turbine rotor <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature,</b> General Electric chose the expensive path of reconfiguring the CF6 core to increase its basic size. They removed two stages {{from the rear of}} the HP compressor, leaving an empty air passage where the blades and vanes had once been. Two booster stages were added to the LP (low pressure) compressor, which increased the overall pressure ratio to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450lb/s (660kg/s), yielding a static thrust of 51,000lbf (227kN). The increase in core size and overall pressure ratio raised the core flow, decreasing the bypass ratio to 4.26.|$|E
25|$|Heated {{water in}} the suit forms an active {{insulation}} barrier to heat loss, but the temperature must be regulated within fairly close limits. If the temperature falls below about 32°C, hypothermia can result, and temperatures above 45°C can cause burn injury to the diver. The diver may not notice a gradual change in <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature,</b> {{and in the early}} stages of hypo- or hyperthermia, may not notice the deteriorating condition. The suit is loose fitting to allow unimpeded water flow. This causes a large volume of water (13 to 22 litres) to be held in the suit, which can impede swimming due to the added inertia. When controlled correctly, the hot water suit is safe, comfortable and effective, and allows the diver adequate control of thermal protection, however hot water supply failure can be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|The <b>inlet</b> air <b>temperature</b> relates {{strongly}} {{with the heat}} sink base temperature. For example, if there is recirculation of air in a product, the <b>inlet</b> air <b>temperature</b> is not the ambient air <b>temperature.</b> The <b>inlet</b> air <b>temperature</b> of the heat sink is therefore higher, which also results in a higher heat sink base temperature.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{thermal power}} plants {{are used to}} {{generate}} power. The thermal power plants are designed based on required conditions, but actually inlet conditions are not as per the designed conditions. Variations in the power outputs from power plant are always a matter of disputes. So correction curves for power and heat rate are generated. In this paper, the thermodynamic analysis of 120 MW thermal power plant has been done at particular inlet pressure (124. 61 bar) and at different <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> (507. 78 °C, 517. 78 °C, 527. 78 °C, 537. 78 °C, 547. 78 °C, 557. 78 °C, and 567. 78 °C). The correction curves for power and heat rate have been generated for combined effect of inlet pressure and different <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures.</b> These curves indicate that if inlet pressure is 124. 61 bar and <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> vary, then power output and heat rate also vary...|$|R

The range of testing included three shaft speeds: the design speed of 36, 000 rpm, 10 percent overspeed (39, 600 rpm), and 10 percent underspeed (32, 400 rpm). A range of compressor <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> from 60 F to 120 F and discharge pressures from 20 to 45 psia were included. The effects of turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> (from 1200 F to 1600 F) on the compressor were also studied.

25|$|The AJ, SF, SH and SK 37 {{models of}} the Viggen had {{the first version of}} the RM8A engine with uprated {{internal}} components from the JT8D that it was based on. Thrust was 65.6kN dry and 115.6kN with afterburner. For the JA 37, the RM8A was developed into the RM8B, achieved by adding a third low-pressure compressor stage over the preceding model, increasing the turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature</b> and fuel diffusion within the combustion chamber. Thrust is 72.1kN dry and 125.0kN with afterburner. Due to the increased length and weight of the RM8B engine over its predecessor, the airframe of the JA 37 was stretched in order to accommodate it. Onboard electrical power was provided by a 60 kVA generator. In the event of an in-flight engine failure, emergency power was provided by an automatically deploying ram air turbine (RAT), capable of generating 6 kVA.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the coolant}} {{temperature}} {{is too close}} to its boiling point, cavitation can occur in the pumps and their operation can become erratic or even stop entirely. The feedwater temperature is dependent on the steam production; the steam phase portion is led to the turbines and condensers and returns significantly cooler (...) than the water returning directly from the steam separator (284°C). At low reactor power, therefore, the <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature</b> may become dangerously high. The water is kept below the saturation temperature to prevent film boiling and the associated drop in heat transfer rate.|$|E

50|$|The {{charge air}} cooler, located between the {{turbocharger}} {{and the engine}} air inlet manifold, is an air-to-air heat exchanger. It reduces the <b>inlet</b> air <b>temperatures</b> of turbocharged diesel engines from 200°C to 45°C while increasing inlet air densities to increase engine efficiencies. Even higher <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> (246°C or higher) and boost pressures {{may be necessary to}} comply with the emissions standards in the future.|$|R
40|$|Efficiency {{and power}} output of gas {{turbines}} improve {{with an increase}} in turbine rotor <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Innovative cooling methods are used by blade designers to raise turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> to levels higher than the melting temperatures of the blade material. These increased turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> are achieved by utilizing a combination of internal convective cooling and external film-cooling. Internal convective cooling, flowing air through the internal passages of the blade, is further augmented by pin fin arrays. These pin fins serve to turbulate the air thereby augmenting convective cooling. The coolant flow exits internal cooling passages to the external side of the blade and forms a protective layer along the external surface of the blade further cooling the blade. In the current study, a novel low-speed large-scale wind tunnel facility was developed with the capability to measure internal heat transfer coefficients, using thermal liquid crystallography, and external adiabatic effectiveness, using infrared thermography. The test facility has been used to characterize several proprietary cooling configurations, and is currently in use for the testing of public pin fin designs...|$|R
2500|$|The {{control unit}} {{comprises}} two controllers, {{one for the}} air heat cycle {{and one for the}} geothermal circulation, in one device. [...] All components communicate over a common bus to ensure they interact to enhance the efficiency of the hybrid heating system. [...] The German Patent and Trade Mark Office in Munich granted the air/water-brine/water heat pump a patent in 2008, under the title “Heat pump and method for controlling the source <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature</b> to the heat pump”. This hybrid heat pump can be combined with a solar thermal system or with an ice-storage. [...] It trades and is marketed under the name ThermSelect.

2500|$|The nominal {{temperature}} of the cooling water at the inlet of the reactor is about [...] and the outlet temperature , at pressure in the drum separator of [...] The pressure and the <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature</b> determine the height at which the boiling begins in the reactor; if the coolant temperature is not sufficiently below its boiling point at the system pressure, the boiling starts {{at the very bottom}} part of the reactor instead of its higher parts. With few absorbers in the reactor core, such as during the Chernobyl accident, the positive void coefficient of the reactor makes the reactor very sensitive to the feedwater temperature. Bubbles of boiling water lead to increased power, which in turn increases the formation of bubbles. After 1986 absorbers were introduced in the fuel assembly, permanently assuring a negative void coefficient at the cost of higher enrichment requirements of the uranium fuel.|$|E

40|$|The cosorption {{characteristics}} {{of water and}} toluene vapors in various concentrations of triethylene glycol (TEG) solution flowing through a packed-bed dehumidifier are investigated in this paper. A multi-component model was constructed using the reported equilibrium relationships of toluene and water vapors in TEG solutions together with the Krishna-Standart multi-component mass transfer correlation. The effects of liquid-to-air ratios, TEG <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures,</b> air <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> were reported on the moisture and toluene removal rate {{as well as the}} moisture and toluene removal efficiency of the packed dehumidifier. Running the packed dehumidifier in a higher liquid-to-gas flow ratio generally increased the removal rates and efficiencies of both water vapor and toluene vapor from the airstream. Inc. reasing <b>inlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the TEG solution led to a decrease in the removal rate of water vapor when running the packed dehumidifier at a high liquid-to-gas flow ratio. However, there was no significant change in the toluene vapor removal rate or toluene removal efficiency when the flow rate of the inlet TEG solution was increased.
