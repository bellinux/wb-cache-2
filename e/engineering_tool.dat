500|$|Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) walks {{his wife}} Keiko (Rosalind Chao) along the {{promenade}} {{to the school}} where she teaches students on the station. [...] They discuss Bajoran culture, a topic Miles learned about from Neela (Robin Christopher), his Bajoran assistant. At the school, Keiko teaches her class about the science of the Bajoran wormhole and the aliens that live inside it. This scientific view {{is different from the}} religious approach taken by the Bajorans, who believe the wormhole is the legendary Celestial Temple inhabited by their [...] "Prophets", whom they worship as gods. Her class is interrupted by one of Bajor's spiritual leaders, Vedek Winn (Louise Fletcher). Winn questions why Keiko doesn't teach Bajoran religion in her classroom. Afterwards, Keiko reports the incident to Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks). When Sisko asks Winn about the dispute, she says there may be consequences if Keiko refuses to teach religion. Meanwhile, Miles discovers an important <b>engineering</b> <b>tool</b> is missing, but is distracted when he and Neela discover the remains of a Starfleet ensign.|$|E

40|$|Real world {{engineering}} design projects require {{the cooperation of}} multidisciplinary design teams using sophisticated and powerful <b>engineering</b> <b>tools.</b> The individuals or the individual groups of the multidisciplinary design teams work in parallel and independently with the different <b>engineering</b> <b>tools</b> which are located on the different sites for often a long time. In order to ensure the coordination of the design activities of the different groups or the cooperation among the different <b>engineering</b> <b>tools,</b> {{it is necessary to}} develop an efficient distributed intelligent design environment. This paper discusses a distributed architecture for integrating such <b>engineering</b> <b>tools</b> in an open design environment organized as a population of asynchronous cognitive agents. Before introducing the general architecture and the communication protocol, issues about the agent architecture and the inter-agent communication are discussed.

40|$|Digitalisation is {{the future}} of the {{manufacturing}} industry, and it will entail production systems that are highly automated, efficient, and flexible. The realisation of such systems will require effective maintenance organisations that adopt engineering approaches, e. g. <b>engineering</b> <b>tools</b> and methods. However, little is known about their actual extent of use in industry. Through a survey study in 70 Swedish manufacturing companies, this study shows to what extent <b>engineering</b> <b>tools</b> and methods are used in maintenance organisations, as well as to what extent companies have maintenance engineers performing work related to <b>engineering</b> <b>tools</b> and methods. Overall, the results indicate a potential for increasing the use of <b>engineering</b> <b>tools</b> and methods in both the operational and the design and development phase. This increase can contribute towards achieving high equipment performance, which is a necessity for the realisation of digital manufacturin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} an innovative approach and infrastructure for a collaborative production engineering environment – from conception phase up to virtual verification. The presented approach allows {{the exchange of}} intelligent components for virtual commissioning between different <b>engineering</b> <b>tools.</b> The components provide in addition to geometric information (which is a common feature) also their logical behavior. An application programming interface (API) enables the integration of these components (so-called SmartComponents) into various <b>engineering</b> <b>tools</b> of different domains. Manufacturer of <b>engineering</b> <b>tools</b> may use the provided API to create, import and export single SmartComponents {{as well as the}} complete product or resource structure and reuse them in different tools. Thus, functional, virtual product catalogs may be offered and applied to different simulation or programming systems. Based on a standardized specification, SmartComponents, which are virtual representations of real components, enable the exchange of their full functionality between heterogeneous <b>engineering</b> <b>tools...</b>|$|R
