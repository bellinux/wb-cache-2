500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} narrates {{the story of}} a failed {{relationship}} which initially started off well. Clarkson regrets having allowed herself to be vulnerable to her ex-boyfriend and she is determined that despite the pain that she feels, he will not get the satisfaction of seeing <b>her</b> <b>cry.</b> Michael Paoletta of Billboard praised Clarkson's vocal, writing [...] "Clarkson simply delivers a loose, tour-de-force vocal that simmers alongside a steroid-charged musical backdrop that is fun, fast and furious." [...] Scott Juba of The Trade praised the production of the song, writing [...] "The song’s strong hook pulls listeners in and involves them in the lyrics without ever becoming gimmicky or manipulative." [...] He also complimented Clarkson's vocal which [...] "oscillates between pain and defiance with near pinpoint accuracy." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, McAdams starred with Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Bradley Cooper in {{the romantic}} comedy Wedding Crashers. McAdams played the {{daughter}} of an influential politician, who is caught in a love triangle with Wilson and Cooper's characters. McAdams listened repeatedly to Fleetwood Mac's 1975 song [...] "Landslide" [...] to prepare for emotional scenes and Wilson has said the song made <b>her</b> <b>cry</b> immediately: [...] "It was like turning on a faucet." [...] She trained for a sailing certification for a boating sequence because her character was said to be an accomplished sailor. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt McAdams [...] "makes the most of her underdeveloped character" [...] and [...] "grows more appealing with every new role". Brian Lowry of Variety found her [...] "a beguiling presence" [...] who [...] "actually creates a real character – a rarity for females in one of these lad-mag escapades". From a production budget of $40 million, the film grossed over $285 million worldwide.|$|E

Lyrically, [...] "Mi Novia Se Me Esta Poniendo Vieja" [...] revolves around how a son looks at their mother from a sentimental perspective, with Arjona singing [...] "She loves me either if i gor as a guerrilla, or I won the Nobel Prize for Peace / She does't care if i'm last or first, if i'm going as a conformist or as tenacious."

500|$|... "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Kelly Rowland, recorded for her third studio album, Here I Am (2011). It was written by Ester Dean and Lukasz [...] "Dr. Luke" [...] Gottwald, with lyrics reflecting the different perspectives on relationships and how one can perceive a relationship different from the outside. It opens with an electro-crescendo followed with vocals by Rowland while Emily Wright produced Rowland's vocals; the production is based upon layered synths and drums, programmed by Dr. Luke. Dean helped Rowland to record the song, which Rowland said made <b>her</b> <b>cry</b> as {{it reminded her of}} her own experiences in past relationships. [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] also had an effect on Rowland's vocals, causing them to swell. The song was serviced to rhythmic and contemporary hit radio on June 29, 2010.

500|$|The {{staff of}} Parks and Recreation {{conceived}} {{the idea that}} Ron Swanson had his birthdate redacted from all government documents early {{in the development of}} the series, and it eventually developed into the subplot featured in [...] "Eagleton" [...] where Leslie finds out about his birthday and plans a surprise for him. Michael Schur, co-creator of the series, said the scene when Leslie surprises Ron with a quiet evening alone was his favorite scene in the show. During the scene, Leslie and Ron declare their mutual admiration for one another. Schur said it was difficult to make such an outwardly emotional scene effective in a comedy, but he believed it ultimately worked because of Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman's strong performances. Poehler said of the scene: [...] "It's really sweet and it's just an example of how it's important to Leslie who she works with. It's just as important as the job itself. I completely relate to that." [...] Rashida Jones also praised the scene, which she said made <b>her</b> <b>cry</b> during a cast read-through of the script.|$|E

500|$|Further success came to Adams {{when she}} reteamed with David O. Russell {{in the crime}} film American Hustle, co-starring Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, and Jennifer Lawrence. Inspired by the 1970s Abscam scandal, the film {{featured}} Adams in the rare glamorous part of a seductive con artist, though she played it so that [...] "everything felt justified and it didn't feel like {{she was just a}} sexy sociopath". She collaborated closely with Bale to build their characters and made off-screen suggestions to Russell, including for a scene in which she is aggressively kissed on the lips by her lover's wife (played by Lawrence). The experience was grueling for Adams, who later admitted that Russell had been too hard on her and had made <b>her</b> <b>cry</b> frequently; she said that she regretted bringing such a negative experience home to her daughter. American Hustle was acclaimed by critics; Manohla Dargis of The New York Times believed that Adams [...] "goes deeper here than she's ever been allowed to" [...] and wrote that she had successfully [...] "turn an unpredictable character into a thrillingly wild one". She won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical and received her fifth Oscar nomination (her first for Best Actress). Her and American Hustle were deemed by critics to be among the best films of 2013, and they were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E

Lot's daughter Pelotit, the wife of a magnate of Sodom, saw a poor man on the street, and was moved with compassion. Every day when she went out to draw water, she smuggled all kinds of provisions to him from her house in her pitcher. The men of Sodom questioned how the poor man could survive.

A young man hears <b>her</b> <b>cry</b> and recognizes that the old man is his long-lost father, Timur, the deposed king of Tartary. The young Prince of Tartary is overjoyed at seeing Timur alive, but still urges Timur to not speak his name because he is afraid that the Chinese rulers, who have conquered Tartary, may kill or harm them. Timur then tells his son that, of all his servants, only Liù has remained faithful to him. When the Prince asks her why, she tells him that once, long ago in the palace, the Prince had smiled at her (Trio with chorus – The crowd, Liù, Prince of Tartary, Timur: Indietro, cani! – [...] "Back, dogs!").|$|E
