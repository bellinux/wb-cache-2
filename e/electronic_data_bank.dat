40|$|Abstract. ELETRONUCLEAR, a {{state-owned}} company responsible for design, construction, ownership {{and operation of}} nuclear power plants in Brazil, is applying systematic measures to preserve its essential technological know-how. A special Project called "Determination of Technological Know-How of ELETRONUCLEAR " was established in January 2001 for this purpose. The extent and location of the existing know-how was identified and the gaps in the essential know-how were evaluated. A multidisciplinary team was established to implement the Project. The team interacted with experts both in Brazil and abroad to achieve a sound technical basis as far as knowledge identification and preservation techniques are concerned. The results of this know-how survey were stored in an <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>bank,</b> which facilitated the creation of several types of reports, according to various criteria. An in-depth analysis of the survey pointed to the gaps in essential know-how. Proposals for solutions {{to fill in the}} know-how gaps were set up, comprising both short term, as well as long-term, solutions. This Project was the first work by ELETRONUCLEAR in the field of Knowledge Management. An indirect consequence was the creation of a nucleus of personnel competent in this new discipline, which had a multiplying effect throughout ELETRONUCLEAR, allowing the execution of other new projects in KM. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{answer to}} the {{question}} posed in this debate is both sim-ple and complex. The simple answer is, “Of course it does. ” In an era of quick-fix cures, biological reductionism, and alarming invasions of privacy by <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>banks</b> that store medical records, a consumer backlash has emerged. Psychoanalysts today are consulted by people who want to make meaning out of their lives. They want a setting where their unique sense of personhood can be recognized, listened to, and validated. They want to tell their own story at a pace that allows the complexity, conflict, and ambivalence of the human psyche to unfold in their own time and in their own idiosyncratic way. Moreover, in the US, many patients pay for psychoanalysis out of their pockets to avoid the compromises of confidentiality that accompany monitoring of treatment by third parties who work for insurance companies. In this regard, psychoanalysis can be considered the last bastion o...|$|R

40|$|Is a {{religious}} educational philosophy relevant or even viable in the postmodern world? Or is a postmodern religious educational philosophy an oxymoron? An incongruous contradiction of terms? These are the fundamental questions. The Postmodern Era Our postmodern era {{is characterized by}} globalization in business and politics, in fashion and entertainment, and in economics. The abrupt devaluation of the Thai baht, for example, and on another front, {{the collapse of the}} Russian ruble plunged the Brazilian real into a nose-dive and prompted the Federal Reserve to abruptly adjust U. S. interest rates. Suddenly we are jolted to the realization that we now live in a global village. Information dominance also characterizes the postmodern world.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{systematically}} review clinical studies examining the survival and success rates of implants placed with intraoral onlay autogenous bone grafts to answer the following question: do ridge augmentations procedures with intraoral onlay block bone grafts in conjunction with or prior to implant placement influence implant outcome when compared with a control group (guided bone regeneration, alveolar distraction, native bone or short dental implants.) ? Material and Method: An <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>banks</b> and hand searching were used to find relevant articles on vertical and lateral augmentation procedures performed with intraoral onlay block bone grafts for dental implant therapy published up to October 2013. Publications in English, on human subjects, with a controlled study design –involv- ing at least one group with defects treated with intraoral onlay block bone grafts, more than five patients and a minimum follow-up of 12 months after prosthetic loading were included. Two reviewers extracted the data. Results: A total of 6 studies met the inclusion criteria: 4 studies on horizontal augmentation and 2 studies on vertical augmentation. Intraoperative complications were not reported. Most common postsurgical complications included mainly mucosal dehiscences (4 studies), bone graft or membrane exposures (3 studies), complete failures of block grafts (2 studies) and neurosensory alterations (4 studies). For lateral augmentation procedures, implant survival rates ranged from 96. 9 % to 100 %, while for vertical augmentation they ranged from 89. 5 % to 100 %. None article studied the soft tissues healing. Conclusions: Survival and success rates of implants placed in horizontally and vertically resorbed edentulous ridges reconstructed with block bone grafts are similar to those of implants placed in native bone, in distracted sites or with guided bone regeneration. More surgical challenges and morbidity arise from vertical augmentations, thus short implants may be a feasible optio...|$|R
