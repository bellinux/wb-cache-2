5000|$|The AAA Foundation is also {{recognized}} {{as a leader in}} promoting the idea of Traffic Safety Culture; that is, a social climate in which traffic safety is highly valued and rigorously pursued. Since 2008, the AAA Foundation has published its annual Traffic Safety Culture Index in an effort to benchmark and track key indicators of the public's beliefs and attitudes toward highway safety. Information is collected through a nationally representative telephone survey that measures both attitudes and behaviors regarding, among other things, drinking and driving, cell phone use/texting behind the wheel, speeding, and seatbelt use. Additionally, the AAA Foundation partners with the Western Transportation Institute at Montana State University and other highway safety leaders to convene the annual National Summit for Rural Traffic Safety Culture. The Summit serves as a national gathering of transportation experts dedicated to improving safety on rural roadways, where fatality rates can be 2-3 times higher than they are on urban roads. [...] AAA Foundation projects have also been used to help strengthen laws, build public awareness of safety concerns and trends, and advise transportation agencies and highway departments on roadway improvement needs. For example, a 2006 report, Safety Impacts of Pavement Edge Drop-offs documented and analyzed the effects such drop-offs have on roadway departure crashes. The study was cited by the Federal Highway Administration's Office of Safety in its promotion of a cost-effective technology known as the Safety Edge, one of nine countermeasures FHWA considers proven to reduce motor vehicle crashes and improve safety. Other recent research includes a 2010 report, Parents, Teens and the Learner Stage of Graduated Driver Licensing, which found that despite the safety benefits seen as a result of implementing GDL laws, teen drivers may still not be getting sufficient supervised driving practice, and may not be getting enough experience driving under the range of conditions motorists face, such as during periods of inclement weather. The study received considerable news coverage, as did another 2010 report, Asleep at the Wheel: The Prevalence and Impact of Drowsy Driving, which found that drowsiness may be a bigger factor in crashes than previously believed. The study estimates that 16.5 percent of fatal crashes involve a <b>drowsy</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Driver in-alertness is an {{important}} cause for most accident related to the vehicles crashes. Driver fatigue resulting from sleep deprivation or sleep disorders is {{an important}} factor in the increasing number of the accidents on today’s roads. <b>Drowsy</b> <b>driver</b> warning system can form the basis of the system to possibly reduce the accidents related to driver’s drowsiness. The purpose of such a system is to perform detection of driver fatigue. By placing the camera inside the car, we can monitor the face of the driver and look for the eye-movements which indicate that the driver is no longer in condition to driver is no longer in condition to drive. In such a case, a warning signal should be issued. This paper describes how to find and track the eyes. We also describe a method that can determine if the eyes are open or closed. The main criterion of this system is that it must be highly non-intrusive and it should start when the ignition is turned on without having at the driver initiate the system. Nor should the driver be responsible for providing any feedback to the system. The system must also operate regardless of the texture and the color of the face. It must also be able to handle diverse condition such as changes in light, shadows, reflections etc. In given paper a <b>drowsy</b> <b>driver</b> warning system using image processing as well as accelerometer is proposed.

40|$|AbstractDriving is a {{very complex}} {{activity}} which requires the driver's full attention. Nowadays, the human factor is linked to the majority of accidents, and driver distraction is a principal cause. The objective of this project was to create an active safety system for testing with somnolent drivers in real driving conditions. The system we developed is composed of a GPS which checks the position and velocity of the vehicle continuously, a robot which decides with GPS data if the vehicle is being properly driven and an actuator over the brakes to stop the car if necessary. The robot takes control of the vehicle if it is not being driven correctly in order to prevent a possible accident. It was necessary to create a system which allowed the driver to handle the car without interfering with driving. Moreover, an environment closely representative of today's roads was created to make the driving experience more real. This included a circuit with bends or corners to check the capabilities or reactions of the driver. The main objective of the tests was to acquire behavioral and biomedical signals of the <b>drowsy</b> <b>drivers</b> while driving, but keeping them safe in a controlled environment. Therefore, the task of stopping the vehicle depended entirely on the system. Additionally, there were redundant devices which would stop the car to prevent an accident in the event of any failure of the primary system. The system developed in the project opens the doors to experimentation with <b>drowsy</b> <b>drivers,</b> in which there is the possibility of loss of control of the vehicle. It {{can also be used to}} increase safety at test track facilities or for other control applications in which safety is fundamental...|$|R

However, driving and road conditions related to steering wheel micro-corrections are not the same in simulators and real-world environment, for instance, driver’s risk perception is reduced in simulators, straight line does not always exist in road, and the width of roads and vehicles is variable and controls the extent of micro-corrections, the possibility to make steering wheel micro-corrections and their extent when there is an overtaking manoeuvre. In addition to that, these features are not specific to fatigue and can be caused by other impaired driving types such the influence of alcohol and drugs (Sahayadhas et al. 2012).

40|$|Advanced driver {{assistance}} systems, such as unintentional {{lane departure warning}} systems, have recently drawn much attention and R 2 ̆ 6 D efforts.

Furthermore, we developed a two-stage training scheme to improve SVM 2 ̆ 7 s prediction performance. Our SVMs were trained and tested using the experiment data generated by VIRTTEX, a hydraulically powered 6 -degrees-of-freedom moving base driving simulator at Ford Motor Company. The data represented 16 <b>drowsy</b> <b>drivers</b> (about three-hour driving time per subject) and six control drivers (approximately 20 minutes driving per subject), all of which drove a simulated 2000 Volvo S 80. More than 100 vehicle variables were sampled at 50 Hz. There were a total of 3, 508 unintentional lane departure occurrences for the 16 <b>drowsy</b> <b>drivers</b> and 23 for {{four of the six}} control drivers (two had none). We optimized the performances of the SVMs by experimentally finding their best kernel functions and parameter values as well as the most appropriate vehicle variables as their input variables. Our experiment results involving the 22 drivers with a total of over 6. 84 million prediction decisions demonstrate that: (1) the two-stage training scheme significantly outperformed the commonly used (one-stage) training scheme, (2) excellent SVM performances, as measured by numbers of false positives and false negatives, were achieved when the prediction horizon was set at 0. 6 s or shorter, (3) lateral position and lateral velocity served as the best input variables among the nine variable sets that we explored, and (4) the radical basis function was the best kernel function (the other two kernel functions that we tested were the linear function and the second-order polynomial). We conclude that the two-stage-training SVM approach deserves further exploration because {{to the best of our}} knowledge, it has demonstrated the best unintentional lane departure prediction performance relative to the literature...|$|R
