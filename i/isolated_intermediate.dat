5000|$|E4 - Termed the Janus {{intermediate}} {{after the}} Roman god of transitions, this intermediate is positioned after exactly {{half of the}} electron proton transfers and can either decay back to E0 or proceed with nitrogen binding and finish the catalytic cycle. This intermediate is proposed to contain the FeMo-co in its resting oxidation state with two bridging hydrides and two sulfur bonded protons. This intermediate was first observed using freeze quench techniques with a mutated protein in which residue 70, a valine amino acid, is replaced with isoleucine. This modification prevents substrate access to the FeMo-co. EPR characterization of this <b>isolated</b> <b>intermediate</b> shows a new species with a spin of ½. ENDOR experiments have provided insight into the structure of this intermediate, revealing the presence of two bridging hydrides. [...] 95Mo and 57Fe ENDOR show that the hydrides bridge between two iron centers. Cryoannealing of the trapped intermediate at -20 °C results in the successive loss of two hydrogen equivalents upon relaxation, proving that the <b>isolated</b> <b>intermediate</b> {{is consistent with the}} E4 state. The decay of E4 to E2 + H2 and finally to E0 and 2H2 has confirmed the EPR signal associated with the E2 intermediate.|$|E

Our results indicate that almost all T cells (greater than 98 %) express neither the high affinity IL- 2 receptor nor the functional intermediate affinity p 75 chain of the IL- 2 receptor without prior activation. In contrast, most NK cells constitutively express the <b>isolated</b> <b>intermediate</b> affinity p 75 IL- 2 receptor. In addition, a subpopulation of NK cells, distinguished by high density expression of the NKH 1 antigen, constitutively express the high affinity IL- 2 receptor, {{in addition to an}} excess of the <b>isolated</b> <b>intermediate</b> affinity p 75 IL- 2 receptor. These NKH 1 bright+ cells exhibit a brisk proliferative response to IL- 2, similar to that seen with antigen-activated T cells, yet do so {{in the absence of any}} known antigenic stimuli. No other resting peripheral blood lymphocyte population, including CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 20 cells, exhibits this property. The intermediate affinity p 75 IL- 2 receptor, as it exists in its isolated form on resting NK cells, does not transduce a growth signal equivalent to that seen in NK cells expressing the high affinity IL- 2 receptor, despite doses of IL- 2 that are known to fully saturate the isolated p 75 chain. This strongly suggests that additional structural or functional components are involved in generating the proliferative response following the binding of IL- 2 to the high affinity heterodimeric form of the IL- 2 receptor. The constitutive expression of this functional high affinity IL- 2 receptor on a small population of resting NK cells provides further evidence in support of a role for these cells in the host's early defense against viral infection or malignant transformation, before the more delayed but specific T cell response...|$|E

Gating currents were recorded from a double mutant of Shaker that was nonconducting (W 434 F mutation) and had the late gating transitions shifted to the right on the voltage axis (L 382 C mutation), thus separating the late transitions from the early ones. 4 AP applied to the double mutant blocked the final transition and made possible novel observations of the <b>isolated</b> <b>intermediate</b> transitions, the ones that immediately precede the final opening of the channel. These transitions, which have not been well characterized previously, produce a distinct fast component in the gating current tails. Two intermediate transitions contribute to the fast component and carry 23 % of the total gating charge. The effect of 4 AP is well modeled as a selective block of the final gating transition, which opens the channel. The final transition contributes ∼ 5 % of the total gating charge...|$|E
