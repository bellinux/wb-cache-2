So I braced my resolution to quit my dear ones, female and male, and forsook my home as birds forsake their nests. My parents being yet in the bonds of life, it weighed sorely upon me to part from them, and both they and I were afflicted with sorrow at this separation.|$|E
500|$|He remains {{interested}} {{in history and}} {{said in an interview}} with The Observer that [...] "I can see myself in a few years' time joining the National Trust and going round the odd castle. I think <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> that restful as the anger of middle-age sets in." [...] In his interview on Parkinson he stated that if he could go back in time to do one thing, it would be to go to the building of Stonehenge, to ask them [...] "why they were bothering". He is a cricket and snooker fan, and also plays the occasional game of squash and tennis. He is a user of Twitter, and does not drive. He is an agnostic.|$|E

[...] She kills the plants {{so that the}} vines bear no melons and the stalks bear no corn." [...] "Mother," [...] demanded , [...] "tell me where <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> the {{dwelling}} of [...]" [...] Changing Woman refused to answer. [...] But , The Wind, whispered, [...] "She lives high on the summet of , where the mountain sheep are." [...] Monster Slayer traveled to [...] and found a lean old woman sitting above the tree line without clothing, on the snow. [...] No roof sheltered her. [...] Her skin was pale as the snow. [...] "Grandmother," [...] said Monster Slayer, [...] "I am here to kill you." [...] "You may kill me," [...] said Cold Woman. [...] "But once I am dead, {{it will always be}} hot on the earth. [...] The land will dry up. [...] The springs will cease to flow. [...] Over the years the people will perish." [...] Listening to her words, [...] said, [...] "I will spare you." [...] And he returned without a trophy.|$|E

50|$|When papa died in 1957, {{three years}} later, I walked around his treasured gardens and the orchard. I looked {{again on the}} chance that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> just <b>find</b> my ring, papa’s gift to me, but it {{remained}} hidden.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> {{here one}} of my pawned schoolprizes. Stephano Dedalo, alumno optimo, palmam ferenti.|$|E
6000|$|... "I floated {{down the}} river to the mouth, beyond your lines, last night; and then worked round here. I thought <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Those sounds assured me,' he {{said calmly}} but kindly, as he advanced, 'that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> you here, on which I {{scarcely}} counted at so early an hour.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{thought it}} very likely {{you would have}} come back. We knew of course of your having been at Ricks. If I didn't find you <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>find</b> Mr. Vetch," [...] Mrs. Brigstock went on.|$|R
50|$|Well.... NNB {{never got}} far back then. Stefan made some instrunmental pieces, that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> still <b>find</b> on a MD (Minidisk) somewhere. But it wasn't until I met Vasi, that {{we picked up}} the name again - even though it might sound a bit funny still :).|$|R
6000|$|... "An' perhaps Jacob {{may be one}} of them!" [...] I cried, in an {{agony of}} apprehension, and from that moment it was not {{necessary}} the old soldier urge me forward, for I burned with the desire to do all <b>I</b> <b>might</b> to <b>find</b> our comrade before it should be too late.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I," [...] Macheson {{answered}} [...] "but {{you have}} crystallized your ideas into a cult, haven't you? <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> {{myself on the}} other side of the traces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> you dull, but I don't think I {{should find}} you ridiculous," [...] Katharine added, as if Denham had {{actually}} brought that charge against her family.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to take my man, Abdool, with me, Colonel," [...] Harry said, later on. [...] "He is a sharp fellow, and <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> him very useful." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{went with}} {{him to see the}} {{adventure}} out. I guessed the huts were some rough shelter where he and some more of these Beast People lived. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>find</b> them friendly, find some handle in their minds to take hold of. I did not know how far they had forgotten their human heritage.|$|R
6000|$|Trickery from without, by [...] "the cunning men," [...] is an {{explanation}} which, at least, provides a motive, but how the thing could be managed from without remains a mystery. Sam Wesley, the friend of Pope, and Atterbury, and Lord Oxford, not unjustly said: [...] "Wit, <b>I</b> fancy, <b>might</b> <b>find</b> many interpretations, but wisdom none". {220} ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{have the}} truth, then!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I {{brought you here}} {{to be alone with}} you, because I hoped that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> you a little kinder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If only I could collar one {{of their}} mustangs, and get away on it," [...] he thought. [...] "Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> those {{soldiers}} and have the Mexicans made prisoners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor would I {{want to be}} swindled," [...] smiled Matt. [...] "It wouldn't pay, and, besides, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> it a hard job to {{pay back}} what I had borrowed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it seems! But our {{employers}} expect results, not excuses." [...] Staffer {{paused and}} resumed: [...] "As {{you have been}} unlucky, <b>I</b> thought you <b>might</b> <b>find</b> some advantage in helping me with Dick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. If I {{could only}} {{find out the}} right Lea Farm, and get a man and horse to take me there--but my sister goes on Monday, and <b>I</b> <b>might</b> not <b>find</b> her, and nobody knows where it is. And nobody will take me in or hide my till the coach goes! Oh, {{what will become of}} me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is {{a convent}} not far off, <b>I</b> think. We <b>might</b> <b>find</b> shelter for you there. Yet they might break in. It {{might not be}} easy to meet. I believe you are safer with me. Will you trust in me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are rather}} full of hands," [...] he said slowly; [...] "but still <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> room for him. Have {{you had any}} {{business}} training?" [...] he continued, turning to Richard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, sir, I {{will get}} the constable at Reigate, who knows me well, to send me a suit. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> it {{difficult}} to get all the things I want here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--well---- You see I jest {{come down}} to--to---- I thought, perhaps, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> something, but it's time I was gettin' {{back to the}} fair, 'cause the folks will be needin' me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{condition}} of affairs, {{as you may}} imagine, grew more and more tedious and exasperating the older I became. Try as <b>I</b> <b>might,</b> <b>I</b> could <b>find</b> nothing to complain of. I once saw the son {{of one of our}} servants receive a flogging; and my heart grew light. I immediately begged my father to flog me, by way of variety; and he, who could refuse me nothing, at once consented. For this reason there was less satisfaction in the operation than I had expected, although for the time being it was a distinct novelty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Jeph, {{you don't}} {{need to be}} testy with your friend. I'll quit ye this moment if you bid me; but <b>I</b> think you <b>might</b> <b>find</b> a warmer and more fitting bed for your old bones than poor Mary Bax's grave. Come, {{let me help you}} up." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{very day}} I set out. For since the King {{was opposed to}} the affair, and knowing the drastic {{measures}} by which he was wont to enforce what he desired, I realized that did <b>I</b> linger he <b>might</b> <b>find</b> a way definitely to prevent my going.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! as thou sayest, Taurus Antinor, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> a dwarf or {{some kind}} of fool to suit me. Mine are getting old and dull. Ye gods, how they bore me at times!" ...|$|E
60|$|How d'you do, Mrs. Kent? I've {{been having}} an early lunch at Richmond, and I thought I'd just {{drop in on}} my way back. As it was Saturday {{afternoon}} I thought <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> you.|$|E
6000|$|... “I quite see that; {{and really}} I think I {{could not do}} better than pass a few years on a man-of-war, for after that I should be fit for any work <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> to do.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went back}} to my lodgings a little {{depressed}} in spirits. Three of the guests at the birthday dinner--and those three all exceptionally intelligent people--were out of my reach, at the very time when it was most important to be able to communicate with them. My last hopes now rested on Betteredge, and on the friends of the late Lady Verinder whom <b>I</b> <b>might</b> still <b>find</b> living in the neighbourhood of Rachel's country house.|$|R
60|$|Sleepily <b>I</b> {{thought we}} <b>might</b> <b>find</b> before many hours had passed {{that all the}} {{shooting}} {{was not to be}} done by us; but the idea was no more than in mind when my eyes closed again, and I was not conscious of the surroundings until Kenton shook me roughly.|$|R
60|$|He added, that I {{need not}} expect any light, trivial work, that was merely entertaining, and nothing more; but here I would find {{entertainment}} and edification beautifully and harmoniously combined; and though, at first, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> possibly <b>find</b> it dull, yet, if I perused the book thoroughly, it would soon discover hidden charms and unforeseen attractions; besides teaching me, perhaps, the true way {{to retrieve the}} poverty of my family, and again make them all well-to-do in the world.|$|R
