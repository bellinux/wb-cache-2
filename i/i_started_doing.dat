5|$|<b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> {{different}} charity events where I did {{a combination}} of 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E
500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{is known}} for her {{animated}} rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which {{has been compared to}} her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj [...] "a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones." [...] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: [...] "What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention." ...|$|E

5000|$|This was {{the second}} film {{directed}} by Juan Orol with his second film muse: the exuberant Cuban rumbera Rosa Carmina. The film was filmed shortly after her film debut in the film A Woman from the East. Rosa Carmina says: Begins to like my presence, my films are very successful. <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>doing</b> tours throughout Mexico. My dance number was the song wrote by Armando Valdez for the film: [...] "Bururu Manengue" [...] and {{it was based on}} pure drums.|$|R

500|$|... "WOW" [...] is an {{industrial}} dance song, and Manson has {{described it as}} a turning point for the album, explaining: [...] "The first half of the record is kind of bitter and angry, but there's a confidence that starts to rebuild itself [...] I wanted to do a song that represented who I am, and why <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> this in the first place." [...] Manson plays a one-stringed guitar on the song, which also features the sound of him [...] "snorting lines of something - whatever it might have been - as a percussion instrument." [...] In a review of the leaked demo, which was originally titled [...] "The WoW", James Gill of Metal Hammer described it as [...] "genuinely filthy and intensely sexy. [...] It doesn't have anything in the way of memorable hooks, but it's the sort of track that would sound amazing in a goth strip club... if one existed." [...] "Wight Spider" [...] is one of the heaviest songs on the album, and has been compared to the work of Mastodon. Metal Hammer also said of the track: [...] "whether conscious or not, what [...] learned from Trent Reznor is back: the track builds and builds without changing direction." [...] "Unkillable Monster" [...] is a down-tempo rock song which alternates between a quiet-verse and loud-chorus structure, and features layered, distorted vocals and guitars.|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was hugely {{successful}} upon its release on September 24, 1991. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'" [...] Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was [...] "too high, too far, too soon. Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it." [...] He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him [...] "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now." [...] Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism; however, [...] "by the age of twenty, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star." [...] He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning; according to the guitarist, [...] "it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going." [...] He was replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.|$|E
2500|$|It {{started in}} 1979 when I was racing in Denmark {{actually}} for a sex magazine called Rapport. They offered me 1,000 kroner if I would sing [...] "My Way". I had {{the words on}} a piece of paper but started two chords higher than I should have, and when the notes got too high, I had to stop. I started again, got through it, and it's gone on from there. The rate varies. I get 2,000 deutschmarks for one song in Munich. When <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> it regularly in about 1980, I would get 500 a night, and sometimes I'd sing on four nights.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{decided to}} change the name from Saints & Sinners to The Oracle and the reason being because <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> a lot of {{research}} on Saints & Sinners, and although I liked what it represented, it's been done before. I think Whitesnake had a record in 1982 or some like that, before which I wasn't that worried about because that's almost 30 years ago, but there has been some other artists, even Spanish albums that I found called Saints & Sinners in Spanish. With all that put together, I started rethinking the name, and then with the name Godsmack, and then the title being called Saints & Sinners, it was all feeling a little bit religious to me, and that really wasn't what this record represented..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blackwell {{first became}} {{interested}} in music through the influence of her fourth grade teacher, Nancy Notargiacomo, who eventually became her voice and piano teacher when she was 10. She also credits her high school choral director for encouraging her to pursue a music career. In a 2003 interview Blackwell recalled, [...] "I {{did not come from}} a musical family. I had a fourth grade teacher that introduced me to music and I sang at the Catholic church. In high school <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> musicals − The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Oliver!, and so forth. I thought maybe this would be what I would pursue after high school, although even in my {{senior year in high school}} I had doubts. I wanted to go into history or fashion design. But, I had a wonderful choral director who said 'no, your calling is music,' and she convinced me." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'When I'd go see Rush as a kid, I {{would wonder}} why Geddy Lee used one finger all the time. Did {{he do that}} because it {{made it easier to}} play while he was singing? I didn't get it. Later I {{realized}} that if you're just riding a note or trying to play a real straight part, it sounds more pulsating if you play with one finger. So I took every bass line and learned how to do it with one finger, and <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> it that way as much as I could. Back then I thought I looked goofy, but now here I am using one finger whenever I can. One finger is ultimately the funkiest sound of all. If you can do it with one finger, you should. If you can do it with two fingers, you should choose over three.' ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{an article}} {{published}} in The Times, the character of Edina was based on Lynne Franks. Franks believed Saunders had observed her and her children in detail after joining them on a family holiday. Josh Howie, Franks' son, reported that his mother was upset because one of her best friends [...] "had taken the piss out of her" [...] in a TV show. Saunders revealed in 2012 that she was also inspired by pop band Bananarama with whom she and Dawn French had become friends after their Comic Relief collaboration in 1989. [...] "The nights with Bananarama were some of the best nights of my life, and I got a lot of gags from Bananarama because they were big vodka drinkers...when <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> AbFab, I remembered all of the falls that I saw Bananarama do. [...] I once saw one of them coming out of a cab bottom first and hitting the road, and I thought 'that's class'.

2500|$|According to Stephen Shore's [...] "Factory: Andy Warhol," [...] "Andy and I {{were hanging}} around together. I had an {{apartment}} on the Lower East Side, where I had haircutting salons. Hundreds of people would come, and I’d be cutting someone's hair. Andy came. When he first started making films, he made films about what a person was famous for," [...] Billy, whose real name was William Linich Jr., and {{was the son of}} a barber, recalled. [...] "I was famous for giving haircuts, so he said, [...] "Would you let me do a film of you doing haircuts?" [...] I had covered my entire apartment in silver foil and painted everything silver. Andy said, [...] "Well, I just got a new loft would you do to it what you’ve done to your apartment?" [...] I said, [...] "Oh, sure, let's do it." [...] So, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>doing</b> it. I was a technician— I’d been a light designer for [...] the Judson Church. I also worked for some off-Broadway theater and avant-garde dance companies. I installed all the lighting at the Factory, all the sound systems." [...] In return for making over his loft, Warhol gave Name a new role within the Factory. [...] "I was into light and sound before, but not photography," [...] Name said. [...] "Andy had a still camera, but he had gotten the Bolex. He was going to start to do films, and he gave me the Pentax and said, [...] "Here, Billy, you do the still photography; I’m going to start making films." [...] I became the in-house photographer and was sort of like the foreman. Eventually I moved in." [...] Name and Warhol eventually became lovers, but the romantic aspect of their relationship slowly dissolved into mutual loyalty and admiration.|$|E
