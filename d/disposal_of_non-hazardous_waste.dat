40|$|ABSTRACT. Standard {{methods for}} {{assessing}} {{the environmental impact of}} waste management systems are needed to underpin the development and implementation f sustainable waste management practices. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an emerging tool for ensuring such assessment is comprehensive and covers the full "cradle to grave " impacts associated with providing a product or service. This paper discusses aspects of a recent study commissioned by the U. K. Department of the Environment to assess how LCA methodology could be developed and applied to assist decision makers in waste management. I focuses on a method developed by the research contractors for identifying the environmental burdens that occur during the collection, treatment and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> The method requires waste management activities to be defined as generic unit operations which are independent of the specific characteristics of the waste pro-cessed. These unit operations are used to flowsheet he specific system under study and burdens that are independent of the waste are identified. Waste-dependent burdens are identified separately by considering the interaction of unit opera-tions and the specific characteristics exhibited by the waste under study. For identification purposes a restricted list of 10 characteristics is considered sufficient o highlight those burdens for which inventory data may be required. Comment is made on the potential to develop the identification method to provide quantified ata for the burden inventory. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Lt...|$|E

Metodología: Se realizó una investigación cuantitativa y descriptiva que nos permitió hacer un análisis estadístico y describir los conocimientos, actitudes y prácticas que tiene Personal Profesional de Enfermería en la eliminación de los Desechos Hospitalarios. El universo fue 140 Enfermeras que laboran en las distintas áreas del Hospital Vicente Corral Moscoso. Resultados: Las(os) Enfermeras(os) Profesionales poseen conocimientos generales con relación a la gestión interna de la eliminación de desechos hospitalarios, además realizan prácticas positivas en la separación de los residuos al momento de desecharlos con porcentaje de 90 %.

The universe was 140 nurses that work in {{different areas of the}} Vicente Corral Moscoso Hospital. The instrument used was a form of questions; it was analyzed through Microsoft Excel 2010 program. Results: We assessed knowledge, attitudes and practices through polls reflected in tables and graphs, which determine the Professional Nursing Staff have general knowledges relative to internal management of the hospital waste disposal, a 98 % known adverse effects and a 100 % the health risk causing improper operation, also they have positive practices about the separating waste at the time of disposal with percentages of 100 % for sharps, the 98 % infectious and pathologic 84 %. Nevertheless, the majority of Professional Nursing Staff do not handle the new classification of Hospital Waste Disposal, because the Public Ministry of Health implemented a new regulation at 2014 and they benefited only 23 % of Staff because they say have been trained less than a year ago.

A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is here used for projecting future quantities <b>of</b> hazardous and <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> in Sweden to 2030. The effects of driving forces behind waste generation are illustrated {{by comparing the results}} of waste projections for a Baseline scenario and four alternative scenarios.

Waste generated in the scenarios, thus, relate to firms’ material input, output, employees, capital scrapping and fuel combustion as well as households’ consumption. The impact of economic growth in increasing the generation of nonhazardous and hazardous waste is apparent when comparing the growth of waste from 2006 to 2030 in the five scenarios.

Over a short time span, the survey of settlements may {{also contribute to the}} investigation of the biodegradation processes. This paper addresses secondary settlements of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), a heterogeneous and time-evolving material. An analysis of available experimental data from different pilots and the literature was conducted to quantify the influence of biodegradation on MSW secondary settlements. After making assumptions about the various features of the waste and their constitutive relationships, a one-dimensional biomechanical model to predict the secondary settlement has been developed. The determination of the total secondary settlement was obtained by the addition of two separate parts, the mechanical settlement, due to creep, and the biochemical settlement, due to the degradation of the organic matter. The latter has been evaluated based on the observed biogas production. Using the data from different recent large-scale experiments that provide a monitoring of biogas production, a method for predicting the biochemically-induced settlements is proposed and validated on these tests. The relative contributions of mechanical and biochemical settlements are also calculated and discussed as a function of waste pre-treatment and operation conditions (biological pre-treatment, shredding, leachate injection). Finally, settlement may be considered as a relevant indicator for the state of biodegradation...|$|R

A survey is conducted, and 507 respondents living within a 7. 0 kilometre radius from the landfill participated.

The level of agreement on ‘odour is a nuisance’ decreases with distance; that is, even respondents (1 %) who live within 6. 0 – 6. 9 km agree to this perception. A possible reason is that odour concentration is not only high at the origin/source, but also emanates from waste collection and transportation.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been {{increasing}} interest in minimizing analytical laboratory wastes. The driving forces behind this interest are the ever increasing costs and liabilities associated with waste disposal. Thus, many analytical laboratories, like the Defense Waste Processing Technology-Analytical Laboratory (DWPT-AL), located at the Savannah River Site (SRS), are looking into treating their own wastes. The DWPT-AL operates four laboratory modules that produce hazardous liquid effluents from the analytical instrumentation: Spectroscopy, Chromatography I, Chromatography II, and Wet Chemistry. The hazardous waste from these modules is being sent to SRS Waste Management {{at a cost of}} approximately $ 13, 000 per drum, which corresponds to approximately $ 325, 000 to $ 520, 000 per year.
