25|$|When Nintendo {{released}} the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately {{different from that}} of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero <b>insertion</b> <b>force.</b> When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.|$|E
25|$|The {{acetabular}} cup is {{the component}} which is placed into the acetabulum (hip socket). Cartilage and bone {{are removed from}} the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either UHMWPE (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is {{held in place by}} a metal coating {{on the outside of the}} cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are sintered beads and a foam metal design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and <b>insertion</b> <b>force.</b> Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a Morse taper.|$|E

40|$|AbstractInsertion of {{needle into}} tissue is {{influenced}} by the cutting edges and the needle tip geometry. In this paper, we aimed at investigating the relationship between the <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> and cutting edge geometry and general mathematical models of included and inclination angles for two different needle configurations. Two new geometries, one with parabolic cut and other with parabolic surface, cut with two bevel planes have been proposed along with the corresponding mathematical models to improve the cutting edge properties. Results show that parabolic needles after cutting with bevel planes have significantly improved cutting edge properties and are better than the other common needle configurations such as bevel cut. Simulation studies predicted that the deformation and stresses are slightly higher for proposed needle tip geometries than currently available topologies. However, the advantage of included and inclination angles reduce <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> thus optimization of medical needle design for the selected tip geometries is a trade-off between <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> and deflection in needle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} works, {{the authors}} showed that using robot-assisted steerable electrode array insertions can {{significantly reduce the}} <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> compared to non-steerable electrode arrays. In addition to steering the electrode array, {{it is possible to}} change its angle of approach with respect to the scala tympani. This paper focuses on determining the relevance of changing the angle of approach of the electrode array by comparing steerable electrode array inser-tions using a two Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) robot versus a four DoF robot. Optimal insertion path planning strategies are presented for both two and four DoF insertions. Simulation results and experiments show that the four DoF in-sertions can improve over two DoF insertions. Moreover, changing the angle of approach can further reduce the <b>insertion</b> <b>forces.</b> The simulation results also provide the workspace requirements for designing a custom parallel robot for robot-assisted cochlear implant surgery. ...|$|R

50|$|A normal {{integrated}} circuit (IC) socket requires the IC {{to be pushed}} into sprung contacts which then grip by friction. For an IC with hundreds of pins, the total <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> can be very large (hundreds of newtons), leading to a danger of damage to the device or the circuit board. Also, even with relatively small pin counts, each pin extraction is fairly awkward and carries a significant risk of bending pins, particularly if the person performing the extraction hasn't had much practice or if the board is crowded.

40|$|Abstract—Cochlear {{electrode}} insertion is {{a challenging}} manual procedure. One technique requires the physician {{to coordinate the}} motions of an electrode array approximately 1 mm in diameter and the smaller stylet within it, using miniature forceps. A new minimally invasive access technique precludes forceps insertion because the electrode must travel through a small-diameter drilled hole to reach the cochlear access point. To address this, we present an automated insertion tool. This second generation device not only enables deployment in the minimally invasive setting, but also makes insertion velocity profiles repeatable and can sense <b>insertion</b> <b>forces.</b> Force sensing is essential because <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> can indicate impending damage to cochlear membranes, but are below the thresholds that can be sensed by human hands.

The objective was also to evaluate the main underlying mechanism of IUD expulsion. Methods: We compared known IUD <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> for “framed” devices with known perforation forces in vitro (hysterectomy specimens) and known IUD removal forces and calculated a range of possible intrauterine forces using pressure and surface area. These were compared with known perforation <b>forces.</b> Results: IUD <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> range from 1. 5 N to 6. 5 N. Removal forces range from 1 N to 5. 8 N and fracture forces from 8. 7 N to 30 N depending upon device. Measured perforation forces are from 20 N to 54 N, and calculations show the uterus is capable of generating up to 50 N of myometrial force depending on internal pressure and surface area. Conclusion: Primary perforation with conventional framed IUDs may occur if the insertion pressure exceeds the perforation resistance of the uterine fundus. This is more likely to occur if the front end of the inserter/IUD is narrow, the passage through the cervix is difficult, and the procedure is complex. IUD embedment and secondary perforation and IUD expulsion may be due to imbalance between the size of the IUD and that of the uterine cavity, causing production of asymmetrical uterine forces. The uterine muscle seems capable of generating enough force to cause an IUD to perforate the myometrium provided it is applied asymmetrically. A physical theory for IUD expulsion and secondary IUD perforation is given.

However, the response due to complex tool-tissue interactions can differ depending on the phantom and no comprehensive comparative study has been published to date, which could aid researchers to select suitable materials.
