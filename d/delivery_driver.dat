500|$|Thomas Lawton {{was born}} on 6 October 1919 to Elizabeth Riley and Thomas Lawton senior in Farnworth, Lancashire. His father was a railway {{signalman}} of Irish extraction, and his mother worked as a weaver at Harrowby Mill. His father left the family 18 months after Lawton was born, and Elizabeth moved back into her parents' home in Bolton. Elizabeth's father, James Hugh [...] "Jim" [...] Riley, became Lawton's surrogate father. Lawton's natural footballing ability earned him {{a place on the}} Bolton Town Schools team in 1930. He was picked by Lancashire Schools at the age of 13. Despite scoring a hat-trick in a trial game for England Schoolboys, he never earned a full England Schoolboy cap. At the age of 14 he began playing for Hayes Athletic in the Bolton Senior League, and went on to score 570 goals in three seasons. The FA's rules meant he was unable to turn professional at a club until he was 17, and Lawton's grandfather rejected Bolton Wanderers's offer for Lawton to work as a <b>delivery</b> <b>driver</b> for two years before turning professional at the club. Lawton instead played as an amateur for Rossendale United in the Lancashire Combination, scoring a hat-trick on his debut against Bacup. He took up temporary work at a tannery, and then joined Burnley as assistant groundsman after his mother rejected an offer from Sheffield Wednesday as she objected to him travelling to Sheffield on a daily basis.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Identifying and prioritising {{effective}} {{service delivery}} drivers' in selected civil construction companies {{are more than}} merely satisfying customers' need. By successfully identifying and prioritising effective service <b>delivery</b> <b>drivers</b> within the selected civil construction companies, the companies {{will be able to}} achieve competitive advantage above their competitors. This study, by using a questionnaire as a measurement instrument, established that a gap currently exist between what civil construction companies, their employees and their customers regards as effective service <b>delivery</b> <b>drivers</b> within the civil construction industry. By closing this gap, the civil construction companies will be able to generate or maximise profits for their shareholders as there will be common understanding of the level of performance to meet the customer's expectations. The company will also have engaged employees as they would know what is expected from them on a daily basis. The study further highlights the benefits of managing these identified service <b>delivery</b> <b>drivers</b> and elaborate on the factors needed to successfully manage a service level agreement between a civil construction company and their customers. Civil construction companies however will have to revisit these drivers on a continuous basis as client satisfaction is associated with continuous improvement, permanent assessment of service <b>delivery</b> <b>drivers</b> and the service delivery standards. In essence, {{there are still a lot}} of challenges and opportunities when it comes to quality service <b>delivery</b> <b>drivers</b> in the civil construction industry. Each company needs to conduct a SWOT analysis to evaluate their competitiveness within the industry. Master...|$|R
