500|$|After {{nearly two}} years of beta testing, Dota 2 was officially {{released}} on Steam for Microsoft Windows on July 9, 2013, and later for OS X and Linux on July 18, 2013. The game did not launch with every hero from Defense of the Ancients. Instead, the missing ones were added in various post-release updates, with the final one from the mod, {{as well as the}} first original hero, being added in 2016. Two months following the game's release, Newell claimed that updates to Dota 2 generated up to three percent of global internet traffic. In December 2013, the final restrictions against unlimited global access to Dota 2 were lifted after the game's infrastructure and servers were substantially bolstered. In order to abide by the standards set by the economic legislation of specific countries, Valve opted to contract with nationally based developers for publishing. In October 2012, the leading Beijing-based video game publisher, Perfect World, announced the acquisition of the exclusive rights of Dota 2 in China. The Chinese version also has a region-specific [...] "Low Violence" [...] mode, which censors and changes most depictions of blood, gore, and skulls in order for the game to follow censorship policies of the country. In November 2012, a similar publishing deal was made with the Tokyo-based company Nexon to distribute and market the game in South Korea and Japan. In November 2015, Nexon announced they would no longer be operating servers for Dota 2, allowing Valve to take over <b>direct</b> <b>distribution</b> and marketing of the game in those regions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{cellular}} embedding of an Eulerian digraph D into {{a closed}} surface {{is said to}} be directed if the boundary of each face is a directed closed walk in D. The directed genus polynomial of an Eulerian digraph D is the polynomial ΓD(x) = h≥ 0 gh(D) x h where gh(D) is the number of directed embeddings into the orientable surface Sh, of genus h, for h = 0, 1, [...] The sequence {gh(D) |h ≥ 0 }, which is called the <b>directed</b> genus <b>distribution</b> of the digraph D, is known for very few classes of graphs, compared to the genus distribution of a graph. This paper introduces a variety of methods for calculating the <b>directed</b> genus <b>distributions</b> of Eulerian digraphs. We use them to derive an explicit formula for the <b>directed</b> genus <b>distribution</b> of any 4 -regular outerplanar digraph. We show that the <b>directed</b> genus <b>distribution</b> of such a digraph is determined by the red-blue star decompositions of the characteristic tree for an outerplanar embedding. The <b>directed</b> genus <b>distribution</b> of a 4 -regular outerplanar digraph is proved to be log-concave, which is consistent with an affirmative answer to a question of Bonnington, et al. [2]. Indeed, the corresponding genus polynomial is real-rooted. We introduce Eulerian splitting at a vertex of a digraph, and we prove a splitting theorem for digraph embedding distributions that is analogous to the splitting theorem for (undirected) graph embedding distributions. This new splitting theorem allows conversion of the enumeration of embeddings of a digraph with vertex degrees larger than 4 into a problem of enumerating the embeddings of some 4 -regular digraphs. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} discloses a <b>direct</b> current <b>distribution</b> circuit which comprises two {{direct current}} voltage sources, three distribution wires and a voltage conversion device, wherein the two voltage sources are respectively used for outputting a first voltage {{and a second}} voltage. Each distribution wire comprises neutral lines which are simultaneously connected with one end of each voltage source and a first electrical level wire and a second electrical level wire, wherein the first electrical level wire and the second electrical level wire are respectively connected with {{the other end of}} each voltage source. The voltage conversion device is connected with the first electrical level wire and/or the second electrical level wire to be used for producing different voltage combinations based on conversion of the first voltage and/or the second voltage.
