5|$|The {{ability to}} enforce the treaty was <b>dubious.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>dubious</b> hadrosaurid Stephanosaurus marginatus was {{considered}} a possible species of Kritosaurus, following the synonymy of Gryposaurus with Kritosaurus. However, this synonymy was rejected in the 2004 edition of the Dinosauria, with Stephanosaurus being tabulated as <b>dubious.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{federal investigation}} into the incident found that the error coins had been struck accidentally, but two former Mint employees were guilty of selling some of the dollars, resulting in imprisonment and fines for both individuals. In 2002, Mint officials announced {{that two of the}} ten coins then reported had entered circulation through legal channels, but the other eight were of <b>dubious</b> origins and might be seized. However, as of 2011, the federal government has not attempted to seize the eight examples considered of <b>dubious</b> origin.|$|E
5|$|David Norman has {{suggested}} that I. bernissartensis includes the <b>dubious</b> Mongolian I. orientalis (see also below), but {{this has not been}} followed by other researchers.|$|E
5|$|Edward Herrmann as Raymond Massey: Distinguished {{actor who}} portrays Dean's screen father on East of Eden. Massey is <b>dubious</b> over James' method acting.|$|E
5|$|I. albinus (or Albisaurus scutifer), {{described}} by Czech palaeontologist Antonin Fritsch in 1893, is a <b>dubious</b> nondinosaurian reptile {{now known as}} Albisaurus albinus.|$|E
5|$|Sony Pictures was <b>dubious</b> over Stone's {{choice of}} Crowe {{because he was}} not a famous actor in the mid-1990s. To cast Gene Hackman in the role of Herod, TriStar Pictures changed the {{shooting}} location from Durango, Mexico to Tucson, Arizona. Sam Rockwell auditioned for The Kid, a role which ended up going to Leonardo DiCaprio. Sony was also <b>dubious</b> over DiCaprio's casting. As a result, Stone decided to pay for the actor's salary herself.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} several species {{left over from}} the synonymizations of Creosaurus and Labrosaurus with Allosaurus. Creosaurus potens was named by Lull in 1911 for a {{vertebra}} from the Early Cretaceous of Maryland. It is now regarded as a <b>dubious</b> theropod. Labrosaurus stechowi, described in 1920 by Janensch based on isolated Ceratosaurus-like teeth from the Tendaguru beds of Tanzania, Although Donald F. Glut listed it as a species of Allosaurus, it is now considered a <b>dubious</b> ceratosaurian related to Ceratosaurus. L. sulcatus, named by Marsh in 1896 for a Morrison theropod tooth, which like L. stechowi is now regarded as a <b>dubious</b> Ceratosaurus-like ceratosaur.|$|E
5|$|A public {{unveiling}} {{took place}} at Union Station in Chicago on October 11, 1979, followed by a short trip over the Burlington Northern Railroad to Lisle. The following day, the Shawnee had the <b>dubious</b> distinction of the first Superliner accident, a minor collision with an Illinois Central Gulf Railroad freight train.|$|E
5|$|Albertosaurus periculosus, Tyrannosaurus luanchuanensis, Tyrannosaurus turpanensis and Chingkankousaurus fragilis were {{considered}} synonyms of Tarbosaurus {{in the second}} edition of the Dinosauria, but Chingkankousaurus has been assessed as <b>dubious</b> by Brusatte et al. (2013).|$|E
5|$|Although {{at least}} some of the poems {{attributed}} to Narihira in imperial anthologies are <b>dubious,</b> there is a large enough body of his work contained in the relatively reliable KokinshÅ« for scholars to discuss Narihira's poetic style. Narihira made use of engo (related words) and kakekotoba (pivot words).|$|E
5|$|Denver {{submitted}} the winning bid {{to host the}} 1976 Winter Olympics but subsequently withdrew, giving it the <b>dubious</b> {{distinction of being the}} only city to back out after having won its bid to host the Olympics. Denver and Colorado Springs hosted the 1962 World Ice Hockey Championships.|$|E
5|$|I. gracilis, {{named by}} Lydekker in 1888 as the type species of Sphenospondylus and {{assigned}} to Iguanodon in 1969 by Rodney Steel, {{has been suggested}} to be a synonym of Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis, but is considered <b>dubious</b> nowadays.|$|E
5|$|Roshan Seth as Chattar Lal: The Prime Minister of the Maharaja of Pankot. Chattar, also a Thuggee worshiper, is enchanted by Indy, Willie and Short Round's arrival, but is {{offended}} by Indy's {{questioning of the}} palace's history and the archaeologist's own <b>dubious</b> past.|$|E
5|$|The {{assumption}} that John of Lydus' figure of 390,000 for the Diocletian's army {{refers to the}} beginning of that emperor's reign is <b>dubious</b> as it would seem more natural for the chronicler to report the army's peak strength under that emperor.|$|E
5|$|A related {{objection}} is {{that evolution}} {{is based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution {{is likely to be}} overturned as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and <b>dubious.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old Boy could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were <b>dubious.</b> The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against <b>dubious</b> bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} consideration for Napoleon {{was that a}} French victory might cause French speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution. Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of <b>dubious</b> quality and loyalty, {{and most of the}} British veterans of the Peninsular War had been sent to North America to fight in the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter. But he also noted that such estimates depend on many <b>dubious</b> assumptions.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as <b>dubious.</b>|$|E
5|$|I. mantelli {{described}} by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in 1832, {{was based on}} the same material as I. anglicus and is an objective junior synonym of the latter. Several taxa, including the holotype of Dollodon and Mantellodon, but also the <b>dubious</b> hadrosauroid Trachodon cantabrigiensis the hypsilophodont Hypsilophodon, and Valdosaurus, were previously mis-assigned to I. mantelli.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} centuries after Alexander's death, {{probably}} in Alexandria, {{a quantity of}} the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the Alexander Romance, later falsely ascribed to Callisthenes and therefore known as Pseudo-Callisthenes. This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages, containing many <b>dubious</b> stories, and was translated into numerous languages.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{corrected}} the subgroups of Thyreophora. He placed Acanthopholididae, Stegosauridae and Ceratopsidae together inside the group. Five years later, he corrected {{the name of}} the family to Acanthopholidae, which is now the correct spelling. In the same publication, he also changed the genera included. He assigned Hylaeosaurus, Stegoceras, Struthiosaurus, and Troodon inside it but moved Stegopelta and Ankylosaurus into the family Ankylosauridae. Nopcsa then downgraded the phylogenetic rank of Acanthopholidae to make it a subfamily inside Nodosauridae. The clade was defined to include Ankylosaurus and Acanthopholinae. Inside Acanthopholinae he placed Acanthopholis, Hylaeosaurus, Rhodanosaurus, Struthiosaurus, and Troodon. Now considered as an artificial grouping, it was defined to include dinosaur taxa now considered to be polacanthids, a pachycephalosaur and Acanthopholis, a genus that is widely considered to be <b>dubious.</b> Acanthopholidae and Acanthopholinae are now <b>dubious</b> groups since the validity of Acanthopholis has changed.|$|E
5|$|Kaspersky's prior {{work for}} the Russian {{military}} and his education at a KGB-sponsored technical college has led to controversy about whether he uses his position to advance Russian government interests and intelligence efforts. According to Kaspersky, allegations of <b>dubious</b> connections with Russian agencies began after {{he got his first}} clients in America. He spends much of his working life trying to get governments and organizations to trust him and his software in spite of the allegations.|$|E
5|$|Mindomys hammondi {{is known}} only from Ecuador, where {{it occurs in}} montane forest; a record from the Amazon basin {{lowlands}} is <b>dubious.</b> Reportedly, it lives {{on the ground and}} is associated with water; other suggest it lives in trees. A large, long-tailed, and long-whiskered rat, its fur is buff above and abruptly lighter below. The front part of the skull (rostrum) is heavily built.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 2017, for {{the second}} {{consecutive}} year, the Mariners were knocked out of the FFA Cup by a state league team in the first round, after losing 3-2 to Blacktown City. This gave the Mariners the <b>dubious</b> honour of being the first A-League team to have been knocked out twice in the FFA Cup by state league opposition.|$|E
5|$|Other portraits {{include one}} by William Nicholson dating from 1814 in which Bewick sits {{with a pencil}} {{in his hand and}} a dog beside his chair; the one at his birthplace; and the {{full-length}} seated portrait of 1827 by Thomas Sword Good (see above). Another painting by Sword in the National Portrait Gallery is now no longer thought to be of Bewick. An unsigned painting supposedly of him in the Yale Center for British Art is equally <b>dubious.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Martinique macaw {{is one of}} {{thirteen}} extinct macaw species that have been proposed to {{have lived in the}} Caribbean islands. Many of these species are now considered <b>dubious</b> because only three are known from physical remains, and there are no extant endemic macaws on the islands today. Macaws were frequently transported between the Caribbean islands and the South American mainland in both prehistoric and historic times, so {{it is impossible to know}} whether contemporaneous reports refer to imported or native species.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene parrot {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1674, and live specimens were later brought to Europe, {{where they lived}} in captivity. The species was scientifically described in 1771. Only two stuffed specimens exist today, in Paris and Vienna. The date and cause of extinction for the Mascarene parrot is unclear. The latest account from 1834 is considered <b>dubious,</b> so {{it is probable that}} the species became extinct prior to 1800, and may have become extinct in the wild even earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Germanicus in <b>dubious</b> {{circumstances}} greatly affected Tiberius' popularity in Rome, {{leading to the}} creation of a climate of fear in Rome itself. Also suspected of connivance in his death was Tiberius' chief advisor, Sejanus, who would, in the 20s, create an atmosphere of fear in Roman noble and administrative circles by the use of treason trials and the role of delatores, or informers.|$|E
5|$|The {{disorders}} {{were not}} {{the product of a}} revolutionary plot, but Crispi chose to believe otherwise. On the basis of <b>dubious</b> documents and reports, Crispi claimed that there was an organised conspiracy to separate Sicily from Italy; the leaders of the Fasci conspired with the clerics and were financed by French gold, and war and invasion were looming.|$|E
5|$|There are two subspecies, {{which are}} highly similar and of <b>dubious</b> validity. The {{nominate}} subspecies S. n. nigrescens occurs on the Pacific coastal region from British Columbia to northern California, while S. n. halseii, described by Giraud in 1841, occupies the inland parts of its range. S. n. halseii birds are slightly {{larger and more}} gray in their upperparts.|$|E
5|$|These factors {{combined}} with what RF politicians and supporters saw as British decadence, chicanery and betrayal {{to create the}} case they put forward that UDI, while <b>dubious</b> legally and likely to provoke international uproar, might nevertheless be in their eyes justifiable and necessary {{for the good of}} the country and region if an accommodation could not be found with Whitehall.|$|E
5|$|Thirty poems {{attributed}} to Narihira {{were included in}} the early 10th-century KokinshÅ«, and many more in later anthologies, but the attributions are <b>dubious.</b> Ki no Tsurayuki mentioned Narihira in his kana preface to the KokinshÅ« as one of the Six Poetic Geniusesâimportant poets of an earlier age. He was also included in Fujiwara no KintÅ's later Thirty-Six Poetic Geniuses.|$|E
5|$|A.Ã cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some <b>dubious</b> collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At the time it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|Another species {{complex in}} Attalea {{includes}} A.speciosa and related species. Henderson (1995) recognised A.speciosa and A.spectabilis, considering {{the latter to}} either be an acaulescent form of A.speciosa or a hybrid between it and A.microcarpa. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted A.spectabilis, but Glassman considered it a <b>dubious</b> taxon. Attalea vitrivir was recognised as a distinct species by Michael Balick and coauthors; Glassman and Govaerts and Dransfield concurred, but Henderson considered it part of A.speciosa. Glassman also described a fourth member of this group, A.brejinhoensis, and it is accepted by Govaerts and Dransfield.|$|E
