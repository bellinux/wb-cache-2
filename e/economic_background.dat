500|$|Few {{aspects of}} Cofresí's life and {{relationships}} have avoided the romanticism surrounding pirates in popular culture. During his life, attempts by Spanish authorities to portray {{him as a}} menacing figure by emphasizing his role as [...] "pirate lord" [...] and nicknaming him the [...] "terror of the seas" [...] planted him in the collective consciousness. This, combined with his boldness, transformed Cofresí into a swashbuckler differing from late-19th-century fictional accounts of pirates. The legends are inconsistent in their depiction of historical facts, often contradicting each other.

She believed that the book especially shone in depicting the South Sea Bubble; [...] "most historical writers," [...] Schaaf opined, [...] "neglect the <b>economic</b> <b>background</b> of their periods, regardless of its importance, and [...] grasp of a complicated situation makes it as fascinating as her descriptions of the sexual behavior of the upper and lower classes." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Koht {{completed}} the dissertation Bonde mot borgar i nynorsk historie, {{in which he}} further developed his theories {{on the role of}} the farmers in history. Published in the journal Historisk Tidsskrift in 1912, it featured an elaboration on Koht's theory about class and the nation. According to Koht, the community of the nation was expanded in a democratic way when the agrarian movement, then the labour movement, both rose from political passivity to demand a place in the political and national sphere. He wrote about this in the 1910 article Norsk folkesamling as well. The book Norsk bondereisning, published in 1926 as a compilation of Koht's presented material in his university lectures, represented the culmination of Koht's work on the topic of class conflict between the agrarian and the urban population. Koht argued that the peasant movement had abandoned the cause of class interest in favour of universal rights and social reforms. The same perspective had to be applied to the struggle of the labour movement, Koht maintained. An <b>economic</b> <b>background</b> for the farmers' rising was presented in 1912, in Priser og politikk i norsk historie, originally a lecture for the second Norwegian conference of historians. This lecture was also where his historical materialism came to fruition. In 1951 he stated that he [...] "has never thought that the theories could be foundational for a political or social uprising".|$|E

500|$|Scholar Yolanda M. Manora {{insisted that}} three women in Caged Bird—the [...] "hybridized mother" [...] of Angelou's {{grandmother}}, her mother, {{and her friend}} Mrs. Flowers—taught her {{how to be a}} mother to her son Guy. Although Angelou's grandmother died early in the series, in her third autobiography Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, Angelou quoted her many times throughout the series. Angelou's desire for security for Guy drove her to marry Tosh Angelos in Singin' and Swingin, and drove many of her decisions, job choices, and romantic relationships. Scholar Siphokazi Koyana stated that due to Angelou's race and <b>economic</b> <b>background,</b> her [...] "experience of motherhood is inseparably intertwined with work". [...] According to Koyana, [...] "...Black motherhood always encompassed work". Angelou's long list of occupations attested to the challenges, especially in her second autobiography Gather Together in My Name, she faced as a working teenager mother, which often led Angelou to questionable decisions. [...] Koyana stated that it was not until Angelou was {{able to take advantage of}} opportunities, such as her role in Porgy and Bess, when she was able to fully support her and Guy, and the quality of her life and her contribution to society improved. [...] It was impossible, however, for Angelou to become successful without her extended family to provide childcare for her; i.e., when she left Guy in the care of his grandmother in spite of the conflict and guilt she experienced as a result (something Koyana insisted was imposed on her by the larger society), a pattern established in Caged Bird by her own mother when she left Angelou and her brother in the care of Angelou's grandmother.|$|E
