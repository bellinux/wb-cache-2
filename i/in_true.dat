5|$|Maeser {{believed}} that religion {{played a key}} role <b>in</b> <b>true</b> education. He viewed each student as a child of God that had an individual capacity and potential. He thought that all schools should adhere to some religious aspect. He also argued that public high schools should be supplemented by religion classes. Maeser, however, was respectful of other religious denominations although Brigham Young Academy and Brigham Young University integrated beliefs from the LDS Church.|$|E

5|$|The {{advent of}} {{photosynthesis}} in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the sun's energy {{to be harvested}} to create conditions allowing for more complex life. The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and {{gave rise to the}} ozone layer. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting <b>in</b> <b>true</b> multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The early Buddhist texts {{describe}} meditative {{practices and}} states, {{some of which}} the Buddha borrowed from the śramaṇa tradition. The Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate {{for the purposes of}} controlling hunger or the mind, depending on the passage. However, {{there is no mention of}} the tongue being inserted into the nasopharynx as <b>in</b> <b>true</b> khecarī mudrā. The Buddha used a posture where pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, similar to even modern postures used to stimulate Kundalini.|$|E
5|$|Harrelson was the season's next {{significant}} casting choice, {{brought on}} to play Hart at McConaughey's request. Harrelson stated that he joined True Detective partly {{because he wanted to}} work with certain people involved in the project, with whom he had previously collaborated in the 2012 HBO film Game Change. Michelle Monaghan agreed to play the season's female lead, Maggie, because she felt compelled by the direction of the plot and her character's story arc. Michael Potts and Tory Kittles completed the principal cast, playing detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania, respectively. Major supporting roles <b>in</b> <b>True</b> Detective first season include Kevin Dunn as Major Ken Quesada, Alexandra Daddario as Lisa Tragnetti, and Brad Carter as Charlie Lange.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} several {{environmental and}} developmental influences on trypsin inhibitor (TI) activity in leaves of young Brassica napus seedlings {{in a series}} of greenhouse experiments. In seedlings of B. napus cv. Westar, TI activity is constitutively present and exhibits a rise then fall through time <b>in</b> the first <b>true</b> leaves of young plants. TI activity is induced by wounding <b>in</b> the first <b>true</b> leaves, but the degree of induction is relatively insensitive to the degree of wounding over a gradient of 5 – 15 % of leaf area damage. TI activity is enhanced <b>in</b> first <b>true</b> leaves of plants in which the cotyledons have been wounded relative to plants in which the cotyledons have not been wounded. TI activity is also enhanced <b>in</b> the second <b>true</b> leaves on plants in which the first true leaves have been wounded. The degree of systemic induction <b>in</b> second <b>true</b> leaves declines additively with plant age, but local induction <b>in</b> the first <b>true</b> leaves is not affected by age. In B. napus cv. Gido, TI activity is constitutively present but is not locally wound-inducible <b>in</b> first <b>true</b> leaves of young plants exposed to the same wounding gradient as cv. Westar. In unwounded plants at the six-leaf stage, TI activity is higher <b>in</b> second <b>true</b> leaves than <b>in</b> fifth <b>true</b> leaves, indicating that TI activity is developmentally regulated in this cultivar...|$|R

5|$|Hoffman {{appeared}} in 55 films and one miniseries during his screen career spanning 22 years. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for Capote (2005), and was nominated three times for Best Supporting Actor for Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Doubt (2008), and The Master (2012). He also received five Golden Globe Award nominations (winning one), five BAFTA Award nominations (winning one), four Screen Actors Guild Awards (winning one), {{and won the}} Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival. Hoffman remained active in theater throughout his career, starring in ten and directing 19 stage productions (predominantly in New York). He received three Tony Award nominations for his Broadway performances: two for Best Leading Actor, <b>in</b> <b>True</b> West (2000) and Death of a Salesman (2012), and one for Best Featured Actor in Long Day's Journey into Night (2003).|$|E
5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen <b>in</b> <b>true</b> lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|The Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista in Ragusa Superiore {{was built}} between 1718 and 1778. Its {{principal}} façade is pure Baroque, containing fine carvings and sculptures. The cathedral {{has a high}} Sicilian belfry in the same style. The ornate Baroque interior is separated into three colonnaded aisles (Illustration 3). Ragusa Superiore, the most badly damaged part of the town, was replanned following 1693 around the cathedral and displays an unusual phenomenon of Sicilian Baroque: the palazzi here are peculiar to this town, of only two storeys and long, with the central bay only emphasised by a balcony and an arch to the inner garden. This very Portuguese style, probably designed to minimise damage in future earthquakes, {{is very different from}} the palazzi in Ragusa Ibla, which are <b>in</b> <b>true</b> Sicilian style. Unusually, Baroque lingered on here until the early 19th century. The last palazzo built here was in the Baroque form but with columns of Roman Doric and neoclassical balconies.|$|E

5|$|The Noronha skink {{is covered}} with light and dark spots above, but there is {{substantial}} variation in the precise colors. There are no longitudinal stripes. The scales on the underparts are yellowish or grayish. The eyelids are white to yellow. It has a small head with small nostrils, which are placed far to the front {{at the sides of}} the head. The mouth contains small and conical teeth and a thin but well-developed tongue. The eyes are small and placed laterally and contain dark, rounded irises. There are three to five well-developed auricular lobules (small projections) in front of the ears; these lobules are absent <b>in</b> <b>true</b> Mabuya. The hindlimbs are longer and stronger than the forelimbs, which are small. The tail is longer than the body and is muscular but very brittle. It is nearly cylindrical in form and tapers towards the end.|$|E
5|$|The {{upgraded}} engine offered better {{speed efficiency}} and new graphical features. While both the original Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider II used a grid system where developers could build the levels {{with a set}} of blocks, Tomb Raider IIIs system incorporated triangular polygons, allowing developers to achieve greater detail and more complex architectural structures. The triangles also allowed developers to implement the game's quicksand and rippling water features. The dynamic lighting system was improved with coloured lighting and better water reflection, making Tomb Raider III more atmospheric than its predecessors. The team also implemented new weather effects such as rain, snow, and wind. The game features more particle effects, offering more realistic explosions and smoke. All the textures used in the game were drawn <b>in</b> <b>true</b> colour before being rendered by the graphics engine, resulting in a better output quality.|$|E
