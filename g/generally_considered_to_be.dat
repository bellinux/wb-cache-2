5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It {{has been suggested that}} CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, although none of the protein components are orthologous.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} planets around a pulsar, PSR B1257+12. This discovery is <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first definitive detection of a planetary system around another star. Then, on October 6, 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the Geneva Observatory {{announced the}} first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star (51 Pegasi).|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{has been}} {{politically}} conservative {{for much of}} its history, especially recently. During the first half century of statehood, it was considered a Democratic stronghold, being carried by the Republican Party in only two presidential elections (1920 and 1928).

However, Oklahoma Democrats were <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more conservative than Democrats in other states.|$|E

5|$|The {{work has}} {{developed}} a reputation as an essential one for aspiring violin virtuosi to conquer. This has led to its becoming virtually ubiquitous in the discography of concert violinists, even including those who were only active at the very dawn of recorded sound and of whom very little recorded music exists, such as Eugène Ysaÿe. Even so, it remains technically challenging and is <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as difficult as many other famous counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the beast are rare, {{as it is}} not <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} there was a growing {{movement}} to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government, and convince them to view domestic films, which were <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions. This was blamed, in part, on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew. As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in Asmara Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions.|$|E
5|$|By 494 BC the Persian {{army and}} navy had regrouped, {{and they made}} {{straight}} for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea, but was decisively beaten at the Battle of Lade, after the defection of the Samians. Miletus was then besieged, captured, and its population was brought under Persian rule. This double defeat effectively ended the revolt, and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result. The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia which was <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> both just and fair.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{campaigns are}} <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a main force behind major {{historical}} societal changes for women's rights, {{particularly in the}} West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender neutrality in English, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), {{and the right to}} enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims because men are also harmed by traditional gender roles.|$|E

The British government supplied the Iranians with materials for chemical weapons {{in order to gain}} intelligence on Iran's military programme. Tomlinson's description of his Iranian activities are <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true, due to his personal involvement and knowledge of details that only an insider would know.|$|E

In Canada, Yellow Submarine topped the RPM national albums chart for two weeks, ending the White Album's 12-week run at number 1. On America's Billboard Top LPs chart, it was kept from the top by the same album.|$|E
5|$|In early 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} two planets orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257+12.
