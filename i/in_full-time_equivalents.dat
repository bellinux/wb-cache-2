40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the time veterinary graduates spend {{in private practice}} and in veterinary work generally, and to determine what factors influence this. METHODS: Questionnaires were completed in the sixth year after graduation by 119 veterinarians {{who had participated in}} this longitudinal study since starting the veterinary course, and the data were analysed using the SAS System for Windows. RESULTS: Of those who started the veterinary course, 90 % graduated and 96 % of these then entered private practice. Five years later 94 % (73 % <b>in</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalents)</b> were working as veterinarians, and 64 % (50 % <b>in</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalents)</b> were still in private practice in Australia. Hours, attitudes of principals and clients, and inadequate rewards were the main reasons for leaving private practice. The likelihood of being still in private practice was greater for those who had had significant responsibility for animals before they entered the course, but it was not related to geographical origin (city vs country), age at entry or gender. Women were, however, {{more likely than men to}} be working part time as veterinarians. Predictions of veterinary working life were not affected by geographical origin or by previous experience with animals or on farms, but men expected to work longer than women. CONCLUSION: The average veterinary career, estimated by veterinarians who graduated 5 years earlier, is 24 years <b>in</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalents</b> for men, and 16 years for women.

We estimate that the average skill of workers declined by 1. 8 % over the period, reflecting strong employment growth for workers with lower than average skill levels. The net decline was the combined effect of a 3. 6 % decline in unobserved skill outweighing a 1. 8 % increase in observed skill, resulting in 1. 8 % slower estimated skill-adjusted labour growth (13. 3 %) than the 15. 0 % growth <b>in</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> (FTE) employment.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} positive growth differential Austria has had over Germany since the early 1990 s. While German output growth was dampened {{in the aftermath of}} unification, the Austrian economy benefited from a number of positive oneoff shocks in the 1990 s. Austria has been able {{to make the most of}} the opening up of Eastern Europe and witnessed a surge in productivity following EU accession. Moreover, given the predominance of small and medium-sized businesses in Austria, outsourcing abroad was much less of a problem for Austrian employees than for German employees. Finally, Germany saw a marked drop <b>in</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> employment, which <b>in</b> turn adversely affected consumption and investment. While fiscal policies were not instrumental in generating growth differentials in the 1990 s, they have played a role since 2002, as Austria, unlike Germany, has pursued an expansionary fiscal policy course. Differences in the wage-setting process and in corporate taxation provide very little, if any, explanation for the growth differential. Thus, Austria’s positive growth differential basically reflects asymmetric one-off shocks with an effect on current GDP levels rather than on the longterm growth rate. Hence, once the effects of these one-off shocks have subsided, the growth differential is likely to shrink. Austria, Germany, growth differentials...|$|R

40|$|Specifying {{the labour}} theory {{of value in}} a way that distinguishes both {{productive}} from unproductive labour, and production workers from supervisory workers, this paper considers distributive shares in the US economy between 1964 and 2001. Trends in productive and unproductive labour are explored <b>in</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalents,</b> hours and money. After 1979, there was a large shift of money value (not matched by a shift in either hours or employment) from the wages paid to productive labour to those paid to supervisory labour. Since the wage share in money value added of non-supervisory labour in unproductive sectors was approximately constant, the 1980 s and 1990 s also saw the profits share squeezed by the rising wage share of supervisory workers. Some implications of this are explored in the construction of a class rather than a factor approach to distributive shares. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E

The {{increase in the}} number of persons in need of long-term care from its current level of 2. 25 million to a forecast level of 2. 9 million by 2020 will mean that professional long-term care in particular will continue to become more significant in Germany as a whole.

So it is not sure that the {{female labor force}} participation measured by the number of hours worked still increases. Subsequently the difference between men and women may not be reducing any more. The aim {{of this paper is to}} answer some of these questions. To do this we carry out a cohort analysis. The data are the enquêtes Emploi 1982 - 2002. For each cohort of women (born in a given year) we estimate an "average participation rate between 25 and 59 years old. We propose several definitions of participation according to whether it includes or not unemployment and part-time. We then compare the rates of the different cohorts and measure thus the growth of the female participation over time. The main results are as follows. The participation of the women (in employment or unemployment) does continue to grow. As a consequence the gap between men and women continues to reduce. But if unemployment and partial time are taken into account the participation no more increases: other things being equal the generation 1965 - 1970 will have the same participation rate (<b>in</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalent)</b> as the generation 1955 - 1960.

30|$|To {{the extent}} possible, {{systematic}} variance in additional determinants of innovative output {{that do not}} result from the staffing pattern should therefore be controlled for. In particular, other determinants of firms’ innovative output that are also related to the staffing strategies and/or the growth and dominance regimes could cause—if they are not considered—an omitted variable bias. As additional determinants of firm-level innovative productivity, we therefore account for the following set of observable controls (Wagner 2008; Criscuolo et al. 2010): First, large firms {{are more likely to}} introduce or generate a new product than smaller firms, but if smaller firms do, the turnover share realized through innovations is higher than for their larger counterparts (Strotmann and Mathes 2005, p. 11). Firm size is accounted for by the average number of employees expressed <b>in</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalents</b> for the respective establishment and year. Similarly, in some studies, firm age {{has been found to be}} negatively correlated to the probability to innovate in a study by Huergo and Jaumandreu (2004); however, other studies have found no effect (McGahan and Silverman 2001; Wagner 2008).

30|$|When all jobs {{subject to}} STW would be {{suppressed}} {{in the absence}} of STW and all job losers would become unemployed, one would expect the sum of the coefficients on the interaction terms between output growth and take-up to approach one. However, this is unlikely to be the case in practice for several reasons. First, STW is a form of work-sharing and, consequently, not all jobs subject to STW are at risk. It is more appropriate, therefore, to focus on the full-time equivalent of the number of STW participants. Assuming an average reduction in working time of about 10 %, as suggested by Hijzen and Venn (2010), one would expect the sum of the coefficients on the interaction terms between output growth and take-up to approach 0.25. Second, not all jobs supported by STW, even when expressed <b>in</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalents,</b> might be suppressed {{in the absence of}} STW due to the role of deadweight effects. Third, not all workers that would have lost their job in the absence of STW would have become unemployed. Some might have found another job quickly, whereas others might have decided to leave the labour force. Assuming that the generosity of STW and unemployment benefits is similar as well as the duration of STW and unemployment, one would expect the fiscal balance associated with STW to be negative. While the first assumption seems reasonable (see Hijzen and Venn, 2010), this is less obvious for the second. The fiscal balance of STW may turn positive if the expected duration of unemployment exceeds that of STW.|$|E
