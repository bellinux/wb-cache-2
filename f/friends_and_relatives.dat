On {{his way back to}} the United States, Costello had a stop over in Detroit, Michigan, where he met Cleo Williams. The two fell in love and married shortly afterwards, remaining together for the rest of Costello’s life.|$|E
5|$|After the lynching, <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> of the Driscolls {{attempted}} {{to strike back}} at the Regulators. They obtained an indictment against many of the Regulators charging them with murder. The Regulators responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against every person who had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E

5|$|Among the Selfe family {{papers in}} Mitchell Library {{there is a}} large {{collection}} of postcards featuring bridges from across the world. Some were sent to Selfe by <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> from Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and Switzerland. Others, un-postmarked, were collected on his travels in 1884-85. These would have formed a research catalogue of contemporary international bridge-building practices for Selfe's own designs.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang music {{generally}} {{could be}} found as the social entertainment at a host of different occasions. It is used during large feasts, festive/harvest gatherings, for entertainment of visiting <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives,</b> and at parades. Kulintang music also accompanies ceremonies marking significant life events, such as weddings and returnees from the Hajj. Kulintang music also {{plays a significant role}} during state functions, used during official celebrations, entertaining of foreign dignitaries and important visitors of distant lands, court ceremonies of either the sultanate or village chieftains, enthroning/coronations of a new leader and the transferral of a sultanate from one family to another.|$|E
5|$|Robie Mortin {{came forward}} as a {{survivor}} during this time; {{she was the}} only one added to the list who could prove she lived in Rosewood in 1923, totaling nine survivors who were compensated. Gaining compensation changed some families, whose members began to fight among themselves. Some descendants refused it, while others went into hiding to avoid the press of <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> who came asking for handouts. Some descendants, after dividing the funds among siblings, received not much more than $100 each. Later, the Florida Department of Education set up the Rosewood Family Scholarship Fund for Rosewood descendants and ethnic minorities.|$|E

5|$|The week-long holiday of Passover in {{the spring}} commemorates the Exodus from Egypt, and in Israel is usually a time for visiting <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives,</b> travelling, and {{on the first night}} of Passover, the {{traditional}} ritual dinner, known as the Seder. Foods containing ḥametz– leaven or yeast– may not be eaten during Passover. This means bread, pastries and certain fermented beverages, such as beer, cannot be consumed. Ashkenazim also do not eat legumes, known as kitniyot. Over the centuries, Jewish cooks have developed dishes using alternative ingredients and this characterizes Passover food in Israel today.|$|E
5|$|Theodore Synadenos was {{a son of}} the megas stratopedarches John Synadenos and Theodora Palaiologina, the niece of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282), {{and hence}} {{a member of the}} Byzantine Empire's highest aristocracy. He had a {{probably}} older brother also named John, and at least one sister, Euphrosyne. Little is known about his early life: he was born circa 1277, apparently at Bizye on the Black Sea coast of Thrace, where he had a palatial residence, extensive estates and many <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{the paparazzi}} taking {{photographs}} of her wherever they could, Winehouse obtained an injunction against a leading paparazzi agency, Big Pictures, under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; the resultant court order {{issued by the}} High Court in 2009 banned them from following her. Photographers were also banned from following her within 100 metres of her London home and photographing Winehouse in her home or the homes of her <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives.</b> According to a newspaper report, {{sources close to the}} singer said legal action was taken out of concern for the safety of Winehouse and those close to her.|$|E
60|$|Willy's {{loyalty to}} Mrs. Cliff {{prompted}} {{her to put}} her in as good a light as possible before this man of the world, and her own self-esteem prompted her to show that, being a <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> of this rich lady, she was not ignorant of her affairs in life.|$|R

60|$|Foy {{admired his}} cousin {{as much as}} did his half-brother, but his {{attitude}} towards her was very different. He never said sweet things; he never gazed up into her eyes and sighed, although once or twice, perhaps by accident, he did squeeze her hand. His demeanour towards her {{was that of a}} <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>relative,</b> <b>and</b> the subject of their talk for the most part was the possibility of her father's deliverance from the dangers which surrounded him, and other matters of the sort.|$|R
5|$|As {{he served}} his {{sentence}} in the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, friends and family continued to occupy some of Vick's other homes in the South Beach section of Miami Beach, Florida. In June 2008, when Vick's brother, Marcus, was arrested and jailed in Norfolk after a police chase, he listed his residence as a $1.39 million home owned by Vick in an exclusive riverfront community in Suffolk, Virginia. Construction of a new riverfront home took place on land Vick owned in another exclusive section of Suffolk. His attorneys later estimated that he was spending $30,000 a month to support seven <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives,</b> including his mother and brother, three children, and their mothers.|$|E
5|$|Boyce was a multi-millionaire by {{the early}} 1900s and by 1909 became more {{interested}} in civic affairs and less in finance. He also began to travel, often as part of hunting expeditions. He leased hunting lodges at Fort Sisseton, South Dakota, where he had hunted as a young man. He often hosted <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives,</b> especially his son, for activities such as hunting, fishing, dinner, poker, and plentiful liquor. These changes {{may have been in}} part caused by the destruction of his Ottawa mansion by fire in early 1908, which was soon rebuilt, followed three months later by the sale of his Marseilles paper mill due to a new law that prevented railroads from negotiating with shippers, and his September 1908 announcement that he and his wife, Mary Jane, were separating.|$|E
5|$|In Edinburgh, Born {{promoted}} {{the teaching of}} mathematical physics. He had two German assistants, E. Walter Kellermann and Klaus Fuchs, and together they continued to investigate the mysterious behaviour of electrons. Born became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1937, and of the Royal Society of London in March 1939. During 1939, he got as many of his remaining <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> still in Germany as he could out of the country, including his sister Käthe, in-laws Kurt and Marga, and the daughters of his friend Heinrich Rausch von Traubenberg. Hedi ran a domestic bureau, placing young Jewish women in jobs. Born received his certificate of naturalisation as a British subject on 31 August 1939, one day before the Second World War broke out in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{probably}} first cousin to Gregory of Nazianzus, and {{was brought up}} in the peculiarly religious atmosphere of the Christian aristocracy of his native province. He studied law in Antioch with Libanius, practised at Constantinople, but soon retired to lead a religious life in the vicinity of his <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>relative,</b> the [...] "theologian" [...] of Nazianzus.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{companies}} in the Arab world rarely have a 'no-nepotism' policy in place, so one can often find a workforce with <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>relatives</b> {{who may or may}} not be qualified. This takes place in both the public and private sectors.|$|R
50|$|Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus (died 66 AD), Roman senator, {{lived in}} the 1st century AD. Notable for his principled {{opposition}} to the emperor Nero and his interest in Stoicism, he was the husband of Arria the daughter of A. Caecina Paetus and the elder Arria, father-in-law of Helvidius Priscus, <b>and</b> a <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> by marriage of the poet Persius.|$|R
5|$|More widely, 1936 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the Great Terror, in which many of the composer's <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> were imprisoned or killed. These included his patron Marshal Tukhachevsky (shot months after his arrest); his brother-in-law Vsevolod Frederiks (a distinguished physicist, who was eventually released but died before he got home); his close friend Nikolai Zhilyayev (a musicologist who had taught Tukhachevsky; shot shortly after his arrest); his mother-in-law, the astronomer Sofiya Mikhaylovna Varzar (sent to a camp in Karaganda); his friend the Marxist writer Galina Serebryakova (20 years in camps); his uncle Maxim Kostrykin (died); and his colleagues Boris Kornilov and Adrian Piotrovsky (executed). His only consolation in this period was the birth of his daughter Galina in 1936; his son Maxim was born two years later.|$|E
5|$|The Memorial {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} some families of officers {{killed in the}} line of duty, regarding the high cost, and that the roll of honour lists only those officers killed during arrests or as a result of criminal acts, rather than all officers killed {{in the line of}} duty; also that, with the book being behind glass, <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> of the deceased are not able to view the relevant page. Before construction, objections were also raised to the Memorial's construction by the London Historical Parks Group and the local residents' association. Concern was also raised by some Irish republicans that the Memorial includes the names of those RUC officers killed in The Troubles.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, {{hoping it would}} aid his recovery, but it did not. Doctors disagreed on {{the cause of his}} illness, with diagnoses ranging from typhus fever to stomach ailments. He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared for the journey, he collapsed in pain and had to be helped back inside. <b>Friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband's death that she went blind from her incessant crying. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery.|$|E
