25|$|The use of {{melamine}} as fertilizer for crops {{had been}} envisaged during the 1950s and 1960s {{because of its}} high nitrogen content (2/3).

60|$|Nelly {{was about}} twelve years old, {{and her life}} in the woods had given her a courage and quickness beyond her years. Without wasting a moment on cries or lamentations, she sprang back into the canoe. Harold took his place beside her, and the light craft darted rapidly out into the lake. Not until he was some three or four hundred yards from the shore did Harold pause to look round. Then, when he felt he was out of gunshot distance, he ceased paddling. The fight was raging now around the house; from loop-holes and turret the white puffs of smoke darted angrily out. The fire had not been ineffectual, for several dark forms could be seen lying round the stockade, and the bulk of the Indians, foiled in their attempt to carry the place at a rush, had taken shelter in the corn and kept up a {{scattering}} fire round the house, broken only on the side facing the lake, where there was no <b>growing</b> <b>crop</b> to afford them shelter.|$|E

40|$|The {{designation}} “new crop ” may {{be applied}} to virtually any useful plant that in some respect is new. The following categories of newness (which are not all mutually exclusive) are economically important in discussing new crops: (1) gathering new wild crops from nature; (2) cultivating an undomesticated plant not previously grown; (3) domesticating (changing genetically) an undomesticated plant; (4) breeding improved cultivars of domesticated plants; (5) <b>growing</b> <b>crops</b> in new areas; (6) <b>growing</b> <b>crops</b> for new uses; (7) <b>growing</b> <b>crops</b> with new management techniques; (8) selling crops in new markets...|$|R

6000|$|The {{country was}} {{inhabited}} by the Pequot Indians, a tall, well-proportioned, and active tribe, {{belonging to the}} great Iroquois nation. They set up their wigwams of bark, around which their squaws cultivated the rapidly <b>growing</b> <b>crop</b> of maize while the men hunted the buffalo and deer, and returning with their spoil, required every imaginable service from their heavily-oppressed women, while they themselves deemed the slightest exertion, except in war and hunting, beneath their dignity. Their nature had much that was high and noble; and in those days {{had not yet been}} ruined either by the White man's vices or his cruelty. They were neither the outcast savages nor the abject inferiors that two hundred years have rendered their descendants, but far better realized the description in Longfellow's [...] "Hiawatha," [...] of the magnificently grave, imperturbably patient savage, the slave of his word, and hospitable to the most scrupulous extent. It was in mercy and tenderness that the character was the most deficient. The whole European instinct of forbearance and respect to woman was utterly wanting,--the squaws were the most degraded of slaves; and to the captive the most barbarous cruelty was shown. Experience has shown that there is something {{in the nature of the}} Red Indian which makes him very slow of being able to endure civilization, renders wandering almost a necessity to his constitution, and generally makes him, when under restraint, even under the most favourable conditions, dwindle away, lose all his fine natural endowments, and become an abject and often a vicious being. The misfortune has been that, with a few honourable exceptions, it has not been within the power of the better and more thoughtful portion of man to change the Red Indian's vague belief in his [...] "Great Spirit" [...] to a more systematic and stringent acceptance of other eternal verities and their consequent obligations, and at the same time leave him free to lead the roving life of the patriarchs of old; since, as Scripture itself shows us, it takes many generations to train the wandering hunter to a tiller of the soil, or a dweller in cities; and the shock to the wild man of a sudden change is almost always fatal both to mental and bodily health. This conclusion, however, has been a matter of slow and sad experience, often confused by the wretched effects of the vice, barbarity, and avarice of the settler and seaman, which in many cases have counteracted the effects of the missionary, and accelerated the extinction of the native.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{valuation}} of <b>growing</b> <b>crops</b> is problematic {{partly due to}} weather conditions. 2011 showed that of all cultivated crops 42 % were autumn sown which makes up {{a significant proportion of}} the total arable land in Sweden. This presented an opportunity to investigate more closely the methods and options used in the inventory {{valuation of}} biological assets.   Problem: What options are there in the valuation of own-produced inventory specifically in the form of <b>growing</b> <b>crops?</b>   Objective: This study's aim is to create an increased understanding of an agricultural company's options for inventory valuation of biological assets. In the survey of the options this study has found two main categories: rule-and principle-based accounting.   Methods: A qualitative study with an abductive approach. Three interviews were conducted, one with the tax authority and two with specialist expertise in agriculture.   Results: The study shows that current regulations do {{not take into account the}} valuation of <b>growing</b> <b>crops,</b> however according to generally accepted accounting principles which advocate the matching principle where expenses shall be recognised along with the related revenues in the same accounting year, apply.   Key words: Inventory valuation, grain stock, <b>growing</b> <b>crops,</b> produced stock, financial statements, financial accounting, <b>growing</b> <b>crops,</b> work in progress.

50|$|There {{are four}} major routes through which {{pesticides}} reach the water: it may drift {{outside of the}} intended area when it is sprayed, it may percolate, or leach, through the soil, it may be carried to the water as runoff, {{or it may be}} spilled, for example accidentally or through neglect. They may also be carried to water by eroding soil. Factors that affect a pesticide's ability to contaminate water include its water solubility, the distance from an application site to a body of water, weather, soil type, presence of a <b>growing</b> <b>crop,</b> and the method used to apply the chemical.|$|E
50|$|Field {{cultivators}} {{are used}} to complete tillage operations in many types of arable crop fields. The main function of the field cultivator is to prepare a proper seedbed for the crop to be planted into, to bury crop residue in the soil (helping to warm the soil before planting), to control weeds, and to mix and incorporate the soil to ensure the <b>growing</b> <b>crop</b> has enough water and nutrients to grow well during the growing season. The implement has many shanks mounted {{on the underside of}} a metal frame, and small narrow rods {{at the rear of the}} machine that smooth out the soil surface for easier travel later when planting. In most field cultivators, one-to-many hydraulic cylinders raise and lower the implement and control its depth.|$|E

50|$|Natural {{features}} like the bicycle-friendly Texas Hill Country, limestone rock formations, and generally mild climate {{work with the}} centrally located Lady Bird Lake Hike and Bike Trail, and local pools like Barton Springs to make Austin the home of several endurance and multi-sport races and communities.

The Austin-founded American Swimming Association hosts an open water swimming event, the Cap 2 K, and other closed-course, open water, and cable swim races around town. Austin is also the hometown of several cycling groups and the former seven-time Tour de France champion cyclist Lance Armstrong, as well as environmentally and economically minded bicycle commuters.
