5|$|In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is {{a series}} of future events, {{including}} a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors. Ragnarök is an important event in Norse mythology, and {{has been the subject of}} scholarly <b>discourse</b> <b>and</b> theory throughout the history of Germanic studies.|$|E
5|$|Like other Ojibwe dialects, Ottawa grammar {{includes}} animate and inanimate noun gender, subclasses of verbs {{that are}} dependent upon gender, combinations of prefixes and suffixes that are connected with particular verb subclasses, and complex patterns of word formation.

5|$|Njörðr {{has been}} the subject of an amount of {{scholarly}} <b>discourse</b> <b>and</b> theory, often connecting him with the figure of the much earlier attested Germanic goddess Nerthus, the hero Hadingus, and theorizing on his formerly more prominent place in Norse paganism due to the appearance of his name in numerous place names.

5|$|Since the {{publication}} of From Bakunin to Lacan in 2001, {{there have been several}} attempts to develop an account of postanarchism that, while retaining many of Newman's specific conceptions of the anarchistic qualities of radical post-structuralist thought, would take postanarchist theory beyond academic <b>discourse</b> <b>and</b> into broader and more diverse environments, as the originator of postanarchism, Hakim Bey, had intended.|$|E

5|$|During the Japanese colonial era, Japanese {{settlers}} mainly used Japanese {{in their}} daily <b>discourse,</b> <b>and</b> Japanese was the lingua franca used for communication between Japanese and Palauans. English was also recognised as a co-official language along with Japanese, and many Japanese had at least some knowledge of the language as well. People of mixed Japanese-Palauan heritage were more competent in Japanese than to Palauan, especially those who attended mainstream primary schools. The Japanese also introduced {{the use of the}} Katakana script in Palauan, which was also used in informal settings. After the Japanese surrender, the use of Japanese was discouraged in place of Palauan and English. Most Japanese-Palauans use Palauan {{in their daily}} discourse in favour of Japanese or English, although Japanese was used more frequently among Japanese-Palauans than to those that do not have Japanese ancestry. As the number of Japanese tourists increased during the 1990s, Japanese was introduced as an elective subject to Palauan schools and in elections.|$|E

5|$|In Norse mythology, Þorgerðr Hǫlgabrúðr (Thorgerdr Holgabrudr) and Irpa are divine figures. Þorgerðr and Irpa appear {{together}} in Jómsvíkinga saga, Njáls saga and Þorleifs þáttr jarlsskálds. Irpa {{does not appear}} outside of these four attestations, but Þorgerðr also appears in the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál, Færeyinga saga, and Harðar saga ok Hólmverja and is mentioned in Ketils saga hœngs. Þorgerðr Hǫlgabrúðr is particularly associated with Haakon Sigurdsson (d. 995), and, in Jómsvíkinga saga and Þorleifs þáttr jarlsskálds, she and Irpa are described as sisters. The roles of the Þorgerðr Hǫlgabrúðr and Irpa in these sources, {{and the implications of}} their names, has resulted in an amount of scholarly <b>discourse</b> <b>and</b> theory.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by Keynes, {{economics}} {{texts in}} the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money, devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management {{and in particular the}} 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, {{since the end of the}} Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics <b>discourse</b> <b>and</b> Keynes' insights have slipped from view. They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the fabric of}} authorized discourses about Information Technology (IT), i. e. of “organizing visions” (OVs), through {{the investigation of the}} <b>discourses,</b> practices, <b>and</b> sociomaterial contexts that make up their micro-social underpinnings. The case of a trade show allows us to explore the production of everyday <b>discourses</b> <b>and</b> practices about IT by gathering many of the parties involved in the fabric of organizing visions. Through a combination of direct observations, interviews, pictures, documents and a survey, we identify and analyze a number of micro-social practices related to the fabric of IT discourses. The trade show we studied was not a context in which new IT buzzwords and concepts emerged, but, rather, it was a setting where existing discourses about IT were repeated, refreshed, and materialized. Our three main findings reveal intriguing relationships between practices, <b>discourses,</b> <b>and</b> sociomaterial contexts: (1) practices and artifacts contribute to enclose the production of discourses; (2) practices <b>and</b> <b>discourses</b> aim at refining and updating an existing <b>discourse</b> about IT; <b>and</b> (3) many actors in the trade shows engage in <b>discourses</b> <b>and</b> practices that materialize the IT artifact. This research adds to the conceptualization of the dynamics of OVs through {{a better understanding of how}} they are affected by the relationships between the <b>discourses</b> <b>and</b> practices of multiple actors and by the sociomaterial context in which they take place. It draws several strategic implications concerning the dynamics of OVs at the industry level, how actors influence the fabric of OVs, as well as the roles and combination of artifacts, <b>discourses</b> <b>and</b> practices to build OVs...|$|R

5|$|The {{interior}} of the church has nineteen stained glass windows, three behind the altar and eight along {{each side of the}} church building. The windows behind the altar focus on St. Joseph and depict, from right to left, the sojourn of the Holy Family in Egypt; the daily lives of the Holy Family; and the death of Joseph. Four of the sixteen windows {{on the sides of the}} church (those closest to the altar and those closest to the doors) depict lilies. The remaining twelve windows each depict a single saint, including Ignatius of Loyola, Stanislaus Kostka, and Saint Cecilia. Further ornamentation of the walls includes carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross as well as twelve triforiums holding paintings illustrating the Lord's Prayer, the Bread of Life <b>Discourse,</b> <b>and</b> praise to Christ and Mary. On top of the altar, at the eastern end of the church, is a tabernacle. The altar, imported from Germany in 1880, is decorated with statues of Abraham, Peter, Paul, and Melchizedek.|$|E
