5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied {{to the point where it}} had an entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran <b>into</b> <b>problems</b> because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to rework the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which made it easy to overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries manorial homes, {{including}} Cranham Hall, became attractive {{properties for}} merchants from the City of London. Initial attempts {{to expand the}} suburban estates from Upminster in the early 20th century ran <b>into</b> <b>problems</b> {{because of the lack}} of water supply. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. In the 1930s land was used to develop some council housing and following the sale of the Benyon estate the pace of new building quickened. Cranham's location on the very edge of London's urban sprawl is explained by the halting effect on suburban house building of the introduction of the Metropolitan Green Belt and World War II. Thereafter building took place within the area bounded by the Southend Arterial Road in the north and St Mary's Lane in the south; and there were 615 council houses built by 1971.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{there was}} {{discussion}} about a future westward extension to I-68. Such an extension would connect the western terminus of I-68 in Morgantown to WV2 in Moundsville. A 1989 proposal had suggested a toll road be built along this corridor. In 2003, the Federal Highway Administration approved the extension, {{paving the way}} for federal funding and for the road {{to become part of the}} National Highway System on completion. However, the project ran <b>into</b> <b>problems</b> due to lack of funds, and in 2008, West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin suggested dropping the project altogether, making construction of a westward extension of I-68 unlikely in the near future.|$|E

By {{variable}} substitution, problem P 2 can be equivalently transformed <b>into</b> <b>problem</b> P 3, {{which is}} further simplified <b>into</b> <b>problem</b> P 4 {{based on the}} necessary optimality conditions. These equivalent transforms can guarantee that the optimal power allocation P∗(t) of problem P 4 {{is the same as}} that of problem P 2 at any slot t. Based on the above two points, we can conclude that problem P 2 can be equivalently decomposed <b>into</b> <b>problem</b> P 4 and PAS problem. Thus, in order to obtain the optimal solutions of problem P 2, we can solve problem P 4 at first, and then by using the power allocation results, the packet allocation solution can be obtained by using (16) and (21).|$|R

5|$|On a small {{ground at}} Belmont, the September grass was coarse. It had been rolled {{so that the}} ball moved very quickly across the ground. The Australian side, fielding first, dropped many catches and could not cope with the short boundary, {{allowing}} the Philadelphians to reach a huge total of 525 runs. King came in to bat last, at number 11, making 36 runs. The leading Australian bowlers, Hugh Trumble and George Giffen, took 2 for 104 and 0 for 114 respectively. When the Australians came to bat, they hoped that they would, by now, have recovered from their tiring journey, but ran <b>into</b> <b>problems</b> when dealing with Bart King's developing swing bowling. The side was all out for 199, with King taking 5 wickets for 78 runs. The Australians followed on and were all out again for 268, allowing the Gentlemen of Philadelphia to win by an innings and 68 runs.|$|E
5|$|The initial spacewalk {{to begin}} the {{assembly}} of the International Space Station was held on December 7, 1998, following {{the launch of the}} first section of the station, Zarya, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, on November 20, 1998. The spacewalk attached the U.S.-built Unity node to Zarya. The longest spacewalk was performed on March 11, 2001, when STS-102 crew members Susan J. Helms and James S. Voss conducted a full spacewalk, and then returned to the airlock, but remained in their suits ready to exit the airlock again in case the robotics operations ran <b>into</b> <b>problems.</b> The total time for that spacewalk was eight hours and fifty-six minutes.|$|E

In addition to the applications to nuclear physics advocated by Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators, condensed matter physicists such as Subir Sachdev have used string theory methods to understand some aspects of condensed matter physics. A notable result in this direction was the description, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, of the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. Another emerging subject is the fluid/gravity correspondence, which uses the AdS/CFT correspondence to translate problems in fluid dynamics <b>into</b> <b>problems</b> in general relativity.|$|E

5|$|Before Crisis began {{development}} in 2002. The Compilation was first unveiled in 2003 with {{the announcement of}} Advent Children. None of the titles in the series {{up to that point}} were traditional role-playing games like the original. The explanation for this was that traditional RPGs took long production periods and a large staff, which would have made the project stand out a bit too much. One of the other considerations for the team was not to make the titles lightweight as X-2 had been, due to backlash from parts of the fanbase. Conversely, making Final Fantasy X-2 reminded the team that they did not need to stick to completely serious traditional RPGs, enabling the original creation of the Compilation. While Advent Children was the first Compilation title to begin production, it ran <b>into</b> <b>problems</b> during post-production, resulting in the first released title being Before Crisis, despite it being the second title to begin development. Before Crisis was also originally planned for release in North America, but the mobile phones available in North America at the time were not able to handle the game. In addition, the producer Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata moved on to other projects, leaving its localization unlikely. Japanese animation studio Madhouse created a commercial to promote Before Crisis. Due to its success and staff feelings that important scenes from VII represented in Advent Children had been needlessly disjointed, the studio was chosen to produce an animated film: this eventually became Last Order. Crisis Core was originally going to be an action game, but became an action RPG, staying within the staff's design strengths while incorporating action elements.|$|E
5|$|Green ran <b>into</b> <b>problems</b> with Go Man Go's registration. At that time, the AQHA had {{two types}} of registration, the Appendix and the Tentative. Appendix-registered horses were the {{offspring}} of Thoroughbreds and either Tentative-registered Quarter Horses or Appendix-registered Quarter Horses. Go Man Go was originally registered in the Appendix, as his dam was an Appendix-registered mare. The way to advance out of the Appendix into the Tentative registry was to qualify on performance grounds and pass a conformation examination conducted by the AQHA. Go Man Go certainly qualified under the performance criteria, but his conformation was such that he resembled a Thoroughbred more than he resembled a Quarter Horse. Green knew {{that in order to}} increase his stud fees—the price paid for the right to breed a mare to a stallion—Go Man Go needed to acquire a regular registration number instead of his Appendix number. So Green appealed to the Executive Committee of the AQHA, which had the authority to award Tentative numbers to horses regardless of conformation exam results. In both 1956 and 1957, the committee declined to take action, waiting to evaluate the quality of Go Man Go's first foals before making a decision. Finally, in 1958, they awarded Go Man Go number 82,000 in the Tentative registry.|$|E
5|$|The failed Egyptian {{offensive}} {{gave the}} initiative to the Israelis, who immediately launched Operation Abiray-Lev, aiming to cross the canal between two Egyptian armies in order to encircle Egyptian forces on the east banks and cut their supply lines. Optimistically planned, the operation began smoothly, but quickly ran <b>into</b> <b>problems.</b> The Israelis faced difficulties in establishing a corridor to the canal due to unexpectedly determined resistance by Egyptian defenses, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of the Chinese Farm. After several days of heavy fighting, they were able to secure the roads to the canal, and by October 18 had two bridges laid down at Deversoir, at the northern end of the Great Bitter Lake. By the next day there were three Israeli armored divisions across the canal. Two advanced south toward Suez City, while the 143rd Armored Division under Major General Ariel Sharon advanced north to seize Ismailia, hoping to sever the supply lines to three Egyptian divisions of the Second Field Army across the canal.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} led by Montfort soon ran <b>into</b> <b>problems.</b> He {{negotiated a}} treaty with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the Prince of Wales, {{an act that}} made him unpopular with the English Marcher lords. In May Edward escaped captivity, {{with the help of}} Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who had now come over to the royal side. Edward started on a campaign of re-conquest, while Montfort was forced to suppress a rebellion in the Marches. He succeeded only by making large concessions to Llewelyn, and then moved east to join forces with his son Simon. Edward, however, routed the younger Simon at Kenilworth Castle, and on 4 August 1265 Montfort found himself trapped at Evesham, forced to give battle with a much smaller army than the royals. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and mutilated on the field. Even with Montfort dead resistance remained, particularly at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle. In October 1266 the Dictum of Kenilworth set down terms by which the rebels could obtain pardons, {{and by the end of}} the year the garrison surrendered.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} research investigating {{expertise and}} the types of knowledge used by airport security screeners. It applies a multi method approach incorporating eye tracking, concurrent verbal protocol and interviews. Results show that novice and expert security screeners primarily access perceptual knowledge and experience little difficulty during routine situations. During non-routine situations however, experience was found to be a determining factor for effective interactions and problem solving. Experts were found to use strategic knowledge and demonstrated structured use of interface functions integrated <b>into</b> efficient <b>problem</b> solving sequences. Comparatively, novices experienced more knowledge limitations and uncertainty resulting in interaction breakdowns. These breakdowns were characterised by trial and error interaction sequences. This research suggests that the quality of knowledge security screeners have access to has implications on visual and physical interface interactions and their integration <b>into</b> <b>problem</b> solving sequences. Implications and recommendations for the design of interfaces used in the airport security screening context are discussed. The motivations of recommendations are to improve the integration of interactions <b>into</b> <b>problem</b> solving sequences, encourage development of problem scheme knowledge and to support the skills and knowledge of the personnel that interact with security screening systems...|$|R
