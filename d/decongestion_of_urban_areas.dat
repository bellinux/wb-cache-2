40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{criteria}} defining the border <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> and aims to define criteria for deliminitation of towns from other areas. The new Spatial Planning Law defines an urban plan for urban area; {{this was one}} of the main points of this thesis. The thesis consists of two parts. The first part examines and compares the indicators and criteria that define small and medium-sized towns from national and foreign literature. The indicators for defining the precise border <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> are also included in the thesis. The second part analyses the suggested indicators and defines criteria for determination <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> border. The results are shown on the examples of Pivka and Postojna. Morphological criteria for defining the border <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> are: continuous built-up area and the type of residential house. The criteria used are the most appropriate for distinguishing between <b>urban</b> and rural <b>area.</b> Since this kind of methodological approach is still not developed in Slovenia, this thesis tries to contribute to forming of criteria and indicators for defining the border <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area...</b>|$|R

The sampel village was determined purposively, namely semayapVillage, North Sea Island Subdistrict. Where was included the ragion of the waste management for the urban Development and Housing Service Kotabaru Regency, with the most densely number of inhabitant and household. Data collection used survey and interview method. Sampling was in accidental method on 10 % of the total sample populationin the three of the most densely neighbourhood associations (RT) on the sample village. The results showed that the community’s participation in the waste management <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> in the Kotabaru Regency observed to community activity related with the cleanliness of the residence and the environment around, covered three stages, namely planning, the implementation and the supervision.
