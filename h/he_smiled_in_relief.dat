50|$|Hush! hush! see how <b>He</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>in</b> dreams.|$|R
60|$|Thorne {{realized}} that this statement covered a question, and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> a manner that indicated unalloyed satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|Brooke nodded comprehendingly, but Barbara {{noticed that}} the blood was in his cheeks and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> a very curious fashion.|$|R
6000|$|... "One flishee--two flishee--lot flishee," [...] {{he murmured}} to himself. [...] "Hop Lung fixee boys," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> his own {{peculiar}} way.|$|R
60|$|Barnes {{took the}} {{sovereign}} with hot, trembling fingers, and deposited it carefully in his waistcoat pocket. Then <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> a somewhat mysterious manner.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the rider}} and girl looked more earnestly at each other. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> {{a way that}} changed his face--brightened out the set hardness.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} scene, Claire once again walks her beat alone. Another vehicle nearly catches {{her at the}} site of her prior accident, but this time she escapes unscathed, and <b>smiles</b> <b>in</b> <b>relief.</b> The closing credit song was custom written, {{produced}} and performed by Max Sharam though she never received a credit.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> his {{superior}} way; and then I saw {{come out in}} his face the singular, eager, consuming cupidity of the seeker after buried treasure.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not altogether,' said <b>he,</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>in</b> return. 'For {{suppose that}} I {{had said to}} myself, We Platonists agree that the sight of God is the highest good.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a putty bold pair {{for your}} years," [...] said Pick Loring. [...] "Hang me if I don't admire you!" [...] And <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> his coarse way.|$|R
60|$|Ithuel's muscles twitched, and an {{expression}} of intense bitterness darkened his countenance. Then <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> a sort of derision, and gave vent to his feelings in words.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> his now {{complete}} candour. [...] "Ah, {{there was}} no reason." [...] Then he used, happily, to right himself, my own expression. [...] "She was all there." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> melancholy irony at the bewilderment, the childish {{forgetfulness}} {{of all the}} circumstances, {{which her}} words expressed. [...] "Oh, no! I'm {{going to take you}} with me." ...|$|R
60|$|Stooping {{with one}} of his quick feline pounces, he placed the slipper upon the blood mark on the sill. It exactly corresponded. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> silence at his colleagues.|$|R
60|$|That night I {{spoke to}} Bickley about the matter, repeating exactly what had passed. As I expected, <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> his grave, rather sarcastic way, and made light of it.|$|R
6000|$|Ike was mending the fence. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> {{his sweet}} way, and said smoothly, [...] "I'm sorry, {{but when they}} once git a taste of grain it's pretty hard to keep 'em--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> an {{exhausted}} fashion, and then, rallying his energies, {{held up a}} forefinger; as we stared at this new riddle, he lowered it, and held up all four fingers, doubled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] said Holmes, and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> a {{singular}} way as {{he glanced at}} our companion. [...] "Well, if {{there is nothing to}} be learned here, we had best go inside." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> his droll {{fashion and}} replied, [...] "Because, {{interesting}} as this household is in sundry ways, I {{think it is}} about time that we, or at any rate that I, got out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys, wouldn't {{you like}} to go to Brill College?" [...] asked their father one day. [...] "That's a fine institution--not quite so large as some but just as good." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> a {{peculiar}} manner.|$|R
60|$|Apparently his master's {{reception}} of the card had impressed the powdered-headed footman in Sam's favour, for {{when he came back}} from delivering it, <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> a friendly manner, and said that the answer would be ready directly.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> a {{constrained}} manner, {{and after}} a few minutes said, 'I have been considering whether this is a fit time to tell you what will give you pain. You must tell me if you can bear it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! don't, Miss Catherine!' I cried. 'We're dismal {{enough without}} conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us. Come, come, be merry and like yourself! Look at little Hareton! he's dreaming nothing dreary. How sweetly <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>in</b> his sleep!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} meet you," [...] said Major Mason, as {{he shook}} hands cordially. [...] "I hope you will make yourselves at home," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> a manner that won the {{confidence}} of all the boys at once.|$|R
60|$|But Thursday Smith did {{not know}} John Merrick very well. The little gentleman had silently listened, observing {{meanwhile}} the demeanor of the accused, and now <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> his pleasant, whimsical way and caught Smith's hand in both his own.|$|R
60|$|His blood leaped, but <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> delighted {{understanding}} of her mood. Sarah Austen had brought {{just such a}} magic touch to an excursion, and even at that moment Austen found himself marvelling a little at the strange resemblance between the two.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> sweet {{enjoyment}} of his friend's wrath. Lemuel observed {{that he spoke}} with an accent different from the others, which he thought very pleasant, {{but he did not}} know it for that neat utterance which the Anglican Church bestows upon its servants.|$|R
60|$|Mentally I thanked my stars; {{and while}} <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> a musing, dreamy fashion, I {{expressed}} my acknowledgments for his visit {{and for the}} interesting business information he had been good enough to impart to me. But I said nothing of my wonder thereat.|$|R
60|$|This, then, was {{the woman}} whom he had forgiven and loved and honoured for all these years. This was the end and this the reward of all his devotion and of all his hopes. And <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> {{bitterness}} of his pain and self-contempt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, it will {{be known}} at Tiumen; that is where these things are settled generally, but people like you are under special orders. You don't look very wicked;" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> a {{friendly}} way {{as he looked at}} the lad beside him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he {{returned}} with a slight smile, and she was curious to know why <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> that meaning way, but feared to ask. [...] "But she is your friend, I suppose, and you know her as well as I do," [...] he added after a while.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> faintly <b>in</b> {{acknowledgment}} of her presence and her prayer, {{and in this}} consolation died.|$|R
6000|$|He stared bravely. [...] "How has it altered?" [...] "Another {{person has}} come between us." [...] He hesitated a moment. [...] "I won't {{pretend not to}} know whom you mean." [...] <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> pity for my aberration, but he meant to be kind. [...] "A woman dead and buried!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we {{have only}} a few more things to get," [...] said Foster Portney, [...] "the most {{important}} of the whole outfit;" [...] and as Randy and Earl looked at him blankly, <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> an odd way. [...] "What could three gold hunters do without picks, shovels, and pans?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{was not a}} father, just now, but a {{passenger}} trying not to irritate the driver. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>in</b> a waxy way, and said, [...] "Hard luck! Well, you did the best you could. The other hole, there in the road, {{would have been just}} as bad. You're a fine driver, dolly." ...|$|R
60|$|The breathless Eskimos {{glanced at}} each other, {{and tried to}} open their eyes wider, but, having already reached the utmost limit, they failed. Unfortunately at that moment our hero was so tickled by the {{appearance}} of the faces around him, that <b>he</b> <b>smiled.</b> <b>In</b> a moment the eyes collapsed and the mouths opened.|$|R
