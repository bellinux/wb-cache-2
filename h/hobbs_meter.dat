50|$|The <b>Hobbs</b> <b>Meter</b> {{is named}} after John Weston Hobbs (1889-1968), who in 1938 founded the company named after him in Springfield, Illinois which {{manufactured}} the first electrically wound clocks for vehicle use. World War II created the demand for aviation hour meters {{which led to the}} development of the original <b>Hobbs</b> <b>Meter.</b> The company was eventually renamed Honeywell Hobbs after being acquired by Honeywell International, who in 2009 announced plans to move manufacturing to Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hobbs</b> <b>meter</b> is a genericized {{trademark}} for devices used {{in aviation}} {{to measure the}} time that an aircraft is in use. The meters typically display hours and tenths of an hour, but {{there are several ways}} in which the meter may be activated: ...|$|E
50|$|Instruments {{are usually}} a basic set given {{the size of}} the panel. It {{consists}} of variometer, altimeter, speed indicator in the top line and two smaller engine instruments below (revolution counter and valve head temperature indicator). Custom upgrades can be of different kind usually providing communication radios, different GPS devices, integrated engine instruments, <b>Hobbs</b> <b>meter,</b> ELT or turn indicators.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} to equip future microprocessors with electronic cumulative timers, for essentially the same reasons for which land vehicles are equipped with odometers (total-distance-traveled meters) and aircraft are equipped with <b>Hobbs</b> <b>meters</b> (total-engine-operating time meters). Heretofore, {{there has been no}} way to determine the amount of use to which a microprocessor (or a product containing a microprocessor) has been subjected. The proposed timers would count all microprocessor clock cycles and could only be read by means of microprocessor instructions but, like odometers and <b>Hobbs</b> <b>meters,</b> could never be reset to zero without physically damaging the chip...|$|R
50|$|Engine Usage Indicator: <b>Hobbs</b> Hour <b>Meter</b> Engine Usage {{indicator}} records actual engine {{hours of}} operation-whether idling or on road. Essential for construction contractors or fleet operators who base maintenance intervals on running time rather than mileage.|$|R
