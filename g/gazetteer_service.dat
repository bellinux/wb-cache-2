40|$|The Definitive Placename Layer for Scotland is a {{gazetteer}} resource {{which provides}} a comprehensive list of Scottish placenames. Despite the importance and significance of this resource, it is currently undelivered and the data is not currently being utilised to its full potential. It was therefore necessary to create a web-based <b>gazetteer</b> <b>service</b> which is capable of delivering the Definitive Placename Layer for Scotland, extending {{the value of the}} resource and standard compliant. There are currently a number of well-defined standards which relate to placenames and gazetteers, issued by well-respected organisations such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the European Union through the INSPIRE initiative. However, none of these standards apply to the manner in which placename data is provided within a web-based <b>gazetteer</b> <b>service.</b> This has led to the definition of a new standard which indicates the manner in which placename data should be presented within a <b>gazetteer</b> <b>service.</b> The project has successfully created a <b>gazetteer</b> <b>service</b> which delivers the placename data held within the Definitive Placename Layer for Scotland and is compliant with web-based standards. This service is capable of supporting a number of spatial queries and has a number of potential uses for organisations such as the Scottish Government and the emergency services. The service is capable of geocoding (converting between coordinates and placenames) and a number of spatial queries, such as bounding box and polygon geometry searches...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Gazetteer</b> <b>services</b> are an {{important}} component {{in a wide variety}} of systems, including geographic search engines and question answering systems. Unfortunately, the footprints provided by gazetteers are often limited to a bounding box or even a centroid. Moreover, for a lot of non–political regions, detailed footprints are nonexistent since these regions tend to have gradual, rather than crisp, boundaries. In this paper we propose an automatic method to approximate the footprints of crisp, as well as imprecise, regions using statements on the web as a starting point. Due to the vague nature of some of these statements, the resulting footprints are represented as fuzzy sets. ...|$|R

In {{order to}} create the {{contents}} of an address <b>gazetteer</b> <b>service</b> that forms part of a city council Spatial Data Infrastructure, all the exis-tent repositories containing address information in the different council offices must be analyzed and harmonized. The problem is that usually these repositories are constrained {{by the use of}} different taxonomies for the identification of urban network feature types. The objective of this work will be to describe how to establish a formal ontology enabling the interoperability among the different taxonomies, and facilitating the construction of the gazetteer contents. ...|$|E

40|$|Gazetteers {{are coming}} to play an {{increasingly}} important role in geographical information retrieval on the web. They enable users of transport timetables, routefinders, yellow pages, web mapping services and geographical web search engines to employ place names when specifying the geographical context of their requirements. The use of gazetteers in this role has also served to highlight some of their limitations {{with regard to the}} needs of the user. In practice, many queries that specify place names fail. One of the prime reasons for this is that the user may employ an informal or vernacular place name that is in common use but which is not recorded in the available gazetteers. In the UK, examples of such names are the “Midlands ” the “Chilterns ” and the “Wye Valley”. The reason the name would not be recorded is that gazetteers tend to reflect an administrative view of the world with an emphasis upon places that have precise boundaries. Some gazetteers do record the names of topographic features such as mountains and valleys, but they are not usually accompanied by data that record an estimate of the spatial extent of the features. The existing gazetteers may also fail to recognise a name because they lack the required level of detail or geographical extent or simply because they are out of date. There is a need therefore for richer gazetteers that reflect common knowledge of place names. Because of the high rate at which place names change or are introduced there is also a need to develop a system of interoperable web <b>gazetteer</b> <b>services</b> that reflect local and regional knowledge of places throughout the world. For the purposes of geographical information retrieval it is possible to envisage an ideal situation in which there is a system of multilingual <b>gazetteer</b> <b>services</b> in which the content conforms to agreed methods for specifying: preferred and alternative names; the timeframe for use of names; an ontology of place categories; rich information on spatial context including geo-political and topographic hierarchies, coordinates in well defined reference systems, spatial relations to adjacent places, and spatial footprints at different levels of generalisation, with information on the nature of boundaries (precise / vague) ...|$|R
40|$|Workshop at Open Repositories 2014, Helsinki, Finland, June 9 - 13, 2014 Workshops and TutorialsGeographic Information Systems (GIS) {{produce a}} plethora of {{spatially}} referenced data that are in high demand by the research community. Libraries’ ability to identify, deliver, and preserve such scientific data, however, has fallen behind their ability to manage other forms of complex digital objects (e. g., audio/video). Rather than create “GIS content” silos, many libraries want to manage researcher-generated geospatial datasets as durable digital objects in keeping with core digital library practice. Moreover, {{they also want to}} manage assets with some geographic association (e. g., a place name or postcode) and to integrate <b>gazetteer</b> <b>services,</b> controlled vocabularies, or other GIS tools. This workshop will discuss solutions, strategies, and best practices that should be applicable to anyone with GIS or georeferenced assets to manage in a repository. We will draw from expertise in managing spatial data assets within a repository environment with a view to informing and refining current practice.

40|$|In {{the context}} of digital map libraries, {{resources}} are usually described according to metadata records that define the relevant subject, location, time-span, format and keywords. On what concerns locations and time-spans, metadata records are often incomplete or they provide information {{in a way that}} is not machine-understandable (e. g. textual descriptions). This paper presents techniques for extracting geotemporal information from text, using relatively simple text mining methods that leverage on a Web <b>gazetteer</b> <b>service.</b> The idea is to go from human-made geotemporal referencing (i. e. using place and period names in textual expressions) into geo-spatial coordinates and time-spans.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{feasibility}} of using services offered by a Spatial Data Infrastructure {{as a basis for}} distributed service oriented geoprocessing. By developing a prototype we demonstrate that a Spatial Data Infrastructure facilitates rapid development of applications that solve typical problems for an existing risk management application. The prototype provides users with a distributed application that enables the assessment of fire damage areas based on land cover data in a given area. The services involved in the application include: Web Feature Services, Web Map Services, <b>Gazetteer</b> <b>Service,</b> Catalogue Service, and Geoprocessing Services. We present the architecture of the application and describe details about implementation-specific issues. We conclude that current OGC specifications provide a sound basis for developing service oriented architectures for geographic applications; how-ever, in particular for geoprocessing applications, we question {{the feasibility of}} the use of Web Feature Services as data sources for larger amounts of data and call for further research in this direction.

40|$|All {{types of}} {{information}} can be referenced to a geographic place. Maps, aerial photographs, and remote sensing images are spatially georeferenced. Other forms of information such as books, articles, research papers, pieces of music, and art are often linked to a geographic location through place names (geographic names). A gazetteer (a dictionary of geographic names) that is spatially referenced itself provides the bridge between {{these two types of}} georeferencing.

40|$|The work in {{this paper}} is {{motivated}} from two different perspectives: First, gazetteers as an important data source for Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) applications often lack historic place name information. More focused historic gazetteers are {{a far cry from}} being complete and often specialize only on certain geographic regions or time periods. Second, research on historic route descriptions - so called itineraries - is an important task in many research disciplines such as geography, linguistics, history, religion, or even medicine. This research on historic itineraries is characterized by manual, time-consuming work with only minimalistic IT support through <b>gazetteers</b> and map <b>services.</b> We address both perspectives and present a depth-first branch-and-bound (DFBnB) algorithm for deducing historic place names and thus the stops of ancient travel routes from itinerary tables. Multiple phonetic and character-based string distances are evaluated when resolving parts of an itinerary first published in 1563. ...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Geocoding {{has become}} one of the most popular on-line services. Nowadays, there exist many Web Services {{providing}} geocoding functionality which differ not only in technological aspects (interface, invocation style, etc.) or terms of use, but also in type of geographic information provided and spatial data quality. Currently, there is no problem to find geocoding providers but to choose the proper one, which is determined by user’s requirements. The public administration is responsible for providing the official and appropriate information for citizens or deal with risk and health management issues; therefore, urban management systems require geocoding services of high quality in terms of quality of service (QoS) and spatial data. However, the present Web geocoding public market is dominated by geocoding services for average users, i. e. users that can accept low QoS or are not interested in the lineage of data. In this situation, a compound geocoder can join data from several services of geographic information and provide services oriented to the users that demand high quality, for example urban management systems. This paper presents an architectural approach for adaptive compound geocoding Web services built on diverse Web services of geographic information, such as <b>gazetteers,</b> cadastral <b>services</b> and address geocoding services. The proposed architecture is characterized by extensibility and adaptivity thanks to application of the ontologies (Administrative Unit Applied Ontology of Spain and Service Characteristic Ontology) and advances in Semantic Web related to strategies for source selection an...|$|R
40|$|In 2005 the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) {{proposed}} that the PATTON Alliance provide assistance in evaluating and obtaining the Integrated Gazetteer Database (IGDB), developed for the Naval Space Warfare Command Research group (SPAWAR) under Advance Research and Development Activity (ARDA) funds by MITRE Inc., fielded to the text-based search tool GeoLocator, currently in use by NGIC. We met with the developers of GeoLocator and identified their requirements for a better gazetteer. We then validated those requirements by reviewing the technical literature, meeting {{with other members of}} the intelligence community (IC), and talking with both the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), the authoritative sources for official geographic name information. We thus identified 12 high-level requirements from users and the broader intelligence community. The IGDB satisfies many of these requirements. We identified gaps and proposed ways of closing these gaps. Three important needs have not been addressed but are critical future needs for the broader intelligence community. These needs include standardization of gazetteer data, a web feature <b>service</b> for <b>gazetteer</b> information that is maintained by NGA and USGS but accessible to users, and a common forum that brings together IC stakeholders and federal agency representatives to provide input to these activities over the next several years. Establishing a robust <b>gazetteer</b> web feature <b>service</b> that is available to all IC users may go a long way toward resolving the gazetteer needs within the IC. Without a common forum to provide input and feedback, community adoption may take significantly longer than anticipated with resulting risks to the war fighter...|$|R
