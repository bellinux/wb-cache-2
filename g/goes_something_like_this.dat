40|$|This {{paper is}} about non-euclidean {{geometry}} {{in the theory}} of inference. 1. Introduction Inference and Geometry get along so well that their offspring appear much before the union is formalized. It suffices to think of the odds ratio of Bayesian inference as the cross-ratio of projective geometry. At this general level the statement is no more than an informal analogy. However, as I argue below, it is pregnant with true implications and suggestive interpretations. I guess that a similar conclusion will be inescapable to anyone reading side by side Courant and Robbins, 1941 (chap.

40|$|Typically, those {{committed}} to metaphysical naturalism believe that evolution {{by natural selection}} provides a good explanation for the ability of our cognitive faculties to produce true beliefs. What we might consider the familiar picture <b>goes</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Sometime {{during the course of}} history, the ancestors of Homo sapiens evolved a cognitive structure that allowed for belief production. Not only did our ancestors evolve this cognitive ability, but this ability was selected for.

One way to account for the reliability of our cognitive faculties to produce true beliefs is to claim that true beliefs are more likely to cause appropriate survival behaviors. A belief being true helps the subject to appropriately judge a given situation and take action. False beliefs on the other hand would not facilitate appropriate behavior, and so genotypes 1 that produce cognitive structures prone to such beliefs would become a liability when the resulting phenotype was exposed to selection pressure 2. This intuitive story seems to provide a naturalistic, evolutionary, explanation for human cognitive reliability...|$|E

40|$|This book sees educating {{girls as}} the panacea for the world’s {{population}} problems—and {{so it might}} have been, had there been time! It takes its title {{from a group of}} Indian schoolgirls whom the writer saw scribbling on their slates {{in the shade of a}} banyan tree. It forgets that ancient Indian proverb ‘Nothing grows under the banyan tree’. What now so urgently needs to grow there is an approach to population control that is effective when a community is already demographically trapped and when it is too late for the fertility lowering effect of female education to be the major method, because the time it needs to work has already been lost. A community is demographically trapped when it has exceeded the carrying capacity of its fragile ecosystem, and when it has no new land to migrate to, and when its economy produces too few exports to exchange for food and other essen-tials. It is also trapped if, because its population is increasing, it is expected to be in this unhappy state before long. The end results of entrapment are the direct poverty, stunting, starvation, and population-driven violence, as in Malawi 1 and Rwanda, 2 and, if we are to believe Figures 1 and 2, in much of the rest of Africa also. What needs to happen then—as the only alternative to starvation and violence—is a dialogue which <b>goes</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> ‘If we don’t reduce our fertility radically, perhaps even to one child as in China, our stunting and starvation are going to get worse. ’ The dialogue on one-child families can open in Africa.

40|$|The English-language {{literature}} {{of technological change}} {{is one of the}} few areas of economic writing in which Joseph Schumpeter has maintained a following and in which he has been accorded some modicum of the attention he deserves. There has grown up within this literature a standard interpretation of Schumpeter 2 ̆ 7 s famous assertion that progress will eventually come to be 2 ̆ 7 mechanized 2 ̆ 7. The conventional wisdom <b>goes</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> The argument in Schumpeter 2 ̆ 7 s early writings by which writers invariably mean the 1934 English translation of The Theory of Economic Development [...] is really quite different from that in Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy. There are, in effect, two Schumpeters: an 2 ̆ 7 early 2 ̆ 7 Schumpeter and a 2 ̆ 7 later 2 ̆ 7 Schumpeter. It was the former who believed in the importance of bold entrepreneurs, while the latter envisaged their demise and replacement by a bureaucratized mode of economic organization. Moreover, the reason Schumpeter changed his views is that he was reacting to the historical development of capitalism as he saw it taking place around him. As he moved from the world of owner-managed firms in early twentieth-century Europe to the world of large American corporations in the 1930 s and 1940 s, his opinions changed appropriately. The paper attempts to make two points. The first is that, as a doctrinal matter, the 2 ̆ 7 two Schumpeters 2 ̆ 7 thesis, as it is understood in the Anglo-American literature on technological change, is clearly wrong. Equally wrong is the idea that the fundamentals of Schumpeter 2 ̆ 7 s thought on entrepreneurship were influenced importantly by any observation of large firms in the United States after 1931. Schumpeter 2 ̆ 7 s ideas were remarkably consistent from at least 1926 (five years before he came to the U. S.) until his death. The obsolescence thesis speaks to a distinction between early capitalism and later capitalism, perhaps, but not to an earlier and later Schumpeter. The second, and more important, point is that the obsolescence thesis is wrong. It rests on a confusion [...] or perhaps a bait-and-switch [...] between two quite different kinds of economic knowledge...|$|E

40|$|Newcomb {{problems}} turn on {{a tension}} between two principles of choice: roughly, a principle sensitive to the causal features of the relevant situation, and a principle sensitive only to evidential factors. Two-boxers give priority to causal beliefs, and one-boxers to evidential beliefs. A similar issue can arise when the modality in question is chance, rather than causation. In this case, the conflict is between decision rules based on credences guided solely by chances, and rules based on credences guided by other sorts of probabilistic evidence. Far from excluding cases of the latter kind, Lewis’s Principal Principle explicitly allows for them, {{in the form of}} the caveat that credences should only follow beliefs about chances in the absence of “inadmissible evidence”. In this paper I begin by exhibiting a tension in Lewis’s views on these two matters. I present a class of decision problems – some of them them-selves Newcomb problems – in which Lewis’s view of the relevance of inadmissible evidence seems in tension with his causal decision theory. I offer a diagnosis for this dilemma, and propose a remedy, based on an ex-tension of a proposal due to Ned Hall and others from the case of chance to that of causation. The remedy suggests a new view of the relation be-tween causal decision theory and evidential decision theory, namely, that they stand to each other much a chance stands to credence, as objective and subjective faces of the same practical coin. 1 Two decision rules The original Newcomb problem <b>goes</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> God offers you the contents of an opaque box.

40|$|In Cry Havoc: How the Arms Race Drove the World to War, 1931 – 1941 (Basic Books, 2010), Joe Maiolo proposes (I want {{to write}} 2 ̆ 2 demonstrates, 2 ̆ 2 but please read the book and judge for yourself) two remarkably {{insightful}} theses. The first is that the primary result of the disaster that was World War I was not the even great catastrophe that was World War II, but rather {{a new kind of}} state and one that is still with us. Maiolo 2 ̆ 7 s argument <b>goes</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> World War I caught the Great Powers flatfooted. They did not believe they were going to fight a protracted war; they thought things would be done quickly and with the men and materiel on hand. Instead, things bogged down and a massive war of attrition [...] something they had no experience with [...] ensued. In order to fight this war successfully (meaning to stay in it for the long term), the Great Powers had to fundamentally restructure their economies, something no state had ever had to do, at least in modern time. In a word, the government took over production and distribution in order to optimize the flow of arms and supplies. Many statesmen found this move objectionable, but all believed it necessary. Once the war was over, they remained convinced {{that the only way to}} deter their enemies and, in the case they couldn 2 ̆ 7 t, fend them off, was to retain control of large segments of the economy and plan to take control of even larger segments. The ability to make war on a World-War-I scale and for a World-War-I duration had to be built into the 2 ̆ 2 plan. 2 ̆ 2 Thus the leaders of all the Great Powers effectively militarized their economies in anticipation of the next great conflict. The military industrial complex was born three decades before Eisenhower put a name on it. Maiolo 2 ̆ 7 s second insight has to do with the origins of World War II itself. Most historians agree that it was 2 ̆ 2 Hitler 2 ̆ 7 s War. 2 ̆ 2 He planned it, he armed Germany for it, and he started it. Maiolo doesn 2 ̆ 7 t necessarily disagree with this position, but he offers an interesting counter-factual that puts it in a different light. What if there had been no Hitler? Would the statesmen of Europe have avoided a second great conflict? Maiolo suggests not, and for an interesting reason. Several of the Great Powers [...] the Soviets and Germans in particular [...] were very dissatisfied with the settlement at Versailles. They would not stand pat in any case. Given what we know about Soviet and German plans for and movements toward rearmament before 1933 (thanks, it should be said, to Maiolo 2 ̆ 7 s own research), it is not clear that leaders other Stalin or Hitler might not have done exactly what Stalin and Hitler did in 1939, that is, take what they felt was rightfully 2 ̆ 2 theirs 2 ̆ 2 by force of arms.

And this is more than a bit unusual, for race has been a driving force in the development of much of the law of democracy over the last several decades. Of course, there is more to politics than race. The 2000 presidential election fiasco, coupled {{with the passage of the}} Help America Vote Act and predictions (mostly correct, it turns out) of a close presidential election in 2004, made us focus on ballot access and integrity in a way that we haven 2 ̆ 7 t since the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Significant new legislation and Supreme Court opinions in the areas of campaign finance and partisan gerrymandering in the last couple of years have made those issues especially relevant. And when it comes to the law of politics, we all recognize the need to strike while the iron is hot - and ballot access, campaign finance, and partisan gerrymandering are certainly the hot issues of the last election. But the relative inattention to the role of race in politics may reflect more than the temporary rise of other issues. It may also reflect a broader belief that, when it comes to race, we 2 ̆ 7 ve done about all we can, especially when it comes to the larger, structural issues. The thinking <b>goes</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> The problem of minority access to the polls was largely resolved in the 1960 s through enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. The problem of minority vote dilution has proven more difficult, but the creation of majority-minority (or, more recently, coalition) districts under sections 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act has effectively remedied that issue. In any case, that remedy appears to have reached its limit, both because there are few places left to draw additional majority-minority districts and because the creation and maintenance of such districts may actually reduce minority influence in political affairs. The belief that problems of minority political participation have been solved, or perhaps more accurately, that there is not that much more we can do about them within existing legal structures, comes at a critical time. Several portions of the Voting Rights Act, including section 5, come up for reauthorization in 2007. Allowing section 5 to expire without replacing it with something comparable will eliminate one of the most flexible legal tools for countering the constantly evolving methods of effectively reducing meaningful minority political participation. This paper, then, is a plea to refocus attention on the issue of race. Part of this project must involve making sure we continue to set new goals as the old ones are achieved. Another part involves making sure that we recognize that some of the constraints that prevent minority groups from fully realizing their potential in a democratic society are of our own, or the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s, making, and that what we have created, we can undo (or at least question). The paper, then, is a call to remain vigilant in policing the many intentional and unintentional ways in which the political rights of racial minorities may be infringed upon. And, more generally, it is an argument to think more broadly about the possibilities that may exist to improve minority participation...|$|E
50|$|Haggis based {{the lead}} {{character}} on himself:I just {{sat down and}} said, “If I had to break the woman I love out of prison, how would I do it?” I’d go on the Internet, that’s the first thing I do. I’d Google “How {{to break out of}} prison.” So, that’s exactly what I did. I went on and Googled “How to break out of prison,” “How to break into a car,” and found these fascinating things, and I just used them. I figured that’s what he would do. I also knew I would fail spectacularly, at least at first. But then I would continue. And I’d get the shit beat out of me, and I would trust the wrong people, and I would do the wrong things. I’d start to feel really good about myself, that I’d figured the whole thing out, and then <b>something</b> would <b>go</b> wrong. I would just keep going until I either was caught or we got out or something happened. That’s what he does. So, I just tried to make him an everyman. I loved the fact that this guy was also an English teacher, so he was a romantic. He was talking about Don Quixote. He’s got this whole romanticized vision of how you sacrifice yourself for a woman, how you <b>go</b> about <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> It’s terribly romanticized and so completely impractical.|$|R
5000|$|The {{director}} of My Name Is Khan, Karan Johar, was asked during an August 2009 interview with MiD DAY if {{the event was}} a publicity stunt for the film. Johar denied that it was and responded: [...] "It's upsetting because I got a text message this morning asking me if it was publicity plug for my movie. (Sarcastically) I mean, if I had that much power over the Homeland Security, why would I allow Shah Rukh to <b>go</b> through <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> ... What's really shocking {{is the fact that}} when I was writing the film, I never thought that what happened to the protagonist of the film would happen to Shah Rukh." [...] During a January 2010 interview, Khan referred to the implication that the event was a publicity stunt for the film as [...] "lowdown and cheap." [...] Christopher B. Duncan, who portrays President Obama in My Name Is Khan, also commented on the incident stating: [...] "I was very disappointed with what SRK experienced at the airport. We're living in times where the levels of fear can sometimes spill over into paranoia. Here's a man who is an international superstar, being detained for an excessive amount of time at an airport in the United States. It had to be very upsetting for him. Imagine Oprah (Winfrey) being detained at an airport in India for a long time, during a kind of interrogation." ...|$|R

On Endless Highway, Dylan performed {{a cover of}} The Band's [...] "Whispering Pines." [...] For Instant Karma, Dylan performed a cover of Lennon's [...] "Gimme Some Truth," [...] with Dhani Harrison contributing backing vocals on the song.In September 2007, it was reported by The New York Times that Dylan was recording his first solo album at producer, Rick Rubin's home in the Hollywood Hills. [...] Regarding its sparse instrumentation and production, Dylan described {{the differences in the}} writing process for Seeing Things, compared to writing for the Wallflowers: [...] A lot of times when you write songs, you’re aware that this line is just going to help you get to the next line and someone's probably going to do an organ fill right there anyway - you can let those <b>go.</b> But with <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> it was just three instruments, really; vocals being one of the instruments, which then makes the lyrics being one of the instruments. You’re more aware that {{things are going to be}} more exposed and you can’t really let anything go unless you’re confident that this is what you want to say. Following the completion of recording in 2007, Seeing Things was released on June 10, 2008. [...] The album received generally favorable reviews and peaked at No.24 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200. [...] Following the release of Seeing Things, Dylan made several television appearances to promote the album and toured with a backing band called The Gold Mountain Rebels, which consisted of Wallflowers drummer Fred Eltringham, guitarist Audley Freed and bassist George Reif. In the summer and fall of 2008, Dylan and the Gold Mountain Rebels played a combination of theaters and festivals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, including Farm Aid in Mansfield, Massachusetts and the Newport Folk Festival. In addition to touring with the Gold Mountain Rebels, Dylan and Eltringham also performed several shows with the Wallflowers in 2008.|$|R
