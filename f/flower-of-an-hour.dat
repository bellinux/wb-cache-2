50|$|Phemeranthus rugospermus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the miner's lettuce family, Montiaceae, known by the common names prairie fameflower, rough-seeded fameflower, and <b>flower-of-an-hour.</b> It is native to the central United States from Texas and Louisiana north to Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.|$|E
50|$|Hibiscus trionum, {{commonly}} called <b>flower-of-an-hour,</b> bladder hibiscus, bladder ketmia, bladder weed, flower-of-the-hour, modesty, puarangi, shoofly, and venice mallow, is an annual plant {{native to the}} Old World tropics and subtropics. It has spread throughout southern Europe both as a weed and cultivated as a garden plant. It has been introduced to the United States as an ornamental where it has become naturalized as a weed of cropland and vacant land, particularly on disturbed ground.|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{planting}} dates and weed control methods on yield and agronomic traits of sunflower was investigated. A factorial experiment {{based on a}} complete randomized blocks design with four replications was conducted in 2009. Treatments consisted of three planting date (April 4 th, May 5 th and Juns 5 th) and five weed control methods, Trifluralin (2 Lit/ha) + Fokus (1. 5 Lit/ha), Trifluralin+Nabu-s (3 Lit/ha), Trifluralin, Hand weeding and without control. Results indicated that planting dates and weed control methods significantly affected head diameter, 100 grain weight, seed number per head and grain yield. Harvest index and oil percent was affected only by planting dates. The highest grain yield (630. 1 g/m 2), was produced in the second planting date (May 5) by using Trifluralin+Fokus. Delaying sowing date (after May 5) significantly decreased grain yield. The most important weeds in the experimental site were common lambsquarter (Chenopodium album), field bind weed (Convolvulus arvensis), bastard cabbage (Rapistrum rugosum), <b>flower-of-an-hour</b> (Hibiscus trionum), cockspur grass (Echinochloa colorum) and green bristle grass (Setaria verticillata). It was observed that the dry matter weight sharply varied in all weed species in different planting dates, that is, in the 4 th April the dry matter production of common lambsquarter and bastard cabbage, in June 5 th planting date were maximum. Dry matter of broad leaf and narrow leaf weeds in the date of May 5 th was lower {{than the other two}} planting dates. The interaction {{of planting}} date Ã—control methods on head diameter, seed number per head, grain yield and weeds dry matter was significant...|$|E
