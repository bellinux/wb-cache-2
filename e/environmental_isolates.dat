40|$|Campylobacter {{isolates}} {{from diverse}} samples within broiler production and processing environments were typed by using flaA short variable region DNA sequence analysis. Sixteen flocks from four different farms representing two broiler producers in Arkansas and California were analyzed. Fourteen of the flocks (87. 5 %) were Campylobacter-positive; two remained negative throughout the 6 -week rearing period. In general, multiple clones were present within a flock. Additionally, clones found within a flock were also {{present on the}} final product, although the diversity of Campylobacter spp. on the final product appeared to be reduced relative to that observed within the flock. Comparison of clones between flocks on the same farm revealed that some clones of Campylobacter persisted in multiple flocks. Furthermore, some clones were identified across the two farms that were under the same management. In two sampling periods, <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> were positive for Campylobacter prior to flock shedding. Environmental samples associated with five additional flocks were positive for Campylobacter concomitantly with recovery of Campylobacter from the birds.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the epidemiological linkage of clinical and <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> of Vibrio cholerae and to determine their genotypes and virulence genes content. Materials and Methods: A total of 60 V. cholerae strains obtained from clinical specimens (n = 40) and surface waters (n = 20) were subjected to genotyping using PFGE and determination of their virulence-associated gene clusters. Result: PCR analysis showed the presence of chromosomally located hly and RTX genetic elements in 100 % and 90 % of the <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates,</b> respectively. The phage-mediated genetic elements such as CTX, TLC and VPI were detected in 5 % of the <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> suggesting that the <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> cannot acquire certain mobile gene clusters. A total of 4 and 18 pulsotypes were obtained among the clinical and environmental V. cholerae isolates, respectively. Non-pathogenic environmentally isolated V. cholerae constituted a distinct cluster with one single non-O 1, non-O 139 strain (EP 6) carrying the virulence genes similar to the epidemic strains. This may suggest the possible potential of conversion of non-pathogenic to a pathogenic environmental strain.

Among the clinical isolates, B. cepacia genomovar III comprised the majority of isolates examined and only a very few isolates were assigned to B. cepacia genomovar I, B. stabilis, and B. pyrrocinia; among the <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> a prevalence of B. cepacia genomovar III and B. ambifaria was observed, whereas few <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> belonging to B. cepacia genomovar I and B. pyrrocinia were found. Antibiotic resistance analysis revealed a certain degree of differentiation between clinical and <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates.</b> Proteolytic activity and onion tissue maceration ability were found to be spread equally among both clinical and <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates,</b> whereas larger percentages of <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> than clinical isolates had hemolytic activity.

In conclusion, {{the results of the present}} study show that the species compositions of the clinical and environmental B. cepacia complex populations examined are quite different and that some of the candidate determinants related to virulence and transmissibility are not confined solely to clinical isolates but are also spread among <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> belonging to different species of the B. cepacia complex...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study was undertaken of clinical and <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> of non-O 1 Vibrio cholerae {{with respect to}} their hemagglutinating, hemolytic, enterotoxigenic, and enteropathogenic activities. Cell-associated hemagglutinin titers of the clinical and <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> did not differ much, although the clinical isolates displayed higher cell-free hemagglutinin titers compared with those of <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates.</b> Culture supernatants of 61. 5 % (24 of 39) of clinical isolates showed hemolytic activity (greater than or equal to 10 % lysis of rabbit erythrocytes), while only 33. 3 % (10 to 30) of the environmental group had such activity. Furthermore, hemolytic activities of the clinical isolates showed a good correlation with their cell-associated hemagglutinin titers which was not true for the environmental group. Culture supernatants of 45. 8 % (11 of 25) of the clinical and 20 % (2 of 10) of the <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> exhibited enterotoxigenic activity in the rabbit ileal loop assay. Such activity was mediated mainly by cholera toxin-like substances, although some of the isolates produced fluid-accumulating factors unrelated to cholera toxin. Experimental animal studies demonstrated that the enteropathogenic potential of the <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> was significantly lower than that of the clinical group. Further analysis of our data showed that phenotypic expression of cholera toxin-like products by the non-O 1 V. cholerae isolates was accompanied by their enteropathogenicity.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between environmental and clinical populations of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, we collected in total 86 isolates from Southern China during {{one and a half}} years. Sixty-eight isolates were recovered from aquaculture ponds, a seafood market, and restaurants, and 18 isolates were recovered from clinical samples. Virulence gene analysis revealed that 25 isolates (14 clinical and 11 environmental) tested positive for tdh, but only 4 carried trh. Interestingly, none of the tdh(+) <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> was recovered from ponds. Both environmental and clinical tdh(+) isolates, except for one clinical isolate, harbor type III secretion system 2 alpha (T 3 SS 2 alpha) and T 3 SS 2 beta-related genes, including vopB 2 alpha, which was previously suggested to be absent from environmental strains. More than 70 % of clinical isolates carried the pandemic marker of new toxRS (GS-PCR+), which was not present in the <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates.</b> Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing analysis showed a high degree of genetic diversity within the <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates.</b> In contrast, the clinical population formed a tight cluster that differed from the <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates.</b> These findings suggest that the pandemic strains of V. parahaemolyticus may not directly originate from marine animals. Rather the environments where they are maintained could serve as reservoirs for toxigenic, but not pandemic strains.

40|$|Background: In recent years, triazole-resistant <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> of Aspergillus fumigatus {{have emerged}} in Europe and Asia. Azole {{resistance}} {{has been reported in}} patients who are treated with long-term azole therapy or exposure of the fungus spores to the azole fungicides used in agriculture. To date, a wide range of mutations in A. fumigatus have been described conferring azole-resistance, which commonly involves modifications in the cyp 51 A gene. We investigated antifungal susceptibility pattern of <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> of A. fumigatus. Materials and Methods: In this study, 170 environmental samples collected from indoors surfaces of three hospitals in Iran. It was used β-tubulin gene to confirm the all of A. fumigatus isolates, which was identified by conventional methods. Furthermore, the antifungal susceptibility of itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole was investigated using broth microdilution test, according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility testing reference method. Results: From a total of 158 environmental molds fungi obtained from the hospitals, 58 isolates were identified as A. fumigatus by amplification of expected size of β-tubulin gene (~ 500 bp). In this study, in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing has shown that there were not high minimum inhibitory concentration values of triazole antifungals in all of the 58 <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> of A. fumigatus. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that there was not azole-resistant among <b>environmental</b> <b>isolates</b> of A. fumigatus.
