40|$|Objective and Relevance: A {{practical}} {{limitation of}} many automated molecular diagnostic platforms is the poor reliability of systems {{that rely on}} components like syringe pumps, hydraulic tubing, and multiple robots. In contrast, the BD Viper ™ System was designed {{with a focus on}} components that feature higher expected reliability. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the reliability of the BD Viper System, operating in extracted mode, 1 which is a fully automated instrument for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in urogenital specimens. The system provides for walk-away processing of the extraction, amplification, and detection of target nucleic acids, with a capacity of 184 assay results per run. Methodology: The reliability estimates for the BD Viper System, operating in extracted mode, were derived using the Systems Engineering ‘roll-up ’ approach, in which failure rates for system components were compiled into an overall reliability calculation. Potential failures were broken into two categories that define distinct measurements of reliability: • Mean Runs Between Failures (MRBF) : associated with “hard” failures of hardware that require replacement or repair by a <b>Field</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Engineer,</b> and • Mean Runs Between Interventions (MRBI) : associated with “soft ” failures that potentially lead to the loss of a run but do not require hardware replacement or service visit. The failure rates for system components were derived from a variety of sources, including supplier failure rate specifications, historical field data on failure rates from BD Viper Systems, operating in non-extracted mode, failure modes and effects analyses, empirical accelerated life testing, and the FRACAS (“Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action”) approach, a closed-loop technique for reliability improvement...|$|E
40|$|When {{field service}} {{engineers}} go to customer sites to service equipment, {{they want to}} diagnose and repair failures quickly and cost effectively. Symptoms exhibited by failed equipment frequently suggest several possible causes which require different approaches to diagnosis. This can lead the engineer to follow several fruitless paths in the diagnostic process before they find the actual failure. To assist in this situation, we have developed the Fault Tree Diagnosis and Optimal Test Sequence (FTDOTS) software system that performs automated diagnosis and ranks diagnostic hypotheses based on failure probability and the time or cost required to isolate and repair each failure. FTDOTS first finds a set of possible failures that explain exhibited symptoms by using a fault tree reliability model as a diagnostic knowledge to rank the hypothesized failures based on how likely {{they are and how}} long it would take or how much it would cost to isolate and repair them. This ordering suggests an optimal sequence for the <b>field</b> <b>service</b> <b>engineer</b> to investigate the hypothesized failures in order to minimize the time or cost required to accomplish the repair task. Previously, field service personnel would arrive at the customer site and choose which components to investigate based on past experience and service manuals. Using FTDOTS running on a portable computer, they can now enter a set of symptoms and get a list of possible failures ordered in an optimal test sequence to help them in their decisions. If facilities are available, the field engineer can connect the portable computer to the malfunctioning device for automated data gathering. FTDOTS is currently being applied to field service of medical test equipment. The techniques are flexible enough to use for many different types of devices. If a fault tree model of the equipment and information about component failure probabilities and isolation times or costs are available, a diagnostic knowledge base for that device can be developed easily...|$|E

This wide spread in digitization is made possible by the introduction of handy devices specifically of mobile phones, laptop computers, smartphones and tablets. These devices, in turn, operate on distributed systems and mobile networks, which enable mobility, ubiquity and interactivity of computers, data, software and users. This new trend in shaping up technological advancement presents new opportunities for mobile information presentation, processing and synthesis in different spheres of application such as industrial <b>field</b> <b>services</b> engineering. Industrial <b>field</b> <b>service</b> <b>engineers</b> execute sets of work orders on daily basis plans. These work order executions demand the availability of digital information anywhere anytime to minimize the average time required to accomplish them. In this context, the pervasiveness and ubiquity of mobile devices and smartphones creates a favorable possibility for industrial <b>field</b> <b>service</b> engineering automation. Most contemporary smartphones come out with abundant features to use for industrial <b>field</b> <b>service</b> engineering task automation and different ways of presenting information to <b>service</b> <b>engineers.</b> The objective of this thesis is, therefore, to develop a stable mobile prototype software by using Android smartphone hardware and software features to perform preparation, execution and post-processing of the work orders using latest digital technology available in smartphones, like camera, video, sound recording, annotations, maps and Augmented Reality (AR). The prototype enables <b>service</b> <b>engineers</b> to locate <b>service</b> <b>fields,</b> locate equipment, record work order events and report them for later use.

40|$|AbstractIndustrial Product-Service Systems (IPS 2) are {{integrated}} product and service offerings that deliver superior customer value in industrial applications by mutually determined planning, development, delivery {{and use of}} product and service shares. A particular challenge {{for the provision of}} IPS 2 is the planning of resources, e. g. <b>field</b> <b>service</b> <b>engineers</b> (FSE). As a consequence, organizations which offer IPS 2 or industrial services experience a lack of decision support in determining robust capacity planning strategies in highly dynamic and uncertain environments. In this paper, a simulation-based capacity planning approach is introduced. The focus is on capacity planning of FSE for IPS 2 delivery in IPS 2 or service networks. After some general considerations on robust capacity planning for IPS 2 delivery with the help of scenario simulations, the core elements of the agent-based simulation approach are presented.

When on-site maintenance is required, as in several cases ranging from washing machines to large-sized machineries, <b>field</b> <b>service</b> <b>engineers</b> carry a stock of service parts in their vehicles to carry out repair interventions. The Repair Kit Problem (RKP) aims at determining the stock of service parts to be carried on the vehicles in order to optimize costs and/or customer service level. A literature review highlights that the models developed so far tend to neglect features that are important for practitioners. We propose a deterministic mathematical formulation of the RKP, where the objective function minimizes inventory holding, ordering, delivery and shortage costs subject to budget and service level constraints. We solve to optimality the problem {{on a set of}} real instances for the case of a multinational firm that needs to determine the stock of service parts for each of its field engineers. A discrete event simulation model is then developed to test ex-post the performance of the model on actual data. Preliminary results of the application are presented and discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Defective {{capital assets}} may be quickly {{restored}} to their operational condition by replacing the item that has failed. The item that is replaced {{is called the}} Line Replaceable Unit (LRU), and the so-called LRU definition problem {{is the problem of}} deciding on which item to replace upon each type of failure: when a replacement action is required in the <b>field,</b> <b>service</b> <b>engineers</b> can either replace the failed item itself or replace a parent assembly that holds the failed item. One option may be fast but expensive, while the other may take longer but against lower cost. We consider a maintenance organization that services a fleet of assets, so that unavailability due to maintenance downtime may be compensated by acquiring additional standby assets. The objective of the LRU-definition problem is to minimize the total cost of item replacement and the investment in additional assets, given a constraint on the availability of the fleet of assets. We link this problem to the literature. We also present two cases to show how the problem is treated in practice. We next model the problem as a mixed integer linear programming formulation, and we use a numerical experiment to illustrate the model, and the potential cost reductions that using such a model may lead to...|$|R
40|$|The Repair Kit Problem {{is about}} {{determining}} {{the stock of}} service parts carried by <b>field</b> <b>service</b> <b>engineers</b> for on-site product support. Models that optimise cost or service performances {{have appeared in the}} literature, but two important managerial decisions have not received enough attention. They are the maximum amount of stock to be carried on the vehicle (referred to as inventory budget) and the number of times per week the repair kit should be restocked (replenishment frequency). In this paper we propose a solution method based on the sequential use of optimization and simulation that addresses these issues. The application study was inspired by a real case of an equipment provider and tested on real data. The method allows defining the repair kit and assessing the impact on the overall cost of combinations of inventory budget and replenishment frequency values. The proposed method aims at improving the managerial understanding on how these decisions interact and at bridging a literature gap. In particular, it supports managers in (i) defining the Repair Kit to be carried by each Service Engineer; (ii) identifying the levels of inventory budget and replenishment frequency minimising the overall cost in correspondence of different combinations of exogenous (cost) parameter...|$|R
