5|$|Aged 14 {{years and}} 5 months, Thorpe became the 463rd and {{youngest}} ever male {{to be selected}} for the Australian team, surpassing John Konrads' record by one month. Frost said that Thorpe's selection catalysed his eventual focus on freestyle. Thorpe continued his <b>good</b> <b>form</b> at the Australian Age Championships. He contested all twelve events, winning ten individual gold and two bronze medals. He set six Australian records in the process.|$|E
5|$|During Hunt's injury, Bennett moved Broncos {{teammate}} Justin Hodges to fullback and Hodges {{was impressive}} in the position. When Hunt {{returned to the}} Broncos side in Round 25 against the Parramatta Eels, {{he was forced to}} play on the wing due to Hodges' <b>good</b> <b>form.</b> Hunt and Hodges continued to switch the fullback position {{for the remainder of the}} season. Hunt missed the first week of the finals due to a hamstring problem but was able to return a week later.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of defender Sol Campbell and retirement of striker Dennis Bergkamp {{in the summer of}} 2006, Gilberto was announced as Arsenal's vice-captain for the 2006–07 season. He began the season well, as he scored the first ever goal at the Dutch DSB Stadion in a pre-season friendly match. He then scored Arsenal's first ever goal in a competitive match at the Emirates Stadium in a 1–1 draw with Aston Villa. His <b>good</b> <b>form</b> continued for Arsenal as he scored several league goals, garnering praise for his performances as stand-in captain while Thierry Henry was injured. Gilberto and his agent (Paulo Villana) also reiterated the player's desire to honour his contract with the Gunners. Meanwhile, Gilberto's <b>good</b> <b>form</b> carried through to {{the second half of the}} season. Even though Arsenal only managed to finish fourth in the league, he ended the season as Arsenal's second highest scorer with 10 Premier League goals. The explanation for his unusually high tally is the fact that Henry suffered two lengthy injury spells, in which Gilberto stepped up as captain to take penalties. Gilberto's goal scoring record combined with his own <b>good</b> <b>form</b> in midfield and his leadership of Wenger's youthful squad led some Arsenal fans and football pundits to label Gilberto as Arsenal's best player of the season, and one of the best in the Premier League.|$|E

5|$|When Dean Solomon {{suffered}} a season-ending knee injury in late March, Hall {{was one of}} three players in contention to be promoted to the senior list in place of Solomon. After approximately one month of assessment Hall was deemed the most impressive of Essendon's three rookies and was elevated to the senior list. In early June, Hall played particularly well in defence for the reserves against the Murray Kangaroos, and was subsequently in consideration to play for Essendon's senior team. Essendon had been plagued by injury throughout 2002 and this, coupled with Hall's <b>good</b> <b>form</b> in the VFL, resulted in him making his AFL debut in round 12 against Hawthorn. After a poor performance in his debut match, in which he did not record a statistic and spent most of the match on the bench, Hall was dropped backed to the VFL side the following round. Despite showing <b>good</b> <b>form</b> in the VFL for the remainder of 2002, Hall was unable to break back into the senior Bombers line-up. Although Hall failed to have an impact at AFL level, he played well at VFL level and was third in the reserves' best and fairest award.|$|E

In this paper, the forming process of Dn 40 -type control valve is analyzed to find the main reason for such forming defects by using CAE tools and comparing with the <b>good</b> <b>forming</b> process of a Dn 50 -type control valve. Results show that big difference between wall thicknesses and bad exhaust system in injection mold is the main reasons for insufficient filling. In the meantime, measures to prevent defects are investigated. Modifying the local structure of the injection mold is provided to avoid the defects. Using reasonable parameters in the injecting process and modified injection mold, the injection product have a smooth surface and <b>good</b> <b>forming.</b> The experiment verified the feasibility of the measure for prevention of defects. ...|$|R
5|$|A bicycle kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. The performer needs to maintain <b>good</b> <b>form</b> when executing the move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional {{accuracy and precision}} when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, one of the sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 career goals.|$|E

Inverness were favourites to win the match being the higher ranked club as a competitor in the First Division, one tier above Alloa who were in the Second Division. Inverness were ranked seventh from ten in the First Division at the time of the final, 20 points behind runaway leaders St. Mirren. After five games unbeaten in the league, Inverness lost their last league game before the final 5–1 away to Morton.|$|E

Liverpool replaced David Johnson with midfielder Steve Heighway in an attempt {{to get back into the}} match but it was to no avail as Anderlecht extended their lead late in {{the second half}} when Rensenbrink scored. No further goals were scored and the referee Károly Palotai blew for full-time with the final score 3–1 to Anderlecht.|$|E
