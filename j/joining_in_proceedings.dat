Of the five {{declared}} nuclear weapon states only the People's Republic of China did not participate. Of the three [...] "threshold" [...] nuclear-weapon states only India participated.

50|$|In 1840, {{women were}} refused {{the right to}} {{participate}} at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London.

When women were still denied to <b>join</b> <b>in</b> the <b>proceedings,</b> abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison, Charles Lenox Remond, Nathaniel Peabody Rogers, and Henry Stanton, all elected to sit silently with the women.|$|R
50|$|Henrv VIII {{nominated}} Wotton {{one of his}} executors and a privy councillor to his son Edward, though Wotton's official superior at Calais, Lord Cobham, was neither. Wotton {{remained a}} privy councillor when Somerset reconstructed the council in March 1546-7, but his duties at Calais prevented his frequent attendance at the council board. In April he was again made a commissioner to settle the disputes as to the frontier of the Boulonnais, and the growing hostility of France kept him busy with preparations for defence. On 13 March 1547-8, however, he signed the council's letter ordering {{the administration of the}} sacrament in one kind only, and on 17 January 1548-9 <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>proceedings</b> against Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley. In September following he again came over to take part in Warwick's scheme for overthrowing Somerset. He was lodging in Warwick Lane, Holborn, on the 18th, he signed the council's manifesto against the Protector on 6 October, and accompanied the other councillors to Windsor six days later, when Somerset was arrested. In November he appears to have returned to Calais, but a year later he was again in attendance at the council. Hasted states that be died on 8 November 1550, but he attended the council on the 22nd of that month, and in January 1550-1 was suppressing disorder in Kent. In the same year also he was included in various commissions among which the young king proposed to divide the work of the privy council. Apparently it was on 8 November 1561 that he died. He was buried in Boughton Malherbe church.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} specific quesitons {{in relation}} to the arbitral award. A first question dealt with, concerned the consequences and effects an arbitral award may have before a state court grants it exequatur. Two sub-questions are discussed : whether such award may have res judicata, and, if yes, what consequences may follow from the res judicata and second whether provisional measures may be ordered {{on the basis of the}} award before the exequatur is granted. In a second chapter, attention is devoted to the seminal question of the possibility to enforce an award which has been annulled. This is done by exploring the effects of a request for annulment on the effects of an award and then discussing the consequences the annulment proper may have on the award. Finally, the position of the award debtor is also discussed {{in relation to}} enforcement <b>proceedings.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the possibility for the debtor to file a negative declaratory action and to request to be <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> enforcement <b>proceedings</b> are discussed...|$|R

The court may, if it believes this {{to be in the}} interests of justice, direct that one or more charges be tried separately. Such an order may be made even after the plea.|$|R
60|$|Among {{those who}} are pleased to write or talk against this paper, I have {{observed}} a strange manner of reasoning, which I should be glad to hear them explain themselves upon. They make no ceremony of exclaiming upon all occasions against a change of ministry, in so critical and dangerous a conjuncture. What shall we, who heartily approve and <b>join</b> <b>in</b> those <b>proceedings,</b> say <b>in</b> defence of them? We own the juncture of affairs to be as they describe: we are pushed for an answer, and are forced at last freely to confess, that the corruptions and abuses in every branch of the administration, were so numerous and intolerable, that all things must have ended in ruin, without some speedy reformation. This I have already asserted in a former paper; and the replies I have read or heard, have been in plain terms to affirm the direct contrary; and not only to defend and celebrate the late persons and proceedings, but to threaten me with law and vengeance, for casting reflections on so many great and honourable men, whose birth, virtue and abilities, whose morals and religion, whose love of their country and its constitution in Church and State, were so universally allowed; and all this set off with odious comparisons reflecting on the present choice. Is not this in plain and direct terms to tell all {{the world that the}} Qu[een] has in a most dangerous crisis turned out a whole set of the best ministers that ever served a prince, without any manner of reason but her royal pleasure, and brought in others of a character directly contrary? And how so vile an opinion as this can consist with the least pretence to loyalty or good manners, let the world determine.|$|R
40|$|Living the Year of Faith was {{the theme}} of Ash Wednesday {{services}} held at The University of Notre Dame Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Fremantle Campus to commemorate the beginning of Lent for 2013. Staff members and students were called to 2 ̆ 7 turn away from sin and be faithful to God 2 ̆ 7 as the ashes from last year 2 ̆ 7 s Palm Sunday were placed on their foreheads by Campus Chaplain Fr John Sebastian OMI. Through {{the words of the}} Homily, the Notre Dame community reflected on the opportunities that Lent affords to draw closer to God and one another. Prayer, fasting, and almsgiving were offered as three pillars upon which a powerful and meaningful Lenten season can be built. 2 ̆ 2 Lent is a very significant time in the Church 2 ̆ 7 s liturgical year, where all who yearn to know God more deeply are invited to journey through the desert, to the Cross, and into the new life of the resurrection, 2 ̆ 2 Campus Minister Karl Brown said. 2 ̆ 2 It is an excellent example of the journey of the individual joining with the wider community of believers to create a rich tapestry of faith and grace. 2 ̆ 2 The Lenten journey concludes on Good Friday, 28 March, with the Stations of the Cross to be held at the Fremantle Campus from 10 am. Community members are welcome to <b>join</b> <b>in</b> the <b>proceedings.</b> For more information on Mass times and prayer sessions throughout the Lenten period at Notre Dame, please contact Campus Ministry on (08) 9433 0581.

40|$|Participants <b>in</b> {{administrative}} <b>proceedings</b> {{with emphasis}} on participation <b>in</b> <b>proceedings</b> conducted according to the Building Act The Master thesis deals with a topic of participants of administrative <b>proceedings,</b> <b>in</b> which participation <b>in</b> <b>proceedings</b> conducted according to the Building Act is strongly emphasized. The author chose this topic because the participants <b>in</b> <b>proceedings</b> are irreplaceable procedural parties of every administrative proceedings without their existence no administrative proceedings could be conducted, and therefore they form {{an integral part of}} administrative proceedings next to administrative authority. The meaning of statutory legal regulation is to guarantee participants <b>in</b> <b>proceedings</b> mutually equal position and rights to prove a claim sufficient <b>in</b> administrative <b>proceedings.</b> The thesis introduces contemporary interpretative and application conclusions altogether with their gradual development and it evaluates in which way these conclusions brought about solutions and in which way conversely there were disputable questions in consequence of these conclusions.

25|$|Two plebeian tribunes, Favonius and Cato, led the {{opposition}} to the steps of the consuls. However, they did not get far, due to popular support for the measures. Favonius was given little time to speak before the plebeian council, and Cato applied obstructionist tactics that did not work. He was led away from the assembly, but he kept returning and he was eventually arrested. Gallus, a senator, slept in the senate house intending to <b>join</b> the <b>proceedings</b> <b>in</b> the morning. Trebonius locked the doors and kept him there for most of the day. The comitia (the meeting place of for the assembly) was blocked by a cordon of men. An attempt to pass through was repulsed violently and there were casualties. When people were leaving after the vote Gallus, who had been let out of the senate house, was hit when he tried to pass through the cordon. He was presented covered with blood to the crowd. People were upset. The consuls stepped in with a large and intimidating bodyguard, called a meeting and put the measure in favour of Caesar to the vote. It was passed.|$|R
