5|$|The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade {{varied in}} size and {{structure}} <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was created. Headquarters and Service Company, the company comprising the headquarters staff and support personnel, was {{much smaller than the}} equivalent company in standard Marine brigades. Each iteration of the brigade was assigned provisional military police, signal and other supporting companies and platoons. This was not an uncommon practice for the U.S. Marine Corps, which created such ad hoc units regularly in wartime. During World War II two other provisional Marine brigades were formed, which eventually expanded into divisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal erosion}} and {{salinization}} affecting {{the west of}} Senegal are also a source of concern on the island; signs of erosion have been observed in Carabane since 1849. The house of the government representative on the island has burned down twice; <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was rebuilt, {{the site of the}} building had to be moved further and further inland. The island's erosion is evident when one considers that the original location of the house eventually became flooded, even at low tide. During the dry season the river has a tide-dominated delta, with tidewater reaching 200km upstream, while it is being concentrated 50% by evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The cockroach's {{ability to}} {{withstand}} radiation better than {{human beings can}} be explained through the cell cycle.

A cockroach's cells divide only once <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> molts, which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach. Since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, but lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Chantal was a North Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclone that {{moved across the}} Caribbean Sea in August2001. Chantal developed from a tropical wave on August14 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It tracked rapidly westward for much of its duration, and after degenerating into a tropical wave it passed through the Windward Islands. Chantal reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) twice in the Caribbean Sea, and <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was anticipated to attain hurricane status; however, wind shear and later land interaction prevented strengthening to hurricane status. On August21 Chantal moved ashore near the border of Mexico and Belize, {{and the next day}} it dissipated.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Ba Cụt was {{involved}} in a battle with another Hòa Hảo leader, Nguyễn Giác Ngộ. He was defeated and driven from the district of Chợ Mới in February, provoking Soái to attack Ngo. Ba Cụt then moved to Thốt Nốt and began attacking the civilians and the French forces there. The French saw the disagreements as an opportunity to divide the Hòa Hảo and gain an anti-Việt Minh ally, and offered material aid, which Ba Cụt accepted. Ba Cụt repeatedly made treaties with the French colonial forces to fight the Việt Minh in return for arms and money, but he broke his end of the bargain and sometimes fought the Cao Đài instead of the communists. He made five such deals with the French, but he abandoned his military responsibilities <b>each</b> <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> was said that Ba Cụt sometimes broke away with the encouragement of Soái, who was still allied to the French, but nevertheless is believed to have given Ba Cụt weapons to fight the French. The French continued to furnish him with supplies despite his disloyalty and unreliability because they lacked the personnel to patrol all of Vietnam but had spare equipment. Some historians have claimed Ba Cụt's anti-French activities were not taken seriously as he was able to pass through French checkpoints without incident. There are also reports that he was accompanied by French intelligence agents during periods when he was nominally opposed to the French. The other Hòa Hảo commanders generally had the same general outlook as Ba Cụt; they were stridently opposed to the Việt Minh due to Sổ's assassination, and sometimes fought alongside and received supplies from the French, but at times they lapsed into apathy and refused to attack.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, Valve {{created a}} formal process to allow purchasers to request full refunds on games they had {{purchased}} on Steam for any reason, with refunds guaranteed {{within the first}} two weeks as long as the player had not spent more than two hours in the game. Prior to June 2015, Valve had a no-refunds policy, but allowed them in certain circumstances, such as if third-party content had failed to work or improperly reports on certain features. For example, the Steam version of From Dust was originally stated to have a single, post-installation online DRM check with its publisher Ubisoft, but the released version of the game required a DRM check with Ubisoft's servers <b>each</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was used. At the request of Ubisoft, Valve offered refunds to customers who bought the game while Ubisoft worked to release a patch that would remove the DRM check altogether. On The War Zs release, players found that the game was still in an alpha-build state and lacked many of the features advertised on its Steam store page. Though the developers Hammerpoint Interactive altered the description after launch to reflect {{the current state of the}} game software, Valve removed the title from Steam and offered refunds to those who had bought it. Valve also removed Earth: Year 2066 from the Early Access program and offered refunds after discovering that the game's developers had reused assets from other games and used developer tools to erase negative complaints about the title. Valve stated it would continue to work on improving the discovery process for users, taking principles they learned in providing transparency for matchmaking in Dota 2 to make the process better, and using that towards Steam storefront procedures to help refine their algorithms with user feedback.|$|E
