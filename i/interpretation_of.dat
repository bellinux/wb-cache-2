5|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An example of this is William Morris's 1970 <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.|$|E

5|$|The Maya {{world was}} {{populated}} {{by a great}} variety of deities, supernatural entities and sacred forces. The Maya had such a broad <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> what was sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate. The Maya <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> deities was intrinsically tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmovision. The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering. Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour. They also had a dual day-night/life-death aspect.|$|E

40|$|In this essay, Pierce and Weiss {{report the}} results of a study of {{judicial}} review <b>of</b> agency <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> agency rules. Prior studies found that, while courts at all levels uphold about 70 % of agency actions, the Supreme Court upholds 91 % <b>of</b> agency <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> agency rules. Pierce and Weiss find that lower courts do not confer this type of “super-deference” on agency <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> agency rules. District courts and circuit courts uphold 76 % of such agency actions. That is within the range of the findings of prior studies of judicial review of other types of agency actions and much lower than {{the rate at which the}} Supreme Court upholds agency <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> agency rules. Pierce and Weiss also find no evidence that judges are influenced by their political or ideological preferences when they review agency <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> agency rules. That finding is consistent with the findings of a prior study of judicial review of agency findings of fact, but it is inconsistent with the findings of several studies of judicial review <b>of</b> agency <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> agency-administered statutes and of judicial review of agency policy decisions...|$|R
