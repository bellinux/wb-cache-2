This work evaluates the consequences of the {{establishment of}} <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> on amphibian communities in an area of the Sierra Madre Oriental using analyses of alpha and beta diversity.

25|$|According to Fadl al-Fa'our, {{the author}} of a 1963 {{dissertation}} about his tribe, the Al Fadl tribesmen who fled to the Beqaa split into two factions in the 18th century {{as a result of a}} feud with the Bani Khalid tribe. One of the factions, led by its emir, Fa'our, migrated to the Golan Heights (known in Arabic as Jawlan). This emir is the namesake and ancestor of Beit Fa'our, the Al Fadl household that has since led the tribe. The Fadl tribesmen who stayed in Beqaa were the Hourrouk branch, which continues to inhabit the Beqaa. The lines of descent connecting the Fa'our and Hourrouk branches with the Mamluk-era Al Fadl emirs has not been specifically defined. For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, the Al Fadl used the Golan Heights as a <b>grazing</b> <b>area</b> for their flocks, along with the Banu Nu'aym tribe. They successfully fought off Turkmen and Kurdish groups in the Golan Heights for control of pasture lands. Later, in the 1870s, Circassians from other parts of the empire settled in the Golan Heights, and their cultivation of the land threatened the Al Fadl's traditional pasture grounds. At the time, the tribe's presence in the area consisted of 320 tents along with several villages which they inhabited in the winter. They fought a number of skirmishes with the Circassians, during which one of their leaders, Sheikh Shadadi al-Fadl was killed.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the diet composition of semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in late summer in different kinds of grazing conditions in northernmost Finland. The composition of diet by reindeer was determined {{on the grounds of}} microhistological analysis of feces samples collected in early August in different seasonal <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> (winter or summer/year-round <b>grazing</b> <b>areas)</b> in three reindeer management districts. Although the proportion of different plant groups varied between the studied districts, the quantified group of ground lichens (which also contained small amounts of mushrooms) was the most abundant, varying from 33. 0 to 46. 4 % in the analyzed samples. In general, there were significant differences in the proportions of lichen between districts, but not between <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> The proportion of lichen in samples increased significantly when the amount of lichen pasture around a sample site increased. The proportion of dwarf shrubs and leaves in samples varied from 24. 9 to 37. 9 % and differed significantly between districts, but not between <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> In the same way, the proportion of graminoids varied between 20. 9 and 36. 2 % and differed significantly between districts and also between <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> Higher amounts of graminoids in feces were observed in summer/year-round <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> than in winter <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> Finally, the proportion of bryophytes varied between 2. 9 and 6. 5 % and was significantly different between districts, but not between <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> An increase in old and mature coniferous forest around a sample site significantly increased the amounts of bryophytes in samples. The results indicate that reindeer adapt their summer diet composition according to the availability of food plants. The results also show that when reindeer are allowed to select their summer ranges freely, reindeer tend to use lichen pastures intensively also during summer, which causes a considerable reduction in lichens due to grazing and trampling. Therefore, a proper seasonal pasture rotation system to protect lichen pastures from grazing and trampling, from early spring to late autumn, {{is an essential part of}} sustainable pasture use in reindeer herding...|$|R

500|$|There {{is concern}} in some {{quarters}} that the horses are a negative influence on their habitat, through overgrazing and competition with native species. While exotic species, such as the Namib Desert Horse, are generally unwanted in the Namib-Naukluft Park, the horses are a special case, given their close ties with Namibian history, their popularity with visitors, and their appeal as subjects for case studies of feral horse bands. Studies during 2003 and 2004, however, found that while an area of approximately [...] around the watering area at Garub has {{been affected by the}} horses, there was no significant disturbance of the area outside this radius. The amount and species of vegetation found outside the watering area appear more affected by rainfall then by the horses, probably due to the low population density and natural rotational grazing. Due to the lack of affect on vegetation by horses, it is unlikely that they significantly influence small mammal populations. The horses also appear to have no measurable affect on any vulnerable or endangered plant or animal species, which in several cases are more threatened by human influence. As the horses are restricted to a certain <b>grazing</b> <b>area</b> and native large herbivores are not, the horses do not pose a danger to the latter species. The horses in the Namib Desert were originally known by the local population as [...] "ghost horses", as they mostly stayed away from human habitations and were rarely seen. However, when their grazing grounds were made part of the game reserve, a policy of limited intervention was put in place that encouraged support to be given to the horses when necessary, bringing the horses into closer contact with humans. This also included closer contact with tourists to Namibia, who frequently see them at the watering area at Garub and near the main road that traverses their grazing grounds. While the horses are credited with bringing tourist dollars to Namibia, there are also concerns about negative horse-human interactions, including vehicle accidents, disruption to sensitive areas by people looking for the horses and disruption of herd dynamics due to becoming too used to or dependent upon humans.|$|E

30|$|In the {{traditional}} farming {{system of the}} Himalayan Hindu-Kush region of Northern Pakistan, different types of fodder trees and shrubs are found at different elevations and sites and are used differently by various landowning and landless social segments.

This paper demonstrates that indigenous tree and shrub species have a high potential in sustaining a pastoral system in need of alternatives to shrinking <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> The decline in pasture availability is due to afforestation programmes, communal hillside privatization, crop extension and conservation programmes that evict herders from their former <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> and trekking routes.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{preference}} of foraging Brent geese is studied. The study {{performed on the}} polder of the was Dutch Waddenisland Schiermonnikoog. Wintering geese feeding in the polder are expected to prefer <b>grazed</b> <b>areas</b> due to a shorter sward, a higher protein content, a higher tiller density and less bare ground in these areas than in areas with other management types. Therefore, the expectation is that geese prefer sheep grazed grass to cattle grazed grass, which is {{at that time of}} year, ungrazed grass. In a choice-experiment, where the geese could choose between two treatments, two geese were allowed to forage on the treatment of their choice. Foraging time was used as an indication for the foraging preference of the geese. Several vegetation parameters were measured for each treatment. The geese showed a large preference for the sheep <b>grazed</b> <b>areas</b> compared to ungrazed <b>areas.</b> The sheep <b>grazed</b> <b>area</b> had a higher tiller density, a lower sward height and biomass and the intake rate of sheep grazed grass was higher than in the ungrazed parcels. In the sheep <b>grazed</b> <b>areas</b> nutrient intake was highest. The geese preferred grazing on sheep grazed compared to goose <b>grazed</b> <b>areas.</b> The goose <b>grazed</b> <b>areas</b> have a lower sward height, a lower biomass and a lower intake rate. Height and not treatment seems to be the major determinant a goose selects on. Nevertheless, there is a correlation between sward height and treatment this is because treatment is a way to achieve a certain grass height. Height is related to intake rate; they show an optimum curve; the geese have a preferred foraging height of the grass where they can optimise their intake rate. ...|$|R
