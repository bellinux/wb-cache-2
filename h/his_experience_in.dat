5|$|Berkman {{planned to}} write a book about <b>his</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> Russia, but he {{postponed}} it while he assisted Goldman as she wrote a similar book, using as sources material he had collected. Work on Goldman's book, My Two Years in Russia, was completed in December 1922, and the book was published in two parts with titles not of her choosing: My Disillusionment in Russia (1923) and My Further Disillusionment in Russia (1924).

5|$|Hamilton's Report on a National Bank was a {{projection}} {{from the first}} Report on the Public Credit. Although Hamilton had been forming ideas of a national bank as early as 1779, he gathered ideas in various ways over the past eleven years. These included theories from Adam Smith, extensive studies on the Bank of England, the blunders of the Bank of North America and <b>his</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> establishing the Bank of New York. He also used American records from James Wilson, Pelatiah Webster, Gouverneur Morris, and from his assistant Treasury secretary Tench Coxe.|$|E

5|$|Sharaf {{writes that}} Reich's {{personality}} changed after <b>his</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> Oslo. He became socially isolated {{and kept his}} distance even from old friends and his ex-wife. His students in the United States came to know {{him as a man}} that no colleague, no matter how close, called by his first name. In January 1940 he wrote to Lindenberg to end their relationship once and for all, telling her that he was in despair and that he believed he would end up dying like a dog.|$|E

5|$|Somewhat disillusioned by <b>his</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> New York City (he had {{philosophical}} {{differences with}} some {{leaders of the}} Antillean liberation movements, particularly with Eugenio María de Hostos), Betances spent a short interlude in Jacmel, Haiti in 1870 {{at the request of}} its then-president, Jean Nissage-Saget, who supported Betances' efforts to have a liberal government for the Dominican Republic take power. He later spent some time in the Cibao valley (in both Santiago de los Caballeros and Puerto Plata) where Luperón and Betances attempted to organize another revolt, this time against conservative elements in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|The idea to do a film {{adaptation}} of Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief {{dates back to}} 1994. Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997, eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but struggled with the adaptation and writer's block. Kaufman eventually created a script of <b>his</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> adaptation, exaggerating events, and creating a fictional brother named Donald Kaufman. Kaufman put Donald Kaufman's name on the script and dedicated the film to the fictional character. By September 1999, Kaufman had written two drafts of the script; he turned in a third draft in November 2000.|$|E

5|$|To help {{design the}} next major show, Laliberté and Caron hired Franco Dragone, another {{instructor}} from the National Circus School {{who had been working}} in Belgium.

Although his experience would be limited in the next show due to budget restraints, he would go on to direct every show up to, but not including Dralion.|$|E
5|$|When it {{appeared}} that the war would resume, four of the New England colonies (Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, New Haven, and Plymouth) formed a defensive compact known as the United Colonies of New England. Edward Winslow was already known for his diplomatic skills, and he was the chief architect of the United Colonies. <b>His</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> the United Provinces of the Netherlands during the Leiden years was key to organizing the confederation. John Adams later considered the United Colonies to be the prototype for the Articles of Confederation, which was the first attempt at a national government.|$|E
5|$|A {{characteristic}} of Douglas's work is {{his attention to}} both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by <b>his</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, {{in the cases of}} Rowden Abbey and StMichael and All Angels Church, Altcar, the entire buildings were timber-framed.|$|E
