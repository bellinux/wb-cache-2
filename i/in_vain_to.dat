5|$|Galileo, like Tycho before him, tried <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> {{measure the}} {{parallax}} {{of this new}} star, and then argued against the Aristotelian view of an immutable heavens. The remnant of this supernova was identified in 1941 at the Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
5|$|As {{the only}} member from a seceded state {{to remain in the}} Senate and the most {{prominent}} Southern Unionist, Johnson had Lincoln's ear in the early months of the war. With most of Tennessee in Confederate hands, Johnson spent congressional recesses in Kentucky and Ohio, trying <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> convince any Union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into East Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{continued}} on 23 November as the Germans attempted <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> mount local counterattacks {{to break the}} encirclement. By this time Axis personnel inside the encirclement moved east towards Stalingrad to avoid Soviet tanks, while those that managed to escape the encirclement moved west toward German and other Axis forces.|$|E

That night, they hear Josh's agonized screams in the {{darkness}} but are unable to locate him. Mike and Heather theorize that Josh's screams are a fabrication by the witch in order to draw them out of their tent.|$|E
5|$|The crucial factor which {{frustrated}} firefighting efforts was the narrowness of the streets. Even {{under normal}} circumstances, {{the mix of}} carts, wagons, and pedestrians in the undersized alleys was subject to frequent traffic jams and gridlock. During the fire, the passages were additionally blocked by refugees camping in them amongst their rescued belongings, or escaping outwards, away from the centre of destruction, as demolition teams and fire engine crews struggled <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> move in towards it.|$|E

5|$|The scene {{there was}} chaotic. Large numbers of {{vehicles}} loaded with soldiers were {{moving down the}} road to the rear. Many soldiers on foot were on the road. Champney tried repeatedly but <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> get these men to stop and turn around. The few North Korean mortar shells falling occasionally in the vicinity did no damage except to cause the troops of the 24th Infantry and intermingled South Koreans to panic further and increase their speed to the rear. The road was so clogged with retreating troops that Check had to delay his counterattack. In the six hours he waited at this point, Check observed that none of the retreating troops of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 24th Infantry, could be assembled as units. Military police tried <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> reassemble troops, but they refused even at gunpoint. At 16:00, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, assembling {{in the rear of the}} 27th Infantry, could muster only 150 to 200 men.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the election, the lame-duck session of the old 67th Congress met. Harding {{had come to believe}} that his early view of the presidency—that it should propose policies, but leave whether to adopt them to Congress—was not enough, and he lobbied Congress, {{although}} <b>in</b> <b>vain,</b> <b>to</b> get his ship subsidy bill through. Once Congress left town in early March 1923, Harding's popularity in the country began to recover. The economy was improving, and the programs of Harding's more able cabinet members, such as Hughes, Mellon, and Hoover, were showing results. Most Republicans realized that there was no practical alternative to supporting Harding in 1924.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this discovery, Kate locks herself in her crime lab and tries {{to come to terms}} with what just happened, while the police struggle <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> find any sign of Alice's corpse. These scenes are depicted amongst numerous flashback sequences that comprise most of the issue. Throughout them, back story is provided from her childhood that depicts Kate, her twin sister Beth, and their mother being kidnapped. While Kate's father is able to rescue her, it appears as though both her sister and mother have been killed by the time he arrives.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE regular {{commerce}} began between the Romans and Asia, marked by the Roman appetite for silk cloth coming from the Far East, which was then resold to the Romans by the Parthians. The Roman Senate tried <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> prohibit the wearing of silk, for economic reasons as well as moral ones. The import of Chinese silk resulted in vast amounts of gold leaving Rome, {{to such an extent}} that silk clothing was perceived as a sign of decadence and immorality.|$|E
5|$|Only {{later did}} Pflanz {{find out that}} it was Wick he saw bailing out. Göring had ordered Kriegsmarine torpedo boats on a night-long search-and-rescue mission for Wick. The next day, other naval vessels and the Seenotdienst (air-sea rescue) service, escorted by fighters of JG2, {{continued}} <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> search for him. He was never found, however, and the Luftwaffe declared him missing in action, presumed dead, on 4 December 1940, earning him his last reference in the daily Wehrmachtbericht. Wick, on his 168th combat mission, was the first Oak Leaves recipient to lose his life in combat.|$|E

5|$|Rob-B-Hood {{features}} {{a collaboration between}} Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao. The pair, along with Sammo Hung, were Peking Opera School classmates and co-starred {{in a number of}} action comedy films in the 1980s, including Project A, Wheels on Meals, and the Lucky Stars trilogy. Chan had originally intended to co-star with both Yuen and Hung, reuniting the trio {{for the first time since}} 1988 film Dragons Forever. However, Hung declined due to a scheduling conflicts. Yuen Biao plays the role of Police Inspector Steve Mok, assigned to investigate the baby's disappearance. Some of Yuen's past antics were revisited in Rob-B-Hood, including a fight in which he tried <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> handcuff Chan's character.|$|E
5|$|After {{the passage}} of Tehcir Law on 29 May 1915, Armenians left at the two holding centers were {{deported}} to Ottoman Syria. Most of the arrested were transferred from Central Prison over Saray Burnu by steamer No. 67 of the Şirket company to the Haydarpaşa train station. After waiting for ten hours, they were sent by special train {{in the direction of}} Ankara the next day. The entire convoy consisted of 220 Armenians. An Armenian train conductor got a list of names of the deportees. It was handed over to the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, Zaven Der Yeghiayan, who immediately tried <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> save as many deportees as possible. The only foreign ambassador to help him in his efforts was US ambassador Henry Morgenthau. After a train journey of 20 hours, the deportees got off in Sincanköy (near Ankara) Tuesday noon. At the station Ibrahim, the director of the Central Prison of Constantinople, did the triage. The deportees were divided into two groups.|$|E

5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the left-hand seat, {{to open the}} cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial hypoxia, which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral hypoxia. He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.|$|E
5|$|Following the Annexation of Texas to the United States, Sam Houston {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth to Washington, D.C. as the state's U.S. senator for 13 years, while Margaret remained in Texas raising their children. When he was elected the state's governor, Margaret became First Lady of the state of Texas and was pregnant with their last child. Her brief tenure came on the cusp of the Civil War, {{at a time when the}} state was torn apart over the debate of whether or not to secede from the United States, while her husband worked <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> defeat the Texas Ordinance of Secession. There had been an attempt on his life, and angry mobs gathered in the streets near the governor's mansion. With children to protect, and no government security forces in place, she lived in fear for her family's safety.|$|E
5|$|Immediately the American {{forces were}} hit with machine gun and mortar {{fire from the}} north ridge, where North Korean troops had been dug in. The first burst of machine gun fire killed Chae and wounded {{most of the other}} commanders, {{including}} Mott. Mott managed {{to make it to the}} ditch where American forces dug him a foxhole, but soon after all the Americans in his vicinity were killed or withdrew and he was left alone and unable to communicate with the rest of the battalion. North Korean forces had the US battalion in a crossfire on higher ground, both from the pass and from the ridge. Mortar fire knocked out many parked vehicles, including the radio jeep of a US Air Force tactical air-control party which was to direct airstrikes. During the fight two flights of US aircraft flew over the area trying <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>to</b> contact the party, and when unable to do so, left the area without making any strikes.|$|E
