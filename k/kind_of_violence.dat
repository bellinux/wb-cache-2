5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court that the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did}} not believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E
25|$|Violence in Portuguese schools {{became an}} {{educational}} {{issue for the}} first time during the 1990s, mainly through the persistence of parental associations and teacher claims. However, it must be said that {{this was not the first}} time that violence appeared in Portuguese schools as a significant situation. After the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974 the occurrence of violent situations reached the highest point. This was a politically socialized and framed violence, quite different from the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> we can find today. That one had political programs, this one is quite anomic. Its origin is very diverse, from poverty to psychological problems. Theft, random or systematic physical aggression, bullying, destruction of school or teachers properties are realities which become current in many schools.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{violence}} in Brazil involves {{any type of}} violence or abuse by intimate partners or family members against one another. The majority of domestic violence cases in Brazil are performed by the man against their female partners. In 2015, the Government released a study that showed that at every seven minutes a women {{was a victim of}} domestic {{violence in}} Brazil, over 70% of the Brazilian female population will suffer some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> throughout their lifetime and 1 in every 4 women reports being a victim of psychological or physical violence. Although Brazil acknowledged that domestic violence was a problem in the 1940s, the Government has only acted upon it from 1980s onwards, with the creation of the Women Police Stations (Delegacia da Mulher) and later in 2006, with the publication of the Domestic Violence law.|$|E

As a result, Jehovah's Witnesses live under a [...] "constant fear of being arrested, of losing their jobs, not getting business licenses or government ﬂats, and fearing their children will face trouble in school". However, it has been asserted that religions with pacifist tenets are not predisposed to the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> that would normally {{be associated with a}} threat to public peace.|$|E
500|$|Before he {{shot his}} own head-smashing scene, {{he spoke to}} Gaspar Noé and {{asked him how he}} had done a similar scene in his film Irréversible (2002). Crossing the line from romance to violence, the scene begins with the Driver and Irene kissing tenderly. What they share is really a goodbye kiss, as he then becomes a [...] "werewolf," [...] violently stomping the hit man's head in. Subsequently, Irene sees the Driver in a new light. Of this scene Refn said: Every movie has to have a hearta place where it defines itselfand in every movie I've made there's always a scene that does that. On Drive, {{it was hard for me}} to wrap my head around it. I {{realized}} I needed to show in one situation that driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> to protect innocence. But that scene was never written. As I was going along, it just kind of popped up. In March 2012, Interiors, an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights Refn's use of constricted space and his way of creating a balance between romance and violence.|$|E

40|$|Violence {{is a type}} of {{behavior}} that takes different forms and is also directed at different groups. This {{is one of the major}} societal problems. The main objective of the present study is to examine the relationship between the perception <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and self-esteem levels in Turkish women. The Personal Information Form asked some questions concerning Turkish women’s perception <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> they are exposed to; the frequency <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> they are exposed to and their reactions to the violent behavior. This was administered to 212 Turkish women, using the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Scale. The findings revealed that most of the women (70 %) perceive violence most intensely as physical violence. Another significant finding of this study revealed that when the self-esteem of women increases, the sensitivity to the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> also increases. The findings have also been discussed in the light of similar research findings and finally some suggestions have been made...|$|R

500|$|The {{timing of}} these events later proved to be controversial. Findley was a bitter {{political}} foe of Hamilton, and he maintained in his book on the insurrection that the treasury secretary had deliberately provoked the uprising by issuing the subpoenas just before the law was made less onerous. In 1963, historian Jacob Cooke, an editor of Hamilton's papers, regarded this charge as [...] "preposterous", calling it a [...] "conspiracy thesis" [...] that overstated Hamilton's control of the federal government. In 1986, historian Thomas Slaughter argued that {{the outbreak of the}} insurrection at this moment was due to [...] "a string of ironic coincidences", although [...] "the question about motives must always remain". In 2006, William Hogeland argued that Hamilton, Bradford, and Rawle intentionally pursued a course of action that would provoke [...] "the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> that would justify federal military suppression". According to Hogeland, Hamilton had been working towards this moment since the Newburgh Crisis in 1783, where he conceived of using military force to crush popular resistance to direct taxation for the purpose of promoting national unity and enriching the creditor class at the expense of common taxpayers. Historian S. E. Morison believed that Hamilton, in general, wished to enforce the excise law [...] "more as a measure of social discipline than as a source of revenue".|$|E

Zhirinovsky has led a number of official Russian delegations to Israel, on behalf of the Russian government. Visiting Israel, he says that he is concerned particularly about the economic situation for the more than one million Russians living in Israel. He also states that [...] "Russia will never allow any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> against Israel".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the reasons}} this {{is seen as an}} evil act is because a human rebirth is seen as a {{precious}} and unique opportunity to do good deeds and attain liberation. The Jataka stories contain tales of women who perform abortions being reborn in a hell. In the case where the mother's life is in jeopardy, many traditional Buddhists agree that abortion is permissible. This is the only legally permissible reason for abortion in Sri Lanka and is also a view accepted in the Tibetan tradition as argued by Ganden Tri Rinpoche. In the case of rape, however, most Buddhists argue that following an act of violence by allowing 'another <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> towards another individual' would not be ethical. Aborting a fetus that is malformed is also seen as immoral by most Buddhists.|$|E
50|$|The history <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> {{against women}} remains vague in {{scientific}} literature. This {{is in part}} because many <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> against women (specifically rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence) are under-reported, often due to societal norms, taboos, stigma, and the sensitive nature of the subject. It is widely recognized that even today, a lack of reliable and continuous data is an obstacle to forming a clear picture <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> against women.|$|R

He announced, [...] "we are going to de-recognise Maruti Suzuki Workers’ Union and dismiss all workers named in connection with the incident. We will not compromise at all in such instances of barbaric, unprovoked violence."

After these moral paroxysms, in which she disputed the most obviously right and reasonable things, she was always humiliated and cast down before his sincerity in trying to find a meaning in her difference from him, as if he could not imagine the nervous impulse that carried her beyond the bounds of truth, and must accuse himself of error. When this happened she would not let Charmian take her to task for her behavior; she would not own that she was wrong; she put the blame on him, and found him arrogant and patronizing.

He remarked that the life of the household to which he had the honour to belong was that of a casa regia; which must have been a great change for poor Checco, whose habits in Venice were not regal. However, he was the sympathetic Checco still; and for five minutes after I left him I thought less about the little pleasure-house by the Cher than about the palaces of the Adriatic.|$|E
