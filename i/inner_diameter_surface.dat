40|$|To run both {{smoothly}} and efficiently, high-speed machines need stable, low-friction bearings {{to support their}} rotors. In addition, an oil-free bearing system is a common requirement in today's designs. Therefore, self-acting gas film bearings are becoming the bearing of choice in high-performance rotating machinery, including that used in the machine tool industry. Although plain journal bearings carry more load and have superior lift and land characteristics, they suffer from instability problems. Since 1992, {{a new type of}} fluid film bearing, the wave bearing, has been under development at the NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, by Dr. Florin Dimofte, a Senior Research Associate of the University of Toledo. One unique characteristic of the waved journal bearing that gives it improved capabilities over conventional journal bearings is the low-amplitude waves of its <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>surface.</b> The radial clearance is on the order of one thousandth of the shaft radius, and the wave amplitude is nominally up to one-half the clearance. This bearing concept offers a load capacity which is very close to that of a plain journal bearing, but it runs more stably at nominal speeds...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasonic testing (UT) for primary water leak path assessments of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) upper head penetrations. Operating reactors have experienced leakage when stress corrosion cracking of nickel-based alloy penetrations allowed primary water into the annulus of the interference fit between the penetration and the low-alloy steel RPV head. In this investigation, UT leak path data were acquired for an Alloy 600 control rod drive mechanism nozzle penetration, referred to as Nozzle 63, which was removed from the North Anna Unit 2 reactor when the RPV head was replaced in 2002. In-service inspection prior to the head replacement indicated that Nozzle 63 had a probable leakage path through the interference fit region. Nozzle 63 was examined using a phased-array UT probe with a 5. 0 -MHz, eight-element annular array. Immersion data were acquired from the nozzle <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>surface.</b> The UT data were interpreted by comparing to responses measured on a mockup penetration with known features. Following acquisition of the UT data, Nozzle 63 was destructively examined to determine if the features identified in the UT examination, including leakage paths and crystalline boric acid deposits, could be visually confirmed. Additional measurements of boric acid deposit thickness and low-alloy steel wastage were made to assess how these factors affect the UT response. The implications of these findings for interpreting UT leak path data are described...|$|E

Therefore, it is strongly desired to develop a wearable actuator to use in nursing care or rehabilitation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a high-power flexible actuator with a displacement sensor which can be used in supporting a bathing. In our previous study, we proposed and tested a rubber artificial muscle with the <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> sensor. The <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> sensor consists of two electric circuit boards with two photo reflectors. Two boards are bonded together to contract the <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> sensor. The sensor also has a doughnutshaped bulkhead to keep a seal. The sensor is inserted into the tube of the artificial muscle. The senor is set at the end of tube. This sensor can be expected to estimate the axial direction displacement of the rubber artificial muscle, because the relation between the <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> and the axial directional displacement of the muscle has a strong correlation. However, if the external bending force is applied to the end of the muscle, the <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> sensor cannot hold at the center position of the tube. Therefore, the sensor cannot measure the <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> exactly. In this study, the improvement of the <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> sensor was executed. The improved sensor has 4 photo reflectors on the two electric circuit boards to compensate the measuring error. The position control was also carried out by using the actuator with the built-in <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> sensor. As a result, the axial direction displacement of the muscle could be estimated well by the tested <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> sensor, and a relatively good position control performance was obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Carbon {{nanotubes}} (2. 4 g/g catalyst), {{with large}} <b>inner</b> <b>diameters</b> were successfully synthesized through pyrolysis of methane on a Ni–Cu–Al catalyst by adding sodium carbonate into the carbon nanotubes growth system. The <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> {{of the carbon}} nanotubes prepared by this method is about 20 – 60 nm, while their outer diameter is about 40 – 80 nm. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction were employed to investigate the morphology and microstructures of the carbon nanotubes. The analyses showed that these carbon nanotubes have large <b>inner</b> <b>diameters</b> and good graphitization. The addition of sodium carbonate into the reaction system brings about a slight decrease in the methane conversion and the yield of carbon. The experimental results showed that sodium carbonate is a mildly toxic material which influenced the catalytic activity of the Ni–Cu–Al catalyst and resulted {{in the formation of}} carbon nanotubes with large <b>inner</b> <b>diameters.</b> The growth mechanism of the carbon nanotubes with large <b>inner</b> <b>diameters</b> is discussed in this paper...|$|R

Upon the same increase in <b>inner</b> <b>diameter,</b> the flow rate increased from 66.7 (LMH) to 270.8 (LMH).

40|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> of high {{pressure}} fuel pipe has {{a significant effect on}} the fuel injection process and the performance of a diesel engine. The spray impact force of each nozzle hole of a conventional injection system of pump-line-nozzle for diesel engine (based on the spray momentum flux) and the injection pressure (on a fuel injection pump test rig) were measured. With varying fuel injection quantities and pump speed, the effects of the <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> of the {{high pressure}} fuel pipe on fuel injection process and the fuel injection characteristics of each nozzle hole were analyzed. It was noted from experimental results that the fuel injection pressure changes with variations in the <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> of the {{high pressure fuel}} pipe and also the injection duration gradually increases with increase in the <b>inner</b> <b>diameter.</b> At low injection pump speed, even with the same geometric fuel deliver rate, the injection duration also increases gradually. Due to throttling effect and reduction in injection pressure, the fuel injection quantities of the injection nozzle were relatively minimal when the <b>inner</b> <b>diameters</b> of the high pressure fuel pipe were respectively small and large. The optimum injection pipe <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> for the right quantity for fuel injection falls between the two cases (between small and large). In addition, the injection rate of each nozzle hole increases with the decrease in angle between the needle axis and each of the nozzle hole axis.

30|$|The {{salt ion}} {{rejection}} depends on two main factors, (1) <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> {{of the carbon}} nanotubes (the average <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> of MWCNT is 5  nm) and (2) the surface charge of the material used to fabricate the membrane. Salt rejection reduces with increasing {{the diameter of the}} CNTs (Thomas and Corry 2015). A native PDMS surface is typically negatively charged as demonstrated by Ocvirk et al. (2000). Therefore, the Na+ ions are trapped by the PDMS surface, hence increasing the salt rejection of the PDMS–CNT membrane. During the experiments, initially, the surface charge of the membrane was high, since both the low CNT <b>diameter</b> and high <b>surface</b> charge of the membrane contributed to the salt rejection. After 60  min of filtration, salt ions accumulated {{on the surface of the}} membrane, thus reducing the salt rejection contributed by the surface charge of the membrane, as shown in Fig.  7, wherein the results are in agreement with the investigation reported by Schrott et al.
