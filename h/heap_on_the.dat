2500|$|To {{grasp the}} intuition behind this {{difference}} in complexity, note {{that the number of}} swaps that may occur during any one siftUp call increases with the depth of the node on which the call is made. The crux is that there are many (exponentially many) more [...] "deep" [...] nodes than there are [...] "shallow" [...] nodes in a heap, so that siftUp may have its full logarithmic running-time on the approximately linear number of calls made on the nodes at or near the [...] "bottom" [...] of the <b>heap.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the number of swaps that may occur during any one siftDown call decreases as the depth of the node on which the call is made increases. Thus, when the siftDown heapify begins and is calling siftDown on the bottom and most numerous node-layers, each sifting call will incur, at most, a number of swaps equal to the [...] "height" [...] (from the bottom of the heap) of the node on which the sifting call is made. In other words, about half the calls to siftDown will have at most only one swap, then {{about a quarter of the}} calls will have at most two swaps, etc.|$|E

50|$|Meghe Dhaka Tara is {{strongly}} melodramatic in tone, especially as concerns <b>the</b> sufferings <b>heaped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> protagonist.
