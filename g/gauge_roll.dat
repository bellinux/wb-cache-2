40|$|Abstract. Tailor Rolled Blank (TRB) and Longitudinal Profile plate (LP plate) {{are both}} new {{products}} for materials saving. TRB produced by cold rolling can partially substitute for Tailor Welded Blank (TWB) achieving lightweight in vehicles. LP plate produced by hot rolling can be utilized in shipbuilding, bridge manufacturing and constructions, realizing structures lightweight. This paper stressed the common point of TRB and LP plate: Variable <b>Gauge</b> <b>Rolling</b> (VGR). Basic equations of VGR were deduced, a velocity relationship which assures {{the shape and}} dimension of transition region was provided, a FEM simulation of VGR was performed, VGR experiments were carried out and TRB samples with a thickness ratio 1 : 2 were obtained. All above achievements have established a foundation for VGR’s industrial application...|$|R

There were about 400 locomotives, with only about one hundred fit for use. There were 290 {{passenger}} coaches and thirty three more out for repair. Finally, out of 4530 freight cars and 187 tank cars, only 1389 and 103 were usable. The Romanians reduced the gauge to a standard , so that cars could be run {{to the rest of}} Europe. Also, {{there were only a few}} inefficient boat bridges. Romanian highway engineers decided to build ten bridges: Cuzlău, Țuțora, Lipcani, Șerpenița, Ștefănești–Brăniște, Cahul-Oancea, Bădărăi-Moara Domnească, Sărata, Bumbala-Leova, Badragi and Fălciu (Fălciu is a locality in Romania. Its correspondent in Bessarabia is Cantemir.) Of these, only four were ever finished: Cuzlău, Fălciu, Lipcani and Sărata.|$|R
2500|$|The bulldog-pattern is a blade {{pattern that}} has longer handles to {{increase}} the mechanical advantage of the snips. In tinner's snips this means the handles are extra long.

Tappet adjustment {{was made by}} moving the pivot nut up and down. Some of these designs also required the tappet clearance to be set with the engine running. As this rapidly wore out feeler <b>gauges,</b> long <b>rolls</b> of disposable feeler strip were needed instead.|$|R

2500|$|Tinner's snips, {{also known}} as tinner snips or tin snips, {{are one of the}} most popular type of snips. They are defined by their long handles and short blades. They usually have extra wide jaws and are made of drop forged carbon steel. Depending on the size of the blade, tin snips can cut between 24 and 16 <b>gauge</b> cold <b>rolled</b> {{low-carbon}} tin. They can be ranged in length from [...] long. There are two main types: straight-pattern and duckbill-pattern. Straight-pattern are best for straight cuts, but can handle gentle curves. Duckbill-pattern snips, {{also known as}} trojan-pattern snips, have blades that taper down from the pivot to the tip of the blades. The blade edges are also bevelled to more easily cut curves and circles or shapes. They are a lighter duty snip that can only cut up to 25 gauge mild steel.|$|R
