5|$|Farhan Akhtar {{conceived}} {{the idea to}} remake the iconic 1978 film {{of the same name}} after listening to a remixed version of a song from the original film. In early 2005, media started reporting that Akhtar was planning to remake the film, but rather than confirming the news, he revealed that though he was writing the screenplay based on the film, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> final decision after completing the script. The director co-wrote the film with his father, Javed Akhtar, who had also written the original film with Salim Khan.|$|E
5|$|For three seasons, City {{finished}} in mid-table in Division Three {{and the new}} Division Two, when the leagues were renamed following {{the formation of the}} Premier League. In January 1994, Geoffrey Richmond took over as chairman. He cleared the debts, loaned the club £2.3million, and promised the fans <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> club to the Premier League within five years. In his first season as chairman, the club {{finished in}} seventh place with Frank Stapleton as manager. Stapleton was sacked and was replaced by Lennie Lawrence.

5|$|Promoted to {{the rank}} of brigadier, after the German {{surrender}} in North Africa, Wheeler was sent to Algiers where {{he was part of the}} staff committee planning the invasion of Italy. There, he learned that the India Office had requested that the army relieve him of his duties to permit him to be appointed Director General of Archaeology in India. Although he had never been to the country, he agreed that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> job on the condition that he be permitted to take part in the invasion of Italy first. As intended, Wheeler and his 12th Anti-Aircraft Brigade then took part in the invasion of Sicily and then mainland Italy, where they were ordered to use their anti-aircraft guns to protect the British 10th Corps. As the Allies advanced north through Italy, Wheeler spent time in Naples and then Capri, where he met various aristocrats who had anti-fascist sympathies.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} Operation Momentum brought about more {{extensive}} {{training for the}} Hmong and other hill tribes recruits such as the Lao Theung. Further training of Special Operating Teams of ADC graduates was begun in August 1961, {{with the aim of}} gradually replacing foreign trainers with Lao instructors. In July 1962, the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos put a damper on Momentum operations until the following April. During this lull, Colonel (later Major General) Vang Pao gathered five ADC companies into a battalion-sized Special Guerrilla Unit.

25|$|On 29 November, Vaublanc was {{assigned}} {{the task of}} composing {{a message to the}} King, asking him to withdraw his veto of the decree of 9 November, a decree designed to slow the massive emigrations (then encouraged by the priests and the nobility) by threatening reprisals against German princes who continued to offer refuge to the armies of French noblemen (such as those of the Comte d'Artois, and of the Prince of Condé). The assembly was so pleased with his work that they asked him to read it to the King personally. Louis XVI replied that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> request into serious consideration, and, several days later, personally announced his decision on the matter.|$|E
25|$|The killing began during June 1980. Clark {{came home}} {{one night and}} told Bundy about two teenagers, Gina Narano and Cynthia Chandler, both of whom he had {{picked up on the}} Sunset Strip that day and {{subsequently}} murdered. He had ordered them to perform fellatio on him and then shot them both in the head before taking them to a garage and raping their dead bodies. He had then dumped their bodies near the Ventura Freeway where they were found the next day. Bundy was uneasy upon hearing this news and phoned the police, admitting to having some knowledge of the murders, but she refused to provide any clues as to Clark's identity. Clark told Bundy that, if either of them were apprehended, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> blame in the hope that Bundy would be allowed to go free.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, Shindo, then {{living with}} his brother in Onomichi, was {{inspired}} by a film called Bangaku No Isshō to want to start a career in films. He saved money by working in a bicycle shop and in 1934, with a letter of introduction from his brother to a policeman in Kyoto, he set off for Kyoto. After a long wait he was able to get a job in the film developing department of Shinkō Kinema, which he joined because he was too short to join the lighting department. He was one of eleven workers in the developing department, but only three of them actually worked, the others being members of the company baseball team. At this time he learned that films were based on scripts because old scripts were used as toilet paper. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> scripts home to study them. His job involved drying 200-foot lengths of film on a roller three metres long and two metres high, and he learned the relationship between the pieces of film he was drying and the scripts he read.|$|E
25|$|On Lee’s {{transfer}} to Richmond, he detailed urgent defense construction, {{then he called}} on Lawton’s “earnest and close attention” to the Federal’s probable approach to the city. “It looks now as if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> Savannah River”. Guns located in island batteries were to be removed to the mainland in and around Savannah’s defensive lines. Obstructions in the river above the city were to be set by hands provided by upriver planters {{in the event of}} an envelopment by way of Fort McAllister. “Every effort must be made” to retard or prevent further progress of the enemy directly upriver on the Savannah River approaches. “If he attempts to advance by batteries on the marshes or islands, he must be driven back, if possible.” Scouts were ordered out “so as to discover his first lodgment, when they can be broken up.” An additional three-gun battery at MacKay’s Point was not intended to stop federal gunboats in force, but with Tattnall’s gunboat support, they could prevent Federal batteries from being built on Elba Island to threaten Old Fort Jackson.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June 1893 the {{flagship}} of the Mediterranean fleet, HMS Victoria, collided with HMS Camperdown, resulting in serious damage to Camperdown, but {{the sinking of}} Victoria {{with the loss of}} 358 lives. Vice-admiral George Tryon, who had ordered the maneuvre which resulted in the collision, was amongst those who drowned. It became necessary to find a replacement as commander of the squadron, and Admiral Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, 3rd Baronet was appointed. Culme-Seymour first acquired as secretary Staff Paymaster Henry Rickard, formerly secretary to Admiral of the fleet Prince Alfred, who had just ceased to be commander in chief of Plymouth. Culme-Seymour next telegraphed to Evan-Thomas, requesting that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> post of flag-lieutenant. Evan-Thomas hesitated, because the post was at least on paper less than a lieutenant of his seniority might expect. However, the request was endorsed by Admiral Lord Clanwilliam, and also the first sea lord, Sir Anthony Hoskins. Evan-Thomas went to see both admirals who assured him he had been chosen on merit, as it was felt that under the circumstances the best man possible was required for the post.|$|E

25|$|The 1964–65 league season {{started with}} an Edinburgh derby defeat by Hearts, but Hibs managed {{to recover from}} this setback. Stein then invited Real Madrid for a {{friendly}} game in Edinburgh, which Hibernian won 2–0 {{in front of a}} crowd of 32,000, further boosting his prestige. Wolves asked Stein if he wanted to replace Stan Cullis as their manager. Stein then approached Celtic chairman Bob Kelly, ostensibly to ask his advice about the Wolves job, but in the hope that he would be offered the Celtic manager's post. Kelly first offered Stein the position of assistant manager (to Sean Fallon), which Stein rejected. Kelly then offered Stein the chance to be joint manager with Fallon, but this was also rejected by Stein, who insisted on full control and suggested <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> Wolves job instead. Billy McNeill believed that Kelly's initial reluctance was due to Stein's religion. Kelly eventually agreed to offer Stein full powers over team selection. Hibs tried to convince Stein to stay, even attempting to persuade his wife Jean, but becoming Celtic manager had been his long-held ambition. While Stein was still Hibs manager, he arranged for Celtic to sign Bertie Auld from Birmingham City and allowed Hibs goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson to join Celtic. Some people claimed with hindsight that he had deliberately allowed Simpson to join Celtic before moving himself, but in fact it was due to a wage dispute.|$|E
500|$|Developer Ryan Lambourn {{created a}} flash game called V-Tech Rampage in 2007, which allows players {{to control the}} actions of gunman Seung-Hui Cho in the Virginia Tech massacre. Lambourn professed empathy for Cho, {{and said that he}} was a target of {{bullying}} in high school. [...] "No one listens to you unless you've got something sensational to do. And that's why I feel sympathy for Cho Seung-Hui. He had to go that far," [...] Lambourn stated. On the V-Tech Rampage site, Lambourn posted a statement that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> game off of Newgrounds if donations reached $1000; at $2000 in donations <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> game down from the main site and for another $1000 he would apologize for creating it. Ledonne posted a comment on Lambourn's website after V-Tech Rampage drew comparisons to Super Columbine Massacre, calling Lambourn's statement tantamount to a [...] "hostage note", and asking bloggers to consider [...] "not whether a game about the Virginia Tech shooting SHOULD be made but how we might go about making a game that accomplishes more than V-Tech Rampage does with the subject matter." [...] Ledonne stated that he emailed Lambourn sympathetically, but that the creator responded to his emails with profanity; he reiterated that the two games had different motivations and were not easily comparable in content.|$|E

In his acceptance speech, Burnett declared that he was undecided as to whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> oath of office if elected. This statement alluded to an earlier comment by Turner that [...] "no man who is engaged in the cause of the South could go to Congress and take the oath of office without perjuring himself."
