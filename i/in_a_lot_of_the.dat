25|$|Sony {{was born}} Warrick Swinney in Port Elizabeth on 12 September 1958. He {{grew up in}} the Cowies Hill area of Durban, {{attending}} Westville High School where he played in school-based groups doing covers of songs by Jimi Hendrix and The Who. He was influenced by Indian music and cuisine and by the work of Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart. He learned to play tabla at the Hindu Sarat school in Durban. In 1976 he was conscripted into the South African Defence Force, where he declared himself a Hindu pacifist, and was assigned to medical duties and then to band work. During his military service, Sony played B♭ horn, euphonium and drums. He changed his surname from Swinney to Sony to make it harder for the army {{to get in touch with}} him for camps; he chose Sony because he liked their products. Whilst in the army in 1977, his father brought him a whole lot of punk rock albums from an overseas trip. This was his first exposure to Sex Pistols and the Clash. By the time his two years service was over he had schooled himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post punk Art rock bands as well as reggae and dub and had developed a healthy respect for Shangaan bass players.|$|E
500|$|While Yellowcard {{was working}} on their {{upcoming}} album, Lights and Sounds, they developed a character, Holly Wood, {{who served as a}} narrator and protagonist for the album's storyline. The character also came about when the band began writing about their hatred for life in Los Angeles. Vocalist Ryan Key, in discussion of the character, said, [...] "Holly became this person on the record who appears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs, and at times you love her and at times you hate her. At times she's good to you and sometimes she's bad." [...] Violinist Sean Mackin, also in discussion of the character, said: [...] "...Ryan didn’t have a romantic interest in his life and he didn’t want to write 'Only One' again, and he wanted to create something new. A lot of songwriters narrate and create fictional characters... and Holly was a character where sometimes you love her and sometimes you hate her, and she was someone he could get all his emotions out through." [...] Key revealed that the song [...] "Rough Landing, Holly", which features the Holly character, was his [...] "favorite song" [...] from Lights and Sounds.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{initially}} conveyed as an EP, Reinhart expanded Better into {{a full-length}} LP, {{which served as}} her second studio album. The album was released on April 29, 2016. It includes some tracks that were written as demos several years ago, {{as well as some}} newer tracks, including her cover of [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love." [...] The first song Reinhart wrote for Better, [...] "I Belong to You", is her professed favorite song that is featured on the album. She utilized the original productions and fused them with cuts from a live band to produce a final product [...] "with a powerful, meaty foundation" [...] and material [...] "that people will relate to". Reinhart composed the lyrics for some of the tracks with the help of Swedish songwriter Anders Grahn, and her father provided guitar for the album. The album includes themes of confidence and progress; Reinhart states [...] "even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artwork I’m doing, I have roses represented throughout all the photos. I wanted to tie in something that represents growth and evolution. A rose is constantly growing, blooming, flourishing.” Additionally, she describes Better as a [...] "sultry" [...] mix of funk and rock with a soulful foundation that is crafted to inspire self-confidence and independence in young women, especially through the title track and lead single, [...] "Better." [...] She had already filmed a video for [...] "Better" [...] but delayed its release due to conflicting projects and being presented with several offers from record labels. She did not sign with a label in order to release the album independently and [...] "make sure things were right." [...] However, she professed the possibility of signing with a label in the future. The lead single [...] "Better" [...] was released on April 8, and its associated music video, directed by Casey Curry, premiered through Billboard on April 27. Better debuted at number 22 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart dated May 21, 2016 and sold 7,500 units in its first two weeks of release.|$|E

At the cost of sitting up stiff and stern, as much like those sitting Egyptian images one sees as I could manage, for pretty nearly twelve hours, I should guess at least, on end, I got over it. You'd hardly think what it meant in that heat and stink. I don't think any of them dreamt of the man inside. I was just a {{wonderful}} leathery great joss that {{had come up with}} luck out of the water. But the fatigue! the heat! the beastly closeness! the mackintosheriness and the rum! and the fuss! They lit a stinking fire on a kind of lava slab there was before me, and brought in a lot of gory muck--the worst parts of what they were feasting on outside, the Beasts-- and burnt it all in my honour. I was getting a bit hungry, but I understand now how gods manage to do without eating, what with the smell of burnt-offerings about them. And they brought <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stuff they'd got off the brig and, among other stuff, what I was a bit relieved to see, the kind of pneumatic pump that was used for the compressed air affair, and then a lot of chaps and girls came in and danced about me something disgraceful. It's extraordinary the different ways different people have of showing respect. If I'd had a hatchet handy I'd have gone for the lot of them--they made me feel that wild. All this time I sat as stiff as company, not knowing anything better to do. And at last, when nightfall came, and the wattle joss-house place got a bit too shadowy for their taste--all these here savages are afraid of the dark, you know--and I started a sort of 'Moo' noise, they built big bonfires outside and left me alone in peace in the darkness of my hut, free to unscrew my windows a bit and think things over, and feel just as bad as I liked. And Lord! I was sick.|$|E
