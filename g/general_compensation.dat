Michael Hicks, for example, has suggested that [...] "the heirs of the dead lords... now wanted revenge for their fathers' deaths. They were not particular whether by constitutional trial or by assassination." [...] Warwick especially was held accountable. King Henry VI imposed a reconciliation between the warring factions of St Albans in early 1458, and commanded the various parties, including Clifford, to London. Clifford arrived there, a contemporary chronicler recorded, [...] "with a grete power," [...] and demanded compensation for his father's death. In this, he was accompanied by the other [...] "yong lordes whoos fadres were sleyne at Seynt Albonys." [...] Jointly with Lord Egremont and the new earl of Northumberland, Clifford is believed to have had an army of around 1,500 men in London in early 1458 where, with Egremont and the duke of Exeter, he attempted to ambush Warwick and York on their way to Westminster. It {{is likely that}} they had organised armed gangs for the purpose of arresting the Yorkist lords, if not assassinating them. The Mayor of London believed they came [...] "agaynst the peas," [...] and excluded them from the city. Thus, Clifford and the others were forced to lodge at Temple Bar, between the city and Westminster, probably in a house of one of the various bishops that lined the route. The king, as arbitrator, resided out of London, at Berkhamsted Castle, and Clifford visited him there on 1 March– [...] "presumably to influence the result [...] probably unsuccessfully," [...] says Hicks. Clifford later participated in what was known ceremonially as the 'Loveday' on the 24th of the month, which saw the king arbitrate a settlement between the warring parties. As a result of this, and as part of a <b>general</b> <b>compensation</b> package between the families of the battle's victors and losers, Clifford was to be paid £666 by the earl of Warwick. This was to be shared between John and his siblings.|$|E

50|$|Frantic {{discussions and}} {{dealings}} went on simultaneously in Regensburg, where the Imperial Diet and its Deputation were in session. In particular, many mid and lower ranking rulers who lacked influence in Paris - the dukes of Arenberg, Croy and Looz, {{the prince of}} Salm-Kyrburg, the counts of Sickingen and Wartenberg, among others - tried their chances with the French diplomats posted at Regensburg, who could recommend additions or amendments to the <b>general</b> <b>compensation</b> plan, generally in exchange for bribes. Nevertheless, all claims were examined {{and there was an}} effort to detect fictitious or exaggerated claims. The Imperial Deputation very seldom examined the claims and grievances, which were almost automatically transferred to the local French officials for decision or referral to Talleyrand in Paris.|$|E
5000|$|On 8 October 1802, the {{mediating}} Powers {{transmitted to}} the Deputation their second <b>general</b> <b>compensation</b> plan whose many modifications reflected the considerable number of claims, memoirs, petitions and observations they had received from all quarters. A third plan was transmitted in November and a final one in mid-February 1803. It served {{as the basis for}} the Final Recess that the Deputation issued at its 46th meeting on 25 February 1803. [...] The Imperial Diet approved it on 24 March and the Emperor ratified it on 27 April. The Emperor however made a formal reservation with respect to the reallocation of seats and votes within the Imperial Diet. While he accepted the new ten-member College of Electors, which would for the first time have a Protestant majority, he objected to the strong Protestant majority within the new College of Princes (77 Protestant vs 53 Catholic votes, plus 4 alternating votes), where traditionally the Emperor's influence had been the most strongly felt, and he proposed religious parity instead. Discussions regarding this matter were still ongoing when the Empire was dissolved in 1806.|$|E

50|$|A few {{imperial}} cities {{had been}} included in some of 18th century stillborn secularization plans, chiefly because they were either contiguous to or enclaved within a prince-bishopric targeted for secularization. While the secret compensation provisions of the treaties of 1796 with Prussia, Baden and Württemberg targeted only ecclesiastical territories, {{by the time the}} Congress of Rastatt opened in late 1797, there were widespread rumors about the abolition of at least some cities. Alarmed by such rumors, the imperial cities of the Swabian Circle, where about half of all the imperial cities were located, held a special conference at Ulm in early March 1798 to examine the situation, for which they felt helpless. However, given that it was expected from the start that the handful of the largest and wealthiest cities would maintain their independence, the expected mediatization of the imperial cities did not raise much public interest. The survival of an imperial city often hung by a thread: while Regensburg and Wetzlar, seats of the Imperial Diet and the Imperial Cameral Tribunal respectively, were still on the short list of imperial cities that were to survive in the June 1802 <b>general</b> <b>compensation</b> plan, they were secularized a few months later in order to beef up the newly created Principality of Aschaffenburg that was to constitute the territorial base of Archbishop von Dalberg, the Imperial Archchancellor. In the end, only Hamburg, Bremen, Lubeck, Frankfurt, Augsburg, and Nuremberg survived mediatization in 1803.|$|E

When Léonard was asked about whether the Catholic Church would contribute to a <b>general</b> <b>compensation</b> fund set up for victims of sexual abuse (including those not abused by Catholic priests), he refused stating that [...] "The civil court must determine the compensation and the offender must pay." [...] The Commission was surprised as they thought that Leonard would build on Danneels' testimony and use the opportunity to try to heal the poor relations {{between the government and the}} Catholic Church over the sex abuse crisis. Leonard added that he expected representatives of other [...] "respectable professions," [...] like medicine and sports, to contribute as well [...] "because abuse is not a monopoly of the church." [...] The day after appearing before the commission, tempering his position, Leonard announced that he would voluntarily donate to a [...] "solidarity fund" [...] to compensate victims of sexual abuse [...] "not because we are obliged to do that, but because we want to show solidarity, as we also regularly do for victims of floods or epidemics." ...|$|E

40|$|Current {{proposals}} in the United Kingdom and Canada recommend {{the implementation of}} no-fault compensation schemes for victims of medical accidents. This thesis argues that although such schemes provide an efficient method of distributing <b>general</b> <b>compensation,</b> there is nevertheless a continuing role for the tort liability mechanism. Due {{to the fact that}} tort liability is founded on an ethic of individual responsibility, the potential for public accountability of particular medical professionals will be maintained by preserving the common law action in negligence. There is also an important role for tort law doctrine in reflecting a move away from the traditional paternalistic structure of the doctor-patient relationship towards a desirable shared decision-making model. The fact that compensation schemes are not amenable to these goals indicates the necessity of maintaining a dual system, in order to accommodate the plurality of objectives that should be achieved in this context...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the choice of}} compensation scheme by firms. Our basic model shows that the unique equilibrium choice for profit maximizing duopsonists in a labor market is for one firm to offer a wage rate and for the other to offer a piece rate. This result arises because the firms recognize that, by offering different compensation schemes, they induce self‐selection among workers, which thereby decreases the intensity of competition in the labor market. We find this asymmetry to be robust to allowing for firing, free entry, and a class of more <b>general</b> <b>compensation</b> schemes. When we broaden our model to permit firms to be differentiated {{in the eyes of}} workers (either geographically or by “other working conditions,” e. g.), we find that our results are preserved when differentiation is low, but that both firms choose to offer a piece rate when differentiation is high.
