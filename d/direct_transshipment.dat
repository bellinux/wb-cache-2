5|$|The first {{railway station}} {{to be built}} in Trondheim was located at Kalvskinnet, to serve the narrow gauge Trondhjem–Støren Line railway that was {{completed}} in 1864. The station was designed by Georg Andreas Bull, and still exists as a synagogue. In 1877 the state and city made an agreement to build a new station at Brattøra to serve the new Meråker Line that was being built to Sweden. Brattøra was chosen because it was located directly beside the port, and would allow <b>direct</b> <b>transshipment</b> from ships to the railway of both goods and passengers. The station would become the main station for both railways; this caused a major protest among the local population, who felt it was necessary to have two terminal stations, one for each line, and the city brought the matter before the courts—the case was settled in 1895 in favor of one station. The lack of planning and coordination between the two lines made the new station a large budget cost for the Meråker Line; and described as one of few exceptions to the small-and-cheap policy dominating the state railways i Norway at the time.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simulation {{model of the}} operation of a liner shipping network that considers multiple service routes and schedules. The objective is to evaluate the op-erational costs and performance associated with liner ship-ping, {{as well as the}} impact of individual service schedules on the overall system. The approach proposes a discrete-event simulation model where shipping activities, con-tainer ship operations, and intermodal container move-ments are considered. The model allows for <b>direct</b> and <b>transshipment</b> operations of container cargo, and the evaluation of fuel consumption and other logistics metrics. The model is used to evaluate a liner shipping network consisting of four service routes, up to 64 container ships, and up to 20 ports with diverse physical characteristics and cost components. The results show the contribution of ser-vice routes, ports, container ships, and containers to the cost and performance of the system. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{designed}} to provide an overview of the oil energy import problem and an analysis in a case study format of the various deepwater port alternatives for <b>direct</b> shipment and <b>transshipment</b> of foreign crude oil. This work was initiated prior to the recent expanded energy crisis and although touches on the problems of dependency of the United States to foreign crude oil, the various alternative sources of energy, the essence of this paper is an analysis of the various deepwater port considerations for the direct or indirect importation of foreign crude oil; specifically along the Gulf Coast...|$|R
