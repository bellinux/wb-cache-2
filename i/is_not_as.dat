Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E

This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E

5|$|As {{a public}} university, McGill <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> {{dependent}} on its endowment for operating revenue {{as some of}} its international peers. The McGill endowment only provides approximately 10 per cent of the school's annual operating revenues. Nonetheless, McGill's endowment rests within the top 10 percent of all North American post-secondary institutions' endowments. While McGill's conservative investment policy has protected it from the more substantial losses experienced at many other universities during the market crisis of 2008–2009, it still faced a 20% endowment decline from approximately $920 million to $740 million. Currently valued at $39,323 per student, the university's endowment is the second largest among Canadian universities on a per-student basis.|$|E

5|$|Banksia cuneata is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} from the other two species in B.subg. Isostylis by its brighter flowers and duller leaves. It further differs from B.ilicifolia in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit; and in its sequence of flower colour changes. The leaves, flowers and fruit of B.oligantha are smaller still, and its foliage <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> prickly as that of B.cuneata.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E

Cesar eventually reveals to Nestor that Maria left him for a Cuban mobster in exchange for cancelling a contract hit against Nestor.|$|E
5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity today, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> popular form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used}} to be in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration.

Despite not wishing to reveal much about Boruto due to developments of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, he added that Boruto <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> direct as Naruto. In the 2015 film , Kishimoto developed Boruto and Naruto's relationship from his relationship with his sons.

When Kate Walsh's character Addison Montgomery left Grey's Anatomy to launch the spin-off show Private Practice, Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Izzie.|$|E
