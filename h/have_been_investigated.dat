5|$|Being {{chemically}} stable, neptunium phosphates <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated</b> {{for potential}} use in immobilizing nuclear waste. Neptunium pyrophosphate (α-NpP2O7), a green solid, has been {{produced in the}} reaction between neptunium dioxide and boron phosphate at 1100°C, though neptunium(IV) phosphate has so far remained elusive. The series of compounds NpM2(PO4)3, where M is an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs), are all known. Some neptunium sulfates have been characterized, both aqueous and solid and at various oxidation states of neptunium (IV through VI have been observed). Additionally, neptunium carbonates <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated</b> to achieve {{a better understanding of}} the behavior of neptunium in geological repositories and the environment, where it may come into contact with carbonate and bicarbonate aqueous solutions and form soluble complexes.|$|E

5|$|Entomopathogenic fungi infect {{and kill}} insects, {{including}} {{a variety of}} pest species, so they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated</b> as possible biological control agents. A variety of Ascomycetes, including Beauveria, Lecanicillium, Metarhizium, and Paecilomyces have promising features for use as biological insecticides. Metarhizium in particular can help to control outbreaks of locusts.|$|E
5|$|Hill plotted {{the remains}} of 102 lodges. Pike {{reported}} finding 44 lodges at the village; the difference is {{probably due to the}} abandonment or destruction of lodges and the building of new ones on different sites. At least 90 graves <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated</b> by archaeologists; an estimated 75–100 additional graves are thought to have been opened by relic hunters.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena vitilis contain the {{chlorinated}} compound strobilurinB. Strobilurins are aromatic compounds produced by some fungi {{that help them}} secure resources by giving them an advantage against other competing fungi.

5|$|Cognitive {{abilities}} that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated</b> include concept formation, sensory skills, and mental representations. Such {{research has been}} ongoing since the 1970s.

5|$|Frome is {{reputed to}} have one or more systems of tunnels beneath {{the streets of the}} older parts of the town. Some entrances are visible above ground; for example in the wall at the top of Stony Street, with other entrances in the cellars of shops and houses.

5|$|The {{essential}} oil has displayed antimicrobial properties in vitro, and can {{function as a}} biopesticide, especially regarding Tropidion castaneum beetles and Camponotus maculatus carpenter ants. Several terpenoids isolated from P.atriplicifolia <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated</b> for potential inhibitory effects on the hepatitis B virus. Its traditional use as an anti-inflammatory {{has been attributed to}} the ability of the lignan (+)-taxiresinol and five other compounds to act as leukotriene antagonists. The isorinic acid derivative perovskoate may also contribute to an anti-inflammatory effect as an arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Interaction with opioid and cannabinoid receptors has been proposed as the mechanism of traditionally reported analgesic effects.|$|E
5|$|The first {{volcanic}} activity of Tuzgle occurred 650,000 {{years ago and}} formed the Tuzgle Ignimbrite. Subsequently, lava domes were erupted and three lava flow units were named San Antonio, Azufre, and Tuzgle. The latest lava flows are dated at 17.5 and 1.5 Ma and {{volcanic activity}} may have continued into the Holocene. Several thermal springs {{are associated with the}} volcano, and some <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated</b> for possible geothermal energy production. Sulfur was formerly mined on the mountain.

5|$|In {{locations}} where both snake and salamander co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they {{feed on the}} amphibians with impunity. Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities {{at the same rate}} as the snake further develops its immunity. Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that microbes at this level could be soaking up ultraviolet light from the Sun {{as a source of}} energy, which could be a possible explanation for dark patches seen on UV images of the planet. Large, non-spherical cloud particles have also been detected in the cloud decks. In 2012, the abundance and vertical distribution of these unknown ultraviolet absorbers in the Venusian atmosphere <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated</b> from analysis of Venus Monitoring Camera images, but their composition is still unknown. In 2016, disulfur dioxide has been identified as a possible candidate for causing the so far unknown UV absorption of the Venusian atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The Slavs erected sanctuaries, created {{statues and}} other sculptures, {{including}} the four-faced Svetovid, whose carvings symbolize {{various aspects of}} the Slavic cosmology model. One 9th-century specimen from the Zbruch River in modern Ukraine, found in 1848, is on display at the Archeological Museum in Kraków. Many of the sacred locations and objects were identified outside Poland, for example in northeastern Germany or Ukraine. In Poland, religious activity sites <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated</b> in northwestern Pomerania, including Szczecin, where a three-headed deity once stood, and the Wolin island, where 9th– to 11th-century cult figurines were found. Archeologically confirmed cult places and figures have also been researched at several other locations.|$|E

5|$|The {{territory}} of the powerful confederation of the Hun tribes included about 400 AD the lands of southern Poland, where burial and treasure sites <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated.</b> A woman's grave in Jędrzychowice, Strzelin County contained fancy feminine ornaments and a nicely preserved bronze kettle, which gave a name ("Jędrzychowice") {{to one of the}} two basic Hun kettle types, while a burial of a young warrior-aristocrat including his horse and precious harness, attire and weaponry elements (gold sheet covered ritual bow and sword sheath) was found in Jakuszowice, Kazimierza Wielka County. Still further east, in Świlcza near Rzeszów a hidden Hun treasure was located; this last find dates from the mid-5th century, when the Hun empire was about to crumble.|$|E
