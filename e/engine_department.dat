25|$|Marine oilers {{and more}} {{experienced}} qualified {{members of the}} <b>engine</b> <b>department,</b> or QMEDs, maintain the vessel in proper running order in the engine spaces below decks, {{under the direction of}} the ship's engineering officers. These workers lubricate gears, shafts, bearings, and other moving parts of engines and motors; read pressure and temperature gauges, record data and sometimes assist with repairs and adjust machinery. Wipers are the entry-level workers in the engine room, holding a position similar to that of ordinary seamen of the deck crew. They clean and paint the engine room and its equipment and assist the others in maintenance and repair work. With more experience, they become oilers and firemen.|$|E

2500|$|In 1945 Trans-Canada Airlines (TCA) started {{exploring}} {{a number of}} aircraft developments {{under the direction of}} Jim Bain. Avro of England, who had recently taken over the Victory Aircraft [...] "shadow factory" [...] in Toronto, and started exploring production possibilities with TCA for a twin-engine turboprop aircraft like the Vickers Viscount. In the fall of 1945, Bain travelled to England to visit various aircraft companies, and during his exploration of Rolls-Royce's <b>engine</b> <b>department,</b> saw the early work on what was then known as the AJ65, a new axial-flow turbojet engine. The new engine, later known as the Rolls-Royce Avon, enthralled Bain and on his return to Canada he changed plans for Avro's development to use the new engine instead of turboprops.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952 Northrop {{began work}} on a fighter project, the Fang, with shoulder-mounted delta wing and a single engine. The {{proposed}} General Electric J79 engine, weighing nearly two tons, meant the resulting aircraft would be large and expensive. Then in 1953, representatives from General Electric Aviation's newly created Small Aircraft <b>Engine</b> <b>Department</b> showed Northrop a relatively tiny engine (around 400lb installed wt) capable of 2,500lb of thrust, and Northrop VP-Engineering Edgar Schmued saw the possibility of reversing the trend toward the large fighters. Schmued and chief engineer Welko Gasich decided on a small twin-engine [...] "hot-rod" [...] fighter, the N-156. Northrop began its N-156 project in 1954, aiming for a small supersonic fighter jet capable of operating from the US Navy's escort carriers. However, when the Navy chose not to pursue equipping its fleets in that fashion, Northrop continued the N-156 design using in-house funding, recasting it as a lightweight fighter (dubbed N-156F) and aimed at the export market.|$|E
2500|$|Torsten Billman was 17 {{years old}} when he in Stockholm, 1926, signed on SS Valencia; a cargo-boat plying the Mediterranean. He first worked as a deckhand; too young to sign up for a job in the <b>engine</b> <b>department</b> (under 18 years old). In 1927 he became a coal trimmer. His artistic {{awakening}} was on SS Nippon, in 1928, a bigger long-distance runner plying the Far East. With white school chalk he drew caricatures of his fellow seamen and officers on the soot-blackened walls and bulkheads of the stokehole. Drawings that evoked encouragement from the men in the forecastle and also from the officers. [...] "That ship put my slumbering pictoral talent in motion. I documented and I stored images - this I understood afterwards", Billman recalls. After the next ship SS Nordic, early in 1929, he told his sister, Ingegerd, that he wanted to become an artist. He worked on five different merchant ships 1926-1929 and 1932 as a deckhand (1926–27), coal trimmer and stoker.|$|E
