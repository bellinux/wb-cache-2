5000|$|The SBA review [...] invites {{member states}} to use an [...] "SME test" [...] to assess whether disproportionate effects will be {{realised}} in relation to enterprise size. It has also been recognised that greater regulatory incentives need to be given for SMEs to adopt ISO 14001 or EMAS. The review paper sets out to provide greater networking support to SMEs. It is theorised that by facilitating the use of networks {{it will be possible}} for information resources regarding eco-innovations to be transferred across a broader array of firms, including those from the SME sector. The SBA review also recognises that ‘whilst SMEs have some market incentives to optimise their resource use, in many cases the market signals are not easy to identify’ they also state that ‘SMEs face challenges of limited information, time and human and financial resources’. It has been suggested that to overcome these challenges {{it will be necessary to}} develop incentives such as financial assistance. It is said that the <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>Network</b> will provide incentives for good environmental practice by offering assistance to SMEs marketing products and services resulting from best practice, particularly those adopting low carbon technologies.|$|E
