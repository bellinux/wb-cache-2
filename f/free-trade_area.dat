De Gaulle was always strongly opposed to British entry for many reasons. He sensed the British were inevitably {{closely linked to the}} Americans. He saw the EEC as a continental arrangement primarily between France and Germany, and if Britain joined, France's role would diminish.|$|E
40|$|The recent {{trend towards}} the {{negotiation}} of free trade areas has potentially important implications for agriculture. Agricultural trade will increasingly {{be influenced by the}} treatment of agriculture within <b>free-trade</b> <b>areas</b> and other regional trade associations. Such blocs will have to deal internally with many of the same issues as face the GATT. This will tend to reinforce the move to less trade-disruptive domestic policies. Moreover, independent trade policies become difficult to maintain in a trade bloc, even if there is no common external tariff. This could lead to harmonisation of external policies. As a consequence, the inclusion of agriculture in <b>free-trade</b> <b>areas</b> could be an important part of overall trade liberalisation in years to come. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|The {{world is}} {{experiencing}} {{an increasing number}} of <b>free-trade</b> <b>areas</b> between developed and developing countries (think of NAFTA, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, APEC, the Euromediterranean Partnership, or the free trade agreements between the EU and Turkey, Mexico, South Africa or Mercosur and between the United States and Jordan, most of them still in the transitory period before full implementation). However, most of these schemes are being implemented out of a blind confidence in the positive effects of trade liberalisation regardless of the framework conditions, without much true empirical evidence on their impact on developing countries, let alone a serious reconsideration of the standard trade integration (custom unions) theory to adapt it to the special circumstances of developing countries. Due to the high social transformation potential of international trade, this could ultimately prove a dangerous economic engineering experiment for the development prospects of less developed countries, particularly the smaller ones. After a brief summary of the conventional trade integration theory, the paper refers to five aspects of <b>free-trade</b> <b>areas</b> between developed and developing countries which are not tackled by the this theory and which could question its assumptions predictions: the (high) import and (low) export elasticities which might prove wrong the positive impact on the current account balance of trade liberalisation; the possible working of economies of agglomeration favouring concentration of economic activities in more developed <b>areas</b> of a <b>free-trade</b> area; the eventual preference for industry in low-competitiveness countries which without a certain level of protection might lose any chance of industrialisation; the impact of those <b>free-trade</b> <b>areas</b> on inward foreign direct investment into developing countries, which might be actually negative; and the macroeconomic and political sustainability (far from granted) of those free trade areas. The conclusion {{is that there is a}} need to adapt conventional trade integration theory to the particular case of <b>free-trade</b> <b>areas</b> between developed and developing countries, and this cannot be done from a purely trade theory perspective, but must also take into account development theory and political economy considerations. In any case, a preliminary analysis seems to indicate that this new framework could favour "deep" integration schemes (where trade liberalisation is supplemented by certain legislative harmonisation, monetary stabilisation schemes and even a sizeable resource transfer from developed to developing countries to support the transition process and compensate the losers) instead of the more frequent "hollow" integration processes (consisting of mere trade barriers removal).

Because of the complexity of the system activity, a simulation model has been adopted using discrete event system simulation to realize the system performance analysis method. Finally, an actual case in China is used to verify the performance analysis model, to analyze the operation performance, and to find the bottlenecks of the system operation according to the simulation results.

This paper summarizes research on the motivation for RPM {{as well as its}} impact on prices. The analysis suggests that comparing prices in RPM jurisdictions with those in <b>free-trade</b> <b>areas</b> provides little guidance on likely effects if RPM were permitted everywhere. An analysis of RPM's impact on prices is developed, and then this analysis is employed to assess RPM's welfare effects.

50|$|The aim of a <b>free-trade</b> <b>area</b> is {{to reduce}} {{barriers}} to exchange so that trade can grow {{as a result of}} specialisation, division of labour, and most importantly via comparative advantage. The theory of comparative advantage argues that in an unrestricted marketplace (in equilibrium) each source of production will tend to specialize in that activity where it has comparative (rather than absolute) advantage. The theory argues that the net result will be an increase in income and ultimately wealth and well-being for everyone in the <b>free-trade</b> <b>area.</b> The theory refers only to aggregate wealth and says nothing about the distribution of wealth; in fact there may be significant losers, in particular among the recently protected industries with a comparative disadvantage. The overall gains from trade can be used to compensate for the effects of reduced trade barriers by appropriate inter-party transfers.|$|E

40|$|The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 has {{resulted}} in the GATT Contracting States making a renewed commitment to freer global trade and trade liberalisation. These Contracting States signalled their commitment to GATT policies and principles by undertaking to abolish all those non-tariff barriers which were not converted to tariffs and to decrease all tariffs applied by their domestic economies. The movement away from protectionism is intended to bring contracting states in line with the GATT most-favoured-nation and national treatment principles. The only exceptions to these principles are the regional trade arrangements which can be implemented in accordance with Article XXIV of GATT 1947 and the Understanding on the Implementation of Article XXIV of GATT 1947. Regional trade arrangements such as customs unions and <b>free-trade</b> <b>areas</b> have been allowed by the GATT as they are deemed to promote trade liberalisation through the removal of substantially all trade restrictions between countries party to these trade arrangements. In practice this has not been the case, however, as these regional trade arrangements have been known to apply very protectionist trade policies. This research determines whether regional trade arrangements are inherently protective ie does the nature of these regional trade arrangements encourage protectionism? The external trade policies of the European Union (EU), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) are analysed to determine whether the contracting parties to regional trade arrangements have corrupted the GATT provisions and so contributed towards the protectionist nature of these regional trade arrangements. The internal trade provisions relating to the implementation of these regional trade arrangements have also been discussed to determine their compliance with Article XXIV of GATT 1947. As all the selected regional trade arrangements have direct or indirect links to South Africa, the implications of the policies chosen by these parties for South Africa have also been discussed. Analysis of the EU, SADC, SACU and ASEAN has shown that prior to the adoption of the GATT 1994, the <b>free-trade</b> <b>areas</b> and customs unions were not implemented in accordance with Article XXIV provisions. These regional trade arrangements have been moulded to fit the economic aspirations of the relevant contracting states. Of the regional trade arrangements accepted by the GATT, <b>free-trade</b> <b>areas</b> {{have been found to be}} the least protectionist and are the least likely to be perverted by contracting parties. Customs unions, on the other hand, may encourage contracting parties to protect their economies as they rely on group participation rather than individual participation. Individual Member States become responsible to the group which provides these states with greater economic power. As a result Member States are motivated to protect the new group entity from outside competition. In this way, they are inherently protective. Safeguards are therefore necessary to protect individual non-Member States from such behaviour. The implications of protectionism for South Africa, SADC and SACU have also been discussed...|$|R

40|$|I {{evaluate}} in {{this paper}} the effects of <b>Free-Trade</b> <b>Areas</b> (FTAs) on the incentives for further multilateral liberalization (ML) using a model that emphasizes the role of oligopolistic industries in creating both reasons for strategic trade policies and political pressures aimed to affect trade policy decisions. In this context, I find that FTAs are in general unable to undermine an otherwise feasible ML process. The primary reason regards an identified "tariff complementarity effect," which indicates that a FTA induces its members to reduce their remaining tariffs. This effect reflects mainly {{the reduction of the}} strategic reasons from protection under a FTA, and ensures a move toward "trade creation. " The introduction of political pressures may revert that result. Nevertheless, this would happen only in the presence of coordination failures between the national oligopolies, and even in that case such undermining would be unlikely to occur. ...|$|R
