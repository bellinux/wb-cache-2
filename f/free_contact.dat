40|$|Between 1976 and 1991, fifteen {{people died}} in elephant-related incidences in North America. Six of those deaths {{occurred}} in the 2 years between 1989 and 91. An elephant handler was 3 {{times more likely to}} die on the job than someone in the next most dangerous occupation, coal mining. If you didn't like those kind of odds, you could reduce your risk by joining the police force or fire department.

40|$|South Africa {{has seen}} a recent {{increase}} in the number of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) maintained in reserves and parks and managed in <b>free</b> <b>contact,</b> where they may spend a significant amount of time in close proximity to humans. This study investigates how individual elephants choose to initiate interactions with humans by examining whether interaction types and frequencies vary both between elephants and with regards to the category of human involved in the interaction. Observations were made on a herd of seven captive African elephants frequently exposed to elephant handlers (guides), volunteers (who carry out general observations for the park’s research unit), and tourists. The elephants differed in the frequencies with which they initiated interactions with each category of human and in the types of behaviors they used to initiate interactions. However, all of the elephants interacted most frequently with guides. Certain individual elephants showed preferences in interacting with specific guides, indicating particular elephant-guide bonds. This study provides evidence for elephant-handler bonds as well as information on the extent of interactions between humans and African elephants managed in <b>free</b> <b>contact...</b>|$|E

40|$|The pitch bearing, which {{connects the}} hub and the blades, allows the {{required}} oscillating {{movements of the}} blade, to change the angle of attack thus reducing the lift and drag coefficients there by controlling power and loads of the wind turbine. During the service life of the turbine of approximately 20 years the pitch bearing is loaded dynamically. In a double row four-point contact ball bearing, which is often used for this application, the described loads lead to radial and axial displacements between {{the inner and outer}} ring and deformations. These displacements and deformations lead to contact angles which vary from the mounted contact angle which is given by the supplier of the bearing. These divergent angles are called <b>free</b> <b>contact</b> angles. For a four-point contact ball bearing the mounted contact angle in the presented example is 45 °. Deviations from the mounted contact angle can lead to reduced fatigue life of the bearing and increased wear, arising from the modified contact behavior. Under axial loads and bending moments the contact area shifts perpendicular to the rolling direction. In the worst case the contact area is truncated, which leads to concentrated and comparatively high stresses. This paper shows how the <b>free</b> <b>contact</b> angles of a double row four-point contact ball bearing of a modern wind turbine with 7. 5 MW behaves during the service life and the effects of contact angle variations to the stress distribution. For the analysis a FE-Model of the bearing which includes the stiffness of the bearing and adjacent components is used...|$|E
