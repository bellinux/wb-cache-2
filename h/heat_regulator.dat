25|$|The tongue evolved {{with the}} {{amphibians}} {{from the same}} structures that form fins in fishes. Most amphibians show a proper tongue after their metamorphosis. As a consequence most vertebrate animals - amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals - have tongues. In mammals such as dogs and cats, the tongue {{is often used to}} clean the fur and body by licking. The tongues of these species have a very rough texture which allows them to remove oils and parasites. Some dogs have a tendency to consistently lick a part of their foreleg which can result in a skin condition known as a lick granuloma. A dog's tongue also acts as a <b>heat</b> <b>regulator.</b> As a dog increases its exercise the tongue will increase in size due to greater blood flow. The tongue hangs out of the dog's mouth and the moisture on the tongue will work to cool the bloodflow.|$|E

40|$|Depending upon one's perspective, {{distributed}} control {{has had an}} either extremely long, or extremely short history {{in the application of}} heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) control. HVAC systems have been in existence for the entire duration of human architecture, {{at least in terms of}} heating, with air-conditioning arriving in the 1800 's with the industrial revolution, as a means to improve profits. These systems would be controlled with a human operator in the loop, making decisions to maximize the thermal environment under limited resource constraints. The need for the human was alleviated in 1885 when mechanical <b>heating</b> <b>regulators</b> were brought to the market by Honeywell (the thermostat, although having been invented in 1572, didn't come in to common use until being integrated into a heating unit). It wasn't until the 1920 's that such systems became prevalent. These simple control systems, essentially hysteretic switches, could be thought of as implementing a 'distributed' control task, if there is more than one heating or cooling unit per building. The ultimate goal is to maintain the entire building at a particular temperature, and a set of distributed sensors and actuators act to achieve this goal. With the post World War II economic and building boom, these control ideas became a bit more sophisticated as the use of air-conditioning became more wide spread, but the essential control strategy remained the same: produce a source of heating or cooling, distribute it to the various rooms, and have the rooms locally control their temperatures. Usually a few sensor readings would be brought back to the main heating or cooling units t...|$|R

40|$|The Hsp 100 /Clp {{protease}} complexes of Bacillus subtilis ClpXP and ClpCP {{are involved}} in the control of many interconnected developmental and stress response regulatory networks, including competence, redox stress response and motility. Here we analyzed the role of regulatory proteolysis by ClpXP and ClpCP in motility development. We have demonstrated that ClpXP acts on the regulation of motility by controlling the levels of the oxidative and <b>heat</b> stress <b>regulator</b> Spx. We obtained evidence that upon oxidative stress Spx not only induces the thiol stress response, but also transiently represses the transcription of flagellar genes. Furthermore, we observed that in addition to the known impact of ClpCP via the ComK/FlgM-dependent pathway, ClpCP also affects flagellar gene expression via modulating the activity and levels of the global regulator DegU-P. This adds another layer to the intricate involvement of Clp mediated regulatory proteolysis in different gene expression programs, which may allow to integrate and coordinate different signals for a better–adjusted response to the changing environment of B. subtilis cells...|$|R
