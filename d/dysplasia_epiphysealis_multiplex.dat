40|$|Rigid digits or symphalmlgism {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominant rait which {{can be traced back}} through many family pedigrees. Symbrachydaetylism can involve either the proximal interphalangeal or the distal interphalangeal joints. Brachy-dactylism has been a useful tool and contributed much to the development of medical geaetks. Although the aetiology is unknown, our clinica { observations tend to support he theory that a lack of motion in the foetus causes sympha-langism. Rigid digits fall into three main groups.

A systematic search was performed to retrieve and describe all studies on <b>dysplasia</b> <b>epiphysealis</b> hemimelica. Studies were included if sufficient information on the patient characteristics, lesion location, treatment, and outcomes were described. In addition, we report on 7 of our patients. In our review, 48 studies were found, of which 42 could be included. Owing to the large heterogeneity in the studies, no pooling of data was performed. The studies included 138 patients with 255 lesions. Approximately 27 % were female patients. The age at presentation ranged from 3 months to 66 years; however, in most, the entity was discovered before 8 years of age. No apparent guidelines were presented concerning the treatment strategy; however, most investigators performed resection because of pain or limitations in the range of motion. Most lesions were located in the ankle or foot (139 of 255). In our own cases, 5 of 7 patients experienced pain, limited range of motion, or activity restriction. The mean follow-up period was 4 years. <b>Dysplasia</b> <b>epiphysealis</b> hemimelica is a rare entity, occurring predominantly in the lower extremity of in young male patients.

40|$|A {{skeletal}} dysplasia with previously unreported features is presented. Its evolution {{was characterized}} by growth abnormalities of bones without involvement of other organs. Advanced bone age, increased stature and irregular epiphyseal ossification with stippling of the main long bones were documented. Physeal overgrowth was massive in the left proximal humerus and femur. Furthermore, the hip joint appeared fused with an abundant mass of pathological calcific tissue extending from the femur to the ilium. Pathological epiphyses were characterized by anarchic cartilaginous proliferation with multiple ossification centres, while lamellar bone apposition and remodelling were normal. The observed bone changes were different from those in any previously reported syndrome, metabolic defect or bone dysplasia.

30|$|<b>Dysplasia</b> <b>epiphysealis</b> hemimelica {{is still}} a rare pathology, {{but the number of}} {{documented}} cases is on the rise. When examining a child with swelling in a medial or lateral location in the proximity of the joint, it is mandatory to consider the possibility of DEH, especially if there is a joint deformation with alterations in the range of motion. Diagnosis is relatively simple using X-ray and MRI exams. Histological exams confirm the diagnosis. It is possible to observe bone mass when there are no symptoms; surgical treatment is mandatory when symptoms like pain, joint impingement or deformation are present. Surgical treatment is successful when the mass is juxtaarticular or extraarticular. When the mass is intraarticular, early surgery may cause secondary osteoarthritis. Therefore, if there are no symptoms and skeletal maturity has not yet been reached, only visual examination is recommended.|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Dysplasia</b> <b>epiphysealis</b> hemimelica (DEH) {{is a rare}} {{developmental}} disorder. The underlying pathophysi-ology {{is largely}} unclear.

We describe a 13 -year-old boy who presented with a unilateral lesion of the left medial femoral condyle and left ankle. In addition to standard diagnostic tools such as radiographs and MRI, arthroscopy-guided biopsy was per-formed; histologic/immunohistochemical findings from cartilage-bone specimens confirmed the diagnosis and provided novel information toward a disease mechanism. The cellular phenotype of clustered chondrocytes exhibited characteristics of chondroprogenitor cells and terminally differentiated cells, suggesting dysregulation of resident progenitor cells. No other surgery was performed and dur-ing a 2 year period, we observed spontaneous ossification of the lesion associated with decreased joint impairment. Immunohistochemical analysis of the lesion provided a more accurate diagnosis and may contribute to unraveling potential novel mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis...|$|R
50|$|Tests for {{osteochondroma}} {{can also}} identify {{diseases such as}} secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma and Multiple osteochondromatosis. In large, secondary chondrosarcoma arises {{at the site of}} osteochondroma due to increased thickness of the cartilage cap indicating potential malignant transformation. The symptoms of multiple osteochondromatosis are similar to solitary osteochondroma, but they are often more severe. Painless bumps can arise at the site of tumor and pain and other discomforts can also take place if pressure is put on the soft tissues, nerves, or blood vessels. <b>Dysplasia</b> <b>Epiphysealis</b> Hemimelica (DEH) or Trevor's disease and metachondromatosis (MC) are considered differential diagnosis of both solitary and hereditary osteochondromas. DEH is described as a type of over growth at one or more epiphyses. Similar to osteochondroma, DEH is diagnosed prior to 15 years of age and the growth of lesions end at puberty, when the growth plates close. Metachondromatosis is a rare disorder that exhibit symptoms of both multiple osteochondromas and enchondromas in children and is also inherited in autosomal dominant mode.|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Dysplasia</b> <b>epiphysealis</b> hemimelica (DEH) {{is a rare}} {{developmental}} bone disorder with hemimelic {{involvement of}} one or more epiphysis. We report on nine new cases and discuss the clinical manifestations, the value of MRI, and the results of complete and early surgical resection of these lesions. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, nine patients with a diagnosis of DEH were evaluated. Age at presentation ranged from 1 year to 12 years. The main complaint at diagnosis was a swelling bony mass. Angular deformities were recorded in two patients. All patients were surgically treated and followed up clinically and by imaging. Eight patients underwent excision only. Results: The average follow-up was 5. 6 years (range, 2 – 10. 5 years). All patients had a good outcome without related symptoms. No epiphysiodesis, angular deformity or recurrence was observed. One patient with femoral lesion involving the distal medial part of the epiphysis developed, four months after surgical excision, a calcification outside the area of total excision. This calcification did not increase in size at two years follow-up. Another patient with lateral involvement of the proximal tibial epiphysis presented a postoperative nervous complication. Spontaneous nervous recovery occurred three months after surgery. Discussion: MRI was useful to find a potential plane of cleavage between the epiphysis and the pathological tissue. We recommend early removing ossifications when a cleavage plane is identified. Waiting a possible complication or increasing of size does not seem logical. Of course, the treatment will be not the same if no cleavage plane is found on MRI. PublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|Multiple osteochondromas (MO) is characterised by {{development}} {{of two or}} more cartilage capped bony outgrowths (osteochondromas) of the long bones. The prevalence is estimated at 1 : 50, 000, {{and it seems to be}} higher in males (male-to-female ratio 1. 5 : 1). Osteochondromas develop and increase in size in the first decade of life, ceasing to grow when the growth plates close at puberty. They are pedunculated or sessile (broad base) and can vary widely in size. The number of osteochondromas may vary significantly within and between families, the mean number of locations is 15 – 18. The majority are asymptomatic and located in bones that develop from cartilage, especially the long bones of the extremities, predominantly around the knee. The facial bones are not affected. Osteochondromas may cause pain, functional problems and deformities, especially of the forearm, that may be reason for surgical removal. The most important complication is malignant transformation of osteochondroma towards secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma, which is estimated to occur in 0. 5 – 5 %. MO is an autosomal dominant disorder and is genetically heterogeneous. In almost 90 % of MO patients germline mutations in the tumour suppressor genes EXT 1 or EXT 2 are found. The EXT genes encode glycosyltransferases, catalyzing heparan sulphate polymerization. The diagnosis is based on radiological and clinical documentation, supplemented with, if available, histological evaluation of osteochondromas. If the exact mutation is known antenatal diagnosis is technically possible. MO should be distinguished from metachondromatosis, <b>dysplasia</b> <b>epiphysealis</b> hemimelica and Ollier disease. Osteochondromas are benign lesions and do not affect life expectancy. Management includes removal of osteochondromas when they give complaints. Removed osteochondromas should be examined for malignant transformation towards secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. Patients should be well instructed and regular follow-up for early detection of malignancy seems justified. For secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma, en-bloc resection of the lesion and its pseudocapsule with tumour-free margins, preferably in a bone tumour referral centre, should be performed...|$|R
