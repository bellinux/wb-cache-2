5|$|Despite the game's {{receiving}} general {{critical acclaim}} and selling well, Peter Jackson, {{director of the}} Lord of the Rings film trilogy, stated that the video game tie-in for his next film, King Kong, would not be developed by EA but by Ubisoft. Jackson's manager claimed that despite EA saying the filmmakers were heavily involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> <b>of</b> the game, the developers {{were not interested in}} Jackson's input on the game. Additionally, Jackson had played Beyond Good & Evil, and wanted to work with producer Michel Ancel, who was at Ubisoft.|$|E
5|$|Footage of the Fairchild {{crash was}} used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> <b>of</b> the 2015 film Project Almanac, {{depicting}} an airline accident, which sparked public anger among relatives of Wolff and McGeehan.

5|$|Gaara {{was created}} a foil to the series' eponymous character, Naruto Uzumaki, {{as the two}} were born through similar circumstances, but develop vastly {{different}} personalities due to a troubled upbringing.

In the Japanese version of the series, Gaara is voiced by Akira Ishida while Liam O'Brien replaces him in the English dub.|$|E
50|$|Inedible {{miniature}} food is food models {{made from}} inedible materials, for instance clay and resin. It is more widely and commonly seen comparing to the edible variant as it serves {{a wider variety}} of purposes, for instances jewelry, handcraft and little toys. Also, whilst ingredients are constricted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> edible miniature food, there are fewer limitations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> inedibles miniature food hence it opens up more possibilities in terms of what ingredients and what colouring materials are to be used. The food and the utensils are usually made of polymer clay and dry glue. The artists utilize dedicated modelling tools to mold and shape the food, sometimes utensils such as sewing needle or toothpick are also seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of moldings and shapings.|$|R

5|$|Motohiro {{wanted to}} return to making anime after a long hiatus but he needed a charismatic script writer. Motohiro and his staff were {{surprised}} with Gen Urobuchi's contribution to the highly acclaimed anime series, Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Motohiro was fascinated by Madoka Magica; he read other works from Urobuchi, which persuaded him to talk to Urobuchi. In early 2011, Motohiro proposed to Urobuchi that the pair should work together. Early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> <b>of</b> the series, Motohiro told Naoyoshi Shiotani not to make anything {{that could not be}} adapted into a live-action film.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the abdication, the Oireachtas, the {{parliament}} of the Irish Free State, removed all direct mention of the monarch from the Irish constitution. The next day, it passed the External Relations Act, which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> <b>of</b> foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.|$|E

The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element. The long half-life of the isotope uranium-238 (4.51 years) makes it well-suited for use in estimating {{the age of the}} earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating, including uranium–thorium dating, uranium–lead dating and uranium–uranium dating.

5|$|Williams {{had long}} planned {{to design a}} horror game, but waited eight years for {{software}} technology to improve before doing so. More than 200 people were involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> <b>of</b> Phantasmagoria, {{which was based on}} Williams' 550-page script, about four times the length of an average Hollywood screenplay. It took more than two years to develop and four months to film. Originally budgeted for US$800,000, the game ultimately cost $4.5 million to develop, and it was filmed in a $1.5 million studio Sierra built specifically for the game.|$|E

5|$|After {{studying}} {{architecture and}} then drama, Cartier {{began his career}} as a screenwriter and then film director in Berlin, working for UFA Studios. After a brief spell in the United States he moved to the United Kingdom in 1935. Initially failing to gain a foothold in the British film industry, he began working for BBC Television in the lae 1930s (among other productions he was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> <b>of</b> Rehearsal for a Drama, BBC 1939). The outbreak of war, however, meant that his contract was terminated; his television play The Dead Eye was stopped in the production stage. After the war, he occasionally worked for British films before he was again hired by the BBC in 1952. He soon became one of the public service broadcaster's leading directors and went on to produce and direct over 120 productions in the next 24 years, ending his television career with the play Loyalties in 1976.|$|E
5|$|As {{the family}} gathers around the {{television}} {{to watch the}} local news, Lois states her fondness of the new co-anchor, Joyce Kinney. Later that day, the family attends church, and while there, Lois learns of a local bake sale, and decides to bring her own baked goods. Going to the store to buy ingredients, Lois notices Joyce shopping there as well, and approaches her. The two quickly become close friends, and they decide {{to spend the day}} together at the news studio. That night, Lois and Joyce decide to get a drink together, and share stories. Reluctant at first to tell Joyce her darkest secret, she soon reveals that she was in a porn film when she was in college in the early 1980s, before she met Peter. Expecting Joyce will keep it a secret, as she promised, she is shocked when the local news reveals her participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> <b>of</b> the pornography, and Lois is made a social outcast.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1937, the BSA {{held its}} first {{national}} Scout jamboree in Washington, D. C., attended by 25,000Scouts and Scouters. In addition to overseeing the innovative event itself, Goodman's public relations service did yeoman work to ensure extensive news media coverage. A jamboree press tent accommodated 626 news media reporters, photographers, and broadcasters. Sixty-four news releases were issued and the public relations service assisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> <b>of</b> 11newsreels and 53magazine articles. The three major U.S. radio networks of the time, NBC, CBS and Mutual, all set up complete broadcasting studios near the jamboree headquarters to produce almost 19hours of live, on-site jamboree coverage broadcast coast-to-coast. Celebrities also visited the jamboree, including well-known broadcaster Lowell Thomas and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While at the jamboree, Scouts also attended a three-game baseball series between the Washington Senators and the Boston Red Sox at Griffith Stadium, with Goodman arranging for Eagle Scouts {{to have a place}} of honor with President Roosevelt in the stands (pictured).|$|E
