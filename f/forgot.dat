40|$|Across 3 {{experiments}} {{we examined}} the interplay of part-list cuing and <b>forgetting,</b> employing 3 different methods to induce episodic <b>forgetting</b> { list-method directed <b>forgetting,</b> context-dependent <b>forgetting,</b> and proactive interference. For each form of <b>forgetting,</b> participants were asked at test to recall the target items of a previously studied list, in the presence or {{the absence of the}} list's remaining items serving as retrieval cues. We found such part-list cuing to amplify the <b>forgetting</b> in proactive interference but to diminish the <b>forgetting</b> in list-method directed <b>forgetting</b> and context-dependent <b>forgetting.</b> These results show that the effects of part-list cuing on <b>forgotten</b> memories depend critically on the circumstances surrounding the <b>forgetting.</b> If the <b>forgetting</b> reflects impaired access to the original encoding context, as has been suggested in list-method directed <b>forgetting</b> and context-dependent <b>forgetting</b> (but not in proactive interference), part-list cues improve access to <b>forgotten</b> memories; if the <b>forgetting</b> does not reflect such a contextual effect, no such beneficial effects emerge and access to <b>forgotten</b> memories may even be impaired...|$|R

40|$|People can {{intentionally}} <b>forget</b> previously studied material if, after study, a <b>forget</b> cue {{is provided}} and new material is learned. It {{has recently been}} suggested that such list-method directed <b>forgetting</b> arises because the <b>forget</b> cue induces a change in internal context and causes context-dependent <b>forgetting</b> of the studied material (L. Sahakyan & C. M. Kelley, 2002). The authors compared directed <b>forgetting</b> and context-dependent <b>forgetting</b> by examining whether, like a <b>forget</b> cue, a change in internal context needs subsequent learning of new material to be effective. Participants studied an item list and, after study, received a remember cue or a <b>forget</b> cue or their internal context was changed through an imagination task. In each condition, half the participants learned a second list, {{and the other half}} fulfilled an unrelated distractor task. Both the <b>forget</b> cue and the change in internal context induced <b>forgetting</b> of the first list only when learning of the second list was interpolated. These results suggest that postcue encoding of new material is crucial for both directed <b>forgetting</b> and (some forms of) context-dependent <b>forgetting...</b>|$|R

40|$|One {{way people}} control the {{contents}} of their minds is intentional forgetting—voluntarily <b>forgetting</b> events after they have happened. The events people would most like to <b>forget</b> are unpleasant and emotional. This study used a directed <b>forgetting</b> procedure with emotional and neutral pictures to examine whether people can intentionally <b>forget</b> emotional events as easily as mundane ones. When the to-be-forgotten list was neutral, participants showed successful intentional <b>forgetting.</b> But when the to-be-forgotten list was emotional, directed <b>forgetting</b> failed. Results contribute to understanding the ways that emotion constrains mental control by capturing mental processes including memory retrieval.

40|$|When {{people are}} cued to <b>forget</b> a {{previously}} studied {{list of items}} and {{to learn a new}} list instead, such cuing typically leads to <b>forgetting</b> of the first list, and to memory enhancement of the second. In two experiments, we examined such listwise directed <b>forgetting</b> in children (and adults), using a <b>forget</b> cue that placed either high emphasis or low emphasis on the need to <b>forget.</b> In the low-emphasis condition, (adult-like) List- 1 <b>forgetting</b> was present in fourth graders, but not in first graders (and kindergartners); in contrast, in the highemphasis condition, (adult-like) List- 1 <b>forgetting</b> was present from first grade on. Only fourth graders showed (adult-like) List- 2 enhancement, regardless of task instruction. The finding that first graders showed List- 1 <b>forgetting</b> in the high-emphasis condition only points to a production deficiency in first graders’ directed <b>forgetting,</b> suggesting that the children are capable of intentional <b>forgetting</b> but fail to do so spontaneously. The finding that first graders showed List- 1 <b>forgetting</b> without List- 2 enhancement suggests that the two directed-forgetting effects are mediated by different processes with different developmental trajectories...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} studied how the age {{at which}} words are acquired (Age of Acquisition, AoA) modulates <b>forgetting.</b> Experiment 1 employed the retrieval-practice paradigm to test the effect of AoA on the incidental <b>forgetting</b> that emerges after solving competition during retrieval (i. e., retrieval-induced <b>forgetting,</b> RIF). Standard RIF appeared with late-acquired words, but this effect disappeared with early-acquired words. Experiment 2 evaluated the effect of AoA on intentional <b>forgetting</b> by employing the list-method directed <b>forgetting</b> paradigm. Results showed a standard directed <b>forgetting</b> effect only when the to-be-forgotten words were late-acquired words. These findings point to the prominent role of AoA in <b>forgetting</b> processes...|$|R

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{evidence}} suggested that both emotion and self-referential processing can enhance memory. However, it remains unclear how these two factors influence directed <b>forgetting.</b> This study speculates that directed <b>forgetting</b> of negative self-referential memory is more difficult than <b>forgetting</b> of other-referential memory. To verify this speculation, we combined the directed <b>forgetting</b> paradigm with the self-reference task. The behavioral result suggested that although both self-referential and other-referential information can be directly <b>forgotten,</b> less self-referential information can be <b>forgotten</b> than other-referential information. At the neural level, the <b>forget</b> instruction strongly activated the frontal cortex, suggesting that directed <b>forgetting</b> is not memory decay but an active process. In addition, compared with the negative other-referential information, <b>forgetting</b> of the negative self-referential information were associated with a more widespread activation, including the orbital frontal gyrus (BA 47), the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45, BA 44), and the middle frontal gyrus. Our results suggest that <b>forgetting</b> of the self-referential information {{seems to be a}} more demanding and difficult process...|$|R
40|$|Attempting to {{retrieve}} a target from memory via a retrieval cue can cause competition from the cue's associates, which might block the target. A 1994 study by Anderson, Bjork, and Bjork demonstrated retrieval-induced <b>forgetting</b> for competing associates and suggested that inhibitory control resolving competition causes the <b>forgetting.</b> A 2011 study by Storm, Angello, and Bjork found <b>forgetting</b> for incorrect associates following creative problem solving. This thesis investigated whether such <b>forgetting</b> is also the result of inhibitory control. Competition was manipulated by instructing participants to remember or <b>forget</b> incorrect associates before working on a Remote Associates Test problem. If problem-solving-induced <b>forgetting</b> is caused by inhibition, then to-be-remembered associates should suffer more <b>forgetting</b> than to-be-forgotten associates. Overall, <b>forgetting</b> occurred for incorrect associates participants were instructed to remember and <b>forget.</b> However, the first quartile of trials showed <b>forgetting</b> only for to-be-remembered associates following longer problem solving durations, suggesting a possible role of inhibitory control as an active means to overcome fixation in creative problem solving...|$|R
40|$|Recent work {{suggests}} {{a link between}} sleep and memory consolidation, indicating that sleep in comparison to wakefulness stabilizes memories. However, relatively {{little is known about}} how sleep affects <b>forgetting.</b> Here we examined whether sleep influences directed <b>forgetting,</b> the finding that people can intentionally <b>forget</b> obsolete memories when cued to do so. We applied the list-method directed <b>forgetting</b> task and assessed memory performance after three delay intervals. Directed <b>forgetting</b> was present after a short 20 -min delay and after a 12 -h delay filled with diurnal wakefulness; in contrast, the <b>forgetting</b> was absent after a 12 -h delay that included regular nocturnal sleep. Successful directed <b>forgetting</b> after a delay thus can depend on whether sleep or wakefulness follows upon encoding: when wakefulness follows upon encoding, the <b>forgetting</b> can be successful; when sleep follows upon encoding, no <b>forgetting</b> may arise. Connections of the results to recent studies on the interplay between <b>forgetting</b> and sleep are discussed...|$|R
