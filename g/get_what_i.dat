He {{was the fourth}} of eight children of Doris Marguerite (Wardell) and Rupert Loebig Hartmann, a salesman specializing in building materials.

Ward's sixth studio album Hold Time and contributed a cover version of The Smiths' [...] "Please, Please, Please, Let Me <b>Get</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Want" [...] to the (500) Days of Summer soundtrack. Deschanel penned eleven tracks for their followed-up release Volume Two (2010), where her lyrics touch on themes of romance and self-appreciation. The following year saw both artists performed three songs for the animated musical film Winnie the Pooh, including {{the theme song}} and an original composition named [...] "So Long". For the latter work, Deschanel received a Grammy nomination for Best Song Written for Visual Media at its 54th ceremony.

500|$|On 4 September 2014, Azalea {{announced}} {{that she would be}} reissuing her debut studio album The New Classic. On October 19 2014, the track list of Reclassified was released, which also included [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] as 9th track. On 23 October 2014, the track was available for streaming. A day later, the track was made available as an instant digital download track upon pre-ordering Reclassified via iTunes Stores. [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] was written by Iggy Azalea, The Invisible Men, Jon Mills, Darryl Reid and Jon Turner. It was produced by The Invisible Men and The Arcade. Lasting for a duration of 3:20 (three minutes and twenty seconds), [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] is built on [...] "club-ready" [...] electro handclap-based beats and heavy synthesisers. Lyrically, Azalea talks about her success and goes after her [...] "haters" [...] on the song. At one point, she raps: [...] "Haters gon' hate while critics critique, I pay them no mind whenever they speak / what they make a year I make in a week, I know you can't stand it, just get you a seat!" [...] On the hook, she raps: [...] "Everywhere I go they say it's Iggy SZN / Until l <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want, I ain't leaving… Simmer down bitch / It's Iggy SZN." ...|$|E
500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Many of Scott's later {{journal entries}} also reflect {{a sense of}} foreboding as to her own {{impending}} death. One journal entry in May 1998 indicated her belief she was to die within a year; this entry stated her belief she had accomplished all she could in her lifespan and ended with these words: [...] "This will be my last year, Lord. I've <b>gotten</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can. Thank you for the light you put in me." ...|$|R

2500|$|For {{the next}} three years he worked, alone and {{sometimes}} with the assistance of family members in his studio. [...] Even at that early stage of his career he was highly particular about his work; in an interview at that time he said [...] " [...] plates are nothing to me unless I <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want. I have used thirty of them at a sitting if I did not secure the effect to suit me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fraud {{involving}} {{the appointment of}} a senator to fill the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama is the most notable charge against Blagojevich. Blagojevich was overheard on a recorded phone call saying [...] "I've got this thing, and it's f**king golden. I'm just not giving it up for f**king nothing." [...] He was also recorded as saying, [...] "it's a f**king valuable thing, you just don't give it away for nothing", and that [...] "If I don't <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want ...

2500|$|Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr wrote [...] "How Soon Is Now?" [...] {{along with}} [...] "William, It Was Really Nothing" [...] and [...] "Please, Please, Please, Let Me <b>Get</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Want" [...] during a four-day period at Earls Court in London in June 1984. His demo was {{originally}} called [...] "Swamp". In {{contrast to the}} frequent chord changes he had employed in most Smiths' songs, Marr wanted to explore building a song around a single chord (in this case, F) as much as possible, which also appealed to producer John Porter.|$|E
2500|$|Marr {{recorded}} the song with bandmates Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce that July at London's Jam Studios. After {{a night out}} celebrating the session for [...] "William, It Was Really Nothing" [...] and [...] "Please Please Please Let Me <b>Get</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Want", the trio had reconvened the following afternoon to record what became [...] "How Soon Is Now?". Porter {{was impressed by the}} basic riff Marr showed him, but felt the song needed something else. Their discussion turned to the early recordings of Elvis Presley, which led to an impromptu jam session of the song [...] "That's All Right". During the jam, Marr worked on his chord progression for [...] "Swamp", which inspired the arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|On the February 16, 2015 {{episode of}} Raw, O'Neil {{made a face}} turn and {{reformed}} the Prime Time Players with Darren Young, effectively disbanding Slater Gator. Later that night, Slater stated on social media, [...] "I'm going to start focusing on ME!!! I'm better on my own... It's about time I <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> deserve," [...] cementing their breakup. Shortly afterwards, Slater debuted a shorter haircut. At WrestleMania 31, Slater competed in the 30-man Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, which was won by Big Show. Slater returned to the scenes on the April 20, 2015 edition of Raw {{when he was at}} catering, only to receive an RKO through the table by Randy Orton. On the May 28, 2015 edition of Superstars, Slater picked up a victory against Adam Rose. Slater would appear mostly on Superstars and Main Event losing to the likes of Fandango, Neville, R-Truth, and Zack Ryder. Slater started appearing on Raw, trying to answer John Cena's United States Championship Open Challenge, but was denied each week.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this short paper are {{to dream about}} software engineering science and to think about making this dream alive. In my dream, {{there are no more}} software engineers but "senseware" engineers that build physical space and time augmentations that adapt to human direct and indirect needs. Making this dream alive could be started by providing research and development directions that might make this dream a reached target. Anyhow, it is an awaken-dream which is made and it is mainly synthesized from the author's experience in research and development of software engineering. Moving from today's software engineering nightmare in which "What You <b>Get</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> You Get" to a dreamed world in which "What <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Need" needs to turn science-fiction into "science-vision"...|$|R

2500|$|In a 1993 {{interview}} with Miller, Option wrote that success was a touchy subject for him, quoting Miller's joking {{example of a}} typical review: [...] "Nothing good ever happens to Scott Miller, but somehow he's managed to drag his broken body into a studio {{one more time and}} make another album." [...] Miller continued that he was [...] "past the point of fighting" [...] discussions of how [...] "arty or brainy" [...] he was, but had hoped for greater emphasis [...] "on what the songs are about—be it the boy-girl situation, or being depressed about some key failure I've had, or getting a little bit of understanding about life." [...] In another 1993 interview, Miller mused:I don't think I'm in danger of making albums that don't age well, because I haven't ever fit into the times spectacularly well. I've always been aware of myself drawing on a musical vocabulary so broad {{that a lot of people}} don't <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> consider to be my real songwriting coups. I think they go right past a lot of people. The bad part of that is I probably won't become a big star. But the good part is that I don't think people will find the albums less useful over time. They'll sound as good in 2004 as they will in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mandolin}} {{has been}} used extensively in the traditional music of England and Scotland for generations. Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums, instructional books and DVDs, as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents. The instrument has also {{found its way into}} British rock music. The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield (and introduced by Vivian Stanshall) on Oldfield's album Tubular Bells, as well as on a number of his subsequent albums (particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge (1974) and Ommadawn (1975)). It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne, who featured two members on the instrument, Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe, and whose [...] "Fog on the Tyne" [...] was the biggest selling UK album of 1971–72. The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs. Maggie May by Rod Stewart, which hit No. 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100, also featured Jackson's playing. It has also been used by other British rock musicians. Led Zeppelin's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That's the Way; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page, who composed the song. Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do, and Black Country Woman. Pete Townshend of the Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme, along with many other tracks on Endless Wire. McGuinness Flint, for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single, When I'm Dead And Gone, is another example. Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance, and played mandolin on their hit How Come. One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in the Incredible String Band. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player (beautiful track Pussy Willow), as is his guitarist Martin Barre. The popular song Please Please Please Let Me <b>Get</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Want by the Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr. More recently, the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin, played by Ailidh Lennon, on tracks such as Fight, Start to End, and Medicine. British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs. Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs. The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse. It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney's 2007 hit [...] "Dance Tonight." [...] That {{was not the first time}} a Beatle played a mandolin, however; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo, the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name. The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people. Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin. This song was left off their debut album, and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones.|$|E
