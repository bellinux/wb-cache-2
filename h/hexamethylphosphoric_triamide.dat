40|$|The {{protonation}} equilibria {{of organic}} compounds commonly employed as dipolar nonhydroxylic solvents (including amides, nitriles, sulfones, and nitro compounds) have been measured at 25 C in aqueous sulfuric acid with an NMR technique. The {{definition of the}} protonation parameters pKBH+ and m* allows comparison of the relative basicities in water and in concentrated acids. An inversion of relative basicities is observed between dimethylformamide and <b>hexamethylphosphoric</b> <b>triamide</b> on going from dilute to concentrated solutions. The relative basicity scale for dipolar nonhydroxylic solvents in aqueous sulfuric acid is amides > dimethyl sulfoxide > acetone >> acetonitrile > sulfones > nitromethane.

Kinetic rate constants are reported and half-lives at ambient temperature were about 1 h duration. A systematic study of the disappearance of solvated electrons in HMPA was carried out at several temperatures (from 7 to 27 °C) and an activation energy (85 - 89 kJ mol - 1) is estimated both in the absence and in the presence of lithium perchlorate.

The addition of dimethoxyethane (DME), triglyme (glyme- 3), 12 -crown- 4 (12 -CE- 4), and <b>hexamethylphosphoric</b> <b>triamide</b> (HMPA) to coexisting tetrameric and dimeric MIBLi in THF induces an increase in dimeric population in the order DME < glyme- 3 < 12 -CE- 4 <HMPA. That order corresponds to an increasing strength of complexation between MIBLi (lithium cation) and the (solvating) ligands For either tetrameric or dimeric species, moreover, the negative charge distribution around MIBLi {{does not seem to be}} significantly modified due to the presence of these complexing agents. In striking contrast, complexation of MIBLi by cryptand 211 (K 211) does shift the equilibrium between tetramer and dimer toward the formation of a single monomeric K 211 -complexed species, which gives rise to ca. 13 and 5 ppm upfield shifts at C(alpha) in the C- 13 NMR spectra, compared to tetrameric and dimeric species, respectively. The effect of 12 -CE- 4 /K 211 on the original aggretation equilbrium for MIBLi in THF nicely explains the significantly different MWD of PMMA anionically prepared in the presence of each of these ligands.

A concomitant tricarbonyl(eta(6) -butoxylbenzene) chromium (6) was also obtained in this reaction probably owing to both the air oxidation of n-BuLi and the ring opening of tetrahydrofuran by n-BuLi. The overwhelming abundance of meta and ortho products 9 b and 10 b produced in the substitution reaction of tricarbonyl(eta(6) - 4 -fluoroanisole) chromium (8 b) by lithium phenylacetylide demonstrates that the reaction {{was by no means}} through the straightforward SNAr mechanism. The results provide support for the mechanism proposed by Pauson and Brookhart, in which the nucleophile attacked a carbon of the phenyl ring not bearing the leaving group, followed by hydrogen migration and finally elimination of the leaving group to achieve aromaticity. In addition, compounds were characterized by mass, IR,H- 1 and C- 13 NMR spectra, and elemental analysis.

When these salts were used as the supporting electrolyte, the potential range where polarogram was obtained was the widest when Hex_ 4 N^+ ion was used and the smallest when Dec_ 4 N^+ or Dod_N^+ ions was used. In HMPA solution, the use of the large ion such as Hex_ 4 N^+ promotes the reduction of sodium ion more than that of the smaller ion such as Et_ 4 N^+ Electrocapillary curves at negative potential showed that Et_aN^+ ion was adsorbed on mercury more strongly than Bu_ 4 N^+ or Hex_ 4 N^+ ion.

40|$|The non-alternant {{aromatic}} hydrocarbon fluoranthene (Ar 0) has been reduced, either chemically with Na or Li or by electrolysis, to the radical anion Ar. -; {{in the three}} solvents THF (tetrahydrofuran), DME (dimethoxyethane) and HMPA (<b>hexamethylphosphoric</b> <b>triamide).</b> The UV-VIS absorption spectrum of the orange-brown Ar. - is quite similar in the three solvents and in all instances addition of H +-H 2 O has resulted in quantitative electron-back-donation along with H 2 evolution and recovery of unchanged fluoranthene Ar 0. Thus the usual Birch-type reduction to a dihydro derivative is totally inefficient in the cases under investigation. The two-electron reduction has also been achieved in these three solvents. The greenish-yellow dianion Ar 2 - produced in THF exhibits characteristic UV-VIS absorption patterns, disproportionates with Ar 0 and reacts with H +-H 2 O only to evolve H 2. With DME or HMPA a blood-red species is produced whose absorption spectrum is virtually the same and quite different from that observed in THF. In both solvents addition of H +-H 2 O leads to tetrahydrofluoranthene as a main reaction product but disproportionation is not observed at all in HMPA {{and this is not}} compatible with a regular dianion Ar 2 -. Reaction with D +-D 2 O instead of H +-H 2 O has shown that hydrogenation involves radical abstraction of H atoms from the solvent in both cases; this sheds new light onto the reaction mechanism.

HMPA is an exceptional solvent in that is has a quite large dipole moment but comparatively low relative dielectricity constant. From the molecular shape Ph-CºCH is expected to exhibit anisotropic rotational diffusion which in fact can be deduced from the measured set of T 1 values of the ortho, meta and para carbon nuclei in the neat liquid {{as well as in the}} HMPA solution. This expected result rules the dominance of a linearly molecules pair Ph-CºCH [...] . HMPA along their dipole moment axes as anticipated in view of the large HMPA dipole moment. In order to conform with the T 1 data, a linear arrangement of Ph-CºCH via the interaction between its weakly acidic H-atom with negatively charge O-atom of HMPA molecules seems to lead to such an anisotropic rotational motion. This hypothesis is supported by ab initio QM calculations which come out with higher interaction energy for linear orientation than other geometries.

Plantarflexion of the foot was repeated for 8 min 40 s at a rate of one contraction per second against a 2 kg load inside the magnet. At rest, during exercise (divided into the first one-half [EX 1] and the latter one-half [EX 2]) and at recovery, 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy data sets were acquired every 4 min 20 s. At rest, the phosphocreatine to <b>hexamethylphosphoric</b> <b>triamide</b> (PCr:HMPT) and the inorganic phosphate (Pi) to PCr ratios in the CHF group were not different from those in the normal group.

The degree of change in the PCr:HMPT ratio during EX 1 in the CHF group was not significantly different from that during EX 1 in the normal group; however, the improvement during EX 2 in the CHF group was impaired.

It {{is used as a}} {{clinical}} drug in the treatment of gallstones, cholecystitis, PBC, and PSC and has broad market prospects and important scientific research value [2 – 9]. Kanazawa et al. [10] first synthesized ursodeoxycholic acid in 1954 by reducing 7 -ketolithocholic acid (3 α-hydroxy- 7 -oxo- 5 β-cholanic acid, 7 K-LCA) in n-propyl alcohol by using metallic sodium with a 14  % yield. At present, the industrial production of ursodeoxycholic acid is based on the synthesis process outlined by Kanazawa. Bharucha and Slemon [11] demonstrated that 7 K-LCA could be reduced to UDCA in an electrolyte containing short-chain alcohol, preferably with weakly acidic dipolar additives such as <b>hexamethylphosphoric</b> <b>triamide</b> (HMPA) with ruthenized titanium or mercury electrodes, and a 91  % yield of UDCA could be obtained. Magni et al. [12] stated that a 97  % yield of UDCA could be obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of 3 α-hydroxy- 7 -oxo- 5 β-cholanate using Raney nickel as the catalyst and beta-branched alcohols as the solvent {{in the presence of a}} base at 40  °C and atmospheric pressure. 3 α-Hydroxy- 7 -oxo- 5 β-cholanate dissolved in alcohols could also be reduced to UDCA by hydrogen at a pressure of 0.5 MPa and a temperature of 80  °C catalyzed by Raney nickel, giving a 92.5  % yield of UDCA [13]. In addition, some biological methods are developed in recent years and showed high potential for industrial application [14, 15]. Herein, 3 α-hydroxy- 7 -oxo- 5 β-cholanate was formed by adding hydrate to 7 K-LCA. Currently, there have been very few reports on the preparation of ursodeoxycholic acid by an electrochemical method, despite the fact that it is a relatively simple and safe process that does not require harsh reaction conditions or complicated reaction steps.|$|E
