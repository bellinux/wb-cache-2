5000|$|Estate maps were {{colourful}} {{and often}} intended for display {{as well as}} estate management. [...] "They were drawn and decorated by country surveyors for the information and pleasure of country squires." [...] The choice of scale was down to the individual map maker, but were usually large scale.

[...] "Few land surveyors even attempted to show relief; it was not essential to their purpose of recording boundaries and areas".

But such demands necessitate modifying established patterns, because none agree on the idea that we have conceived of a peaceful passage to agriculture and animal husbandry on the Atlantic façade of Europe. Each fundamental sign on these standing stones will here be reconsidered, and their ‘syntax’ analysed. However, we have no innocence about the subject: as soon as we display the strange desire to question these engravings, we ‘participate’ in an analogical spell attributed to a distant image, we fall as well into those exegetic attempts which pretend to obey to a cultural project wherein it appears they interpret the symbolism but that, finally, tend to renew it, because any <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>symbols</b> is part of their symbolism.

30|$|Practical {{communication}} signals {{may have}} special statistical features. For example, digital modulated signals have nonrandom components such as double sidedness due to sinewave carrier and <b>keying</b> rate due <b>to</b> <b>symbol</b> period. Such signals {{have a special}} statistical feature called cyclostationarity, that is, their statistical parameters vary periodically in time. This cyclostationarity can be extracted by the spectral-correlation density (SCD) function [16 – 18]. For a cyclostationary signal, its SCD function takes nonzero values at some nonzero cyclic frequencies. On the other hand, noise {{does not have any}} cyclostationarity at all; that is, its SCD function has zero values at all non-zero cyclic frequencies. Hence, we can distinguish signal from noise by analyzing the SCD function. Furthermore, it is possible to distinguish the signal type because different signals may have different non-zero cyclic frequencies.|$|R

Finally, the attitudinal questionnaire was given to the participants in experimental group to elicit their attitude towards their practicing technique. The findings revealed that visual medium had significant effect on learning word stress but not pronunciation of target words. Furthermore, using computer as a visual medium increased students’ motivation for both pronunciation and word stress learning. </p...|$|R

It is known that pilot contamination can alter the legitimate transmit precoder design and strengthen the quality of the received signal at the eavesdropper, without being detected. In this paper, we devise a technique which employs random pilots chosen from a known set of phase-shift <b>keying</b> (PSK) <b>symbols</b> <b>to</b> detect pilot contamination. The scheme only requires two training periods without any prior channel knowledge. Our analysis demonstrates that using the proposed technique in a massive MIMO system, the detection probability of pilot contamination attacks can be made arbitrarily close to 1. Simulation results reveal that the proposed technique can significantly increase the detection probability and is robust to noise power as well as the eavesdropper’s power...|$|R

Some stories involve ‘outsider’ characters, who explore the implications of attempting to invent another kind of life outside of the norms of ordinary existence. Existential techniques typical of ‘outsider’ novels, such as the creation of psychic distance and the use of discontinuous structure are used. Scenes are strung together out of sequence like images recalled from memory. Other stories are experiments in the fabulist style. Leaps out of realism challenge the sense of coherence and suggest what might be, rather than what is. The stories contain events verging on the magical or fantastic.
