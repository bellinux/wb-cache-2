30|$|Patients and methods: We {{carried out}} an {{observational}} retrospective study including successively all patients with blood culture positive to K. pneumoniae analyzed at Gaston Bourret hospital, Nouméa, between 2013 and 2015. The hyper mucoid {{character of the}} strains was defined {{by the use of}} the string test followed by molecular analysis to determine the capsular serotype. After a <b>double</b> <b>seizure</b> and anonymization of the data, a bi- and multivariate analysis was carried out according to the mucoid nature or not of the Kp strain and the clinico-biological characteristics of the patients.|$|E
40|$|A {{mutation}} in the voltage-gated sodium-channel Scn 2 a results in moderate epilepsy in transgenic Scn 2 aQ 54 mice maintained on a C 57 BL/ 6 J strain background. The onset of progressive epilepsy begins in adults with short-duration partial seizures that {{originate in the}} hippocampus. The underlying abnormality {{is an increase in}} persistent sodium current in hippocampal neurons. The voltage-gated potassium channel Kcnq 2 is responsible for generating M current (IKM) that is thought to control excitability and limit repetitive firing of hippocampal neurons. To determine whether impaired M current would exacerbate the seizure phenotype of Scn 2 aQ 54 mice, we carried out genetic crosses with two mutant alleles of Kcnq 2. Szt 1 mice carry a spon-taneous deletion that removes the C-terminal domain of Kcnq 2. A novel Kcnq 2 missense mutation V 182 M was identified by screening the offspring of ENU-treated males for reduced threshold to electrically evoked minimal clonic <b>seizures.</b> <b>Double</b> mutant mice carrying the Scn 2 aQ 54 transgene together with either of the Kcnq 2 mutations exhibited severe epilepsy with early onset, generalized tonic–clonic seizures and juvenile lethality by 3 weeks of age. This dramatic exacerbation of the sodium-channel mutant phenotype indicates that M current plays a critical role in preventing seizure initiation and spreading in this animal model. The genetic interaction between Scn 2 a and Kcnq 2 demonstrates that combinations of mild alleles of monogenic epilepsy genes can result in severe disease and provides a model for complex inheritance of human epilepsy. The data suggest that interaction between these genes might contribute to the variable expressivity observed in human families with sodium-channel mutations. In a screen of 23 SMEI patients with missense mutations of SCN 1 A, no second-site mutations in KCNQ 2 were identified...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Autoimmune {{encephalitis}} is a {{group of}} treatable noninfective encephalitic disorders with great clinical implications. They have a close resemblance to prion disease and some slow virus infections. We report the presence of significant titers of antimeasles antibody in some of our patients with autoimmune encephalitis resulting in diagnostic and therapeutic problems. Patients and Methods: Patients seen by us in the last 4 years with high titers (1 : 625 dilution) cerebrospinal fiuid (CSF) antimeasles antibody positivity were reviewed retrospectively. The data collected were assessed using SPSS- Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 15. 0 (IBM corporation) software. The groups which showed elevated antimeasles antibody titers but did not have other parameters suggestive of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (Group 2) were segregated and compared with those who had the typical features (Group 1) using Fisher's Exact Test. Results: There were 33 patients with antimeasles antibody in CSF. Group 1 had 27 and Group 2 had 6 patients. Group 1 had lower age, cognitive dysfunction, slow myoclonus, less generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and focal seizures. Group 2 patients belonged to the higher age, had significant psychosis (P = 0. 02), incontinence of bowel and bladder (P = 0. 0001). Slow myoclonus was significant in the first group (P = 0. 028), and weakness was significant in the second group (P = 0. 028) and double incontinence in the second group (P = 0. 0001). Magnetic resonance imaging showed significant gray matter and cerebellar involvement in Group 2 P = 0. 005 and P = 0. 028, respectively. Conclusions: Patients who show significant titers of antimeasles antibodies in the CSF but belonging to older age group with psychosis, generalized tonic-clonic <b>seizures,</b> <b>double</b> incontinence, focal myoclonus, and electroencephalographic and imaging noncorroborative need to be investigated for autoimmune encephalitis in view of the great prognostic and therapeutic relevance...|$|R
