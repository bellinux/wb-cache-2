5|$|Due to flirtations with {{characters}} of various genders and sexuality, fans have speculated Deadpool as pan- or omnisexual. Writers Gerry Duggan and Gail Simone, {{as well as}} Terry Miller, {{the director of the}} Deadpool film, accepts the fan theory. However, Fabian Nicieza, one of the creators of the character, stated on Twitter that such speculation on his sexuality <b>is</b> <b>invalid</b> because his “brain cells are in CONSTANT FLUX. He can be gay one minute, hetero the next, etc.” The comment upset many fans, for it suggests that Deadpool’s sexuality is linked to his mental disorder.|$|E
50|$|The Federal Circuit court {{affirmed the}} {{district}} court's judgement that ERM did not infringe claims 1 or 13, and that claims 21-25, 27 and 28 <b>were</b> <b>invalid</b> {{for failing to}} satisfy the written description requirement. They did not consider the district court's ruling that claim 21 <b>was</b> <b>invalid</b> for obviousness, since they had already decided it <b>was</b> <b>invalid.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{rational}} nexus test looks at whether the basis for differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those who are grouped together from those left outside the group. To satisfy the second stage, {{there must be a}} discernible basis of classification. All persons being discriminated against by a law must share a common identifying mark that is not borne by those not discriminated against. Examples of such features include gender, age, race, religion, seniority of professional qualification and area of residence. Another feature that has been accepted by the courts as constituting an intelligible differentia is Singapore citizenship. Singling out a person or object with characteristics not peculiar to itself, but which may conceivably be found in other persons or objects, does not constitute classification. If there is no consistent means of identifying the persons treated differently, the differentiation is arbitrary and the law <b>is</b> <b>invalid.</b> If there is an intelligible differentia, the differentiation is not arbitrary in this sense and it is necessary to proceed to the third stage.|$|E
5|$|Two {{varieties}} {{described by}} Derek Reid in 1972, H.aurantiaca var. macrospora and H.aurantiaca var. rufa, {{have since been}} promoted to distinct species status as H.macrospora (1996) and H.rufa (2008). Two other varieties of the fungus have been described, {{but they are not}} considered to have independent taxonomic significance by Index Fungorum: var. nana (Singer 1946), characterized by a small fruit body; and var. robusta (Antonín 2000), characterized by a robust fruit body and an odour similar to Maggi seasoning sauce. Pale forms of the fungus are sometimes referred to as var. pallida. This taxon was first published by Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi in 1953, but later considered invalid as it did not conform to nomenclatural rules. Variety nigripes, a taxon with a black-brown stipe, <b>is</b> <b>invalid</b> for similar reasons. H.aurantiaca var. pallida was published validly in 1995.|$|E

While Hope neglects Liam emotionally during their wedding preparations, Steffy is there for him. Hope watches Steffy and Liam kissing, and dumps him. Liam instantly proposes to Steffy; they travel to Aspen, Colorado days later and marry, despite Hope {{trying to stop the}} wedding. Liam, however, cannot choose between Hope and Steffy, ultimately deciding to be with Hope after finding out that Bill had manipulated him into staying with Steffy. Liam files for divorce in 2012, but still in love with him, Steffy refuses to sign the papers. She eventually signs the papers, freeing Liam to marry Hope. However, Liam still has feelings for Steffy, prompting him to tear up the annulment papers and kiss her. Despite this, Liam and Steffy eventually divorce. Shortly thereafter, Liam believes Hope has left him on their wedding day in Italy. He declares his love for Steffy, but Hope soon tells him of the misunderstanding.

A dark-colored etrog <b>is</b> <b>invalid.</b> If it is green as a leek, Rabbi Meir declares it valid and Rabbi Judah declares it invalid. Rabbi Meir taught that the minimum size of an etrog is that of a nut. Rabbi Judah taught that it is that of an egg. Rabbi Judah taught that the maximum size is such that two can be held in one hand. Rabbi Jose said even one that can be hold only in both hands.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{argument}} that copyright <b>is</b> <b>invalid</b> because, unlike physical property, intellectual property is not scarce and is a legal fiction created by the state.
