40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to interpret the bitumen-aggregate adhesion based on the dielectric spectroscopic response of individual material components utilizing their dielectric constants, refractive indices and average tangent of the <b>dielectric</b> <b>loss</b> <b>angle</b> (average loss tangent). Dielectric spectroscopy of bitumen binders at room temperature was performed in the frequency range of 0. 01 – 1000 Hz. Dielectric spectroscopy is an experimental method for characterizing the dielectric permittivity of a material as a function of frequency. Adhesion data has been determined using the Rolling bottle method. The results show that the magnitude of the average tangent of the <b>dielectric</b> <b>loss</b> <b>angle</b> (average loss tangent) depends on bitumen type. The average loss tangent in the frequency range 0. 01 – 1 Hz is introduced as a potential indicator for predicting polarizability and, thereby, adhesion potential of bitumen binders to quartz aggregates when using Portland cement.

40|$|The present paper {{reports on}} a new module design based on LTCC-PZT laminates. The {{assembly}} of modules is achieved by packaging of ceramic PZT plates between LTCC green layers and subsequent sintering of the evolving multilayer. The challenge exists in avoiding tension cracks at shrinking of LTCC layers on the already sintered piezoceramic during the firing process. Thermal characteristics of several LTCC green ceramic products were investigated, systematically, to obtain crack free ceramic modules. The advantages of a module with full integrated PZT ceramic tiles are the mechanical stabilisation of the piezoceramic, the electrical insulation and the shielding of external environmental influences. More general, our approach combines LTCC microsystems technology and piezo technology and allows for a tremendous improve of functional integration, e. g. sensing, actuation, buried electronic circuits, and strain-stress transformation.
