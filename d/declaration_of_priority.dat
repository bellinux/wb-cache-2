40|$|This {{transcript}} {{of a speech}} given by Labor senator John Faulkner discusses the idea of political integrity and ethics.   No-one ever argues that governments should have less integrity, that elected officials should not be accountable, or that public servants should behave unethically. Broad statements {{of the value of}} integrity, transparency, accountability and ethics gain general agreement from all sides of politics and from all participants in public debate. But government integrity demands more than general expressions of goodwill. Enhancing transparency and accountability requires supportive structures as well as <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>priorities.</b> And cultivating ethical behaviour needs more than simple, sweeping statements of expectations. Nor is integrity in government and in politics simply a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the importance of individuals behaving ethically. Of course, they should behave ethically...|$|R
40|$|This two-part article compares agile, plan-driven, and cost-sensitive {{software}} development approaches {{based on a}} set of project organization principles, extracting from them ideas for pulling agile techniques into cost- and plan-driven projects. Part one, which appeared in October’s CrossTalk, described how the different teams make trade-offs of money for information or for flexibility, and presented the first seven of 10 principles for tuning a project to meet various prioritization of cost, correctness, predictability, speed, and agility. This month, part two presents the last three principles, then pulls the material together for actions that plan-driven and cost-sensitive project teams can use to improve their strategies and hedge against surprises. Being agile is a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>priorities,</b> prioritizing for project maneuverability with respect to shifting requirements, shifting technology, and shifting understanding of the situation. Other priorities that might override agility include predictability, cost, schedule, process-accreditation, or use of specific tools. Most managers run a portfolio o...|$|R

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{contexts and}} contextuality {{as a means}} to analyze the contemporary immigration, which is defined as a factor of global competition in the framework of the first context. The typical research model of ‘donor-recipient’ is supplemented by a third actor - political and economic world centers, and the world’s multinational companies that invite migrants in order to redistribute the labor resources on the most important labor markets. Immigration is used as an instrument to regulate state social policies; immigration contributes to the social and cultural fragmentation of Europe. The second context is devoted {{to the study of the}} rationalization principle as a form of European expansion. Following the conception of A. Touraine, the author defines the rationalization as a form of expansion and as one of the European civilization features that destroys social and cultural constellations. Today Europe is divided into two parts in relation to immigration: the western part (or group of countries) reproduces the immigration model typical for the classic immigration in the past (it is open to immigration); the eastern group of countries reproduces the perception of immigration typical for the old Europe (it is closed to immigration). The determining factor of immigration is the force of attraction of economic and financial world centers; however, the new feature of immigration is that it becomes predominantly nonreturn. The third immigration context is based on the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> culture, traditions and values of the national community. Immigration here is undesirable, non-labor and unacceptable for local labor markets. Immigrants are refugees partly supported by the budgetary funds. Immigrants face high integration requirements such as the study of the language, culture and social norms of the host society...|$|R
