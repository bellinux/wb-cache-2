25|$|Since {{joining the}} EU in 1973, Ireland has {{received}} over €17 billion in EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. These {{are made up}} of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Fund</b> (<b>ESF)</b> and were used to increase investment in the education system and to build physical infrastructure. These transfer payments from members of the European Union, such as Germany and France, were as high as 4% of Ireland's gross national product (GNP). Ireland is unique among cohesion countries, having allocated up to 35% of its Structural Funds to human resource investments, compared with an average of around 25% for other cohesion fund recipients. The Irish economy's increased productive capacity is sometimes attributed to these investments, which made Ireland more attractive to high-tech businesses, though the libertarian Cato Institute has suggested that the EU transfer payments were economically inefficient and may have actually slowed growth. The conservative Heritage Foundation also attributed to transfer payments no significant role in causing growth.|$|E

The research study is significant because it represents the first known academic study of vendor-specific certifications that focuses on the experiences of women. Given the small percentage of women working in network administration, it is hoped that results from this study will provide valuable insights into the challenges such certification presents to women. The paper describes the context for the study. It then outlines why the training providers, both established voluntary sector women’s training centres, and the women trainees themselves chose this particular vendor-specific certification. It outlines results from qualitative interviews with women studying at two Microsoft Academies, The Women’s Workshop in Cardiff (WWiC) and Oxford Women’s Training Scheme (OWTS).

40|$|This report {{deals with}} a Swedish project within the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Funds</b> (<b>ESF)</b> {{programme}} area 2. The overall objective for programme area 2 {{is to increase the}} supply of labour. The report analyses ideas of ethnicity and empowerment in relation to project practices. The methodological approach consists of document analysis, participant observation and qualitative interviews. The source material used in the document analysis consists of the project application and marketing. Nine participant observations have been carried out in the project’s daily activities. Through interviews with one project worker and two participants, different perspectives on the practices and ideas are given voice. The results of the report emphasis that another ethnic background than Swedish often are considered to be an important factor for the individual’s lack of success on the labour market. In the analysed documents integration appears {{to be seen as a}} one-way process, hence it is largely a matter of learning about Swedish norms and culture and displaying an image of a coherent Swedish community. However, contacts between people with dif­ferent backgrounds can be seen as a form of integration activity. These encounters might not have taken place if the project had not been carried through. There is a relatively large discrepancy between the idea of empowerment’s charitable functions, how it is opera­tionalized in practice, and how this is perceived by the interviewed project participants. ...|$|R

40|$|Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) {{have been}} at the heart of {{government}} policy priorities for many decades because of its contribution to the economy and exploitation of the science base is key to improving productivity and growing the market in the Northwest (NWDA, 2006). Against this, black and minority ethnic (BME) groups are projected to account for half the growth in the working age population between 1999 and 2009 and are generally over-represented in SET at undergraduate level in comparison to their white counterparts. It is therefore important that the region makes particular efforts to develop and retain its BME SET graduates. This paper presents findings from a <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Funded</b> (<b>ESF)</b> <b>funded</b> project looking at issues relating to the participation of BME students and graduates in SET degrees and occupations in the Northwest. The study was conducted via survey questionnaires and interviews with undergraduates, graduates and employers. We found that although the desire of BME undergraduates and the actual participation of BME graduates in SET careers at least equaled the aspirations and decisions of their White counterparts BME undergraduates were more likely to want to leave the region and more BME than White graduates had done so. The BME undergraduates in our study expressed considerable concern about whether or not their ethnicity would affect their career prospects although few of our BME graduates, who were primarily employed in large organisations, had actually experienced it. Employers in our survey on the one hand reported few applications from ethnic minority graduates and, on the other hand, the majority admitted that they use informal methods to recruit for available vacancies...|$|R

40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{apparent}} oxygen transmissibility Dk/t) app of four silicone hydrogel (Si-Hy) contact lenses (CLs). A method is described {{that allows the}} estimation of the oxygen tension at the lens-cornea interface for closed- and open-eyelids situations combining the instrument oxygen transmissibility (IOT) and corneal parameters such as corneal thickness, corneal permeability, and oxygen flux across the cornea. From these results, the biological oxygen apparent transmissibility (BOAT), equivalent oxygen percentage (EOP), partial pressure, (ptc), of oxygen at the cornea-CL interface and oxygen flux, (jc), were also obtained. This method allows {{the evaluation of the}} physiological environment under the lens using the formulations described in previous studies. The oxygen performance of four Si-Hy materials was evaluated using a polarographic cell coupled to a permeometer. Measurements of the apparent transmissibility, (Dk/t) app, and permeability, Dk, were performed in stacks containing from 1 to n repeated lenses and, from the values obtained, the error involved in the measurements in single samples was estimated. It was found that the values of (Dk/t) app and Dk obtained following the two different procedures (stack method and measurement of single sample) were significantly different from the nominal values given by the manufacturer, particularly for some samples. However, the impact of these differences on the values of the other physiologically relevant parameters (BOAT, EOP, ptc, and jc) was not significant. Furthermore, these parameters were similar for the four lenses in spite of the different (Dk/t) app measured. The relationships of (Dk/t) app with the remaining physiological parameters were calculated and graphically represented for open and closed-eyelid conditions.

40|$|The Eurozone {{debt crisis}} and {{austerity}} measures have put public authorities under strong pressure. Facing significant financial resources' reduction, the Lombardy regional authority {{has sought to}} use the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Funds</b> (<b>ESF)</b> for occupied workers training, {{in cooperation with the}} Italian Fondi Paritetici Inteprofessionali (FPI), that are Labour Capital joint management commissions. FPI collect and mutualize the employers' compulsory training taxes, and implement training projects. These collective actors contribute to the regulation of the labor market in a private manner. The analysis of this cooperation between private and public actors of regulation through the case of ESF is threefold. First, it assesses the theoretical implications of Putnam's legacy for researches on public-private partnerships in Italian regions. Second, the very argument of regional differentiation is assessed for the case of adult education. On the one hand, the fragmentation argument is confirmed. Lombardy experiences much better rates of employers' membership in the FPI, than other parts of the country. Yet, on the other hand, when it seeks to share ESF with these FPI, the regional council services face a mitigated reception. To understand that paradox, pinpointing the contradiction between ESF general skills ambition and employers' specific skills demands is insufficient. The third argument developed in the article is that other variables need to be taken into account. To do so, literature on the tensions surrounding logics of membership in business associations is mobilized, together with scholarship on the strategic usages of Europe. Eventually, the Lombardy case study is compared with France. It allows identifying common trends in the practices of FPI facing EU norms: avoidance; inertia through strategic usages and reframing; or adoption. The probability to develop one or the other trend depends on the status of the training tax, alternatively considered as a continuation of employees' wages or as a part of employers' investment. That intermediary variable is in turn explained by a set of three variables that shape further research: the degree of competition amongst business associations and FPI; the skills strategies stemming from sector collective bargaining; the discourses held by interviewees on employers' autonomy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Deregulation of {{prostaglandin}} E 2 (PGE 2) levels {{reported in}} colorectal carcinogenesis contributes to key steps of cancer development. Our {{aim was to}} evaluate {{the influence of the}} genetic variability in COX- 2 /HPGD/SLCO 2 A 1 /ABCC 4 PGE 2 pathway genes on the development and recurrence of colorectal adenomas. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted gathering 480 unscreened individuals and 195 patients with personal history of adenomas. A total of 43 tagSNPs were characterized using the Sequenom platform or real-time PCR. RESULTS: Ten tagSNPs were identified as susceptibility biomarkers for the development of adenomas. The top three most meaningful tagSNPs include the rs 689466 in COX- 2 (odds ratio (OR) = 3. 23; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 52 - 6. 86), rs 6439448 in SLCO 2 A 1 (OR= 0. 38; 95 % CI: 0. 22 - 0. 65) and rs 1751051 in ABCC 4 genes (OR= 2. 75; 95 % CI: 1. 58 - 4. 80). The best four-locus gene-gene interaction model included the rs 1346271, rs 1863642 and rs 12500316 single nucleotide polymorphisms in HPGD and rs 1678405 in ABCC 4 genes and was associated with a 13 -fold increased susceptibility (95 % CI: 3. 84 - 46. 3, P< 0. 0001, cross-validation (CV) accuracy: 0. 78 and CV consistency: 8 / 10). Interesting, in low-risk patients the ABCC 4 rs 9524821 AA genotype was associated not only with a higher hazard ratio (HR= 2. 93; 95 % CI: 1. 07 - 8. 03), but half of these patients had adenoma recurrence at 60 months, considerably higher than the 21 % noticed in low-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms in COX- 2 /PGE 2 pathway appear to {{contribute to the development of}} colorectal adenomas and influence the interval time to adenomas recurrence. The definition of risk models through the inclusion of genetic biomarkers might improve the adherence and optimization of current screening and surveillance guidelines for colorectal cancer prevention.

40|$|Die Untersuchung von Maßnahmen der Europäischen Union zur Integration der Roma in der Slowakischen Republik ist das Thema der vorliegenden Diplomarbeit. Den Ausgangspunkt bildet die Beobachtung, dass seit dem Beitritt der Slowakei zur EU im Jahr 2004 zwar zahlreiche Projekte im Rahmen des Europäischen Sozialfonds (ESF) oder von EU Programmen, wie bspw. der Gemeinschaftsinitiative EQUAL, durchgeführt wurden, diese jedoch kaum eine Verbesserung der Situation der Ethnie bewirkt haben. Vielmehr haben die Projekte die soziale Ausgrenzung und Isolation durch die Reproduktion von Stereotypen fortgesetzt. Es ist das Ziel der Autorin anhand der Untersuchung zweier vom ESF finanzierter Projekte die strukturellen Auswirkungen der supranationalen Förderinstrumentarien auf die lokale Projektebene näher zu beleuchten und herauszuarbeiten, auf welche Weise Roma als die Zielgruppe von Projektmaßnahmen konzeptualisiert und welche Zuschreibungen an sie vorgenommen wurden. Ergänzt wird die Analyse durch Empfehlungen für die Durchführung zukünftiger Projekte. Als Grundlage für die Untersuchung werden der ESF und die Gemeinschaftsinitiative EQUAL vorgestellt, die in diesem Zusammenhang als Reaktion der Staatengemeinschaft auf die prekäre Lage der Ethnie in der Europäischen Union zu werten sind. Die Darstellung der Situation der Roma in der Slowakei wird der Projektanalyse unter Berücksichtigung historischer Prozesse und wirksamer Barrieren vorangestellt. Des Weiteren werden mit der Beschreibung der gesellschaftlichen Konstruktion des „Zigeunerbildes“ jene Ursachen beschrieben, die die soziale Eingliederung der Ethnie erschweren. diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of strategies of the European Union to integrate Roma into Slovak society. The starting point is the observation that the minority's general situation hasn't changed although a number of projects have been implemented through the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Funds</b> (<b>ESF)</b> or programmes like the communitiy initiative EQUAL since the accession of the Slovak Republic to the EU in 2004. Instead, the projects have deepened the social exclusion and isolation by reproducing stereotypes and clichés. It's the author's goal to describe the consequences of supranational funding instruments to activities {{on the local level}} by analysing two projects which have been financed by the ESF. Furthermore, it is illustrated how Roma as the target group of the activities have been conceptualised and which ascriptions to the minority have marked the projects. The analysis is completed by the formulation of recommendations for the implementation of future projects. The introduction to the ESF and EQUAL provides the background for the analysis. In this regard both instruments have to be seen as the reaction of the European Union to the minoritie's precarious situation. Grounded on the description of the Roma's situation in Slovakia the analysis includes historic processes and barriers. The societal construction of the image of “the Gypsy” is exemplified as one of the reasons which hinder the social inclusion of Roma. ...|$|R

Aims. We assess {{the validity of}} the free magnetic energy - relative magnetic helicity diagram for solar magnetic structures. Methods. We used two different methods of calculating the free magnetic energy and the relative magnetic helicity budgets: a classical, volume-calculation nonlinear force-free (NLFF) method applied to finite coronal magnetic structures and a surface-calculation NLFF derivation that relies on a single photospheric or chromospheric vector magnetogram. Both methods were applied to two different data sets, namely synthetic active-region cases obtained by three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and observed active-region cases, which include both eruptive and noneruptive magnetic structures. Results. The derived energy-helicity diagram shows a consistent monotonic scaling between relative helicity and free energy with a scaling index 0. 84 ± 0. 05 for both data sets and calculation methods. It also confirms the segregation between noneruptive and eruptive active regions and the existence of thresholds in both free energy and relative helicity for active regions to enter eruptive territory. Conclusions. We consider the previously reported energy-helicity diagram of solar magnetic structures as adequately validated and envision a significant role of the uncovered scaling in future studies of solar magnetism.
