40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was a) to compare the effect of three {{different}} warm-up protocols upon rowing performance and perception of dyspnea, and b) to identify the functional significance of a respiratory warm-up. Methods: A group of well-trained club rowers (N = 14) performed a 6 -min all-out rowing simulation (Concept II). We examined differences in mean power output and dyspnea measures (modified CR-Borg scale) under three different conditions: after a submaximal rowing warm-up (SWU), a <b>specific</b> <b>rowing</b> warm-up (RWU), and a <b>specific</b> <b>rowing</b> warm-up with the addition of a respiratory warm-up (RWUplus) protocol. Results: Mean power output during the 6 -min all-out rowing effort increased by 1. 2 % after the RWUplus compared with that obtained after the RWU (P < 0. 05) which, in turn, was by 3. 2 % higher than the performance after the SWU (P < 0. 01). Similarly, after the RWUplus, dyspnea was 0. 6 +/- 0. 1 (P < 0. 05) units of the Borg scale lower compared with the dyspnea after the RWU and 0. 8 +/- 0. 2 (P < 0. 05) units lower than the dyspnea after the SWU. Conclusion: These data suggest that a combination of a respiratory warm-up protocol together with a <b>specific</b> <b>rowing</b> warm-up is more effective than a <b>specific</b> <b>rowing</b> warm-up or a submaximal warm-up alone as a preparation for rowing performance...|$|R
