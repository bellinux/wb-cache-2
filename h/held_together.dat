5|$|Structure 11 {{has been}} excavated. It {{was covered with}} rounded {{boulders}} <b>held</b> <b>together</b> with clay. It is located {{to the west of}} the plaza in the southern area of the Central Group.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} of solids is weak {{molecular}} crystals (e.g., fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, etc.) where the molecules are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> essentially by physical forces (e.g., van der Waals and hydrogen bonds). Since these solids are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> by weak forces, a very low input of energy is required to break them, thus they are termed “low energy”. Depending {{on the type of}} liquid chosen, low-energy surfaces can permit either complete or partial wetting.|$|E

5|$|During the Late Preclassic {{structures}} were built using volcanic stone <b>held</b> <b>together</b> with clay, {{as in the}} Middle Preclassic. However, they evolved to include stepped structures with indented corners and stairways dressed with rounded pebbles. At the same time, old Olmec-style sculptures were moved from their original positions and {{placed in front of}} the new-style buildings, sometimes reusing sculpture fragments in the stone facing.|$|E
5|$|Madlax {{was often}} {{accused of being}} {{secondary}} and reusing Noir stylistic solutions, such as the story premise, the two heroines' appearance, and the musical style. Nevertheless, some sources praised the story for being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor's, owing to all its episodes and subplots being tightly intertwined and <b>held</b> <b>together</b> by the primary plot.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Barnes & Noble called the writing style fluid and Children's Literature praised {{the story for}} being richly detailed. Kirkus Reviews {{compared}} the story to a patchwork of fantasy elements and characters, then concluded that it, despite being derivative, was exciting and <b>held</b> <b>together</b> well.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{phonation}} is voiceless, {{which means}} it is produced without vibration of the vocal cords; necessarily so, because the vocal cords are <b>held</b> tightly <b>together,</b> preventing vibration.|$|R
60|$|At Westminster {{there was}} an hour's school before breakfast, and when nine o'clock struck, and the boys poured out, Dr. Litter and his under-masters <b>held</b> council <b>together.</b>|$|R
60|$|Oh, {{you must}} {{see that as}} well as I. We're utterly unsuited to one another. And the baby's death removed the only {{necessity}} that <b>held</b> us <b>together.</b>|$|R
5|$|Our {{solar system}} orbits within the Milky Way, a {{barred spiral galaxy}} that is a {{prominent}} member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, <b>held</b> <b>together</b> by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.|$|E
5|$|A hadron is a {{composite}} particle made of quarks <b>held</b> <b>together</b> by the strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) made of one quark and one antiquark. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.|$|E
5|$|Although {{competitions}} are {{no longer}} held outdoors, the most important competitions (Olympics, World Championships, World Cups) are still scheduled for the Northern Hemisphere summer season because they are combined with outdoor events. Many lesser international events, however, are held during the European indoor season between October and March, culminating in the European Championships each year. Most of these competitions are multi-day events <b>held</b> <b>together</b> with air rifle matches.|$|E
5000|$|I am {{very sorry}} indeed. I met him on many {{occasions}} and admired the skill and statesmanship with which he <b>held</b> Jordan <b>together.</b> (UK former Prime Minister James Callaghan) ...|$|R
6000|$|A moment's pause. [...] "Wait!" [...] he said, {{and broke}} off. He hesitated. [...] "Good-bye," [...] {{he said as}} though he was {{snapping}} a thread that <b>held</b> them <b>together.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{never did}} enforce my title of Aunt, {{in spite of}} Miss Woolmer's advice. It sounded too ridiculous, and would have {{hindered}} the sisterly feeling that <b>held</b> us <b>together.</b>|$|R
5|$|By 1796, {{the end of}} George Washington's eighth year as {{president}} of the United States, the United States' strategic position was dire. Interstate rivalries, violent insurrections (such as the Whiskey Rebellion), and solidifying opposition to the national government {{in the form of the}} Anti-Federalist Party combined with its dependence on trade with Europe to weaken the new nation. During this time, the country's increasingly-brittle government was <b>held</b> <b>together</b> almost entirely by Washington's charismatic authority.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{happiness}} of Bobby Dodd's early life came to a sad end in 1924 when his father committed suicide due to business failure and financial troubles. The family was forced to move, but was <b>held</b> <b>together</b> by the perseverance of Dodd's mother. During the next three seasons, the Kingsport Indians were very successful, gaining two state titles. They were helped by Dodd, who moved from receiver to quarterback and kicker. In 1926, Bobby Dodd graduated and {{was admitted to the}} University of Tennessee with a football scholarship.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines <b>held</b> <b>together</b> by a common meter alone.|$|E
50|$|During 2016 design {{workshops}} {{are being}} <b>held</b> bringing <b>together</b> the Urban&Civic and RLW Estates design teams, key local authority partners, the parish council, neighbourhood plan working group, and local residents.|$|R

5|$|Not {{much detail}} {{is known about}} Bhimsen Thapa's early life. At the age of 11, Bhimsen {{possibly}} {{came into contact with}} the Nepalese Royal Palace when his bratabandha ceremony was <b>held</b> <b>together</b> with the Crown Prince Rana Bahadur's in Gorkha in 1785. In 1798, his father took him to Kathmandu and enrolled him as a bodyguard to the king. In Kathmandu, Bhimsen took up residence at Thapathali Durbar, after which he lived in Bagh Durbar near Tundikhel after becoming a kaji (equivalent to a minister).|$|E
5|$|The Smart Cover, {{introduced}} {{with the}} iPad 2, is a screen protector that magnetically {{attaches to the}} face of the iPad. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also <b>held</b> <b>together</b> by magnets. The Smart Cover can also assume other positions by folding it. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad, and wakes up the unit when the cover is removed. It comes in five colors of both polyurethane and the more expensive leather.|$|E
5|$|The {{floor of}} the barn was {{originally}} made of hard-packed flint gravel <b>held</b> <b>together</b> with iron panning, excavated from a local gravel deposit, which {{was used as a}} more readily available alternative to stone. In subsequent years it was repaired with brick, tile and, ultimately, cement, obscuring the original appearance of the floor. An indication of how it would have looked can still be obtained from the outside of {{the west side of the}} barn.|$|E
60|$|Deronda's anguish was intolerable. He {{could not}} help himself. He seized her outstretched hands and <b>held</b> them <b>together,</b> and kneeled at her feet. She {{was the victim of}} his happiness.|$|R
50|$|Another {{variation}} {{is where the}} slappee has their hands <b>held</b> palms <b>together,</b> <b>held</b> out at mid-torso height; the slapper then does {{the same with the}} tips of the fingers of both players hands around a centimetre apart, and then (with just one of their hands) the slapper tries to slap the backs of the slappee's hands. You can slap the slappee's hands with just one of your hands as a strategical move.|$|R
25|$|Glue (2001) was {{a return}} to the locations, themes and episodic form of Trainspotting, telling the stories of four {{characters}} spanning several decades in their lives and the bonds that <b>held</b> them <b>together.</b>|$|R
5|$|The helmet was too fragile to be {{excavated}} in situ so it {{was removed}} within a block of earth <b>held</b> <b>together</b> with plaster of Paris. It {{was taken to the}} British Museum in London for conservation, which took nine years of work by conservator Marilyn Hockey and her colleagues Fleur Shearman and Duygu Çamurcuoğlu. Corrosion and the effects of time had shattered the helmet into thousands of pieces, most of which were smaller than the nail on a person's little finger. The reconstructed and conserved helmet was unveiled in January 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{proboscis}} (plural – proboscises) {{is formed}} from maxillary galeae and is adapted for sucking nectar. It {{consists of two}} tubes <b>held</b> <b>together</b> by hooks and separable for cleaning. Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a central tube up which moisture is sucked. Suction is effected through the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head. The proboscis is coiled under the head when the insect is at rest and extended only when feeding. The maxillary palpi are reduced and even vestigial. They are conspicuous and five-segmented {{in some of the}} more basal families and are often folded.|$|E
5|$|The quarks are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> by {{the strong}} {{interaction}} (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, {{are held to}} each other in the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.|$|E
50|$|DOHC (Dual Over-head Cam) Air Swipe - Similar to {{the baby}} swipe. It {{utilizes}} the momentum and the torque gain from the air flare. Both legs are <b>held</b> tightly <b>together</b> to increase rotational speed.|$|R
