50|$|A {{chain loop}} must be of an {{appropriate}} length {{in order to}} run safely. This is described {{by the number of}} <b>drive</b> <b>links.</b> This number is determined by the length and type of bar, the sprocket size and the overall configuration of the saw. For replacement purposes, simply count the <b>drive</b> <b>links</b> on the old chain.|$|R

50|$|The oil {{is pumped}} {{from a small}} pump to {{a hole in the}} bar. From here the lower ends of each chain <b>drive</b> <b>link</b> take a portion of the oil into the gauge towards the bar nose. Pump outlet and bar hole must be aligned. Since the bar is moving out and inwards {{depending}} on the chain length, the oil outlet on the saw side has a banana style long shape.|$|E
50|$|On 18 February 2016 Haryanto was {{confirmed}} {{as a driver}} of Manor Racing for the 2016 Formula One season alongside 2015 DTM Champion Pascal Wehrlein. He made his debut at the 2016 Australian Grand Prix on Friday, 18 March 2016. He finished his first and second free practice at 19th and 14th place respectively. Haryanto finished the third free practice in 22nd position. He {{was involved in a}} major incident which occurred just seconds after the beginning of the third practice session, when Haryanto and Romain Grosjean collided in the pit lane. Haryanto was later issued a three-place grid penalty for the incident, as well as two penalty points added to his licence. Haryanto retired from his debut race due to a <b>drive</b> <b>link</b> problem on the 18th lap.|$|E
5000|$|Usually each segment in this chain (which is {{constructed}} from riveted metal sections {{similar to a}} bicycle chain, but without rollers) features small sharp cutting teeth. Each tooth {{takes the form of}} a folded tab of chromium-plated steel with a sharp angular or curved corner and two cutting edges, one on the top plate and one on the side plate. Left-handed and right-handed teeth are alternated in the chain. Chains come in varying pitch and gauge; the pitch of a chain is defined as half of the length spanned by any three consecutive rivets (e.g., 8 mm, 0.325 inch), while the gauge is the thickness of the <b>drive</b> <b>link</b> where it fits into the guide bar (e.g., 1.5 mm, 0.05 inch). Conventional [...] "full complement" [...] chain has one tooth for every two drive links. [...] "Full skip" [...] chain has one tooth for every three drive links. Built into each tooth is a depth gauge or [...] "raker" [...] which rides ahead of the tooth and limits the depth of cut, typically to around 0.5 mm (0.025"). Depth gauges are critical to safe chain operation. If left too high they will cause very slow cutting, if filed too low the chain will become more prone to kick back. Low depth gauges will also cause the saw to vibrate excessively. Vibration is not only uncomfortable for the operator but is also detrimental to the saw.|$|E
5000|$|Chainsaw cutting chains superficially {{resemble}} {{roller chains}} but are {{more closely related}} to leaf chains. They are driven by projecting <b>drive</b> <b>links</b> which also serve to locate the chain onto the bar.|$|R
50|$|The terms used to {{describe}} chain arrangements can be confusing. Most modern chains do not have only cutter teeth and <b>drive</b> <b>links.</b> There are tie straps which separate the cutters from each other.|$|R

40|$|The term {{precision}} linear actuator, {{direct drive}} (PLADD) {{refers to a}} robust linear actuator designed {{to be capable of}} repeatedly performing, over a lifetime of the order of 5 to 10 years, positioning maneuvers that include, variously, submicron increments or slews of the order of a centimeter. The PLADD is capable of both long stroke (120 mm) and high resolution (repeatable increments of 20 nm). Unlike precise linear actuators of prior design, the PLADD contains no gears, levers, or hydraulic converters. The PLADD, now at the prototype stage of development, is intended for original use as a coarse-positioning actuator in a spaceborne interferometer. The PLADD could also be adapted to terrestrial applications in which there are requirements for long stroke and high resolution: potential applications include medical imaging and fabrication of semiconductor devices. The PLADD (see figure) includes a commercially available ball-screw actuator driven directly by a commercially available three-phase brushless DC motor. The ball-screw actuator comprises a spring-preloaded ball nut on a ball screw that is restrained against rotation as described below. The motor is coupled directly (that is, without an intervening gear train) to a <b>drive</b> <b>link</b> that, in turn, is coupled to the ball nut. By eliminating the gear train, the direct-drive design eliminates the complexity, backlash, and potential for misalignment associated with a gear train. To prevent inadvertent movement, there is a brake that includes flexured levers compressed against the <b>drive</b> <b>link</b> by preload springs. This is a power-off brake: There are also piezoelectric stacks that can be activated to oppose the springs and push the levers away from the <b>drive</b> <b>link.</b> Hence, power must be applied to the piezoelectric stacks to release the <b>drive</b> <b>link</b> from braking. To help ensure long operational life, all of the mechanical drive components are immersed in an oil bath within hermetically sealed bellows. The outer end of the bellows holds the outer end of the ball screw, thereby preventing rotation of the ball screw. Positioning is controlled by an electronic control system that includes digital and analog subsystems that interact with the motor and brake and with two sensor/encoder units: a Hall-effect-sensor rotation encoder and a linear glass-scale encoder. This system implements a proportional + integral + derivative control algorithm that results in variation of voltage commands to each of the three pairs of windings of the brushless DC motor. In one of two alternative control modes, the voltages are applied to the windings in a trapezoidal commutation scheme on the basis of timing signals obtained from the Hall-effect sensors; this scheme yields relatively coarse positioning - 24 steps per motor revolution. The second control mode involves a sinusoidal commutation scheme in which the output of the linear glass-scale encoder is transposed to rotational increments to yield much finer position feedback - more than 400, 000 steps per revolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{volumetric}} hydraulic drive structure consisting of an unregulated pump, hydraulic motor, and energy accumulation block with pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator (PHA). Drive control is provided through frequency modification of current {{arriving at the}} asynchronous electric drive (AED) from the frequency changer. The paper describes drive advantages when the energy accumulation block is set to allow power accumulation both from the AED and in recuperation regimes with moving outlet <b>drive</b> <b>link</b> with assisting loads. It offers simulation models and computer programmes to analyze a non-stationary movement of the outlet link of volumetric hydraulic drive with frequency control (VHD-FC) with hydraulic motor power supplied from the PHA. The paper examines acceleration regimes of motor axis under different loads and presents PHA energy characteristics and algorithms to find desirable operational non-displaced and constructional accumulator capacities that provide motor outlet link acceleration up to the necessary speed. It presents graphs to show changing motor axis angle speed and PHA-displaced fluid volume as well as energy and PHA power during its discharge versus acceleration time of the motor axis. These dependences are obtained through varying different parameters of the system, namely: inertia, viscous friction, constant load moment, and volumetric displacement. The paper shows that decrease of inertia load and use of hydraulic motor with high volume constants result in the most essentially reduced acceleration time. Setting the PHA allows more than 2. 5 times decreasing acceleration time of the motor axis. At the same time, because of the evidently complicated VHD-FC, taking decision on the sound PHA design and parameters {{must be based on}} the integration analysis of requirements. These requirements concern the VHD-FC reliability and performance in standard and failure modes as well as the technical-and-economic indexes and operation parameters of drive competitiveness, which are defined by specific designation of engineering hydraulically operating object. </p...|$|E

5000|$|The {{gauge of}} the chain is the {{thickness}} of the <b>drive</b> <b>links,</b> and is dictated by the gauge of the bar on which it is to be run. Usual gauges are [...]050" [...] (1.3 mm) - [...]058" [...] (1.5 mm) and [...]063" [...] (1.6 mm). Chain and bar gauge must match; a chain that is too large will not fit, one that is too small will fall sideways and cut poorly.|$|R
