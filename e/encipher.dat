Horse had previously written several children's books {{and received the}} Scottish Arts Council Writer of the Year award for his 1983 book [...] He began forging documents that same year {{as a way to}} earn money. The story which became the basis for Drowned God was originally a phony manuscript Horse wrote in 1983, ostensibly describing events after the destruction of the lost city of Atlantis. The manuscript, dated 1846, was said to have been written by the English poet Richard Horne, who shares Horse's birth name. Horse's initiation into the concept of an alternate history came in the early 1980s, when he first encountered professor Ian Halpke, who explained to him that information from the Kabbalah and ancient Jewish texts [...] "hide and <b>encipher</b> the secret", namely, human evolution was aided by extraterrestrial intelligence. According to Horse, Halpke believed the Ark of the Covenant was a nuclear device, and that humans and pigs share compatible genes.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} be as easy to {{decipher}} as <b>encipher,</b> some rotor machines, most notably the Enigma machine, were designed to be symmetrical, i.e., encrypting twice with the same settings recovers the original message (see involution).|$|E
40|$|Cryptanalysis is a {{very active}} area of {{research}} in the eld of cryptology. All the cryptanalytic attacks are based on, at least, two assumptions. First, the ciphertext to be decoded is known and second, the <b>enciphering</b> algorithm, that produced the ciphertext is known. Though former is a minimal requirement to start with, latter requires {{a great deal of information}} about the source of the <b>enciphered</b> text and this may not be available, at times. In such cases, identifying the <b>enciphering</b> algorithm is the rst step. Our work addresses this problem...|$|R
5000|$|Generally, the {{cryptanalyst}} {{may benefit}} from lining up identical <b>enciphering</b> operations among a set of messages.

50|$|Like many {{machines}} {{of the era}} it used an electromechanical {{system of}} rotors in order to <b>encipher</b> messages, but {{with a number of}} security improvements over previous designs. No successful cryptanalysis of the machine during its service lifetime is publicly known.|$|E
50|$|SIGABA {{was similar}} to the Enigma in basic theory, in that it used a series of rotors to <b>encipher</b> every {{character}} of the plaintext into a different character of ciphertext. Unlike Enigma's three rotors however, the SIGABA included fifteen, and did not use a reflecting rotor.|$|E

50|$|JADE was the codename {{given by}} US codebreakers to a Japanese World War II cipher machine. The Imperial Japanese Navy used the machine for {{communications}} from late 1942 until 1944.

50|$|The {{keyboard}} {{itself was}} a large sliding switch, also called permutor board. A signal, coming from a letter key, went through the rotors, back to the permutor board to continue to the printer. The KL-7 was non-reciprocal. Therefore, depending on the <b>Encipher</b> or Decipher position of the permutor board, {{the direction of the}} signal through the rotors was changed.|$|E

50|$|Alice, believing {{this public}} key to be Bob's, encrypts her message with Mallory's key and sends the <b>enciphered</b> message back to Bob.

5000|$|It {{was common}} to <b>encipher</b> a message after first {{encoding}} it, {{to increase the}} difficulty of cryptanalysis. With a numerical code, this was commonly done with an [...] "additive" [...] - simply a long key number which was digit-by-digit added to the code groups, modulo 10. Unlike the codebooks, additives would be changed frequently. The famous Japanese Navy code, JN-25, was of this design.|$|E
5000|$|With [...] plaintext-ciphertext pairs one slid pair is expected, {{along with}} {{a small number of}} false-positives {{depending}} on the structure of the cipher. The false positivescan be eliminated by using the keys on a different message-ciphertext pair to see if the encryption is correct. The probability that the wrong key will correctly <b>encipher</b> two or more messages is very low for a good cipher.|$|E

Although the Japanese purchased the Enigma machine they chose to base their cipher machine on a different technology. Rather than use rotors the Japanese used a stepping switch.|$|E

Sometimes (about one message in eight) one of the repeated letters in the message key <b>enciphered</b> to the same letter on both occasions. These occurrences were called samiczki (in English, females—a term later used at Bletchley Park).|$|R
