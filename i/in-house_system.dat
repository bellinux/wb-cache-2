500|$|The Shamrock {{initially}} had a {{staff of}} 1,200 managed by George Lindholm, who had been recruited from the socially prominent Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York. There were 23 different employee uniforms. Guests signed the register in [...] "grass-hued" [...] green ink and their luggage was carried by bellhops wearing emerald green, lemon trimmed uniforms past a portrait of McCarthy in the elevator lobby to air-conditioned, green-hued rooms each with generously framed abstract art on the walls, push-button radios (including recorded music from an elaborate <b>in-house</b> <b>system</b> through which an operator played extended-length phonographic records) and television, all somewhat rare amenities for a hotel at the time. Over {{a third of the}} rooms had kitchenettes. Celebrity singers (including Lamour) performed in the hotel's nightclub, called the Emerald room. From 1949 to 1953 the Shamrock hosted a network radio program called Saturday at the Shamrock carried by the American Broadcasting Company, then the only nationally broadcast scripted radio program produced outside New York or Los Angeles.|$|E

This paper discusses the innovation of four <b>in-house</b> <b>systems</b> namely Pustaka VRS (Vendor Rating System), SiberPROP, iPustaka and OffPAC.

Poughkeepsie developed a primitive in-house solution for office automation {{over the period}} 1970-1972; OFS (Office System), which evolved into PROFS, was developed by Poughkeepsie laboratory {{as a replacement for}} that earlier system and first installed in October 1974. Compared to Poughkeepsie's original <b>in-house</b> <b>system,</b> the distinctive new features added by OFS were a centralised database virtual machine (data base manager or DBM) for shared permanent storage of documents, instead of storing all documents in user's personal virtual machines; and a centralised virtual machine (mailman master machine or distribution virtual machine) to manage mail transfer between individuals, instead of relying on direct communication between the personal virtual machines of individual users. By 1981, IBM's Poughkeepsie site had over 500 PROFS users.|$|E
