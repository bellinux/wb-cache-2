40|$|Most {{retailers}} and scientists agree that supporting the buying decisions of individual <b>customers</b> or <b>groups</b> of <b>customers</b> with specific product recommendations holds great promise. Target-oriented promotional campaigns are more profitable {{in comparison to}} uniform methods of sale promotion such as discount pricing campaigns. This seems to be particulary true if the promoted products are well matched to the preferences of the <b>customers</b> or <b>customer</b> <b>groups.</b> But how can retailers identify <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> and determine which products to offer them? To answer this question, this dissertation describes an algorithmic procedure which identifies <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> with similar preferences for specific product combinations in recorded transaction data. In addition, for each <b>customer</b> <b>group</b> it recommends products which promise higher sales through cross-selling if appropriate promotion techniques are applied. To illustrate the application of this algorithmic approach, an analysis is performed on the transaction database of a supermarket. The identified <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> are used for a simulation. The results show that appropriate promotional campaigns which implement this algorithmic approach can achieve an increase in profit from 15 % {{to as much as}} 191 % in contrast to uniform discounts on the purchase price of bestsellers.

40|$|Hotel Online {{review is}} {{becoming}} a more and more popular topic in the hotel industry nowadays. Lots of {{research has been done}} and many interesting implications have been investigated. But very little research has been conducted from the different <b>customer</b> <b>group</b> perspective. In my thesis, I conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis mainly from the different <b>customer</b> <b>group</b> perspective and found out some very meaningful implications for the hotel industry. Some key contributions have been summarized as below: First, there exist significant mean differences in terms of six individual ratings and overall rating among different <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> (Family, Business, Friend, Solo, and Couple). Second, the six different individual review items account for different weights in the overall rating scale. Third, there is a significant positive relationship between six individual review items and overall rating. Fourth, independent hotels are making better performance than chain hotels except for some certain <b>customer</b> <b>group</b> in terms of rooms and sleep quality rating. Also, among the five different <b>customer</b> <b>groups,</b> the ratings of individual and overall given by business <b>customer</b> <b>group</b> are the lowest compared with the other groups. These implications will help hotels allocate their resources more flexible and efficient rather than focus on every single aspect. Especially for those small and medium sized hotels, {{they may be able to}} run better business since they now learn where to allocate more resources according to the rank of the importance...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{automotive}} industry faces increasingly tough competition {{in a global}} market. One key for competitiveness is product differentiation, {{in order to attract}} clearly defined market segments. However, designing cars for specific <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> incorporates the risk that a car appeals to {{only a small number of}} potential buyers. Another issue is that the actual <b>customer</b> <b>group</b> in many cases differs from the initially targeted <b>customer</b> <b>group.</b> The use of the ‘design for all’ (DfAll) concept may very well enlarge a car manufacturer’s market and improve the vehicles by making them suit larger populations. This paper discusses the aims of a research project that seeks to identify areas where both the main targeted <b>customer</b> <b>group</b> and others can gain from a ‘design for all’ approach. Other objectives are to suggest working methods that enable ‘design for all’ in the automotive development process and the identification of computer tools, such as virtual manikins, that can support these objectives early in a virtual design process...|$|R

Four <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> were recognized, termed hypercritics, silent killers, friendly complainers, and happy campers. Characteristics of the <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> based on all criteria variables differed according to service delivery failure reactions. Overall, hypercritics and friendly complainers informed a restaurant and gave it {{the opportunity to make}} corrective actions; silent killers resorted to negative marketing actions rather than complaining on site; and happy campers did not complain. The analysis indicates several ways to turn silent killers into more favorable consumer groups. The results suggest that service stages should be treated uniquely while designing the best recovery response strategies for different <b>customer</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Swiss Financial Services (FS) {{industry}} has seen major changes characterized by regulatory and growth issues, increased competition, {{development of new}} delivery channels commoditizing bank products, customer preferences, and technological advances. These have impacted revenue, profits, shareholder, and market value generation. Therefore, financial institutions need to transform their business models making them customer-centric. They must understand critical customer value drivers in accordance with customer profitability indicators. Given the highly competitive environment relationship marketing (RM) strategies aim to build loyal long-term relationships. Active customers are suggested to be highly-involved, confident and more profitable. For this research, {{depending on the type}} of relationship with their FS provider, three distinct <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> namely self-directors, semi-self-directors, and delegators were identified and investigated. This study investigates the following research questions: 1. How can highly-involved and confident FS customers be characterized? 2. How do highly-involved and confident <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> differ in terms of relationship value dimensions? 3. How do highly-involved and confident <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> differ in terms of bonding value dimensions? 4. Which relationship dimensions drive behavioural loyalty among highly-involved and confident customers? Based on the literature review seven relationship value dimensions namely involvement, confidence, self-advocacy, service quality, satisfaction, trust, and loyalty were identified. Seven bonding value dimensions were derived, namely financial value, technical value, functional value, social value, temporal value, spatial value, and product value. A theoretical loyalty model comprising previously identified relationship value dimensions was developed. An online survey applying respondent driven sampling (RDS) technique was administered over 130 valid respondents. Descriptive analysis, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), value opportunity algorithm analysis, discriminant analysis, and structure equation modelling (SEM) technique were applied using statistical software analysis package SPSS 17 and AMOS. The results suggest that <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> differ in terms of socio-demographic and financial behavioural characteristics. With respect to relationship value dimensions loyalty is influenced by trust, satisfaction, and service quality. The results also indicate that involvement, confidence and self-advocacy are potentially different among <b>customer</b> <b>groups.</b> Self-directed FS <b>customers</b> are more involved, more confident and thus more self-advocate compared to semi-self-directors and delegators. True and loyal relationship was found to coexist for all <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> investigated. With respect to value bonding dimensions <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> differ in the way they perceive spatial values and product values vis-a-vis importance and to some extent fulfilment. For all <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> technical and temporal values were similarly decisive. While spatial values were regarded to be over served by all <b>customer</b> <b>groups</b> social and functional values showed to some extent improvement opportunities for delegators, product values showed improvement opportunities for semi-self-directors. This study has provided insights on how customers can be better managed enabling efficient and effective bonding strategies that imply RM as well strategic management considerations. It has provided the first empirical and systematically conducted investigation of highly-involved and confident FS customers with respect to descriptive, relationship value and bonding value dimension considerations. Finally, the managerial and research implications and guidelines for strategic management and RM practice are discussed including directions for a potential business model targeting in particular the customer segments investigated...|$|R
