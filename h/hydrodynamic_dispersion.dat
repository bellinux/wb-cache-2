40|$|Abstract. When {{the liquid}} {{residing}} in a horizontal bed of porous material is displaced by another liquid of different density, the resulting <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>dispersion</b> is modified by {{the formation of}} a tongue of denser liquid undershooting the less dense liquid, a phenomenon known as gravity segregation. An earlier account of gravity segregation contained a substantial error (that of an incorrect frame of reference for flow) and several printing mistakes. In this paper we (i) correct these errors, (ii) extend the analysis to describe the course of breakthrough in beds of rectangular and circular cross-sections, (iii) re-interpret the existing experimental evidence, and (iv) present new experimental results on the vertical and horizontal transport of ionic solutions of different concentrations and densities through inert and reactive porous materials, ballotini, and sepiolite, respectively. The behaviour of immiscible liquids is predicted by the non-dimensional gravity segregation number, β, segregation becoming more extreme as β increases. With miscible liquids, however, breakthrough starts later and ends earlier then predicted for immiscible liquids, mixing by <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>dispersion</b> moderating the effect of segregation. Breakthrough curves are well fitted by CXTFIT 2. 0; apparent coefficients of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>dispersion</b> vary much less with pore-water velocity in horizontal than in vertical flow, but retardation factors are not influenced by orientation.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{mechanisms}} of dispersion in the laminar flow through the pore space of a $ 3 $-dimensional porous medium. We focus on pre-asymptotic transport prior to the asymptotic <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>dispersion</b> regime, in which solute motion may be described by the average flow velocity and a <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>dispersion</b> coefficient. High performance numerical flow and transport simulations of solute breakthrough at the outlet of a sand-like porous medium evidence marked deviations from the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>dispersion</b> paradigm and identifies two distinct regimes. The first regime {{is characterized by a}} broad distribution of advective residence times in single pores. The second regime is characterized by diffusive mass transfer into low-velocity region in the wake of solute grains. These mechanisms are quantified systematically in the framework of a time-domain random walk for the motion of marked elements (particles) of the transported material quantity. The model is parameterized with the characteristics of the porous medium under consideration and captures both pre-asymptotic regimes. Macroscale transport is described by an integro-differential equation for solute concentration, whose memory kernels are given in terms of the distribution of mean pore velocities and trapping times. This approach quantifies the physical non-equilibrium caused by a broad distribution of mass transfer time scales, both advective and diffusive, on the representative elementary volume (REV). Thus, while the REV indicates the scale at which medium properties like porosity can be uniquely defined, this does not imply that transport can be characterized by <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>dispersion...</b>|$|E
40|$|We model a fluid-filled disordered porous medium by a lattice-Boltzmann {{system with}} {{randomly}} broken links. The broken links exert a friction on the fluid without excluding volume.

40|$|Mismatches in {{electrokinetic}} properties between micro- and nanochannels {{give rise}} to superposition of electroosmotic and pressure-driven flows in the microchannels. Parabolic or similar flow profiles are known to cause the so-called <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>dispersion,</b> which under certain conditions can be formally assimilated {{to an increase in}} the solute diffusivity (Taylor-Aris model). It is demonstrated theoretically that taking into account these phenomena modifies considerably the pattern of current-induced concentration polarization of micro/nanointerfaces as compared to the classical model of unstirred boundary layer. In particular, the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>dispersion</b> leads to disappearance of limiting current. At essentially "over-limiting" current densities, the time-dependent profiles of salt concentration in microchannels behave like sharp concentration "fronts" moving away from the interface until they reach the reservoir end of the microchannel. Under galvanostatic conditions postulated in this study, these "fronts" move with practically constant speed directly proportional to the current density. The sharp transition from a low-concentration to a high-concentration zone can be useful for the analyte preconcentration via stacking. The pattern of moving sharp concentration "fronts" has been predicted for the first time for relatively broad microchannels with negligible surface conductance. The Taylor-Aris approach to the description of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>dispersion</b> is quantitatively applicable only to the analysis of sufficiently "slow" processes (as compared to the characteristic time of diffusion relaxation in the transversal direction). A posteriori estimates reveal that the condition of "slow" processes is typically not satisfied close to current-polarized micro/nanointerfaces. Accordingly, to make the description quantitative, one needs to go beyond the Taylor-Aris approximation, which will be attempted in future studies.

Thus, the improved PWRI model considered contributions of geochemical reaction, adsorption kinetics, and <b>hydrodynamic</b> molecular <b>dispersion</b> mechanism to alter the injectivity and deposition of suspended solids on aquifer wall resulting in cake formation in pores during PWRI and transport of active constituents in hydrocarbon reservoirs. The injectivity decline and cake deposition for specific case studies of hydrocarbon aquifers in Nigeria oil fields were characterized with respect to its well geometry, lithology, and calibrations data and simulated in COMSOL multiphysics software environment. The PWRI model was validated by comparisons to assessments of previous field studies based on data and results supplied by operator and regulator. The results of simulation showed that PWRI performance was altered because of temporal variations and declinations of permeability, injectivity, and cake precipitation, which were observed {{to be dependent on}} active adsorption and geochemical reaction kinetics coupled with filtration scheme and molecular dispersion. From the observed results and findings, transition time t r to cake nucleation and growth were dependent on aquifer constituents, well capacity, filtration coefficients, particle-to-grain size ratio, water quality, and more importantly, particle-to-grain adsorption kinetics. Thus, the results showed that injectivity decline and permeability damage were direct contributions of geochemical reaction, hydrodynamic molecular diffusion, and adsorption kinetics to the internal filtration mechanism, which are largely dependent on the initial conditions of concentration of active constituents of produced water and aquifer capacity.|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{collective}} {{dynamics of}} an equimolar Lennard-Jones KrAr mixture is studied {{in detail in}} a wide range of spatial and time scales. Combining both the molecular dynamics simulations and analytical generalized collective mode approach, we calculated the spectrum of generalized collective excitations and analyzed the dominant dynamic processes that determine the main contributions to time correlation functions in different regions - starting from the hydrodynamic limit and up to the range of the so-called molecular regime. The origin of collective propagating modes as well as the specific features of their dispersion laws within and beyond the hydrodynamic region are established. It is shown that the structural relaxation and processes, connected with mutual diffusion of particles, determine mainly the central peak of total dynamic structure factor beyond the <b>hydrodynamic</b> region. The <b>dispersion</b> laws, obtained for the propagating modes in our analytical approach, are compared with the dispersion curves, estimated from the maxima positions of partial current spectral functions. The difference in these two sets of numerical results is discussed...|$|R
