The 2.5km approach road to the A1077 junction, by Costain Civil Engineering began in September 1976. It included a 320m span from the southern anchorage of seven pre-stressed concrete box sections, and the A1077 junction, costing £4.25million. Work on the bridge substructure (foundations) began in March 1973. To reduce heat of hydration in the concrete, which produces calcium silicate hydrate from belite, as much as 60% of the Portland cement was replaced with ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS). It took longer to build the southern anchorage due to a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>wall</b> design due to not enough shallow bedrock. The main southern approach roads from Barton to the M180 motorway junction at Barnetby {{were built in the}} late 1970s by Clugston Construction of Scunthorpe, opening in 1978.|$|E

40|$|<b>Diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> are {{a type of}} {{geotechnical}} structures, which mainly {{are used}} to stabilize deep excavations built in densely populated areas. The {{most common type of}} <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> are cast in-situ in submerged conditions in a support liquid used to stabilize the excavation. There are concerns that the construction method may negatively influence the properties of the finalized structure. However, up to now little research has been done regarding the significance of this influence. Therefore during the last years in Sweden two recently constructed <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> have been investigated. In this paper some results from these investigations are presented. The results show that there is only a slight negative influence on the properties of the concrete in <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> compared to conventional structures...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{installation}} of cast-in situ concrete structures such as bored piles and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> may influence {{the properties of the}} adjacent soil. Installation effects are important because they may change the stresses applied to, and subsequent performance of cast-in situ bored piles and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls.</b> These effects have been studied using the finite element method. In particular the generation of excess pore pressures during construction and subsequent dissipation of these pore pressures have been examined using coupled consolidation analyses.

40|$|Deep shafts {{are usually}} {{required}} during tunnels construction (for maintenance tasks when tunnel boring machines –TBM- are used) and/or the operation stage of tunnels (emergency exits). Generally, these shafts are constructed below {{the water table}} and by the cut and cover method. Therefore, impervious <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> are desired for two main reasons: (1) to reduce risks (stability, inflows, flooding, etc.) and outside impacts (loose of groundwater resource, holes and sinkholes, etc.) during the excavation stage of a shaft and, (2) to avoid leaks and inflows of groundwater during the operation stage once the shaft is finished. Given that defects in <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> are frequent and can relatively easy be repaired before starting the excavation stage, a useful and new methodology to assess the state of enclosures before excavation is proposed. Its use would allow to reduce impacts on groundwater (construction and operation stages) and costs in case of defects {{as well as to}} increase the safety during the construction. The groundwater response regarding different scenarios of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> is studied numerically in order to propose a successful procedure to evaluate underground enclosures imperviousness by internal pumping tests. The scenarios consist in circular and square enclosures where the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> are assumed as homogeneous (with numerous defects) or heterogeneous (one discrete defect). The homogeneous cases are modeled by considering different effective hydraulic conductivities, while the size and position of the single defect is varied in the simulations of heterogeneous walls. An analysis of diagnostic plots and the comparison between the expected and measured groundwater evolutions inside the enclosure, is proposed to ascertain: (1) if the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> can be considered as homogeneous or heterogeneous, (2) the effective hydraulic conductivity of the walls (if they are homogeneous) and, (3) the position of a defect (if they are heterogeneous).
