Full conference proceedings are available via: [URL] with a negative Poisson’s ratio known also as auxetic materials [1] exhibit unusual property of getting thicker when stretched and thinner when compressed. The <b>helical</b> <b>auxetic</b> yarn (HAY) is a recently invented auxetic reinforcing structure for composites [2]. A <b>helical</b> <b>auxetic</b> yarn (HAY) consists of two fibres: a low modulus elastomeric core and a high modulus wrap fibre in a double helix structure. When a tensile load is applied the core of the HAY becomes wider as the wrap straightens out, resulting in a lateral expansion of the core, and therefore a large negative Poisson’ ratio behaviour. The auxetic behaviour of the HAY can be tailored by altering fibre properties, the initial geometry and also the applied strain to comply with specific applications, such as composites [3, 4], blast mitigation, and filtration [5]. This paper introduces a further development to the current HAY by addition of a third component (a sheath). The presence of the sheath is expected to overcome problems such as slippage of the wrap and inconsistency in the initial wrap angle previously encountered during the manufacture of the HAY. The auxetic performance of conventional and novel systems is investigated and Poisson’s ratio data are presented. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC...|$|E

This study therefore presents optimal design parameters through analytical calculations and finite element (FE) method. Three main design parameters were considered which includes Poisson?s ratio, core/wrap diameter ratio, and starting wrap angle. The Poisson?s ratio of the HAY was calculated by measuring its total diameter at a given rate of strain. The investigation found here to be a starting wrap angle of a HAY (critical angle) {{that resulted in the}} highest possible exhibiting of the auxetic effect. The critical angle was determined to be 7 °, and a maximum NPR of - 12. 04 was achieved with this design...|$|E

This paper introduces a novel extrusion process for manufacturing <b>helical</b> <b>auxetic</b> yarn (HAY). A range of semi-coextruded HAYs have been manufactured in a cost-effective, consistent and readily usable form. The semi-coextruded HAYs were compared to the conventional spun yarns in terms of tensile properties and auxetic behavior. The results show {{the presence of the}} auxetic effect in newly fabricated semi-coextruded HAYs. Similar to the traditional spun HAYs, the new HAYs are sensitive to parameters such as the initial wrap angle, the core/wrap diameter ratio and component moduli. Importantly, a few new manufacturing parameters have been identified for tailoring the auxetic behavior of the semi-coextruded HAYs. The semi-coextruded HAYs are auxetic when an instantaneous true Poisson’s ratio analysis method is applied. The semi-coextruded HAYs give a larger maximum negative Poisson’s ratio than the conventional HAYs due to the advantages of the pre-formed helical wrap structure.

One recently invented example of this is the <b>helical</b> <b>auxetic</b> yarn (HAY). This has been proved to successfully exhibit auxetic behaviour both as a yarn and when incorporated into fabric. The HAY is based on a double-helix geometry where a relatively stiffer ‘wrap’ is helically wound around a compliant core fibre. This paper studies the effect of the interaction between the core and the wrap fibre on the auxetic behaviour of the HAY, including the effect of their relative moduli. Assessment of the Poisson’s ratio of the HAYs has revealed that an elevated difference in component moduli causes the wrap fibre embedding itself into the core fibre, thus decreasing the auxetic effect. Careful determination of an optimum core–wrap moduli ratio where the ratio is high enough to yield an auxetic effect and low enough to prevent the core-indentation effect can lead to the fabrication of a yarn with largest negative Poisson’s ratio.

A definitive version was subsequently published in Composites Science and Technology (2015), DOI: 10. 1016 /j. compscitech. 2015. 06. 012 Functional auxetic composite materials can be fabricated from conventional or from auxetic components. The <b>helical</b> <b>auxetic</b> yarn (HAY) is a very recently invented auxetic reinforcing component for composite materials. This paper investigates the Poisson’s ratio behaviour of a further development of the HAY, needed for many practical applications. The 3 -component auxetic yarn is based on a stiff wrap fibre (the first component) helically wound around an elastomeric core fibre (the second component) coated by a sheath (the third component). The resultant structure can overcome problems such as slippage of the wrap and changes in wrapping angles previously encountered during the manufacture and utilisation of the two-component HAY. The mechanical performance of conventional and novel systems is investigated; with emphasis on the differences between the engineering and true Poisson’s ratio. The importance of the utilisation of a true tensile modulus and a true Poisson’s ratio is demonstrated. This is the first time reported in the literature that an experimental auxetic effect analysis of HAYs was carried out by comparing true and engineering Poisson’s ratio. We show that depending on the coating thickness of the third component, the 3 -component auxetic system can demonstrate auxetic behaviour, and the coating thickness can be employed as a new design parameter to tailor both the Poisson’s ratio and modulus of this novel composite reinforcement {{for a wide range of}} applications.
