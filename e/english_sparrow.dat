The Latin word passer, like the English word [...] "sparrow", is a term for small active birds, coming from a root word referring to speed.

Some mammals are protected—game animals and fur bearers are usually protected by Fish and Game Departments. Cottontail rabbits, deer, and tree squirrels are examples of game animals, and muskrats, foxes, badgers, and raccoons are examples of fur bearers.

5000|$|The British {{acclimatisation}} society {{originated from}} an idea {{proposed by the}} management of The Field journal. A meeting was held on January 21, 1859, at the London Tavern on Bishopsgate Street. The attendees included Professor Richard Owen {{at the head of}} the table and the servings included a large pike, American partridges, a young bean goose and an African eland. At the meeting Mitchell and others suggested that many of these exotic animals could live in the British wilderness. Professor Owen wrote in the newspapers later on the taste of the eland and the need for animal introductions. On June 26, 1860, another meeting was held and the Acclimatisation Society was formally founded in London and a year later the Secretary to the Society, Frank Buckland, a popular naturalist known for his taste in exotic meats, noted the [...] "success" [...] of the Society in introducing peafowl, common pheasant, swan, starling and linnet into Australia through the efforts of Edward Wilson. One of the supporters of the Society was Miss Burdett Coutts. Other such societies spread quickly around the world, particularly to European colonies in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand. In many instances they existed both as societies for the study of natural history as well as to improve the success rate of introduced species. In 1850, <b>English</b> <b>sparrows</b> were introduced into America and Eugene Schieffelin introduced starlings in 1890 as part of a plan to introduce all the birds mentioned in Shakespeare.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{characterize}} avian skeletal muscle (SKM) glucose and fatty acid uptake. <b>English</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Passer domesticus) {{were used for the}} following studies: 1. Characterization of glucose uptake, 2. Identification and localization of glucose transporters, 3. Characterization of free fatty acid uptake, and 4. Reciprocal inhibition of glucose and free fatty acids. The results are summarized as follows. Isolated SKM incubated for 60 minutes with insulin, IGF- 1, caffeine or AICAR demonstrated no increase in glucose transport. Interestingly, uptake was decreased in the presence of incremental unlabeled glucose suggesting the presence of glucose transporters (GLUT) and by phloretin, an inhibitor of transport proteins, decreased transport. The SKM glycogen content was low, which is supportive of the observed minimal glucose uptake. These findings suggest that GLUT expression may differ in birds as compared to mammals. GLUT 1 and GLUT 3 gene expression, but not GLUT 4, were found in all tissues examined and share a high degree of homology with published chicken sequences. In addition, GLUT 3 and GLUT 4 proteins were not detected, whereas GLUT 1 protein was abundant in blood-tissue barriers. Sparrows have high plasma ketone body levels suggestive of a high rate of free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation. In vitro uptake of radiolabeled oleic acid (OA) was maximal at 60 minutes and competitively inhibited by unlabeled OA suggesting a facilitative process. Radiolabeled OA uptake was not increased by IGF- 1, caffeine and AICAR, whereas insulin increased uptake at 60 minutes. Inhibitors of protein-mediated substrate transport increased OA uptake by 60 minutes (DIDS and phloretin) whereas a specific inhibitor of long chain FFA transport, sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate, decreased its uptake at 2. 5 min. In reciprocal inhibition studies, 20 mM unlabeled glucose and OA inhibited the uptake of their radiolabeled counterparts. Glucose (20 mM) significantly decreased labeled OA uptake 36 % and 20 mM OA significantly decreased labeled glucose transport by 49 %. These data begin to elucidate why avian skeletal muscle may not take up glucose to an appreciable extent and further, why avian skeletal muscle is insulin resistant...|$|R

Stuart Baker suggested the <b>English</b> name rufous-backed <b>sparrow,</b> but as this name might cause confusion with other species, Ticehurst suggested the name Sind jungle-sparrow, which became the accepted name for the species.

The Cuckoos have been accused of stealing the eggs of us other birds, but I've never known them to do it and I've lived neighbor to them for a long time, I guess they get their bad name because of their habit of slipping about silently and keeping out of sight as much as possible, as if they were guilty of doing something wrong and trying to keep from being seen.

60|$|Away {{off to the}} northward Cape Jerimo reared its black, forbidding {{head like}} some huge monster rising from the deep.

Hardly had the patter, patter died away when a flock of sea quail rose, and with whistling wings flew away to windward, where members of a large band of whales were disporting themselves, their blowings sounding like the exhaust of steam engines. The harsh, discordant cries of a sea-parrot grated unpleasantly on the ear, and set half a dozen alert in a small band of seals that were ahead of us.

500|$|The saxaul sparrow {{was first}} {{described}} by English zoologist John Gould in a March 1872 instalment of The Birds of Asia, from a specimen collected near Kyzylorda, now in southern Kazakhstan, by Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov. Severtzov {{had been planning}} to describe the species as Passer ammodendri {{for several years and}} had been distributing specimens among other naturalists. When natural history dealer Charles Dode escaped from the Paris Commune in 1871 with some of his collection, Gould obtained specimens from a set of rare birds Dode exhibited to the Zoological Society of London. Severtzov did not describe the species until 1873, and some later writers preferred to attribute him, but Gould's description takes priority over Severtzov's. The saxaul sparrow's species name refers to its desert habitat, coming from the name of the Ammodendron or sand acacia tree, which is in turn derived from the Ancient Greek [...] (ammos, [...] "sand") and [...] (dendron, [...] "tree"). The <b>English</b> name saxaul <b>sparrow</b> refers to the saxaul plant, with which it is closely associated. The saxaul sparrow usually is classified in the genus Passer with the house sparrow and around twenty other species, although a genus Ammopasser was created for the saxaul sparrow by Nikolai Zarudny in 1890.|$|R
6000|$|In the nesting habits the {{diversity}} is greatest. Some ground species excavate {{in the earth}} like kingfishers, only with greater skill, making cylindrical burrows often four to five feet deep, and terminating in a round chamber. Others build a massive oven-shaped structure of clay on a branch or other elevated site. Many of those that creep on trees nest in holes in the wood. The marsh-frequenting kinds attach spherical or oval domed nests to the reeds; {{and in some cases}} woven grass and clay are so ingeniously combined that the structure, while light as a basket, is perfectly impervious to the wet and practically indestructible. The most curious nests, however, are the large stick structures on trees and bushes, in the building and repairing of which the birds are in many cases employed more or less constantly all the year round. These stick nests vary greatly in form, size, and in other respects. Some have a spiral passage-way leading from the entrance to the nest cavity, and the cavity is in many cases only large enough to accommodate the bird; but in the gigantic structure of Homorus gutturalis it is so large that, if the upper half of the nest or dome were removed, a condor could comfortably hatch her eggs and rear her young in it. This nest is spherical. The allied Homorus lophotis builds a nest equally large, but with a small cavity for the eggs inside, and outwardly resembling a gigantic powder-flask, lying horizontally among the lower branches of a spreading tree. Pracellodomtis sibila-trix, a bird in size like the <b>English</b> house <b>sparrow,</b> also makes a huge nest, and places it on the twigs at the terminal end of a horizontal branch from twelve to fifteen feet above the ground; but when finished, the weight of the structure bears down the branch-end to within one or two feet of the surface. Mr. Barrows, who describes this nest, says: [...] "When other branches of the same tree are similarly loaded, and other trees close at hand bear the same kind of fruit, the result is very picturesque." [...] Synallaxis phryganophila makes a stick nest about a foot in depth, and from the top a tubular passage, formed of slender twigs interlaced, runs down {{the entire length of the}} nest, like a rain-pipe on the wall of a house, and then becoming external slopes upward, ending at a distance of two to three feet from the nest. Throughout South America there are several varieties of these fruit-and-stem or watering-pot shaped nests; they are not, however, all built by birds of one genus, while in the genus Synallaxis many species have no tubular passageways attached to their nests. One species--erythro thorax--in Yucatan, makes so large a nest of sticks, that the natives do not believe that so small a bird can be the builder. They say that when the tzapatan begins to sing, all the birds in the forest repair to it, each one carrying a stick to add to the structure; only one, a tyrant-bird, brings two sticks, one for itself and one for the urubú or vulture, that bird being considered too large, heavy, and ignorant of architecture to assist personally in the work.|$|R
