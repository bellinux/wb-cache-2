We investigated these qualitative answers manually, but mostly did not find a clustering of non-listed issues except in two cases: Several respondents mentioned additional problems if not all team members are able to understand all languages; and several respondents indicated the use of code generation, that is, using a single specification for cross-language links and using this specification to prevent problems.

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{there is}} a major need to record and analyse {{presenting}} complaints in emergency departments (EDs), no international standard exists. The aim {{of the present study was}} to produce structured complaint classification suitable for ED use and to implement it in practice. The structured classification evolved from a study of free text fields and ICPC- 2 classification. Methods Presenting complaints in a <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>field</b> of ED admissions during a one-year period (n= 40610) were analyzed and summarized to 70 presenting complaint groups. The results were compared to ICPC- 2 based complaints collected in another ED. An expert panel reviewed the results and produced an ED application of ICPC- 2 classification. This study implemented the new classification into an ED. Results The presenting complaints summarized from free text fields and those from ICPC- 2 categories were remarkably similar. However, the ICPC- 2 classification was too broad for ED; an adapted version was needed. The newly developed classification includes 89 presenting complaints and ED staff found it easy to use. Conclusions ICPC- 2 classification can be adapted for ED use. The authors suggest a list of 89 presenting complaints for use in EDs adult patients. </p...|$|E

However the quality and consistency of these data were rarely examined. Our aim was to examine medication related calls made to the healthdirect advice service in November 2014, to assess their basic characteristics and how the data entry format influenced information collected and data consistency. Registered nurses selected the patient question type {{from a range of}} categories, and entered the medications involved in a <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>field.</b> Medication names were manually extracted from the free text fields. We also compared the selected patient question type with the free text description of the call, in order to gauge data consistency. Results showed that nurses provided patients with advice on medication-related queries in a timely matter (the median call duration of 9 minutes). From 1835 calls, we were able to identify and classify 2156 medications into 384 generic names. However, in 204 cases (11. 2 % of calls) no medication name was entered. A further 308 (15. 0 %) of the medication names entered were not identifiable. When we compared the selected patient question with the free text description of calls, we found that these were consistent in 63. 27 % of cases.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether Aston University’s undergraduate classes on the symptoms and history element of eye examinations reflected the habits of optometrists working in multiple practice, the destination of most optometry graduates. Data abstraction was carried out on a single <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>field</b> within electronic eye examination records taken from a major community multiple practice. Company policy required optometrists to enter symptoms and history in this field. The feasibility of carrying out Bayesian searches on free text fields was investigated. Electronic searches were carried out to identify 163 text items linked to 11 classes of presenting symptoms in 51, 944 records. Likelihood ratios were calculated for all text item/presenting symptom combinations in a training dataset of 1075 manually classified records. These likelihood ratios were applied to naïve Bayesian searches for presenting symptoms in the training dataset. Post-test probability threshold values were adjusted to match known and estimated prevalence for each symptom presentation type. These adjusted threshold values resulted in diagnostic accuracy of between 83 and 99 % (depending on the presenting symptom class). The same likelihood ratios and adjusted threshold values were applied to larger scale naïve Bayesian searches in order to estimate the prevalence of each presenting symptom class in all 51, 944 records. This part of the study showed that similar Bayesian searches on the more complex and numerous elements of complete symptoms and history free text fields would not have been feasible. This being the case, detailed manual searches through 224 free text fields to determine how often optometrists asked 105 symptom and history test items taught at Aston University. Asking rates varied from 0 to 88 %. The proportion of expected questions asked in individual records (conformity) tended to be higher for eye examinations that were routine (no presenting symptoms: 95 % confidence limits 41 to 51 %) compared to those with presenting symptoms (the means for which ranged from 25 to 34 %). Optometrists tended to ask database-style questions (mean asking rates varied from 33 to 40 % depending on the presenting symptom) more often than problem-orientated style questions (mean asking rates varied from 22 to 33 % depending on the presenting symptoms). Decision tree analyses were used to explore the data in more depth and showed statistically significant regional variations in conformity. In summary, typical practice did not reflect what was taught at Aston University. Optometrists tended not to vary the questions asked according to the presenting symptoms. It was anticipated that these findings would be of interest to optometry schools and members of legal teams involved with fitness to practice disputes...|$|E

As is typical of medical data in general, these audiology records are heterogeneous, containing the following three different types of data: – Audiograms (graphs of hearing ability at different frequencies) – Structured tabular data (such as gender, date of birth and diagnosis) – Unstructured text (specific observations made about each patient in a <b>free</b> <b>text</b> comments <b>field)</b> There are two research questions for this research: – To find factors influencing the selection of ITE (in the ear) opposed to BTE (behind the ear) hearing aids. James Cook University Hospital is unique in that it supplies ITE hearing aids on the National Health Service – Among those patients diagnosed with tinnitus (ringing in the ear), to find the factors influencing the decision {{whether or not to}} prescribe a tinnitus masker (a gentle sound source, worn like a hearing aid, designed to drown out tinnitus) A range of statistical techniques, including clustering, the chi-squared test, principal component analysis, a Naïve Bayesian approach and multiple logistic regression have been used on this set of audiology data. These enabled us to discover candidate variables (including individual words in the <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>fields)</b> which may influence the dichotomies identified above. The findings of this research are compared with the experience of the professional audiologist at James Cook Hospital. The candidate variables are combined using both a Naïve Bayesian approach and multiple logistic regression to produce decision support systems, where unseen patient records are presented to the system, and the relative probability that the patient should be fitted with an ITE as opposed to a BTE aid or a tinnitus masker as opposed to no tinnitus masker will be returned. The advantage of these techniques for the combination of evidence is that {{it is easy to see}} which variables contributed to the final decision, facilitating the production of explanation facilities for decision support systems to be used in the real world...|$|R

40|$|As the {{software}} industry grows larger by the minute, {{the need for}} automated solutions within bug report management is on the rise. Although some {{research has been conducted}} in the area of bug handling, new, faster or more precise approaches are yet to be developed. A bug report typically contains a <b>free</b> <b>text</b> observations <b>field</b> where the issue can be described by a human. Research regarding processing of this type of field is extensive, however, bug reports are often accompanied with system log files which have been given less attention so far. In the 4 G LTE telecommunications network, the available system log files are many and several are likely to aid the routing of bug reports. In this thesis, one system log file was chosen to be evaluated; the alarm log. The alarm logs are time series count data containing alarms raised by the system. The alarm log data have been pre-processed with data mining techniques. The Apriori algorithm has been used to mine for specific alarms and alarming objects which indicates that the bug report should be solved by a particular developer group. We extend the Apriori algorithm to a temporal setting by using a customised time dependent confidence measure. To further mine for interesting sequences of events in the logs, the sequence mining approach SPADE has been used. The extracted class-associated sequences from both pre-processing approaches are transformed into binary features possible to use as predictors in any prediction model. The results have been evaluated by predicting the correct developer group with two different methods; logistic regression and DO-probit. Logistic regression was regularised with the elastic net penalty to avoid computational issues as well as handling the sparse covariate set. DO-probit was used with a horseshoe prior; it is well suited for the sparse covariate regression problem as it is customised to obtain signals in sparse, noisy data. The results indicate that a data mining approach for processing alarm logs is promising. The results show that the rules obtained with the Apriori mining process are suitable for mining the alarm logs as most binary representations of the rules used as covariates in logistic regression are kept in the equations for the expected classes with strongly positive coefficients. Although, the overall improvement in accuracy from using the alarms logs in addition to the learned topics from <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>fields</b> is modest, the alarm logs are concluded to be a good complement to the <b>free</b> <b>text</b> information as some Apriori covariates appears to be better suited to predict some classes than some topics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} a database of over 180, 000 patient records, collected from over 23, 000 patients, by the hearing aid clinic at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, UK. These records consist of audiograms (graphs of the faintest sounds audible to the patient at six different pitches), categorical data (such as age, gender, diagnosis and hearing aid type) and brief <b>free</b> <b>text</b> notes made by the technicians. This data is mined to determine which factors contribute to the decision to fit a BTE (worn behind the ear) hearing aid {{as opposed to an}} ITE (worn in the ear) hearing aid. Methods From PCA (principal component analysis) four main audiogram types are determined, and are related to the type of hearing aid chosen. The effects of age, gender, diagnosis, masker, mould and individual audiogram frequencies are combined into a single model by means of logistic regression. Some significant keywords are also discovered in the <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>fields</b> by using the chi-squared (χ 2) test, which can also be used in the model. The final model can act a decision support tool to help decide whether an individual patient should be offered a BTE or an ITE hearing aid. Results The final model was tested using 5 -fold cross validation, and was able to replicate the decisions of audiologists whether to fit an ITE or a BTE hearing aid with precision in the range 0. 79 to 0. 87. Conclusions A decision support system was produced to predict the type of hearing aid which should be prescribed, with an explanation facility explaining how that decision was arrived at. This system should prove useful in providing a "second opinion" for audiologists. </p...|$|R

Unfortunately, most state maternal and child health surveillance systems are not designed to readily address longitudinal research questions or track and follow children across multiple programs over time. The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) recently integrated its birth defects registry, newborn hearing screening tracking and management system, and electronic birth certificate (EBC) into a robust, Web-based surveillance system called the Virginia Vital Events and Screening Tracking System (VVESTS). Completely redesigning the existing birth defects and newborn hearing screening system (the Virginia Infant Screening and Infant Tracking System [...] VISITS I) with minimal disruption of ongoing reporting presented a number of challenges. Because VVESTS had different requirements such as required fields and data validations, extensive data preparation was required to ensure that existing VISITS I data would be included in the new system (VISITS II). Efforts included record deduplication, conversion of <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>fields</b> into discrete variables, dealing with missing/invalid data, and linkage with birth certificate data.

MOLES 3 provides support for organising information about data, and for user navigation around data holdings. The implementation described here, “CEDA-MOLES”, also supports data management functions for the Centre for Environmental Data Archival, CEDA. The previous iteration of MOLES (MOLES 2) saw active use over five years, being replaced by CEDA-MOLES in late 2014. During that period important lessons were learnt both about the information needed, as well as how to design and maintain the necessary information systems. In this paper we review the problems encountered in MOLES 2; how and why CEDA-MOLES was developed and engineered; the migration of information holdings from MOLES 2 to CEDA-MOLES; and, finally, provide an early assessment of MOLES 3 (as implemented in CEDA-MOLES) and its limitations. Key drivers for the MOLES 3 development included the necessity for improved data provenance, for further structured information to support ISO 19115 discovery metadata  export (for EU INSPIRE compliance), and to provide appropriate fixed landing pages for Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) in the presence of evolving datasets.

These results were used to determine the validity of the diagnosis IA in EMRs and to develop an algorithm to improve diagnostic validity. Results: From the 219 patients diagnosed as IA in the database, the diagnosis IA was confirmed in 155 patients (70. 8 %). The algorithm, which resulted in a group of patients with as many as possible confirmed IA-diagnosed patients without excluding too many patients from our dataset, was when patients fulfilled {{at least one of the}} following three criteria: 1) a repeat prescription for a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and/or biological agent, 2) ≥ four contacts or one episode with a diagnostic code for IA, combined with at least two IA-related prescriptions (excluding DMARDs/biological agents), and 3) age at diagnosis ≥ 61 years. After applying this algorithm, the percentage of correctly diagnosed IA patients increased from 71 % to 78 % reducing the size of our study population by 36 %. Conclusions: Based on additional diagnostic information, the diagnosis IA from EMRs of patients in primary care is sufficiently valid when using the proposed algorithm. After applying the algorithm, the percentage of correctly diagnosed IA patients increased from 71 % to 78 %. © 2013 Nielen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Poster Presentation: no. PP 163 Conference Theme: Next Stop: Istanbul — Bridging the Continents!Objectives: Individual case {{safety reports}} (ICSRs) {{could be an}} {{important}} source in giving further information to characterize the risk situation and aid in the prevention, diagnosis, management and treatment of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The aim {{was to determine whether}} and where on the ICSRs clinically useful information was specified for rare ADRs in the paediatric population. Methods: ICSR concerning rhabdomyolysis occurring during use of antipsychotic medicines for patients up to 17 years of age were retrieved from the WHO Global ICSR database, VigiBase. The original case reports were requested and received from the national pharmacovigilance centres. We focused on five areas of information specified in a recent guideline for publishing ADRs. [1] Results: Eighteen original cases with an age span from 5 to 17 years were reviewed with the following outcomes. Circumstances preceding the reaction: 9 reports included this information, consisting primarily of abdominal, muscle and back pain. In eight of these reports, the full account of the symptoms and sequence of events were only found in the narratives. Underlying risk factors for rhabdomyolysis: Recorded for four of five patients in the narrative: seizures (n = 1), strenuous physical activity (n = 2), diabetic ketoacidosis (n = 1), alcohol use (n = 1). Four patients had Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) co-reported. Physical examination and laboratory tests: All values for patient temperature and laboratory values were given in <b>free</b> <b>text.</b> Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) or myoglobin values were recorded in 14 reports ranging from 1200 to 95 000 IU/L (CPK). Patient temperature was specified for 5 patients, of whom 3 patients were also reported to experience NMS. Drug-reaction time-to-onset: 13 reports included information on the duration from drug start to reaction onset, which ranged from 4 days to 1. 5 years. 9 reports included dates in the structured data, so that time to onset could be calculated and in 4 reports the information was specified in the narratives. Treatment of the reaction: Apart from stopping the drug (n = 18) and hospitalization (n = 16), other actions of treatment, such as forced intravenous fluids or resolving spontaneously, was given for 5 cases in the narrative. Conclusions: This study showed that useful clinical information was available to characterize the risk situation for these patients in this subset of reports. This should be regarded in the context that ICSRs are generally considered to be of poor quality. However, access to the <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>fields</b> recorded by the reporter was crucial to capture this information. Reference 1. Kelly WN, Arellano FM, Barnes J, et al.

40|$|Abstract Background Varicella and {{herpes zoster}} are both caused by {{varicella}} zoster virus (VZV) infection or reactivation and may lead to complications associated with a (severe) societal burden. Because the epidemiology of VZV-related diseases in the Netherlands remains largely unknown or incomplete, the main objective {{of this study was}} to study the primary care incidence, associated complications and health care resource use. Methods We investigated the incidence of VZV complications in the Dutch general practitioner (GP) practices and pharmacies in a retrospective population-based cohort study (2004 – 2008) based on longitudinal GP data including <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>fields,</b> hospital referral and discharge letters from approximately 165, 000 patients. Results The average annual incidence of varicella GP-consultations was 51. 5 per 10, 000 (95 % CI 44. 4 - 58. 7) overall; 465. 5 per 10, 000 for 0 – 1 [*]year-olds; 610. 8 per 10, 000 for 1 – 4 [*]year-olds; 153. 5 per 10, 000 for 5 – 9 [*]year-olds; 8, 3 per 10, 000 for > 10 [*]year olds. When only ICPC coded diagnoses were analyzed the incidence was 27 % lower. The proportion of complications among varicella patients was 34. 9 %. Most frequently complications were upper respiratory tract infections. Almost half of the varicella patients received medication. The referral rate based on GP consultations was 1. 7 %. The average annual incidence of herpes zoster GP-consultations was 47. 5 per 10, 000 (95 % CI 40. 6 - 54. 4). The incidence increased with age; 32. 8 per 10, 000 for 65 [*]year olds. When estimating herpes zoster incidence only on ICPC coded information, the incidence was 28 % lower. The complication rate of herpes zoster was 32. 9 %. Post herpetic neuralgia was seen most often. Of patients diagnosed with herpes zoster 67. 8 % received medication. The referral rate based on GP consultations was 3. 5 %. Conclusions For varicella the highest incidence of GP-consultations was found in 1 – 4 [*]year-olds, for herpes zoster in the > 65 [*]years olds. The occurrence of complications was not age-dependent but varies per complication. When estimating incidence of VZV-related diseases in primary care, based on diagnostic codes only, one should be aware of a gross underestimation of the incidence. Our analysis may have important implications for the outcomes of upcoming cost-effectiveness analyses on VZV vaccination. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{compares the}} assessment, treatment, referral, and follow up {{contact with the}} {{dispatch}} centre of emergency patients treated by two types of solo emergency care providers in ambulance emergency medical services (EMS) in the Netherlands: the physician assistant (PA), educated in the medical domain, and the ambulance registered nurse (RN), educated in the nursing domain. The hypothesis {{of this study was}} that there is no difference in outcome of care between the patients of PAs and RNs. METHODS: In a cross-sectional document study in two EMS regions we included 991 patients, treated by two PAs (n = 493) and 23 RNs (n = 498). The inclusion period was October 2010 -December 2012 for region 1 and January 2013 -March 2014 for region 2. Emergency care data were drawn from predefined and <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>fields</b> in the electronic patient records. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. We used chi (2) and Mann-Whitney U tests to analyse for differences in outcome of care. Statistical significance was assumed at a level of P < 0. 05. RESULTS: Patients treated by PAs and RNs were similar with respect to patient characteristics. In general, diagnostic measurements according to the national EMS standard were applied by RNs and by PAs. In line with the medical education, PAs used a medical diagnostic approach (16 %, n = 77) and a systematic physical exam of organ tract systems (31 %, n = 155). PAs and RNs provided similar interventions. Additionally, PAs consulted more often other medical specialists (33 %) than RNs (17 %) (chi (2) = 35. 5, P < 0. 0001). PAs referred less patients to the general practitioner or emergency department (50 %) compared to RNs (73 %) (chi (2) = 52. 9, P < 0. 0001). Patient follow up contact with the dispatch centre within 72 h after completion of the emergency care on scene showed no variation between PAs (5 %) and RNs (4 %). CONCLUSIONS: In line with their medical education, PAs seemed to operate from a more general medical perspective. They used a medical diagnostic approach, consulted more medical specialists, and referred significantly less patients to other health care professionals compared to RNs. While the patients of the PAs did not contact the dispatch centre more often afterwards...|$|R
40|$|Background: Unplanned out-of-hospital {{birth is}} often {{perceived}} as precipitate in nature, ‘infrequent’, ‘normal’ and ‘uncomplicated’. However, international studies report unplanned out-of-hospital birth {{is associated with}} increased rates of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. This research describes intrapartum, immediate postpartum and neonatal care provided by paramedics in Queensland, Australia. The objectives were to (1) {{determine the number of}} cases where the paramedic documented birth or imminent birth during the study period (2) to describe the incidence of births prior to or during paramedic care (3) to detail any risk factors and/or complications recorded by paramedics during these cases, (4) identify paramedic pain management practices for intrapartum care, and (5) to examine the maternal and neonatal outcomes as documented by paramedics. Method: A retrospective analysis of Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) de-identified patient care records, generated from clinical case data between the 1 st of Jan 2010 and 31 st of Dec 2011, was undertaken. Descriptive analysis and x 2 tests were used to test associations between categorical variables, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum for associates between continuous variables which were not normally distributed. Content analysis was utilised to code <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>fields.</b> Results: Six thousand one hundred thirty-five records were identified as intrapartum cases. This represented approximately 0. 5 % of the annual QAS caseload; 5722 were classified as maternal records and 413 were neonatal records. Paramedics recorded antenatal and/or intrapartum complications in 27. 3 % (n =[*] 1563) of cases. Abnormal maternal vital signs were recorded in 30. 1 % (n =[*] 1725) of cases. Of the 5722 women attended by paramedics during their labour, a birth occured in 10. 8 % (n =[*] 618) of cases. Parity was documented in 41. 4 % (n =[*] 256) of mothers who birthed. Neonatal records were available for 66. 8 % (n =[*] 413) of actual births, 60. 0 % (n =[*] 248) recorded a full set of neonatal vital signs and an Apgar score. When an Apgar score was recorded, 21. 8 % (n =[*] 91) scored ≤ 7 out of 10. Conclusions: The research described intrapartum, immediate postpartum and neonatal care provided by paramedics and identified factors that may complicate paramedic clinical management of labouring and birthing women. Further research is required to determine if there are opportunities to improve the paramedic management of such cases...|$|R
