5|$|Mayberry {{has been}} used {{predominantly}} as a starting outfielder, despite some suggesting he is better suited as a platoon player. He hits for power, but strikes out frequently. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> athlete, with good speed, but does not steal many bases. Defensively, he is adequate, and possesses a strong and accurate arm. Mayberry has a degree in political science from Stanford.

In {{an attempt to}} prevent Angel and his team from stopping Illyria, Gunn mortally wounds Connor. Connor pleads with Angel {{not to let the}} Senior Partners win and assures him that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> person despite being a vampire. Connor then dies in Angel's arms. He is restored to life when Angel provokes Gunn into killing him, forcing the Senior Partners to turn back time to the moment of the original alleyway fight in the television finale. All those who died since the city was sent to hell come back to life and have their memories of the intervening time intact.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Springfield Elementary {{put on a}} {{production}} of Casablanca, in which Lisa gets the lead role of Ilsa. Milhouse wants the male lead role of Rick because of his love for Lisa, but he is challenged by a new boy, Jack Deforest, who dresses, acts and speaks like Humphrey Bogart. Milhouse enlists the bullies to beat up Jack, but Jack wins the fight. Principal Skinner sees this violence and declares that Milhouse will play Rick instead of Jack; Lisa is angered as she {{does not believe that}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> actor. Marge tells Lisa {{that it is important to}} encourage people who are not skilled by telling them that they are, using the example of Homer. The production is a success, but at the end it is revealed that Jack was disguised as Milhouse; he and Lisa leave hand-in-hand.|$|E
25|$|Steve Warson is an American {{driver and}} Michel's best friend. He first {{appeared}} in the series in 1957. Steve has a different personality than Michel: he smokes, drinks, flirts, fights, and defies other drivers. Despite his several flaws, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> driver for the Vaillante team and a faithful team mate to Michel, even if his romantic adventures sometimes caused him to be Vaillante's occasional rival. His numerous girlfriends have included Ruth and Julie Wood. As good driver as Michel, he outdoes him in most rallying and American races.|$|E

25|$|Rev. Duncan Magee (Derek McGrath)– The {{priest of}} the Anglican Church which also houses the mosque, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> friend to Amaar {{and the two}} clerics often turn {{to each other for}} advice. He is liberal, once {{offering}} to perform a gay marriage at the church, and is willing {{to stand up to the}} church hierarchy when he believes that it is acting inconsistently with the true message of Christianity. He often laments the sad state of his own church and congregation. His character unfortunately departs the show after season three, to be replaced by the ambitious, younger and distinctly less accommodating Rev. William Thorne. In seasons 1-3, it is gradually revealed that he has a number of hobbies (including curling, running and painting), all taken very seriously. His presence on the show illustrates the commonalities between Islamic and Anglican faiths and the similar problems the priests of each faith must face.|$|E

In her early appearances, she maintained {{a friendship with}} George O'Malley, until developing romantic feelings towards him. Rhimes offered the insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They’re really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that's what Lexie is hoping. She is my kind of girl. The girl who likes the guy because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>GOOD</b> guy and that's what George is. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guy and that's something that Lexie could use now. She's going through her own challenges what with Meredith and losing her own mother {{and trying to keep}} things afloat. I’m rooting for Lexie. She's my kind of girl and I hope that she gets what she deserves: love. And more kisses. There should always be that." [...] Lexie's most significant relationship was with Mark Sloan.

500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1890 season, Dunlap engaged in {{protracted}} salary negotiations with President Nimick of the Alleghenies. In late March 1890, the Pittsburg Dispatch reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, [...] "and it now seems certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the Pittsburg league club." [...] Nimick said at the time: [...] "I had a long talk with Mr. Dunlap, and we agreed to terms for him to play with us this season. [...] Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play for much less than $5,000. [...] He did not sign a contract, for reasons that were quite satisfactory to me ... We know <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> player and he is quite willing to remain with us." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{testing the}} limits of what he can get away with, such as {{interrupting}} church attendants by having a Bible fight, kicking open the stall doors in a girls' bathroom, and saying [...] "testicles" [...] through a microphone at a fast food restaurant, Peter goes behind the counter and sees a [...] "Fryolator" [...] and wants to take it home. [...] However, he accidentally drenches Lois with boiling oil. While she is recovering, Child Protection Services take away Peter's custody of Meg, Chris, and Stewie {{on the grounds that}} Peter is mentally unfit to look after them. The three are placed in the care of Cleveland. When Brian tells Peter that he just has to show that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> parent, Peter thinks {{that the best way to}} do that is to show what a bad parent Cleveland is, so he brings seven prostitutes into Cleveland’s house. This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out. In a last attempt, he appeals to the court for custody of the children, but he is denied and avoids imprisonment only because the judge forgets that prisons exist.|$|E

500|$|Waddington bowled with control, {{maintaining}} a good length while his action made the ball swing {{away from the}} batsman. For variation, he delivered an off-cutter and when he bowled, the ball seemed to increase its speed after bouncing. He often bowled around the wicket. His curved run-up began from the on side of the wicket, and he ran behind the umpire. He then released the ball {{from the corner of}} the bowling crease, creating a sharp angle for the batsman to face, sometimes using short deliveries with a ring of leg side fielders. Waddington modelled his bowling on that of George Hirst, a fellow left-arm paceman who also acted as a coach and mentor to him in his early career, but Derek Hodgson notes that the two men were very different in personality: Waddington was far more quick-tempered than Hirst. Waddington's bowling action was noted for its excellence and perfection. Neville Cardus, the journalist and cricket writer, described it as [...] "gloriously rhythmical", and [...] "so lovely that one simply cannot deny <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> bowler." [...] But too often, Cardus suggested, he was [...] "ever raising hopes that real greatness will come from him, only to disappoint again and again".|$|E
500|$|While Deangelo gets {{annoyed with}} Jim and Pam, {{he loves the}} antics of Andy, who has resorted to {{physical}} comedy when his jokes fall flat, {{getting to the point}} where he pours hot coffee on his pants and (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that [...] "this is my life now". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the [...] "multipurpose room", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.|$|E
500|$|In May 1999, Nicolas Anelka stated {{his desire}} to leave Arsenal and cited the English media {{as a reason for}} wanting to leave the club as they caused him [...] "enormous {{problems}} on a personal level". Lazio was interested in signing the player, but the Italian club refused to pay Arsenal's asking price of £23million. After Real Madrid reopened negotiations with Arsenal and Anelka, a deal was finally reached on 1 August 1999 and the player signed for the club, the next day. Arsenal sought to strengthen the squad's attacking options first by signing Davor Šuker from Real Madrid; the player was prepared to take a pay cut to join the club. The club then signed Juventus forward Thierry Henry for a club record fee of £11million. Wenger, who served as the player's protégé at Monaco, believed his best position was as a goalscorer: [...] "He was the top scorer in the Under-17s for France when I first had him and I think that, as well as having the qualities of youth, pace and power, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> finisher. That is something he has not worked on enough {{in the last two years}} because he has played more wide, but I think he can become a central striker again. That is what we will try to develop together." ...|$|E

500|$|Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters {{described}} The Red Sea Sharks as a [...] "complex, ambiguous, even labyrinthine" [...] story {{which was}} [...] "undoubtedly {{the book in}} which Hergé ventured furthest into the creation of his own universe." [...] He thought that [...] "Hergé enters a new phase" [...] with The Red Sea Sharks, as its author [...] "seems to know his family of characters better and better, and he enjoys playing with them and his readers." [...] Peeters noted that the book was [...] "in some respects a continuation" [...] of Land of Black Gold, an assessment shared by Thompson, the Lofficiers, and Farr, all of whom {{described it as a}} partial sequel to the earlier book. Thompson added that The Red Sea Sharks [...] "atoned for the relative failure" [...] of Land of Black Gold, believing that although it had a [...] "rather hasty finish", it was [...] "a first-rate thriller". The Lofficiers awarded it four out of five, stating that it was [...] "very effective as a modern political thriller and far more believable than The Calculus Affair". They also opined that it provided an effective political commentary on the West's relationship with the Arab world. In their analysis, Tintin and Haddock seek to aid the Emir not because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> leader, but for their own selfish purposes (to get Abdullah out of Marlinspike), just as Western governments and corporations build alliances with Arab leaders guilty of human rights abuses in order to benefit their own interests.|$|E
500|$|Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) {{is deeply}} {{upset by the}} death of her sister, Jean (Robin Trocki). She lashes out by having the glee club's flight to Nationals in New York City rerouted so it has a layover in war-ravaged Tripoli [...] and kicks Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) off the Cheerios. Sue allows Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) and Kurt to plan Jean's funeral and help her sort through Jean's {{personal}} belongings, and agrees to have the glee club to perform at the funeral, as she believes no one will attend otherwise. While going through Jean's belongings, Finn and Kurt discover that her favorite movie was Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, and arrange a funeral inspired by the film. At the funeral, an emotional Sue is unable to continue reading her eulogy after a few sentences, and Will reads the remainder for her. The glee club then sings [...] "Pure Imagination", the theme song of the film. Touched by Will's support, Sue later tells him that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> friend and he has what Jean had and she does not: a pure heart. She says that she will no longer attempt to destroy the glee club, and announces that she is planning to run for the United States House of Representatives. For the first time, she wishes him good luck. Sue also apologizes to Becky, reinstates her {{as a member of the}} Cheerios, and tells her she will be captain of the squad in the fall. Sue asks for and receives a hug from Becky.|$|E
500|$|Season 2 leaves Tyrion [...] "broke, beaten, scarred {{for life}} and {{stripped}} of his power," [...] despite having been instrumental in saving King's Landing from invasion. It is his chance to escape the sordid and deadly [...] "game of thrones," [...] but he cannot bring himself to, confessing, [...] "Bad people are what I'm good at." [...] So Tyrion finds he must submit to Tywin's plan of marrying him to Sansa Stark; despite being drunk in order to soothe his many woes, Tyrion manages to save Sansa from being publicly stripped and likely raped by Joffrey, and later [...] "chooses decency over filial loyalty and elects not to consummate the marriage after all." [...] Tyrion is also now powerless against Joffrey's malice, but Tywin has asserted his control over the young king, if only when it serves his own desires; he stops Joffrey from presenting Sansa with her brother's head, but not because he cares about Sansa or Tyrion's outrage. Despite Tywin's continuous determination to make Tyrion feel [...] "miserable and unloved," [...] he believes <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> father – because he {{resisted the urge to}} cast Tyrion into the sea at birth. Though he should not be surprised by his father's coldblooded machinations, Tyrion is horrified by Tywin's involvement in the Red Wedding; Todd VanDerWerff writes, [...] "only Tyrion seems to understand that the blood they spilled will eventually be avenged. The North may have calmed for now, but it won't be calm always." [...] Of that storyline, Matt Fowler of IGN notes, [...] "Only an event that powerful could keep series-favorite Tyrion out of an episode for the first time." ...|$|E
