He shared century stands with Shoaib Malik and Kamran Akmal, while Jerome Taylor took four wickets in his 33 overs. Dave Mohammed bowled 31 overs, taking three for 98 {{including}} the two last batsmen, but West Indies had to make 279 <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Pakistan bat again.|$|E
25|$|O’Neil's Question is very {{conflicted}} {{on how far}} to go in enforcing justice, often feeling {{tempted to}} kill. He resists this temptation during his time in Hub City, realizing {{that part of his}} desire to go so far is <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{what it feels like to}} take a life. His relationship with his mentor, Aristotle Rodor, is one of many things that keep him from going over the edge and back towards the darkness he had shown in his youth on the streets of Hub City.|$|E
25|$|A modest ratings success, KITS {{fought off}} {{competition}} from the legendary AM CHR station, KFRC (which changed format to big bands in 1986), as well as KMEL-FM, which had switched from album-oriented rock to CHR in 1984. 105 KITS was, for a while, {{the darling of the}} Jet Set; daily visits were common from movie celebrities such as Bette Midler, Tom Cruise, Pat Morita, George Takei, Anthony Perkins and others.

25|$|The 1954–55 season saw {{the team}} {{remain in the}} Regional League, {{finishing}} fifth. In the 1955 Cup, the team reached the round of 16, where it lost marginally 4–2 against Larvik Turn, double-reigning Main League champions. The team {{was in need of}} younger players, with parts of the stem of the team retiring after the 1955 season. The 1955–56 season saw Rosenborg again relegated to the Third Division, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it win the following season and be promoted, to again finish last in the Regional League in the 1957–58 season and be relegated. In the 1958–59 season, Rosenborg won its conference of the Third Division for the fourth time in seven years, and the following year win its conference of the Regional League. The women's division was closed in 1958.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Empire Windrush, {{which was}} en route from Australia to England via the Atlantic, docked in Kingston, Jamaica, to pick {{servicemen}} who were on leave. The British Nationality Act 1948 had just been passed, giving the status of citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC status) to all British subjects connected with the United Kingdom or a British colony. Prior to 1962, the UK had no immigration control for CUKCs, who could settle indefinitely in the UK without restrictions. The ship was far from full, and so an opportunistic advertisement {{was placed in a}} Jamaican newspaper offering cheap transport on the ship for anybody who wanted to come and work in the UK. Many former servicemen took this opportunity to return to Britain with the hopes of rejoining the RAF, while others decided to make the journey <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what England was like. The resulting group of 492 immigrants famously began a wave of migration from the Caribbean to the UK when the ship docked at the Port of Tilbury, near London, on 22 June 1948, and the name Windrush has as a result come to be used as shorthand for that migration, and by extension for the beginning of modern British multicultural society.|$|E
500|$|However, {{according}} to Turner Classic Movies (TCM), the grapefruit scene was a practical joke that Cagney and costar Mae Clarke {{decided to play}} on the crew while the cameras were rolling. Wellman liked it so much that he left it in. TCM also notes that the scene made Clarke's ex-husband, Lew Brice, very happy. [...] "He saw the film repeatedly <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that scene, and was often shushed by angry patrons when his delighted laughter got too loud." ...|$|E

However, Andrew Sanchez of Maximum PC praised the game's graphics {{and noted that}} the Dark Engine went [...] "feature-for-feature with the LithTech, Quake, and Unreal engines". He also praised the game's AI, sound and plot. Larka disliked the game's extremely dark areas, which required him to [...] "max out the gamma correction and set [...] monitor to its brightest setting <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the barest details" [...] but called the graphics [...] "seamless". Some reviews complained about collision detection issues.|$|E

According to that legend Sandalj asked Jelena who was her favorite husband. Her reply was that she would give away both Sandalj and Balšić <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Miloš Obilić one more time. Sandalj was angered and Jelena had to run away from him. While she was on the way to Zeta, in some nettle, she gave birth to a boy who was a founder of Koprivica family (kopriva, [...] "nettle").|$|E

I think Dave's getting better and Mick's still playing. It would be great to get back together <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what musical ideas we had, and what would happen." [...] The Daily Mail subsequently interpreted his comments as a declaration that a reunion of the band's original line-up was imminent. Dave Davies swiftly rejected the idea of a reunion. He told a reporter that [...] "it would be like a bad remake of Night of the Living Dead" [...] and added, [...] "Ray has been doing Karaoke Kinks shows since 1996." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{moved into}} feature film acting cautiously, {{choosing}} deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, {{after going through}} an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to New Mexico to film a single scene in the 2007 film, The Flock. She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside Claire Danes and Richard Gere. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes. On her role in The Flock, Lavigne said, [...] "I did that <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how it was and to not jump into [...] too fast". The Flock was not released in American theatres, {{and because it was}} not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7million in the foreign box office.|$|E
500|$|One critic theorized, [...] "...ather than {{end this}} Brazil-ian sci-fi dystopia with the {{equivalent}} of that film's shot of its lobotomized hero, which puts the lie to the immediately previous scene of his imagined liberation, Spielberg tries to pass off exactly the same ending but without the rimshot, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the audience is paying attention." [...] Film scholars Nigel Morris and Jason P. Vest point to {{a line in the}} film as possible evidence of this. After Anderton is captured, Gideon tells him that, [...] "It's actually kind of a rush. They say you have visions. That your life flashes before your eyes. That all your dreams come true."*Vest. pg. 135 While Vest considers the blissful dream ending a possibility, he questions why Anderton did not imagine his son as having returned.|$|E

They {{were able to use}} her by attracting normal folk from their daily activities to attend a Marcos rally to see the [...] "beautiful wife of Marcos" [...] themselves. The mere mention of Imelda attending a rally would make people attend the rally and scamper for a place near the stage, not to listen to the speeches, but rather <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the lovely wife of Ferdinand Marcos.

500|$|Petrucci and keyboardist Jordan Rudess {{wrote the}} album's music {{independently}} {{from the rest}} of Dream Theater by getting together everyday, going over ideas in the morning, and then working through the music during the day and night. Upon finishing their initial drafts, they presented them {{to the rest of the}} band, who worked on writing parts for their own instruments. In an interview with Artisan News, drummer Mike Mangini reflected, [...] "The biggest challenge for me was interpreting the initial music that was given to me, because there were no drums. So , 'All right, I need to listen to this, really, as a whole piece to understand where I should kind of let loose or I should lay back a lot.' All that. <b>Just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it as a whole, 'cause I don't wanna play blindly or try to fit too much where it doesn't belong." ...|$|E
500|$|Back in Los Angeles, Beck {{began to}} work at a video store in Silver Lake [...] "doing things like {{alphabetizing}} the pornography section". He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al's Bar and Raji's. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. [...] "I'd be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking. So maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if people were listening," [...] he later remarked. Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play [...] "strange folk songs", accompanied by [...] "what could best be described as performance art" [...] while sometimes wearing a Star Wars stormtrooper mask. Beck met someone who offered to help record demos in his living room, and he began to pass cassette tapes around.|$|E
