5|$|James Maury Henson (September 24, 1936– May 16, 1990) was an American puppeteer, artist, cartoonist, inventor, screenwriter, and filmmaker who {{achieved}} international fame as {{the creator}} of the Muppets. Born in Greenville, Mississippi, and raised in Leland, Mississippi, and Hyattsville, Maryland, Henson began developing puppets while attending high school. While he was a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park, he created Sam and Friends, a five-minute sketch-comedy puppet show that appeared on television. After graduating from the University of Maryland with a degree in home economics, he produced coffee advertisements and <b>developed</b> <b>some</b> experimental films. Henson founded Muppets Inc. in 1958 (which would later become the Jim Henson Company).|$|E
5|$|Roaring Brook is {{the largest}} {{tributary}} of the Lackawanna River. It is a third-order stream. Its headwaters are situated immediately {{to the west of}} the watershed of the Lehigh River. Forested land comprises 70 percent of the watershed's upper reaches. 20 percent is agricultural land and 10 percent is <b>developed.</b> <b>Some</b> abandoned mine land occurs in the watershed as well. Other land uses include high-density residential land and downtown commercial land. Major roads in the watershed include Interstate 380, Interstate 84, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. South Washington Avenue is located near the stream's mouth. The University of Scranton is located near the stream.|$|E

By 1984, SAS had begun building a fitness center, medical center, on-site cafe and other facilities. It had also <b>developed</b> <b>some</b> of its other benefits programs. SAS became known as a good place to work and was frequently recognized by national magazines like BusinessWeek, Working Mother and Fortune for its work environment.|$|E
5|$|Narcissi are now {{popular as}} {{ornamental}} plants for gardens, parks and as cut flowers, providing colour {{from the end}} of winter to the beginning of summer in temperate regions. They {{are one of the most}} popular spring flowers and one of the major ornamental spring flowering bulb crops, being produced both for their bulbs and cut flowers, though cultivation of private and public spaces is greater than the area of commercial production. Over a century of breeding has resulted in thousands of varieties and cultivars being available from both general and specialist suppliers. They are normally sold as dry bulbs to be planted in late summer and autumn. They are one of the most economically important ornamental plants. Plant breeders have <b>developed</b> <b>some</b> daffodils with double, triple, or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments. Many of the breeding programs have concentrated on the corona (trumpet or cup), in terms of its length, shape, and colour, and the surrounding perianth or even as in varieties derived from N. poeticus a very reduced form.|$|E
5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have <b>developed</b> <b>some</b> unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E

5|$|The pre-Socratic Greek {{philosophers}} and Indian philosophers <b>developed</b> <b>some</b> {{of the earliest}} philosophical concepts of the Universe. The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials {{in the world are}} different forms of a single primordial material, or arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers resistance to motion. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.|$|E
