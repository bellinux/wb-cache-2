5|$|Edgar Murray finds Threni less {{expressive}} {{than the}} Krenek, {{and more like}} the Lamentationes of Thomas Tallis. Stravinsky, however, while acknowledging that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> the Tallis settings and works by William Byrd and Palestrina, {{did not believe that}} they had influenced his music.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Barringer, Berg {{enrolled}} in New York University. He spent two semesters there and played baseball and basketball. In 1919 {{he transferred to}} Princeton University and never again mentioned that he had attended NYU for a year, presenting himself exclusively as a Princeton man. Berg received a B.A., magna cum laude in modern languages. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> seven languages: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Sanskrit, studying with the philologist Harold H. Bender. His Jewish heritage and modest finances combined to keep him {{on the fringes of}} Princeton society, where he never quite fit in.|$|E
5|$|As Threni was {{intended}} for concert rather than liturgical use, Stravinsky chose the text freely from the early chapters of the Book of Lamentations. It has three movements: the large central movement is surrounded by two much shorter ones. Ernst Krenek composed a setting of the Lamentations in 1942, and Stravinsky acknowledged {{that it might have}} influenced him. He considered it less likely that works by Renaissance composers, including Tallis, Byrd and Palestrina, had influenced him, although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> such music.|$|E

5|$|By age sixteen, Sampson was {{teaching}} at Indian Creek School in Laurel County. He attended Union College in Barbourville, then enrolled at Valparaiso University. He was class president for three years, and earned an A.B. in 1894. Per university policy, {{he was also}} awarded and an LL.B. because, prior to graduation, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> {{for at least one}} year in a law office. He returned to Kentucky and was admitted to the bar in June 1895.|$|E
5|$|Details about Cẩn's {{early life}} are scarce. In his youth, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> the {{writings}} and {{opinions of the}} renowned anti-French Vietnamese nationalist Phan Bội Châu, who spent his last years in Huế. Regarded as the leading revolutionary of his time, Châu had been captured and sentenced to death, before having his sentence reduced to house arrest. Cẩn regularly traveled to Châu's sampan on the Perfume River with gifts of food and listened to Châu's political lectures. Regarded as the least educated of his family, Cẩn had never traveled outside Vietnam and was the only Ngô brother not to have studied at a European-run institution.|$|E
5|$|The Commandos were aided {{in their}} {{planning}} for the operation by Captain Bill Pritchard of the Royal Engineers, who had pre-war experience as an apprentice in the Great Western Railway dockyards and whose father was the dock master of Cardiff Docks. In 1940 while part of the British Expeditionary Force in France, his duties had included determining how to disable the French dockyards if they were captured. One of the dockyards <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> was St Nazaire, and he had submitted a report detailing how to put the dock out of action.|$|E

5|$|Together {{with the}} pied and grey currawong, the black currawong forms the genus Strepera. Although crow-like in {{appearance}} and habits, currawongs are only distantly related to true crows, and are instead {{closely related to}} the Australian magpie and the butcherbirds. The affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by ornithologist John Albert Leach after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> their musculature. Ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between the woodswallows and the butcherbirds and relatives in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which later became the family Artamidae.|$|E
5|$|Another element {{widely used}} by Gaudí was the {{catenary}} arch. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> geometry thoroughly {{when he was}} young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised {{the virtues of the}} catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction of suspension bridges. Gaudí was the first to use this element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling tangential forces.|$|E
5|$|Its closest {{relative}} is {{the black}} currawong (S. fuliginosa) of Tasmania, which has sometimes been considered a subspecies. Together with the larger grey currawong (S. versicolor), they form the genus Strepera. Although crow-like in appearance and habits, currawongs are only distantly related to true crows, and instead belong to the family Artamidae, together with the closely related Australian magpie and the butcherbirds. The affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they {{were placed in the}} family Cracticidae in 1914 by ornithologist John Albert Leach after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> their musculature.

5|$|The pied butcherbird {{is one of}} six (or seven) {{members of}} the genus Cracticus known as butcherbirds. Within the genus, it is most {{closely related to the}} Tagula butcherbird (C. louisiadensis) and hooded butcherbird (C. cassicus). The three form a {{monophyletic}} group within the genus, having diverged from ancestors of the grey butcherbird around five million years ago. The butcherbirds, Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) and currawongs (Strepera spp.) were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by John Albert Leach after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> their musculature. American ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between woodswallows and the butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which became the family Artamidae in 1994.|$|E
5|$|When Hubbard {{arrived in}} Portland, the USS PC-815 {{was in the}} last stages of its construction. The ship, a 173ft (53 m) steel-hulled subchaser of the PC-461 class, had been laid down on October 10, 1942 at the Albina shipworks. She was {{commissioned}} on April 21, 1943 with Hubbard in command and Lt (jg) Thomas Moulton, an officer with whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> in Florida, as the ship's executive officer. The ship left Portland on May 18 to travel down the Columbia River to Astoria, Oregon, where she took on ammunition. After participating for a day in an air-sea rescue operation, USS PC-815 was ordered to sail to San Diego to commence its shakedown cruise.|$|E
5|$|As {{a student}} at the University of Edinburgh in 1827, Darwin learnt about marine {{invertebrates}} while assisting the investigations of the anatomist Robert Edmond Grant, and during his last year at the University of Cambridge in 1831, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> geology under Adam Sedgwick. So when he was unexpectedly offered a place on the Beagle expedition, as a gentleman naturalist he was well suited to FitzRoy's aim of having a companion able to examine geology on land while the ship's complement carried out its hydrographic survey. FitzRoy gave Darwin the first volume of Lyell's Principles of Geology before they left. On their first stop ashore at St Jago island in January 1832, Darwin saw geological formations which he explained using Lyell's uniformitarian concept that forces still in operation made land slowly rise or fall over immense periods of time, and thought that he could write his own book on geology. Lyell's first volume included a brief outline of the idea that atolls were based on volcanic craters, and the second volume, which was sent to Darwin during the voyage, gave more detail. Darwin received it in November 1832.|$|E

5|$|Maple noted that, unusually—given {{his role}} as a cunning man—Pickingill did not charge for his services, but did receive some money from visitors, and that his {{recorded}} roles included restoring lost property and curing minor ailments, both of which were common practices amongst British cunning folk. According to one account, he cured a woman of rheumatism by transferring the ailment to her father. Maple wrote that Pickingill was known to use cursing and malevolent magic on occasion, something that the folklorist contrasted with the activities of other contemporary cunning folk that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied,</b> such as James Murrell. At harvest time, Maple recorded, Pickingill was known to wander around the field threatening to bewitch farm machinery, with many farmers thus offering him beer so that he would leave them alone. He was also recorded as coercing local people to obtain water for him from the village pump by threatening to set upon them white mice, a rodent which in local folklore was associated with misfortune. Another tale that Maple recorded also associated Pickingill with white mice; according to this, a visitor travelled to the cunning man's cottage only to find him lying in bed, with the mice suckling from his nipples.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, {{therefore it is}} likely that White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli {{was ordained}} in Constance, {{the seat of}} the local diocese, and he celebrated his first Mass in his hometown, Wildhaus, on 29 September 1506. As a young priest <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> little theology, but this was not {{considered}} unusual at the time. His first ecclesiastical post was the pastorate of the town of Glarus, where he stayed for ten years. It was in Glarus, whose soldiers were used as mercenaries in Europe, that Zwingli became involved in politics. The Swiss Confederation was embroiled in various campaigns with its neighbours: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States. Zwingli placed himself solidly {{on the side of the}} Roman See. In return, Pope Julius II honoured Zwingli by providing him with an annual pension. He took the role of chaplain in several campaigns in Italy, including the Battle of Novara in 1513. However, the decisive defeat of the Swiss in the Battle of Marignano caused a shift in mood in Glarus in favour of the French rather than the pope. Zwingli, the papal partisan, found himself in a difficult position and he decided to retreat to Einsiedeln in the canton of Schwyz. By this time, he had become convinced that mercenary service was immoral and that Swiss unity was indispensable for any future achievements. Some of his earliest extant writings, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), attacked the mercenary system using allegory and satire. His countrymen were presented as virtuous people within a French, imperial, and papal triangle. Zwingli stayed in Einsiedeln for two years during which he withdrew completely from politics in favour of ecclesiastical activities and personal studies.|$|E
