2500|$|Since {{the last}} {{broadcasts}} of BS Zelda (in January 1997) and BS Zelda: MAP2 (in March 1996), restoration-minded fans have created numerous patches {{that have been}} applied to the original ROM dumps to alter the game by removing the game's download pauses and time limits, stringing together all four episodes into one, and providing a title screen and <b>file</b> <b>selection</b> screen, among others. Some patches have also replaced the game's protagonist with Link, {{the hero of the}} original The Legend of Zelda in order to more closely mimic this game. Further altering the game, some emulation-based restoration projects have removed the [...] "Listen closely" [...] sign to replace it with a display showing the text of the narration that originally accompanied the [...] "Listen closely" [...] sign, and more recent MSU-1 emulation projects have introduced fan-made voice acting of the original script. The game has been translated by fans into English, French, Spanish, and German. The cumulative effects of all of these alterations has led to a great deal of confusion among fans as to the character of the original broadcasts and as modern hacked versions are often missing plot details initially present in missing vocal files, this has contributed to the misconception that the games were little more than 16-bit remakes of the original.|$|E

The many advantages include easy program or <b>file</b> <b>selection,</b> quick start, and interactive debugging.

40|$|Abstract. The CMS {{experiment}} at CERN {{is setting}} up a Grid infrastructure required to fulfil the needs imposed by Terabyte scale productions {{for the next few}} years. The goal is to automate the production {{and at the same time}} allow the users to interact with the system, if required, to make decisions which would optimise performance. We present the architecture, design and functionality of our first working Objectivity file replication prototype. The middle-ware of choice is the Globus toolkit that provides promising functionality. Our results prove the ability of the Globus toolkit to be used as an underlying technology for a world-wide Data Grid. The required data management functionality includes high speed file transfers, secure access to remote <b>files,</b> <b>selection</b> and synchronisation of replicas and managing the meta information. The whole system is expected to be flexible enough to incorporate site specific policies. The data management granularity is the file rather than the object level. The first prototype is currently in use for the High Level Trigger (HLT) production (autumn 2000). Owing to these efforts, CMS is one of the pioneers to use the Data Grid functionality in a running production system. The project can be viewed as an evaluator of different strategies, a test for the capabilities of middle-ware tools and a provider of basic Grid functionalities...|$|R
