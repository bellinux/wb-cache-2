5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} both shell and workings, and {{analysis}} of the metal content of the original brass pipes of the organ (many have been replaced), indicates that the tiger was of local manufacture.

5|$|The 1990s saw an {{increasing}} interest in international cuisines. Sushi, in particular, has taken hold {{as a popular}} style for eating out and as an entrée for events. In restaurants, fusion cuisine, with the melding of classic cuisines such as French and Japanese with local ingredients has become widespread. In the 2000s, the trend of “eating healthy” {{with an emphasis on}} organic and whole grain foods has become prominent, and medical research <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> Israelis to re-embrace the Mediterranean diet, with its touted health benefits.|$|E
25|$|The mix of {{positive}} attitudes to femininity with blatantly negative sentiment <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> writers to characterise early Buddhism's attitude to women as deeply ambivalent.|$|E

25|$|Monoculturalism: In some European states, {{culture is}} very {{closely linked to}} nationalism, thus {{government}} policy is to assimilate immigrants, although recent increases in migration <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> European states to experiment with forms of multiculturalism.|$|R
25|$|He was {{confirmed}} {{in the position}} of party secretary at the third, fourth, fifth and sixth congresses of Rifondazione. At the last, however, his final document received less support than usual, gaining only 52% of delegates' votes. This close result <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> political commentators to suggest that he may be replaced as secretary of Rifondazione Comunista by Nichi Vendola.|$|E
25|$|Several of the {{top-level}} categories have unique characteristics. The Adult {{category is}} not present on the directory homepage but it is fully available in the RDF dump that DMOZ provides. While {{the bulk of the}} directory is categorized primarily by topic, the Regional category is categorized primarily by region. This <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> to view DMOZ as two parallel directories: Regional and Topical.|$|E
25|$|Transcendence (paired {{with the}} term The Encompassing in later works) is, for Jaspers, that which exists beyond the world of time and space. Jaspers' {{formulation}} of Transcendence as ultimate non-objectivity (or no-thing-ness) <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> philosophers to argue that ultimately, Jaspers became a monist, though Jaspers himself continually stressed the necessity of recognizing {{the validity of the}} concepts both of subjectivity and of objectivity.|$|E

25|$|The {{community}} of Dixville Notch traditionally opens its polling {{place in the}} ballroom of The Balsams Grand Resort Hotel at midnight, usually {{in front of a}} crowd of journalists, where the village's handful of voters cast their ballots before the polls close about less than ten minutes later. This <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> presidential candidates to visit the area before the New Hampshire primary in hopes of securing an early-morning boost.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the front wings, Anchiornis had long, vaned feathers on the hind legs. This <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> scientists to call Anchiornis a four-winged dinosaur, along with similar animals like Microraptor and Sapeornis. However, the feathers on the hind legs in Anchiornis {{did not have the}} shape or arrangement expected from flight feathers, and it is likely that their primary role was in display rather than flight.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to criticizing the show's perceived controversial or offensive content, critics have also targeted the show's reliance on Cutaway Gags. The show's Cutaway Gags are mostly {{criticized for being}} either offensive or too long. The show has also received criticism of having one-dimensional characters and unoriginal storytelling. The backlash Family Guy has received <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> contemporary animated sitcoms such as South Park and The Simpsons to satirize Family Guys writing.|$|E

25|$|According to {{different}} estimates, {{there are about}} 25,000-45,000 Moroccan Christians of Berber or Arab descent mostly converted from Islam. Other sources give a number of {{a bit more than}} 1,000.

His programs have been credited with assisting in the conversion of over 150,000 former Muslims to Christianity in Morocco.|$|E

50|$|The {{teeth of}} S. clarki were shaped like cloves (maple leaves), which coupled with its short and deep snout suggest {{it was not}} a {{carnivore}} like most other crocodylomorphs. In fact, these features <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> palaeontologists to consider it an herbivore.|$|R
50|$|According to John Conduitt's {{introductory}} letter, The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended was Isaac Newton's last personally reviewed {{work before}} his death.

25|$|The exact {{causes for}} the {{development}} of a particular sexual orientation have yet to be established. To date, a lot of research has been conducted to determine the influence of genetics, hormonal action, development dynamics, social and cultural influences—which <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> to think that biology and environment factors play a complex role in forming it. It was once thought that homosexuality was the result of faulty psychological development, resulting from childhood experiences and troubled relationships, including childhood sexual abuse. It has been found that this was based on prejudice and misinformation.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} {{cryptographic}} technology has raised {{a number of}} legal issues in the information age.

In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation. Cryptography also {{plays a major role in}} digital rights management and copyright infringement of digital media.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the trogons within the class Aves has been a long-standing mystery. A variety of relations have been suggested, including the parrots, cuckoos, toucans, jacamars and puffbirds, rollers, owls and nightjars. More recent morphological and molecular evidence has suggested {{a relationship with the}} Coliiformes. The unique arrangement of the toes on the foot (see morphology and flight) <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> to consider the trogons to have no close relatives, and to place them in their own order, possibly with the similarly atypical mousebirds as their closest relatives.|$|E
5000|$|Legendary {{powers and}} age have been {{attributed}} to Mahavatar Babaji by the disciples of Lahirī. These stories <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>many</b> to believe that Mahavatar Babaji is a legendary person, rather than a real sadhu that was seen by numerous witnesses from 1861 to 1935.|$|R
