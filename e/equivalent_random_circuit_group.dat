To generate " <b>random</b> <b>circuits,</b> we propose the random applications of several transformation rules to an initial circuit instead of the obvious method, random placement of connections. A preliminary experiment has been conducted on SIS's responses against such <b>random</b> <b>circuits.</b> SIS shows considerably di erent performances for di erent circuits generated from the same original circuit. 1...|$|R

We suggest a scheme to implement <b>random</b> <b>circuits</b> in a weighted graph state. The input state is entangled with the weighted graph state and a <b>random</b> <b>circuit</b> is implemented when the experimenter performs local measurements in one fixed basis only.

40|$|Random {{acceleration}} vibration {{specifications for}} subsystems, i. e. instruments, equipment, are most times based on measurement during acoustic noise tests on system level, i. e. a spacecraft and measured by accelerometers, {{placed in the}} neighborhood of the interface between spacecraft and subsystem. Tuned finite element models can be used to predict the random acceleration power spectral densities at other locations than available via the power spectral density measurements of the acceleration. The measured and predicted power spectral densities do represent the modal response characteristics of the system and show many peaks and valleys. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>random</b> acceleration vibration test specification is a smoothed, enveloped, peak-clipped version of the measured and predicted power spectral densities of the acceleration spectrum. The original acceleration vibration spectrum can be characterized by a different number response spectra: Shock Response Spectrum (SRS), Extreme Response Spectrum (ERS), Vibration Response Spectrum (VRS), and Fatigue Damage Spectrum (FDS). An additional method of non-stationary random vibrations is based on the Rayleigh distribution of peaks. The response spectra represent the responses of series of SDOF systems excited at the base by random acceleration, both in time and frequency domain. The synthesis of <b>equivalent</b> <b>random</b> acceleration vibration specifications can be done in a very structured manner and are more suitable than <b>equivalent</b> <b>random</b> acceleration vibration specifications obtained by simple enveloping. In the synthesis process Miles’ equation plays a dominant role to invert the response spectra into <b>equivalent</b> <b>random</b> acceleration vibration spectra. A procedure is proposed {{to reduce the number of}} data point in the response spectra curve by dividing the curve in a numbers of fields. The synthesis to an <b>equivalent</b> <b>random</b> acceleration spectrum is performed on a reduced selected set of data points. The recalculated response spectra curve envelops the original response spectra curves. A real life measured random acceleration spectrum (PSD) with quite a number of peaks and valleys is taken to generate, applying response spectra SRS, ERS, VRS, FDS and the Rayleigh distribution of peaks, <b>equivalent</b> <b>random</b> acceleration vibration specifications. Computations are performed both in time and frequency domain...|$|R

In this work, we aim at closing the gap by proving two anti-concentration theorems.

40|$|The {{development}} of new Field-Programmed, MaskProgrammed and Laser-Programmed Gate Array architectures is hampered {{by the lack of}} realistic test circuits that exercise both the architectures and their automatic placement and routing algorithms. In this paper, we present a method and a tool for generating parameterized and realistic <b>random</b> <b>circuits.</b> To obtain the realism, we propose a set of graph-theoretic characteristics that describe a physical netlist, and have built a tool that can measure these characteristics on existing circuits.

To validate the quality of the generated netlists, parameters that are not specified in the generation are compared with those of real circuits, and with those of "random" graphs. 1 Introduction There is a need for benchmark netlists in order to compare and test the quality of new ASIC architectures and physical design algorithms.

40|$|Random {{instances}} of feedforward Boolean circuits are studied both analytically and numerically. Evaluating these circuits {{is known to}} be a P-complete problem and thus, in the worst case, believed to be impossible to perform, even given a massively parallel computer, in a time much less than the depth of the circuit. Nonetheless, it is found that, for some ensembles of <b>random</b> <b>circuits,</b> saturation to a fixed truth value occurs rapidly so that evaluation of the circuit can be accomplished in much less parallel time than the depth of the circuit. For other ensembles saturation does not occur and circuit evaluation is apparently hard. In particular, for some <b>random</b> <b>circuits</b> composed of connectives with five or more inputs, the number of true outputs at each level is a chaotic sequence. Finally, while the average case complexity depends on the choice of ensemble, it is shown that for all ensembles it is possible to simultaneously construct a typical circuit together with its solution in polylogarithmic parallel time...|$|R

40|$|We extend de Finetti’s (1974) {{theory of}} {{coherence}} to apply also to unbounded random variables. We show that for random variables with mandated infinite prevision, such {{as for the}} St. Petersburg gamble, coherence precludes indifference between <b>equivalent</b> <b>random</b> quantities. That is, we demonstrate when the prevision {{of the difference between}} two such <b>equivalent</b> <b>random</b> variables must be positive. This result conflicts with the usual approach to theories of Subjective Expected Utility, where preference is defined over lotteries. In addition, we explore similar results for unbounded variables when their previsions, though finite, exceed their expected values, as is permitted within de Finetti’s theory. In such cases, the decision maker’s coherent preferences over random quantities is not even a function of probability and utility. One upshot of these findings is to explain further the differences between Savage’s theory (1954), which requires bounded utility for non-simple acts, and de Finetti’s theory, which does not.

To assess, refine and advance the design and control of these devices, one needs a means to test and evaluate their fidelity.
