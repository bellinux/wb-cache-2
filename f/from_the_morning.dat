5|$|Gen. Lee {{arrived on}} the {{battlefield}} at about 2:30 p.m., as Rodes's men were in mid-attack. Seeing that a major assault was underway, he lifted his restriction on a general engagement and gave permission to Hill to resume his attacks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> First in line was Heth's division again, with two fresh brigades: Pettigrew's North Carolinians and Col. John M. Brockenbrough's Virginians.|$|E
5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} attacks <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Morning</b> Chronicle on his supposed indecency, poor {{taste and}} lack of creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that would prove his detractors wrong. The result was The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E

5|$|Agreements between Norwegian and Russian {{authorities}} {{were made on}} 31 August, where Norway resumed full responsibility for the recovery and investigation, but Russian help was accepted. To allow the Russian workers access <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of 1 September, the crew was allowed to fly in and establish a base camp, but no work was to be done until Norwegian supervisors arrived in the morning. However, two people were observed at the wreck at about 20:00 CEST, who {{were brought to the}} Governor's offices for questioning. As they were both members of the Russian team, it was decided that the base would be disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} torpedo planes attacked Enterprise, South Dakota, and cruiser , but all {{of their}} torpedoes missed or failed, causing no damage. The engagement was over at 10:53; nine of the 16 torpedo aircraft were lost in this attack. After suppressing most of the onboard fires, at 11:15 Enterprise reopened her flight deck to begin landing returning aircraft <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> U.S. strikes on the Japanese warship forces. However, only a few aircraft landed before {{the next wave of}} Japanese strike aircraft arrived and began their attacks on Enterprise, forcing a suspension of landing operations.|$|E
5|$|As Allen {{approached}} the Gulf of Mexico, hurricane warnings were raised for the northeast Yucatán peninsula of Mexico from {{the afternoon of}} August 6 into the morning of August 8. Gale warnings were in effect for the Florida Keys from the evening of August 6 into the early morning of August 8. As Allen approached its final landfall, the northeast Mexican coast and Texas coast were placed under a hurricane watch <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of August 8 until the morning of August 9 for Mexico and the afternoon of August 9 for Texas. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Texas coast during the afternoon of August 8, and were lowered north of Freeport, Texas during the afternoon of August 9 and south of Freeport during the afternoon of August 10. Gale warnings and a hurricane watch were issued for the Louisiana coast from Vermilion Bay westward from the afternoon of August 8 into the afternoon of August 9. Hurricane warnings were in effect for northeast Mexico from the early afternoon of August 9 into the late afternoon of August 10. Hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings between High Island, Texas and Freeport, Texas between the late afternoon of August 9 and the late afternoon of August 10. Hurricane watches were dropped for the Louisiana coast during the late afternoon of August 9. Hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings for the lower Texas coast south of Freeport from the late afternoon of August 10 into the early morning of August 11.|$|E
25|$|The Squirrel Grippers {{were chosen}} as Stubb's replacement, moving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> to breakfast. Renaming {{themselves}} as Timbo & Bedders for Breakfast, they continued Stubbs' success from 1998 to 2001.|$|R
60|$|Next day, when we {{were all}} {{assembled}} round the breakfast-table, shivering and fresh <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning's</b> chill ablutions, Mrs. Bretton pronounced a decree that nobody, who was not forced by dire necessity, should quit her house that day.|$|R
60|$|When {{the bell}} rang for the quarter to eleven {{interval}} the ferrets were in their new home, happily discussing a piece of meat--Renford's contribution, held over <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning's</b> meal,--and O'Hara, looking {{as if he had}} never left the passage for an instant, was making his way through the departing mathematical class to apologise handsomely to Mr Banks--as was his invariable custom--for his disgraceful behaviour during <b>the</b> <b>morning's</b> lesson.|$|R
5|$|At the {{vernal equinox}} of 1930, Fortune {{declared}} that—with the 'Lesser Mysteries' and three degree system now properly established—she {{wanted to turn}} away from public work and focus on personal spiritual development. At the vernal equinox of 1931, Fortune stepped down as leader of the Fraternity, with Loveday being appointed Magus of the Lodge in her place. During the 1930s, Fortune's emphasis moved away from mediumship and towards ritual, {{while at the same time}} other Fraternity members embraced mediumship in order to channel the messages of the Masters. In late 1931, Fortune began mooting the idea of the construction of a permanent base, or Sanctuary, at the Chalice Orchard, and despite the economic obstacles of the Great Depression was able to raise sufficient funds. The group experienced a growth in the numbers attending its lectures, subscribing to its correspondence course, and using their private library; conversely, their Sunday services were not very popular, with a move <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to the evening seeing no effect. One significant individual who joined the Fraternity was Christine Campbell Thomson, who had been Fortune's literary agent since 1926. Fortune subsequently aided Thomson in separating from her abusive husband, after which she grew close to another Fraternity member, Colonel C. R. F. Seymour, in 1937. Although Seymour became a senior member of the Fraternity, relations between him and Fortune were strained, and during the Second World War he left London and settled in Liverpool, terminating his involvement with Fortune's Bayswater temple.|$|E

25|$|The attack, {{which began}} in the early {{afternoon}} of 13 January—postponed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> because of a persistent mist and a slow advance by artillery across the river—quickly lost the intended element of surprise, as the outnumbered British forces on both sides of enemy lines struggled to assert themselves against a robust Ottoman defense. Kemball made a frontal advance, while Younghusband, with the bulk of the British force, attempted a wide turning movement. The delay seriously affected the chances of success, as small-arms and artillery fire from the alerted Ottoman forces began to halt the British infantry movements.|$|E
25|$|On 24 March, three {{workers were}} exposed {{to high levels of}} {{radiation}} which caused two of them to require hospital treatment after radioactive water seeped through their protective clothes while working in unit 3. It rained in Tokyo <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of 21 March to 24 March. The rain brought radioactive fallout there. In Shinjuku, based on the research by Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health, 83900 Bq/m2 of I-131, 6310 Bq/m2 of Cs-134, and 6350 Bq/m2 of Cs-137 were detected for these four days in total as radioactive fallout, including 24hours from 20 March 9:00am to 21 March 9:00am.|$|E
25|$|Churchill first {{sought the}} opinion of friends and {{relations}} about the book. He asked his grandmother, Frances, Duchess of Marlborough, to comment, with particular reference {{to the character of}} Lucile. She responded that she felt the book was worthy of publication, particularly since it already had the prospect of a reasonable financial return, but felt the plot might be improved. She was impressed by the descriptions of fighting, but agreed with Churchill's concerns about Lucile, suggesting that the character betrayed his lack of experience of women. However, an offer of £100 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Morning</b> Post for the right to serialise the book left Churchill no time for amendments, and it was published as it stood.|$|E

25|$|A {{powerful}} spring-time {{low pressure}} system developed across the North American Interior Plains on April 1. While {{moving into the}} Mississippi and Ohio Valley areas, a surge of very moist air intensified the storm further while there were sharp temperature contrasts between {{both sides of the}} system. Officials at NOAA and in the National Weather Service forecast offices were expecting a severe weather outbreak on April 3, but not to the extent that ultimately occurred. Several F2 and F3 tornadoes had struck portions of the Ohio Valley and the South in a separate, earlier outbreak on April 1 and 2, which included three killer tornadoes in Kentucky, Alabama, and Tennessee. The town of Campbellsburg, northeast of Louisville, was hard-hit in this earlier outbreak, with {{a large portion of the}} town destroyed by an F3. Between the two outbreaks, an additional tornado was reported in Indiana in the early morning hours of April 3, several hours before the official start of the outbreak. On Wednesday, April 3, severe weather watches already were issued <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> from south of the Great Lakes, while in portions of the Upper Midwest, snow was reported, with heavy rain falling across central Michigan and much of Ontario.|$|E

500|$|Joseph Priestley's son William was {{presented}} to the French Assembly and granted letters of naturalization on 8 June 1792.

A decree of 26 August 1792 by the French National Assembly conferred French citizenship on Joseph Priestley and others who had [...] "served the cause of liberty" [...] by their writings. Priestley accepted French citizenship, considering it [...] "the greatest of honours". [...] In the French National Convention election on 5 September 1792, Joseph Priestley was elected to the French National Convention by at least two departments, (Orne and Rhône-et-Loire). However, he declined the honor, on the grounds that he was not fluent in French.|$|E

500|$|Corder {{was easily}} discovered, as Ayres, the constable in Polstead, {{was able to}} obtain his old address from a friend. Ayres was {{assisted}} by James Lea, {{an officer of the}} London police force who later led the investigation into [...] "Spring-heeled Jack". They tracked Corder to Everley Grove House, a boarding house for ladies in Brentford. Corder was running the boarding house with his new wife Mary Moore, whom he had met through a newspaper advertisement that he had placed in The Times (which had received more than 100 replies). Judith Flanders states in her 2011 book that he had placed advertisements in the Morning Herald and The Sunday Times. He received more than 40 replies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Morning</b> Herald and 53 from The Sunday Times that he never picked up. These letters were subsequently published by George Foster in 1828.|$|E

He is a laborious draughtsman, and a beautiful colourist; but he has not taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth."

500|$|Despite all the {{controversy}} and negative backlash, {{which included the}} book being banned in Japan shortly after its release, Sex {{proved to be a}} commercial success, selling 150,000copies on its release day in the United States alone.

A week later, the book's sales exceeded the 500,000units and eventually topped The New York Times Best Seller list. Giselle Benatar wrote in her article [...] "Sex & Money": [...] "This isn't the publishing event of the year, it's the publishing event of the century." [...] A day earlier, Tyra Braden <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Morning</b> Call wrote that she and some friends concluded that the book [...] "might become a collector's item a few years down the road".
