5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>or</b> stroke.|$|E

500|$|A {{few studies}} have {{suggested}} that total dietary fat intake is linked to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. However, a number of very large studies, including the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, an eight-year study of 49,000 women, the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, revealed no such links. None of these studies suggested any connection between percentage of calories from fat and risk of cancer, <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> <b>or</b> weight gain. The Nutrition Source, a website maintained by the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, summarizes the current evidence on the impact of dietary fat: [...] "Detailed research—much of it done at Harvard—shows that the total amount of fat in the diet isn't really linked with weight or disease." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, a CIAR-funded {{study on}} secondhand smoke {{exposure}} by Peter Lee was published. The tobacco industry {{hoped that the}} study would undermine the validity of a 1981 study by Takeshi Hirayama, which reported a positive association between secondhand smoke and lung cancer risk. The final paper concluded that studies like Hirayama's were subject to misclassification bias, and therefore, had [...] "little scientific basis". In 1995, the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology published two studies funded by the CIAR examining the association between ETS and heart disease. Both studies concluded that ETS exposure from spouses did not {{increase the risk of}} heart disease, and that previous conclusions to the contrary were due to publication bias. Both of these studies have been criticized for suffering from exposure misclassification, because both studies failed to distinguish between current and former smokers. In 2003, a study funded by the center was published in the BMJ. Authored by James Enstrom and Geoffrey Kabat, the study found little association between secondhand smoke and coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>or</b> lung cancer. This study has been criticized for failing to distinguish between those who were exposed to second-hand smoke and those who were not, because, according to the American Cancer Society, the study's participants were enrolled in 1959, [...] "when exposure to secondhand smoke was so pervasive that virtually everyone was exposed to ETS, {{whether or not they were}} married to a smoker." ...|$|E

2500|$|AF {{is linked}} to several forms of {{cardiovascular}} disease, but may occur in otherwise normal hearts.

Disorders of breathing during sleep such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are also associated with AF. [...] Obesity is a risk factor for AF.
