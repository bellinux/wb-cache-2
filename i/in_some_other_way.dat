5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E

Explicit consent is when a patient clearly communicates to a healthcare worker, verbally or in writing or <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> that relevant confidential information can be shared. Implied consent, means that a patient's consent to share personal confidential information is assumed.

25|$|So the {{function}} of satisfaction for Aquinas is not to placate a wrathful God or <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> remove the constraints which compel God to damn sinners. Instead, {{the function}} of satisfaction is to restore a sinner {{to a state of}} harmony with God by repairing or restoring in the sinner what sin has damaged. This is Aquinas' major difference with Anselm. Rather than seeing the debt as one of honor, he sees the debt as a moral injustice to be righted.|$|E

25|$|The {{most obvious}} {{evidence}} for this model is that carnivorous plants tend to grow in habitats where water and light are abundant and where competition is relatively low: the typical bog.

25|$|A {{receiving}} woman's {{legs and}} arms are generally free to move about, though her position and movement may be constrained by the penetrating partner's weight and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.|$|E
25|$|A retail {{electricity}} market exists when end-use {{customers can}} choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers; one term {{used in the}} United States {{for this type of}} consumer choice is 'energy choice'. A separate issue for electricity markets is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have no incentive to reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) prices or to shift their demand to other periods. Demand response may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to the end}} of the Cold War, the {{consensus}} among students of large-scale violence was that ethnic groups should be considered irrational actors, or semi-rational at best. If true, general explanations of ethnic violence would be impossible. In the years since, however, scholarly consensus has shifted to consider that ethnic groups may in fact be counted as rational actors, and the puzzle of their apparently irrational actions (for example, fighting over territory of little or no intrinsic worth) must therefore be explained <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> As a result, the possibility of a general explanation of ethnic violence has grown, and collaboration between comparativist and international-relations sub-fields has resulted in increasingly useful theories of ethnic conflict.|$|E
50|$|The Tabuk {{differs from}} the M72 <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways.</b> It has {{provision}} for mounting optics, though {{this is not an}} unusual accessory on Eastern Bloc weapons, and it has a skeletonized buttstock with a cheek piece. A third difference, and perhaps the most important (though not definitive) visual cue when identifying the Tabuk, is the conspicuous lack of a bipod. The M72's bipod, which is not detachable from the M72 (though sometimes removed by undisciplined troops), is quite obvious from afar when attached. It was likely removed from the Tabuk design to enhance mechanical accuracy and reduce weight, though had it been retained it might have added useful stability (practical accuracy) for long range work.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} distance between classes and training datasets size to XCS classifier system on imbalanced datasets. Our purpose is {{to answer the question}} whether the loss of performance incurred by the classifier faced with class imbalance problems stems from the class imbalance per se or it can be explained <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways.</b> The experiments from 250 artificial imbalanced datasets show that XCS can perform well <b>in</b> <b>some</b> imbalance domains if the training datasets size is large enough and the distance between classes is appropriate. Thus, it dose not seem fair to correlate imbalance datasets directly to the loss performance of XCS. Through this research, we also know what kinds of datasets are suitable for training XCS and dealing with class imbalances alone will not always help improve performance of classifiers...|$|R
25|$|Firstly, if the omniscient mean {{is unknown}} (and is {{computed}} as the sample mean), then the sample variance is a biased estimator: it underestimates the variance {{by a factor}} of (n−1) / n; correcting by this factor (dividing by n−1 instead of n) is called Bessel's correction. The resulting estimator is unbiased, and is called the (corrected) sample variance or unbiased sample variance. For example, when n=1 the variance of a single observation about the sample mean (itself) is obviously zero regardless of the population variance. If the mean is determined <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> than from the same samples used to estimate the variance then this bias does not arise and the variance can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the (independently known) mean.|$|E
25|$|Peter Fritsch and his coauthors {{decided to}} do a more {{comprehensive}} test for carnivory on P. minensis after they observed nematode worms on leaf surfaces. The similarity between the habitat for Philcoxia species and that of Genlisea and their similar subterranean leaves and stems spurred the team's decision to test for potential carnivory {{in the field and}} in situ. They tested for a protease enzyme {{that is one of the}} enzymes found in other carnivorous plants and is responsible for breaking down captured prey. They hypothesized that Philcoxia could be carnivorous, capturing nematodes and possibly soil microbes like Utricularia and Genlisea do. Ultimately, Fritsch's study concluded that while no protease activity was detected, this fact does not rule out the possibility that the genus may be carnivorous <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> They note that there are many possibilities, such as seasonal carnivory or the unusual growth form being an adaptation to the heat and sun, and more study is needed before precise conclusions can be reached.|$|E

Keyboard instruments are any instruments that are played with a musical keyboard. Every key generates one or more sounds; most keyboard instruments have extra means (pedals for a piano, stops and a pedal keyboard for an organ) to manipulate these sounds. They may produce sound by wind being fanned (organ) or pumped (accordion), vibrating strings either hammered (piano) or plucked (harpsichord), by electronic means (synthesizer), or <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> Sometimes, instruments that do not usually have a keyboard, such as the glockenspiel, are fitted with one.
