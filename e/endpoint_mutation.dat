The goal {{of the current study}} was to determine whether AZT monotherapy in HIV- 1 infected patients also selects the A 371 V, Q 509 L or other mutations in the C-terminal domains of HIV- 1 RT. Methodology/Principal Findings: Full-length RT sequences in plasma obtained pre- and post-therapy were compared in 23 participants who received AZT monotherapy from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group study 175.

40|$|Abstract Background Short-term {{laboratory}} {{evolution of}} bacteria followed by genomic sequencing provides {{insight into the}} mechanism of adaptive evolution, such {{as the number of}} mutations needed for adaptation, genotype-phenotype relationships, and the reproducibility of adaptive outcomes. Results In the present study, we describe the genome sequencing of 11 endpoints of Escherichia coli that underwent 60 -day laboratory adaptive evolution under growth rate selection pressure in lactate minimal media. Two to eight mutations were identified per endpoint. Generally, each <b>endpoint</b> acquired <b>mutations</b> to different genes. The most notable exception was an 82 base-pair deletion in the rph-pyrE operon that appeared in 7 of the 11 adapted strains. This mutation conferred an approximately 15 % increase to the growth rate when experimentally introduced to the wild-type background and resulted in an approximately 30 % increase to growth rate when introduced to a background already harboring two adaptive <b>mutations.</b> Additionally, most <b>endpoints</b> had a <b>mutation</b> in a regulatory gene (crp or relA, for example) or the RNA polymerase. Conclusions The 82 base-pair deletion found in the rph-pyrE operon of many endpoints may function to relieve a pyrimidine biosynthesis defect present in MG 1655. In contrast, a variety of regulators acquire mutations in the different endpoints, suggesting flexibility in overcoming regulatory challenges in the adaptation...|$|R

Five of the 23 participants reached a primary study <b>endpoint.</b> <b>Mutations</b> significantly associated with AZT monotherapy included K 70 R (p =  0. 003) and T 215 Y (p =  0. 013) in the polymerase domain of HIV- 1 RT, and A 360 V (p =  0. 041) in the connection domain of HIV- 1 RT. HIV- 1 drug susceptibility assays demonstrated that A 360 V, either alone or in combination with thymidine analog mutations, decreased AZT susceptibility in recombinant viruses containing participant-derived full-length RT sequences or site-directed mutant RT. Biochemical studies revealed that A 360 V enhances the AZT-monophosphate excision activity of purified RT by significantly decreasing the frequency of secondary RNase H cleavage events that reduce the RNA/DNA duplex length and promote template/primer dissociation. The A 360 V mutation in the connection domain of RT was selected in HIV-infected individuals that received AZT monotherapy and contributed to AZT resistance...|$|R
40|$|The high {{biological}} {{effectiveness of}} heavy ions for <b>endpoints</b> like <b>mutation</b> induction, neoplastic cell transformation or cell inactivation cannot {{be explained by}} the mere number of induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which does not vary substantially for varying radiation qualities. This has been taken as an indication that more complex DSBs are induced by high LET particles. Additionally, the size distribution of DNA fragments is different for different radiation qualities, because damaged sites are produced in close spatial proximity to each other along the track of the particle for densely ionizing radiations. The distribution of DSBs is also influenced by the organization of the DNA inside the nucleus. Sites which are considerable distances apart on the linear DNA molecule but were brought into close proximity by the structural organization of the chromatin are more likely to become simultaneousl...|$|R
40|$|A fine-structure {{deletion}} {{map of the}} L-arabinose operon of E. coli was constructed by mapping deletion <b>endpoints</b> against point <b>mutations.</b> Of 350 independent deletions with average endpoint separation of ten nucleotides, 51 ended in the control region between the C and B genes, and the rest ended in the structural genes A, B, C, and D. If deletion endpoints are randomly distributed, the C and B genes are separated by about 510 nucleotides. Deletion endpoints and locations of point mutations in fact do appear randomly interspersed in the C and B genes, but no point mutations {{were found in the}} control region between them. Deletions were isolated {{with the aid of a}} heat-inducible λ phage inserted into leucine genes adjacent to the arabinose genes.

40|$|This {{scientific}} opinion of EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) {{deals with the}} risk assessment of the additive tungsten oxide, CAS No 39318 - 18 - 8 and FCM No 1064, for use in food contact materials as a reheat agent in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at a maximum use level of 75 ppm (75 mg/kg PET). The substance {{is a mixture of}} tungsten oxides with tungsten at different oxidative levels. The average oxidation level of tungsten in the oxides is 2. 86 corresponding to 19. 93 % oxygen content. Detailed information on impurities is provided as confidential. Specific migration from PET plaques with the substance at 150 mg/kg (double the maximum intended use level of 75 mg/kg) was determined into 95 % ethanol, as a worst-case simulant for PET due to its swelling effect. Under these test conditions, the specific migration, measured as tungsten using ICP-MS, was at the level of 1 lg/kg. The Panel considered that due to the insolubility of the substance, this low migration will be typical for any foreseeable use as a reheat additive in PET. Two in vitro genotoxicity studies, a bacterial gene mutation test and an in vitro micronucleus assay, performed in accordance with the OECD Guidelines and in compliance with GLP, were provided by the applicant for the substance tungsten oxide and were considered negative by the CEF Panel. According to a {{scientific opinion}} on strategy for genotoxicity testing (EFSA, 2011), the three genotoxic <b>endpoints,</b> gene <b>mutation,</b> chromosomal and numerical aberrations, are covered by these two tests. The CEF Panel concluded that the substance tungsten oxide is not of safety concern for the consumer if the additive is used as a reheat agent in PET. For other technical functions or for use in other polymers, the migration should not exceed 50 lg/kg (expressed as tungsten) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panelon Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of dimethyl carbonate used as monomer for making a polycarbonate prepolymer with 1, 6 -hexanediol and then reacted with 4, 4 -methylenediphenyldiisocyanate (MDI) and diols, such as polypropylene glycol and 1, 4 -butanediol, to form a thermoplastic polyurethane containing 29 % of the polycarbonate prepolymer. This polymer is intended for repeated use articles with short-term contact (30 min) {{at room temperature for}} types of food, simulated by 10 % ethanol and 3 % acetic acid. In the third migration test performed at 40 degrees C during 30 min, overall migration was below 2 mg/dm(2). Complete migration of the residual dimethyl carbonate would have amounted to less than 1. 5 g/kg food. The migration of two cyclic hexanediol carbonate oligomers was below 50 g/kg food when determined by the third migration test; that of all others was below 1 g/kg food. Three invitro genotoxicity studies performed in accordance with OECD Guidelines and covering the three <b>endpoints</b> gene <b>mutation,</b> structural and numerical aberrations were provided and were considered negative by the CEF Panel. The oligomers detected by the migration tests are formed from dimethyl carbonate and 1, 6 -hexanediol (FCM ref No 1067) do not give rise to concern for genotoxicity. The CEF Panelconcluded that the use of dimethyl carbonate does not raise safety concern in the application described above. It is aware that dimethyl carbonate may be used for other polycarbonates and/or under other conditions. These are likely to result in different migrates which need to be evaluated by the business operators. In such cases, the migration of dimethyl carbonate and the total polycarbonate oligomers below 1, 000 Da is of no safety concern, if each of them does not exceed 0. 05 mg/kg food...|$|R

40|$|Tumor {{formation}} in humans or animals is a multi-step process. An {{early stage of}} cancer development {{is believed to be}} genomic instability (GI) which accelerates the mutation rate in the descendants of the cells surviving radiation exposure. GI is defined as elevated or persistent genetic damages occurring many generations after the cells are exposed. While early studies have demonstrated radiation-induced GI in several cell types as detected in <b>endpoints</b> such as <b>mutation,</b> apoptosis and damages in chromosomes, the dependence of GI on the quality of radiation remains uncertain. To investigate GI in human lymphocytes induced by both low- and high-LET radiation, we initially exposed white blood cells collected from healthy subjects to gamma rays in vitro, and cultured the cells for multiple generations. Chromosome aberrations were analyzed in cells collected at first mitosis post irradiation and at several intervals during the culture period. Among a number of biological endpoints planned for the project, the multi-color banding fluorescent in situ hybridization (mBAND) allows identification of inversions that were expected to be stable. We present here early and late chromosome aberrations detected with mBAND in chromosome 3 after gamma exposure. Comparison of chromosome damages in between human lymphocytes and human epithelial cells is also discusse...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHistoric {{approaches}} to radiation protection are {{founded on the}} conjecture that measures to safeguard humans are adequate to protect non-human organisms. This view is disparate with other toxicants wherein well-developed frameworks exist to minimise exposure of biota. Significant data gaps for many organisms, coupled with high profile nuclear incidents such as Chernobyl and Fukushima, have prompted the re-evaluation of our approach toward environmental radioprotection. Elucidating the impacts of radiation on biota {{has been identified as}} priority area for future research within both scientific and regulatory communities. The crustaceans are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems, comprising greater than 66, 000 species of ecological and commercial importance. This paper aims to assess the available literature of radiation-induced effects within this subphylum and identify knowledge gaps. A literature search was conducted pertaining to radiation effects on four endpoints as stipulated by a number of regulatory bodies: mortality, morbidity, reproduction and mutation. A major finding of this review was the paucity of data regarding the effects of environmentally relevant radiation doses on crustacean biology. Extremely few studies utilising chronic exposure durations or wild populations were found across all four endpoints. The dose levels at which effects occur was found to vary by orders of magnitude thus presenting difficulties in developing phyla-specific benchmark values and reference levels for radioprotection. Based on the limited data, mutation was found to be the most sensitive endpoint of radiation exposure, with mortality the least sensitive. Current phyla-specific dose levels and limits proposed by major regulatory bodies were found to be inadequate to protect species across a range of <b>endpoints</b> including morbidity, <b>mutation</b> and reproduction and examples are discussed within. These findings serve to prioritise areas for future research that will significantly advance understanding of radiation-induced effects in aquatic invertebrates and consequently enhance ability to predict the impacts of radioactive releases on the environment...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} glycophorin A (gpa) in vivo somatic cell {{mutation}} in a population of 394 healthy people from 8 to 77 years of age (mean age±SD 41 ± 15 years) revealed a subset of 37 individuals with stably elevated allele-loss and/or allele-loss with duplication variant erythrocyte frequencies (Vf) exceeding 30 × 10 − 6. These 37 individuals with gpa outlier Vf are significantly older (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) than {{the remainder of the}} larger study population from which they were drawn reflecting a highly significant increase in the prevalence of these individuals in the population beyond age 40 years. A study of hprt mutant frequencies (Mf) in the peripheral blood T-lymphocytes of 27 of these individuals, together with 15 matched control individuals with unremarkable gpa Vf, was undertaken to determine if these subjects also displayed elevated mutation frequencies at this independent locus indicative of globally elevated somatic mutation. The hprt Mf in these 27 subjects (geometric mean 11. 5 × 10 − 6 (dispersion interval 5. 8 × 10 − 6 to 22. 8 × 10 − 6)) was not significantly different from that observed in the 15 controls (geometric mean 12. 1 × 10 − 6 (dispersion interval 5. 7 × 10 − 6 to 25. 5 × 10 − 6)). These Mf are higher than typically reported values reflecting the older age distribution of these individuals (arithmetic mean age±SD 53 ± 12 and 50 ± 16 years for the subjects and controls, respectively). Taken together, these data suggest that several genetic mechanisms may be responsible for producing the gpa outlier Vf observed in these subjects. The observation that hprt Mf were not increased indicates that the majority did not arise by a genome-wide increased rate of somatic mutation detectable at both loci. The fixation and subsequent expansion of `jackpot 2 ̆ 7 mutations at the gpa locus occurring early in embryonic/fetal development also {{does not appear to be}} a predominant mechanism. Some cases may result from a stable over-representation of gpa variant cells, perhaps associated with a marked age-dependent decrease in the number of contributing erythroid stem cells in the bone marrow. The subset that displays elevated allele-loss with duplication Vf involving both gpa alleles may represent individuals with increased rates of somatic recombination. Elevations arising by this mechanism are not detected in the hprt assay, but could be confirmed using an autosomal locus in vivo somatic cell <b>mutation</b> <b>endpoint</b> such as the hla-a assay. Of primary biological significance, these results demonstrate that genetic/stochastic processes leading to the loss of heterozygosity of somatic cells occur ubiquitously in humans and in some individuals this level of somatic mosaicism can approach a frequency of 10 − 3 at the gpa locus in erythroid lineage cells...|$|R
40|$|Genotoxic {{agents are}} {{a major threat to}} the integritiy of {{chromosomes}} and viability of cells, specially if the damage is not repaired, because it can lead to chromosome instability, cell cycle arrest, cell dysfunction, induction of apoptosis or carcinogenesis. For genotoxicity, two main <b>endpoints</b> are gene <b>mutations</b> and chromosome aberrations; the latter can either be structural (clastogenic) or numerical (aneugenic). There are several in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests available. However, none of these tests are capable to detect both endpoints of genotoxicity simultaneously. The pUR 288 mouse model, carrying the lacZ transgene on a plasmid vector, used for this thesis, is in theory capable of detecting large deletions (> 500 base pairs) in addition to small deletions and point mutations. Since it was not previously demonstrated that the pUR 288 mouse model is indeed sensitive enough to detect clastogens, a second mouse model was used, the Rad 54 /Rad 54 B deficient mice. This model has a defect in the repair of chromosomal aberrations, caused by clastogens. Determination of the lacZ mutant frequency (lacZ MF) as well as hybridization studies showed that the Rad 54 /Rad 54 B deficient mice are only moderately more sensitive towards clastogens as compared to pUR 288 mice. It was concluded that, although still a promising test, both in vivo models were not sensitive enough to detect the effect of exposure to clastogens. In contrast to the in vivo studies, the in vitro studies using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from pUR 288 and Rad 54 /Rad 54 B mice, have shown a dose-dependent induction in the lacZ MF and the micronuclei frequency (for the MNT) after exposure to both mutagens as well as clastogens in both MEFs models. Moreover, MMC-treatment resulted in a higher lacZ MF in Rad 54 /Rad 54 B MEFs compared to pUR 288 MEFs. This genotype effect after MMC-exposure, also shown in microarray studies, was due to an impaired DNA damage response in MMC-treated Rad 54 /Rad 54 B MEFs. This will lead to a weaker DNA repair response and therefore a larger percentage of the cells will carry a lacZ mutation, hence a higher lacZ MF in the Rad 54 /Rad 54 B MEFs compared to pUR 288 MEFs. Since MMC induces predominantly DNA crosslinks, the obtained results suggests that the Rad 54 and/or Rad 54 B genes are involved in DNA crosslink damage recognition and repair. As a conclusion, the lacZ MF assay using pUR 288 MEFs is able to detect both mutagens as well as clastogens simultaneously. Using this in vitro test can be of great advantage, since this can lead to a {{reduction in the number of}} tests needed. The reduction in time and costs and the increase in the sensitivity make this in vitro lacZ assay a good alternative for existing tests for screening of genotoxic compounds. However, before this test can be used as a high-throughput screenings test, it needs to be validated with a wider range of genotoxic compounds, non-genotoxic compounds, non-carcinogens and most importantly also low potency genotoxic compounds. Then it can be assessed whether this assay is reproducible and whether the results obtained can replace existing genotoxicity assay...|$|R
