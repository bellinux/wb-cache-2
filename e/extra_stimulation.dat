30|$|In this work, {{energetic}} Al/Ni superlattice was fabricated by alternatively deposited Al and Ni {{layer on}} the surface of Al 2 O 3 ceramic substrates by magnetron sputtering, characterized by TEM. The electrical behaviors and plasma performances based on the energetic Al/Ni superlattice under <b>extra</b> electrical <b>stimulation</b> were investigated, which was integrated as a micro-plasma generator. The integrated micro generator exhibited remarkable electrical exploding phenomenon, leading to plasma generations at a small timescale. The plasma outputs reflected by flyer velocities were superior to that with a much thicker bilayer of 500 [*]nm Al/Ni multilayer. The Gurney energy model confirmed that the chemical reaction of the Al/Ni superlattice structure was involved in the plasma generation in comparison with Al/Ni RMFs. Overall, the micro plasma generator based on energetic Al/Ni superlattice exhibits superior performance with high-plasma outputs, thus improving electrical energy transduction and system reliability. Hence, there is much prospect of the application of energetic Al/Ni superlattice on micro- or nano-plasma initiators to implement special function.|$|R

Sixty male subjects, randomly selected from the population of truck drivers in a large mining company, operated a driving simulator for a period of 7 h. A 2 x 3 experimental design was employed including two levels of rest conditions and three levels of secondary-task manipulations. The results show that performance and perceived fatigue were significantly higher when a secondary task involving voice communication was added to the basic driving task, but an added vigilance task had less effect. An extra 30 -minute rest period in the middle of the experimental session significantly alleviated the reported experience of fatigue but did not affect performance. The results are discussed in terms of their relevance to actual in-dustrial driving tasks. Like many other behavioral phenomena, fatigue has been defined in numerous ways by different researchers. As McFarland (1968) wrote: "Definitions of the nature of fatigue are almost as numerous as the articles that have been written about it, since each de-pends largely upon the interests or technical background of the author. " One of the more comprehensive definitions of fatigue was of-fered by Wolf (1967), and Saito, Kogi, and Kashiwagi (1970), who, in their factor ana-lytic studies, reported that the sensation of fatigue has three major components: (1) the sensation of bodily tiredness and drowsiness, (2) the sensation of weakened motivation or concentration towards the task, and (3) a group of physical complaints pertaining t...|$|R

40|$|Early life {{environment}} and maternal care can have long-lasting effects on behavior and physiology. Previously, {{we found that}} compared to mother-reared (MR) female rats, rats reared without mothers, siblings, and nest, through artificially rearing (AR), show reduced levels of maternal behavior when they grow up. These effects can be reversed if AR pups are provided with <b>extra</b> “licking-like” tactile <b>stimulation</b> during the preweaning period [Gonzalez et al. [2001] Developmental Psychobiology, 38 (1), 11 – 42]. We also found that AR rats are more action impulsive and have reduced attentional capacities in comparison to their MR siblings [Lovic, Fletcher, & Fleming, in preparation; Lovic & Fleming [2004] Behavioural Brain Research 148 : 209 – 219]. However, it is unknown whether increased impulsivity contributes to reduced levels of maternal behaviors. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the relationship between impulsivity and maternal behavior in AR and MR rats. Female rats were reared with (MR) or without mothers (AR) and half of the AR rats received additional stroking stimulation. As adults, AR and MR rats were mated and maternal behavior towards their own pups was assessed. In addition, rats were assessed on impulsive action (differential reinforcement of low-rate schedule; DRL- 20 s). Consistent with previous findings, AR rats were both less maternal and more action impulsive than MR rats.

50|$|Vagus nerve {{stimulation}} (VNS) involves implanting a pacemaker-like generator below the {{skin in the}} chest area that intermittently sends electrical impulses to the left vagus nerve in the neck. The impulses are mediated to the brain by the vagus nerve and thereby help to inhibit electrical disturbances that cause seizures. The antiepileptic effect of vagus {{nerve stimulation}} increases over several months: after two years around half of VNS patients experience a reduction of their seizures by at least 50% and after 10 years the average seizure reduction is around 75% Furthermore, in most patients mood (VNS has a significant anti-depressent effect and is approved for depression in some countries), alertness and quality-of-life are increased significantly within {{the first year of}} vagus nerve stimulation.

After the drug infusion, the MAP duration (MAPd), repolarization time, and corrected QT interval were significantly prolonged during sinus rhythm, RV pacing, and RV <b>extra</b> <b>stimulation.</b> The prolongation of MAPd at 90 % repolarization during RV pacing at a cycle length of 500 ms was 31 +/- 6 ms (13 %) and 26 +/- 7 ms (11 %) at RVA and RVOT, respectively. The ventricular effective refractory period was significantly prolonged by 33 +/- 9 ms (13 %) and 22 +/- 7 ms (9 %) at driving cycle lengths 600 and 500 ms, respectively. The MAPd shortening with decreasing diastolic time intervals was significantly diminished by dofetilide in early extra beats during RV <b>extra</b> <b>stimulation,</b> suggesting a relatively more pronounced effect of this drug at the early diastolic phase. The dispersion of repolarization, defined as the difference in MAPd between RVA and RVOT, and the activation time were not significantly changed. In conclusion, acute administration of dofetilide in patients with ventricular tachycardia significantly prolonged the time intervals of ventricular repolarization and refractoriness in a parallel fashion, without affecting intraventricular conduction.

Females of {{two species of}} grey treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis and Hyla versicolor) were tested with combinations of a conspecific advertisement call and acoustic appendages.

40|$|This study {{compared}} B lymphocytes {{isolated from}} different tissues {{with regard to}} their proliferation, apoptosis and the effects of cortisol on these processes. B-lymphocytes, isolated from the head kidney and spleen, were characterised by higher proliferation and lower intracellular calcium (Ca 2 i) response to Ig-crosslinking compared with peripheral blood B-lymphocytes. Cortisol induced high levels of apoptosis (160 % of control levels) in peripheral blood B-lymphocytes, in combination with a stimulatory (LPS) signal. Head kidney {{and to a lesser extent}} spleen B-lymphocytes, although less sensitive than their equivalent in peripheral blood, underwent cortisol-induced apoptosis irrespective of <b>extra</b> <b>stimulation</b> up to 150 % of control levels. Also proliferation with and without LPS stimulation was suppressed by cortisol. In view of the relatively modest concentration of cortisol (compared to plasma values measured during stress conditions) that is effective in inducing a significant increase in apoptosis in all three populations of B-cells, it is suggested that cortisol may be important for immunoregulation in both stressed and non-stressed conditions. This implies possible severe impact of stress on lymphocyte development and activity. Different sensitivity of B-cells to the corticosteroid, with respect to developmental stage and activity, may prevent excessive and long lasting depletion of B-lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|In conclusion, {{the studies}} {{described}} in this dissertation demonstrate that bile salts and oxysterols differentially affect production of TG-rich lipoproteins via several pathways, involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory routes. In vitro, the inhibitory action of bile salts on VLDL secretion appeared to occur at a post-translational level, via inhibition of apoB protein secretion. The underlying mechanism(s) are still unclear. On the other hand, activation of LXR in rat hepatoma cells promoted VLDL-TG secretion, but did not affect apoB secretion. Oxysterols might induce VLDL-TG secretion by affecting lipidation steps in the assembly of TG-rich particles. In vivo under normal physiological conditions, widely varying transhepatic bile salt fluxes had small effects on VLDL secretion in mice. However, <b>extra</b> <b>stimulation</b> of the transcription factor LXR or absence of the transcription factor and bile salt receptor FXR, considered as key regulators of genes in cholesterol, bile salt and lipid homeostasis, clearly affected formation of TG-rich lipoproteins by liver and intestine. Disturbances in LXR and FXR-regulated signaling pathways may contribute to development of an atherogenic lipid profile and, in the long run, to cardiovascular diseases. Since many groups have recently focused their research on the regulatory role(s) of LXR and FXR in lipid metabolism, more information about their roles will become available {{in the near future}} and may contribute to a better knowledge of the complex interactions between bile salt and lipid metabolism. ...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{increased}} {{dispersion of repolarization}} in the genesis of torsade de pointes and ventricular fibrillation has been well recognized generally, {{but not in the}} genesis of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). Monophasic action potentials (MAP) were therefore recorded simultaneously from the right ventricular (RV) apex (RVA) and outflow tract (RVOT) during sinus rhythm, RV pacing and programmed <b>extra</b> <b>stimulation</b> (PES) in 24 patients with VT. The activation time (AT), MAP duration at 90 % repolarization (MAPd), and repolarization time (RT) were measured and their dispersions, defined as the differences in these parameters between RVA and RVOT, were calculated. During sinus rhythm and RV pacing, the dispersions of AT, MAPd and RT (dispersions) were significantly larger in the 17 patients with a VT induced than in those without. During PES, the dispersions were further augmented in the S 2 beats in the seven patients with a sustained VT induced, the maximal dispersion of RT being 85 +/- 22 ms. Both the dispersion of AT and that of MAPd contributed to the dispersion of RT. In both of our two patients with a sustained VT induced during MAP recording, a marked increase in dispersions of RT (140 and 190 ms, respectively) was observed immediately before the initiation of the VT. A link between the dispersions and the inducibility of a monomorphic VT was found in our patients, which suggests that the increased dispersions {{play an important role in}} the genesis of a monomorphic VT...|$|E
40|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} by endocannabinoids (eCBs) mediates {{a widely}} expressed form of long-term depression at excitatory and inhibitory synapses (eCB-LTD), involving {{a reduction in}} neurotransmitter release. In the hippocampus, eCB-LTD occurs at interneuron (IN) -pyramidal cell (PC) synapses (I-LTD), and its induction requires a presynaptic reduction of cAMP/PKA signaling resulting from minutes of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB 1 R) activation. Although repetitive activity of glutamatergic synapses initiates the eCB mobilization required for I-LTD, {{it is unclear whether}} CB 1 R-containing GABAergic terminals are passive targets of eCBs or whether they actively contribute to induction. Here, we show that the minutes-long induction period for I-LTD may serve as a window to integrate associated spontaneous activity in the same IN receiving the retrograde eCB signal. Indeed, reducing spontaneous IN firing blocked I-LTD, which could be rescued with <b>extra</b> <b>stimulation</b> of inhibitory afferents. Moreover, cell pair recordings showed that a single IN expressed LTD onto a PC only if it was active during eCB signaling. Several methods of disrupting presynaptic Ca 2 + dynamics all blocked I-LTD, strongly suggesting that IN spikes regulate I-LTD by raising Ca 2 + at the nerve terminal. Finally, inhibiting the Ca 2 +-activated phosphatase, calcineurin, fully blocked I-LTD, but blocking another phosphatase did not. Our findings support a model where both CB 1 R signaling and IN activity shift the balance of kinase and phosphatase activity in the presynaptic terminal to induce I-LTD...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} the arrhythmic risk {{as part of}} the natural history in asymptomatic patients with a manifest atrio-ventricular accessory pathway (i. e., Wolff-Parkinson-White electrocardiogram pattern) highlighting the ongoing controversy pertaining to the invasive electrophysiological management of these asymptomatic patients. The thesis argues against population screening or routine invasive testing with a view to catheter ablation based on the meta-analysis research presented which demonstrates the low mortality/morbidity rates in asymptomatic patients. The presented low mortality and morbidity along with the potential for harm by screening and subsequent testing, low sensitivity and specificity of risk stratifiers, practicality, cost-effectiveness and the potential for complications from electrophysiology study and ablation and even mortality that can mitigate benefit if undertaken routinely population wide is elaborated to justify current clinical practice and clinical guidelines. Additionally the thesis presents novel intra-cardiac electrophysiological measures for arrhythmic substrate assessment in patients with a suspected concealed septal atrio-ventricular accessory pathway. The widely utilized intra-cardiac pacing maneuver, the para-Hisian pacing maneuver is investigated demonstrating short stimulus-to-atrial intervals to reliably indicate inadvertent atrial capture to avoid technical and interpretative pitfalls. A critical change of stimulus-to- atrial interval using a small catheter adjustment to deliberately lose and obtain atrial capture reliably ensures that inadvertent atrial capture can be identified to avoid interpretative pitfalls. Additionally to overcome the limitation of requiring sustained supra-ventricular tachycardia for the utility of the widely used post entrainment measures, the first tachycardia cycle after supra-ventricular tachycardia induction with right ventricular <b>extra</b> <b>stimulation</b> is demonstrated to yield comparable information to entrainment, precluding the need for sustained supra-ventricular tachycardia, providing a unique maneuver and measures that both diagnose the supra-ventricular tachycardia substrate and mechanism when tachycardia is not sustained...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between pulmonary vein (PV) arrhythmogenicity and its anatomy has been reported. However, {{that of the}} superior vena cava (SVC) has not been well discussed. Arrhythmogenic response induced by pacing stimulation at SVC might help with identifying SVC arrhythmogenicity. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the {{relationship between}} the anatomical dilatation of SVC and the arrhythmogenic response induced by pacing at SVC. Methods: Forty-three patients who underwent atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation were enrolled in this study. After PV isolation, scan pacing (up to triple <b>extra</b> <b>stimulation</b> following intrinsic sinus beats) was performed at SVC. The arrhythmogenic response was defined as following: (1) repetitive atrial responses, (2) non-sustained, and (3) sustained AF/ atrial tachycardia. To assess the dilatation of SVC, we measured the cross-sectional area of the SVC (SVC-area) using multi-planar reconstruction CT imaging. Results: Arrhythmogenic responses were documented in 24 patients (Group 1). No arrhythmogenic responses were documented in the remaining 19 patients (Group 2). The SVC-area was significantly larger in Group 1 than Group 2 (3. 1 ± 0. 9 vs. 2. 2 ± 0. 8  cm 2, P= 0. 004). A multivariate analysis revealed only SVC-area was associated with arrhythmogenic responses (odds ratio= 2. 87, CI 1. 05 – 7. 82, P= 0. 04). Furthermore, AF recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with SVC-area> 2. 56  cm 2 than those with SVC-area < 2. 56  cm 2 (9 [42. 9 %] of 21 vs. 3 [13. 6 %] of 22, P= 0. 026). Conclusion: Dilatation of SVC was associated with an arrhythmogenic response, and the AF recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with large SVC-area.

40|$|Immunoglobulins and {{complement}} {{components are}} required for optimal ingestion and optimal killing of microorganisms by granulocytes. The degree of opsonization of microorganisms necessary for their ingestion was lower than that required for the killing of these bacteria during the ingestion phase. Killing during this phase was found to depend mainly {{on the presence of}} heat-labile opsonins, probably C 3 b, present on the microorganisms. Extracellular immunoglobulin G (IgG) and C 3 b were indispensable for optimal intracellular killing after ingestion was complete. This was established with an assay permitting assessment of the course of the number of viable intracellular bacteria independent of the ingestion of new live bacteria. Maximal intracellular killing by human granulocytes of ingested catalase-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) or catalase-negative (Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae) microorganisms was found only when fresh serum was present extracellularly. Killing was suboptimal in the absence of serum. With heat-inactivated serum, the killing index lay between the indices obtained in the presence and absence of fresh serum. The stimulatory activity of heat-inactivated serum was most probably due to the interaction of IgG with the Fc receptor on the granulocyte membrane, since IgG subclasses IgG 1 and IgG 3 as well as pFc fragments of IgG stimulated the intracellular killing to the same degree as heat-inactivated serum did. In addition, (Fab 1) 2 fragments of IgG did not stimulate killing, and reduced killing was observed in the presence of heat-inactivated serum after reduction of the number of Fc receptors. The <b>extra</b> <b>stimulation</b> of the killing process in the presence of fresh serum compared with heat-inactivated serum was due to the interaction between membrane receptors and complement [...] most probably C 3 b generated by both the classical and the alternative pathways of complement activation. This conclusion is based on results obtained with sera in which one or both complement pathways were blocked, on the restoration of the killing-stimulatory activity of C 3 -deficient serum after addition of fresh C 3, and on the reduced killing observed in the presence of fresh serum after reduction of the number of C 3 receptors by the use of pronase or antigranulocyte serum...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{activity}} (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) {{are reduced}} after stroke. To enhance participation in daily activities and structured exercise training, longitudinal {{evaluation of the}} level and influencing factors of PA and CRF after stroke is crucial. These insights help to identify barriers of PA and to better delineate aerobicexercise interventions and maintain long-term benefits. Studies carried out within this PhD-project included the prevalence and determinants of stroke caregivers# strain {{in the first six}} months after stroke (chapter 1), the criterion validity of heart rate monitoring versus RT 3 -accelerometry and examination of the accuracy of Yamax-pedometers instroke survivors (chapter 2), the quantity of PA one year after stroke and its influencing factors (chapter 3), the evolution of CRF during thefirst year post-stroke and the influence of pre-stroke patients# characteristics and stroke-related factors on this evolution(chapter 4),and the identification of determinants of CRF at 3, 6 and 12 months post-stroke (chapter 5). In chapter 1, the prevalence and determinants of strain experienced by 90 stroke patients# caregivers at 2, 4 and 6 months post-stroke were presented. Demographic characteristics, physical and emotional performance of patients, caregivers# characteristics and service input were documented to identify determinants of the caregivers# strain. Nearly one out of three caregivers was under strain and no differences were seen between 2, 4 and 6 months post-stroke. Our results also indicated that in predicting strain, the patients# level of function andactivity played an important role in the subacute phase while the participation level increased in importance over time. These findings emphasized the importance of maximal physical recovery and optimal integration in the community. Providing services in which patients can participate, such as social activities, leisure and sport related activities might help to reduce caregivers# strain and to prevent socialisolation of the patient. In the validation study (chapter 2) nine stroke patients performed a standardised activity protocol wearing a Cosmed K 4 b² to measure oxygen consumption and heart rate (HR), a RT 3 -accelerometer and two Yamax SW- 200 pedometers (hip- and knee-positioned). We concluded that the RT 3 -accelerometer showed poor validity for measuring PA in stroke patients. HR monitoring, however, can be used to make intra-individual comparisons through providing patients with information on exercise i ntensity. This study further revealed that the Yamax SW- 200 pedometer provided accurate results during slow walking if positioned on the knee,but not when hip-positioned. In conclusion, HR monitoring and knee-positioned Yamax-pedometers seemed to be useful instruments to assess PA in stroke survivors and could be seen as a motivational strategy to enhance PA. Chapter 3 addressed the question whether stroke patients are active enough 1 -year post-stroke to improve their physical health. Due to the unique attribute of absolute, relative, and self-reported measures, PA was quantified by a multifaceted approach in 16 mildly disabled stroke patients. Our results showed that on average, stroke patients spent 44 ± 39 minutes a day in activities of moderate intensity and performed 6428 steps per day which is within the normative data (5900 - 6900 steps/day). However, none performed moderate activity at least three days per week and only 19 % performed more than 10, 000 steps/day, required to improve/maintain their health. Functional mobility, CRF, mood and participation had an influence on daily steps, but not on the time spent in moderately intense activities. We could conclude that discrepancies between absolute (daily steps) and relative (minutes moderate active) measures of PA exist with respect to the quantity achieved and its potential determinants. In chapter 4 the evolution of CRF of 33 stroke patients in a 1 -year follow-up study were examined and the effect of pre-stroke patients# characteristics and stroke-related factors on this evolution were explored. Findings revealed that on average CRF was reduced from 3 to 12 months post-stroke (values were 65 % to 71 % of the age- and sex-matched normative values in healthy sedentary persons) and did not significantlychange over time. These results suggest that conventional stroke rehabilitation is insufficient to obtain a cardiorespiratory training effect. It seems worthwhile to initiate exercise-based interventions of sufficient intensity, frequency and duration in the rehabilitation centre and continuation in the community. Stroke survivors at risk of deconditioning were pre-morbid less active at work or in sport activities, diabetic or initially more severely impaired. Statistically combining these factors revealed that older patients with stroke and diabetes were less likely to improve their VO 2 peak and older, female, diabetic non-smokers improved less on log OUES. These results indicate that cardiovascular exercise training could be a therapeutic goal for these patients at risk and preferably be started as early as possible. Pre-morbid less active persons require <b>extra</b> <b>stimulation</b> to change theirsedentary lifestyle and guidance post-rehabilitation will be essential to retain long-term benefits. In chapter 5, CRF was predicted based on standardized measures along theseveral dimensions of the ICF model at 3, 6 and 12 months post-stroke in 40 patients with stroke. Knee muscle strength was found the main predictor of CRF and explained variance increased over time from 41 % to 72 %. Functional mobility and mood affected CRF at 12 months post-stroke. These results may suggest that cardiorespiratory endurance training should be supplemented with strength-developing exercises of the lower limbs, especially on the weaker paretic side. Ambulation at moderate intensity and good mental health may further positively influence CRF. status: publishe...|$|E
