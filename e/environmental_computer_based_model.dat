At present, there is a dearth of information concerning how these films effect the thermal comfort of occupants within buildings where these films have been applied. An illuminated hot box, utilising a xenon lamp to simulate sunlight, has been designed as a testing facility. The illuminated hot box has been used to obtain information on how much thermal radiation enters the internal space from a window fitted with a solar-control film. The data from the experimental apparatus was verified using a finite-difference model written on a personal computer, with the aim of the computer program being used to compare different films, and thereby avoiding expensive experiments. The experimental rig produced usable data for the tested films only when the lamp was orthogonal to the plane of the glass, with errors occurring, and increasing, as the angle of incidence between the lamp and the glass increased.
