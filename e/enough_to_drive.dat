Abum followed an everyman figure called Brock, watching his grindingly repetitive life. Brock visited {{a strip club}} often but without joy, which led Abum to believe he no longer took pleasure from sinning. One day, Abum added an additional irritation to Brock's life, posing as a traffic warden and giving him a ticket. This was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> Brock to suicide. However, during this time, Abum also encountered Black, who again saw his demonic nature.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland {{concluded}} that the Viet Cong still had the strength to continue the attacks on Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it may not be <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1840s, California fought for its {{independence}} from Mexico in the Mexican–American War. The Santa Ana river played {{an important part in}} the victory of the Americans over the Mexican army. In 1847, one year after the Bear Flag Revolt, a Mexican military force set out northwards to attack a smaller American force in the Los Angeles area. However, the Santa Ana River flooded, preventing the Mexicans from crossing the river to attack the Americans. When the river's flow finally subsided, the American forces had been reinforced <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> the Mexicans out of the region.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Île de France in December, Lhermitte steered for Port Louis but {{was intercepted}} by the British {{blockade}} squadron, comprising the 74-gun ship {{of the line}} HMS Tremendous and the 50-gun HMS Adamant. Unable to reach safety, Lhermitte evaded pursuit long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> Preneuse onto a beach {{at the mouth of}} the Tombeau. After a brief exchange of fire the wrecked frigate was surrendered and British boarding parties in ship's boats rowed inshore to Preneuse, removed the survivors and burnt the remains. Watching from the shore as the last of his command burned on the beach, Sercey subsequently retired from military service.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{may have}} weakened Mallory politically and certainly diverted him from other duties, {{but it was}} not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> him from office. Perhaps because {{there was no one to}} replace him and perhaps because he absorbed shafts that were aimed at the president, Davis retained him in the cabinet until the end of the war. After the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox, Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South, first to Danville, Virginia, then to Greensboro, North Carolina, Charlotte, Abbeville, South Carolina, and finally Washington, Georgia. There, Mallory submitted his resignation and went to La Grange, Georgia, where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children.|$|E

25|$|Wireless {{speakers}} {{are very}} similar to traditional (wired) loudspeakers, but they receive audio signals using radio frequency (RF) waves rather than over audio cables. There is normally an amplifier integrated in the speaker's cabinet because the RF waves alone are not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> the speaker. This integration of amplifier and loudspeaker is known as an active loudspeaker. Manufacturers of these loudspeakers design them to be as lightweight as possible while producing the maximum amount of audio output efficiency.|$|E

His second motor was powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> a boat with 14 people across a wide river.

The first night out was far from a success as the youngster, barely old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> on the street, Waltrip slammed the wall and heavily damaged the coupe.

25|$|The {{evolutionary}} strategy used by cicadas of {{the genus}} Magicicada make use of prime numbers. These insects {{spend most of their}} lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects.|$|E

25|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) generation in chloroplasts {{is similar to}} that in mitochondria and takes the required energy from the proton motive force (PMF). However, chloroplasts rely more on the chemical potential of the PMF to generate the potential energy required for ATP synthesis. The PMF is the sum of a proton chemical potential (given by the proton concentration gradient) and a transmembrane electrical potential (given by charge separation across the membrane). Compared to the inner membranes of mitochondria, which have a significantly higher membrane potential due to charge separation, thylakoid membranes lack a charge gradient. To compensate for this, the 10,000 fold proton concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane is much higher compared to a 10 fold gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The resulting chemiosmotic potential between the lumen and stroma is high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> ATP synthesis using the ATP synthase. As the protons travel back down the gradient through channels in ATP synthase, ADP + Pi are combined into ATP. In this manner, the light-dependent reactions are coupled to the synthesis of ATP via the proton gradient.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the aims}} of most driver {{screening}} practices, {{in addition to a}} variety of possible diagnostic and rehabilitation activities, usually is to exclude from the driver population those persons who are not “safe <b>enough</b> ” <b>to</b> <b>drive.</b> In order <b>to</b> realise this aim i. e., {{to decide whether or not}} somebody is “safe <b>enough</b> ” <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> a car, we must estimate his or her individual risk as driver and compare this risk level with a threshold value. When estimating a driver’s individual risk we must make certain assumptions, such as the following: (1) there is such a thing as individual driver risk; (2) it can be expressed as one parameter; (3) it can be measured or estimated; and (4) thresholds dividing the driver population into those safe and those unsafe can be identified. All these assumptions have some problems from both a theoretical and a methodological perspective. In the present paper, the theoretical and methodological basis of driver screening is critically discussed...|$|R
