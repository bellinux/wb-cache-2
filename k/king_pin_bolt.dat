40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{decisions}} made by the Marine Accidents Inquiry Agency during the period from 1950 to 1964, investigaion was carried out on the broken parts of engine and their causes. 1. In diesel engines, principal broken parts were propeller shaft, crank arm, crank <b>pin</b> <b>bolt</b> and main bearing. The crack or breakage of crank arm was caused mostly by the deviation of center line of main bearings. The breakage of crank <b>pin</b> <b>bolts</b> was due mostly to excessive or unbalanced tightening. 2. In hot balb engines, nearly one half of damaged engines were due to the breakage of crank arm. When start engine, neglect about exhaust remaining oil in cylinder caused the engine to rapid rotation, and so crank case, piston, cylinder or cylinder cover to damage. 1. 漁船機関損傷の部位とその原因を,デイーゼル機関. 焼玉機関別に海難審判庁の裁決より考察した. 2. 主軸受中心線偏移によるクランク アームのき裂又は折損が最も多く,殊に焼玉機関に於て著しく,早期の開放点検整備が強く要望される. 3. デイーゼル機関に於ては,更に主軸受の焼損及びクランク ピン. ボルトの折損が多く,之等は他の部分の損傷に直接影響のある所で,潤滑油系に対する充分な注意と,ボルト締め付けに際しての細心の留意が肝要である. 4. 焼玉機関の始動時の急回転による損傷が各部に見出され,特に始動失敗の折の慎重な処置が望まれる. 機関損傷の殆どが,極めて基本的な事項の不注意,不処置に起因し,取扱者の充分な点検整備の実行が遂行されるならば,著しく軽減される海難である...|$|R

50|$|Longboard {{specific}} {{trucks are}} {{a more recent}} development. A longboard truck has the <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> laid at a more obtuse angle (usually between 38 and 50 degrees) to the deck, giving {{a greater degree of}} turning for the same tilt of the deck.

5000|$|There {{were many}} forms of {{fastening}} in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as dowels and pins, wedging, mortises and tenons, dovetails, nailing (with or without clenching the nail ends), forge welding, and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of knots. Prior to the mid-19th century, cotter <b>pins</b> or <b>pin</b> <b>bolts,</b> and [...] "clinch bolts" [...] (now called rivets), were used in shipbuilding. Glues also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.|$|R
