5|$|As {{a result}} of the inspection, Sir Francis Flemming, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was tasked in February 1558 with {{improving}} the defences on the islands. Flemming was supported <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> with a shipment of lead to aid in construction, and money raised from the dissolution of the monasteries in England. The building work initially focused on the island of Tresco and was carried out under the direction of John Killigrew, the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth. Tresco was in need of modern defences, but Killigrew also wanted to use the work programme to increase his political influence on the island.|$|E
5|$|Farmers exploit {{flocking}} {{behavior to}} keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, {{and to move}} them more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort,</b> with a highly bred herding ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food. Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} {{leading up to}} 1848, {{a small number of}} women began to push against {{restrictions}} imposed upon them by society. A few men aided <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort.</b> In 1831, Reverend Charles Grandison Finney began allowing women to pray aloud in gatherings of men and women. The Second Great Awakening was challenging women's traditional roles in religion. Recalling the era in 1870, Paulina Wright Davis set Finney's decision as the beginning of the American women's reform movement.|$|E
5|$|On May 8, 1858, Brown held {{a meeting}} in Chatham, Ontario, where he {{unveiled}} his plan for a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia. When word of the plan was leaked to the government, Brown put the scheme on hold and began raising funds for its eventual resumption. Tubman aided him <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort,</b> and with more detailed plans for the assault.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{aggression}} {{may even}} extend to deities who, unlike Apep, are not regarded as evil. Evidence in early funerary texts suggests that at dawn, Ra {{was believed to}} swallow the multitude of other gods, who in this instance are equated with the stars, which vanish at sunrise and reappear at sunset. In doing so, he absorbs the gods' power, thereby renewing his own vitality, before spitting them out again at nightfall. The solar Eye is said to assist <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort,</b> slaughtering the gods for Ra to eat. The red light of dawn therefore signifies the blood produced by this slaughter.|$|E
50|$|In 1911 a Salvage Company was {{organized}} {{to salvage the}} reported treasure. <b>In</b> 1912 <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> {{is reported to have}} recovered silver coins, cannon, cannonballs, grapeshot and an anchor but no treasure.|$|R
50|$|Some advocates {{would like}} a public holiday {{declared}} for 12 February 2009. Robert Beeston was successful <b>in</b> championing <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> Des Moines, Iowa, in 2003; progress has also been made in England.|$|R

5|$|The St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame is a {{professional}} wrestling hall of fame. After several years of debating {{the idea of creating}} the Hall of Fame, former owner and promoter of the St. Louis Wrestling Club Larry Matysik opened it in 2007. He was joined <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> by promoter Herb Simmons, SBAC Member Tony Casta, sports journalist Keith Schildroth, and longtime fan Nick Ridenour. Although these directors oversee the selection process, the St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame is unique because it is the only wrestling hall of fame that allows fans to vote for potential inductees.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{repair and}} recovery plan was {{enacted by the}} Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with {{more than two-thirds of}} it not being funded by the final plan report on March4. Of the NZ$15million (US$10.6million) in home damage, NZ$7.2million (US$5.1million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5million (US$3.9million) grant to assist <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort.</b> Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes, with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ$6million (US$4.2million) for this project. Finalization of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June, with some residents still living in tents. Farmers were provided with NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies to jump-start agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{transfer}} to the Army, the Chinooks were used in similar roles to those they had undertaken in RAAF service. The first operational deployment of the Army Chinooks began in October 1997, when two of the helicopters and three Black Hawks which were in Papua New Guinea {{as part of a}} training exercise were tasked with delivering food supplies to the highlands of the country following a severe drought. The Chinooks were also used to transport fuel supplies for the other ADF aircraft and helicopters involved <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort.</b> At this time, the deployment of two Chinooks was the largest the Army could undertake as the other helicopters were undergoing maintenance or were needed for training purposes. The Chinooks returned to Australia in March 1998.|$|E

5|$|Gravel {{actively}} {{campaigned for}} the office of Vice President of the United States during the 1972 presidential election, announcing on June 2, 1972, over a month before the 1972 Democratic National Convention began, that he was interested in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates. Towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention. He was not alone <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort,</b> as former Governor of Massachusetts Endicott Peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year. Likely presidential nominee George McGovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vice-presidential candidates and letting the delegates choose.|$|E
5|$|The 27th Infantry Regiment lost 53 men killed, 221 wounded, and 49 missing, a {{total of}} 323 battle {{casualties}} during the battles along the Hwanggan road. However, {{it was able to}} delay the North Korean division for five days <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort.</b> The NK 2nd Division suffered heavily during this time to US artillery and armor, some estimates placing its losses above 3,000 men in the battles along the road. The US 1st Cavalry Division initially took the 27th Infantry's place on the line, but retreated without engaging the NK 2nd Division after movement by the NK 3rd Division threatened to take Kumch'on and block the US division's route of supply. The division was driven to the Naktong River by July 31, having taken 916 battle casualties at Hwanggan and Sangju in its first ten days on the line. Tactically, the North Koreans had been successful in pushing the US forces south and capturing the ground, but the American units had bought strategically valuable time to set up the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategies}} that sailfish and thresher sharks employ against shoaling fish {{are more effective}} when the shoal is first concentrated into a ‘bait ball’ (Helfman, Collette & Facey, 1997; Oliver et al., 2013; Domenici et al., 2014). Since this is difficult for individual predators to achieve, they cooperate <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort.</b> When herding a shoal of fish or squid, sailfish also raise their sails to make themselves appear larger. When they slash or wipe their bills through shoaling fish by turning their heads, their dorsal sail and fins are outstretched to stabilize their bodies hydrodynamically (Lauder & Drucker, 2004). Domenici et al. (2014) postulate that these fin extensions enhance the accuracy of tapping and slashing. The sail can reduce yaw rotation by counteracting the lateral force in the direction opposite to the slash. This means that prey {{is less likely to}} recognize the massive trunk as being part of an approaching predator (Marras et al., 2015; Webb & Weihs 2015). Film footage available online impressively demonstrates the hunting strategies of sailfish and thresher sharks.|$|E

50|$|He {{was more}} {{successful}} {{as an amateur}} boxer, winning the Australian heavyweight title <b>in</b> 1959. <b>This</b> <b>effort</b> saw him represent Australia at the 1960 Rome Olympics, in the heavyweight division. Taylor was eliminated after being KO'd in the Preliminaries by American Percy Price.|$|R
5|$|During the 640s, the Muslim {{conquest of}} Syria and Egypt {{created a new}} threat to Byzantium. Not only did the Arabs conquer {{significant}} recruiting and revenue-producing areas, but, after the utility of a strong navy was demonstrated by the short-lived Byzantine recapture of Alexandria in 644, they took to creating a navy of their own. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> the new Muslim elite, which came from the inland-oriented {{northern part of the}} Arabian peninsula, largely relied on the resources and manpower of the conquered Levant (especially the Copts of Egypt), which until a few years previously had provided ships and crews for the Byzantines. There is, however, evidence that in the new naval bases in Palestine shipwrights from Persia and Iraq were also employed. The lack of illustrations earlier than the 14th century means that nothing is known about the specifics of the early Muslim warships, although it is usually assumed that their naval efforts drew upon the existing Mediterranean maritime tradition. Given a largely shared nautical nomenclature, and the centuries-long interaction between the two cultures, Byzantine and Arab ships shared many similarities. This similarity also extended to tactics and general fleet organization; translations of Byzantine military manuals were available to the Arab admirals.|$|E

5000|$|By 1880 {{problems}} from his war wounds became {{bad enough that}} he sought relief by moving south in hope of a more beneficial climate. To assist <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>efforts,</b> Sheldon's friends found him a job {{as editor of the}} Sunday Baltimore Herald. While in Baltimore, Sheldon was recommended by William Pinkney Whyte for a judicial appointment. This recommendation was then endorsed by Ulysses S. Grant, Roscoe Conkling, and prominent members of the New York and Baltimore legal profession. In the recommendation, Sheldon's friends noted he had [...] "lately been addicted" [...] to the newspaper business and wished to leave it.|$|R
