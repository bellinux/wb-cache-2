5|$|Shiraasan, {{also known}} as Shi-chan, is a female homunculus, or {{artificial}} human, created by a joint effort of Hibiki and Shirotsuki. Despite looking like a very young girl, Shiraasan has the maturity of an adult who finds nothing wrong with reading newspapers or smoking cigarettes. Since homunculi were originally created as weapons in Hibiki's Magic, Shiraasan can procure guns and other weapons to use as she pleases, such as taking care of stray flies. Shiraasan has a very independent personality and does {{not like to be}} told what she can and cannot do. After it is confirmed that she is a stable lifeform, Shiraasan warms up to Hibiki and loves <b>her</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b>|$|E

500|$|I enjoyed {{working with}} <b>her</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> Mariah and I got along very great. We had never talked and never sang {{together}} before. We {{just had a}} chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind of thing. We just laughed and talked and laughed and talked and sang in between that ... It's {{good to know that}} two ladies of soul can still be friends. We talked about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl. She's a smart lady. I really like Mariah.|$|E

500|$|In 1936, Kalep {{published}} {{the first edition}} of Air Babies, a children's book that she wrote and illustrated to teach children about flying. The story followed two young planes, Happy Wings and Speedy, and a 1938 reprint included a foreword from Earhart, who embarked on her last flight three days after writing the piece; she disappeared while flying in 1937. Kalep later said of Earhart's disappearance: [...] "I miss <b>her</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> When I heard that Amelia had disappeared, well, I fell apart." [...] She visited the 1939 New York World's Fair to promote Air Babies on television and to speak at the National Woman's Party luncheon.|$|E
500|$|... "Porcelain" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Moby for his fifth studio album Play (1999) and recorded in his Little Italy, Manhattan apartment. He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman; speaking to Billboard, he explained: [...] "I {{was involved with}} this really, really wonderful woman, and I loved <b>her</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> But I knew deep in my heart of hearts that we had no business being romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being {{in love with someone}} but knowing you shouldn't be with them." [...] Moby initially disliked the track, criticizing his production as [...] "mushy" [...] and his vocals as [...] "really weak". He had dismissed [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "average" [...] and later recalled that he [...] "couldn't imagine anyone else wanting to listen to it" [...] – however, he was eventually talked into including it on Play.|$|E
500|$|The most {{outstanding}} ideological {{authority of the}} movement in Stuttgart, {{during the time of}} Rau's political involvement there, was however Clara Zetkin. She was {{a founding member of the}} Second International, about whom Friedrich Engels once had written, that he liked <b>her</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> while emperor Wilhelm II is said to have referred to her as the [...] "worst witch in Germany". She had been living in a Stuttgart suburb since 1891 and, since then, been gathering a circle of Württemberg Marxists around her, among them Rau's friend Hoernle, who had been editing with her the magazine Die Gleichheit. Her house, built in 1903 in Sillenbuch (now a part of Stuttgart), had become a meeting place of leading national and local left-wing and communist activists. It was also visited by international communist leaders like Vladimir Lenin, who stayed there overnight in 1907. In 1920, when Zetkin was elected to the Reichstag in Berlin, Hoernle and Rau moved to Berlin as well.|$|E

500|$|Patrick Duffy, {{who would}} play Pamela's {{on-screen}} love, knew the part was ideal for Principal {{the minute he}} set his eyes on her. He recalled {{that one of the}} finalists for Pamela [...] "was a remarkably talented young actress from New York... really good. , in walked Victoria Principal with the tightest jeans I've ever seen and the most unbelievable blouse. I just went, 'Hello, Pam'. I knew {{she was going to be}} Pam Ewing." [...] Producer Michael Filerman (Knots Landing and Falcon Crest) offered insight, [...] "Principal really wanted that role...and worked very hard to get it. And there's a humanity about her that's just winning. And the camera likes <b>her</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> The camera just loves her. That's real important." [...] During the pilot filming, Principal became very close with teenaged actress Charlene Tilton, who played Lucy Ewing. Principal explained that [...] "the location shooting was hard on Tilton, who was only seventeen and had never been away from home".|$|E
2500|$|Vasily Rozanov met Suslova {{when he was}} a schoolboy, and she {{was already}} over thirty years old. He fell in love at first sight. Rozanov had known her as the former {{mistress}} of Fyodor Dostoyevsky. It was enough to spark his interest, because Dostoyevsky was the writer whom Rozanov admired most. Rozanov made only a brief entry in his diary: [...] "Meeting Apollinaria Prokofyevna Suslova. My love for her. Suslova loves me, and I love <b>her</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> She is the most wonderful woman I've ever met." [...] They had an affair for three years, and married in November 1880. She was 40 at that time, and he was 24.|$|E
2500|$|Bourchier and Vanbrugh {{continued}} to play in Shakespeare and other pieces through World War I, but their marriage was becoming difficult. [...] A contemporary later observed, [...] "He treated <b>her</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> as Henry VIII treated Anne Boleyn [...] except he didn't quite cut off her head." [...] They toured together in 1916 but then separated and finally divorced in 1918. [...] Bourchier remarried a much younger actress, Violet Marion Kyrle Bellew in 1918. [...] Bourchier managed the Strand Theatre from 1919 to 1923. [...] There, in 1922, he appeared as Long John Silver in J. B. Fagan's adaptation of Treasure Island. [...] He toured with the play in 1923, and brought {{it back to the}} Strand the following year. In 1921 he appeared in the Hugh Ford film The Great Day.|$|E

2500|$|Welch {{did with}} Fox her first {{starring}} vehicle, the British Modesty Blaise-style spy movie Fathom (1967), filmed in Spain. Second unit director Peter Medak said Welch [...] "was {{at that time}} quite inexperienced, exactly {{like one of those}} American drum majorettes. But she tried very hard and went to see the rushes each day, gradually improving. 'Who's this dumb broad?' people used to say. But I said: 'You wait. I'll bet she makes it.' I liked <b>her</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> because she was such a genuine person. And she had a beautiful body which always helps." [...] Welch said her role was [...] "a blown up Barbie doll." [...] Reviewing her performance, the Los Angeles Times film critic said that [...] "each new Raquel Welch picture brings further proof that when Maria Montez died they didn't break the mold. Like Maria, Raquel can't act from here to there, but both ladies seem to have been born to be photographed... this sappiest of spy pictures." ...|$|E
2500|$|Merman {{initially}} was overlooked {{for the film}} version of Anything Goes (1936). Bing Crosby insisted his wife Dixie Lee be cast as Reno Sweeney opposite his Billy Crocker, but when she unexpectedly dropped out of the project, Merman was cast in the role she had originated on stage. From the beginning, it was clear to Merman the film would not be the enjoyable experience she had hoped it would be. The focus was shifted to Crosby, leaving <b>her</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in a supporting role. Many of Porter's ribald lyrics were altered to conform to the guidelines of the Motion Picture Production Code, and [...] "Blow Gabriel Blow" [...] was eliminated completely, replaced by a song, [...] "Shang Hai-de-Ho", that Merman was forced to perform in a headdress made of peacock feathers while surrounded by dancers dressed as Chinese slave girls. The film was completed $201,000 over budget and 17 days behind schedule. Richard Watts, Jr., of the New York Herald Tribune described it as [...] "dull and commonplace", with Merman doing [...] "as well as possible", but unable to register [...] "on screen as magnificently as she does on stage." ...|$|E

When he and Kai Qi reconcile their friendship, he hopes their relationship will move beyond being just friends, but she comes clean that she has feelings for Ah Jie and only want to be friends, which he abides by.

When he finally confesses his feelings to Kai Qi she rejects him. Finally getting an answer from Kai Qi he gives up his job as a food critic and pursues his real interest in astronomy.|$|E
