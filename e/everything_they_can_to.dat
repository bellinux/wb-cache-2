40|$|People, when {{processing}} human-to-human communication, utilize <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{in order}} <b>to</b> understand that communication, including speech and {{information such as}} the time and location of an interlocutor’s gesture and gaze. Speech and gesture are known to exhibit a synchronous relationship in human communication; however, the precise nature of that relationship requires further investigation. The construction of computer models of multimodal human communication would be enabled by the availability of multimodal communication corpora annotated with synchronized gesture and speech features. To investigate the temporal relationships of these knowledge sources, we have collected and are annotating several multimodal corpora with time-aligned features. Forced alignment between a speech file and its transcription is {{a crucial part of}} multimodal corpus production. This paper investigates a number of factors that may contribute to highly accurate forced alignments to support the rapid production of these multimodal corpora including the acoustic model, the match between the speech used for training the system and that to be force aligned, the amount of data used to train the ASR system, the availability of speaker adaptation, and the duration of alignment segments. 1...|$|R

40|$|Lean {{manufacturing}} {{is well-known}} {{as an effective}} means toward cost savings, but to convince management to support a culture shift to implement a lean manufacturing program there must be confidence in understanding what real effective and measurable lean savings are. This case study analyzes data from one specific lean event and points out areas of deficiency and shows how misreporting cost savings can hurt the lean program and the creditability of the lean practitioners. Often, lean practitioners are so anxious to show what benefit their lean projects have attained, <b>they</b> cite <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> think of <b>to</b> justify their lean project, some {{of which can be}} questionable cost savings and can negatively impact the long term credibility of the lean program. This case study from Boeing’s Ground-Based Missile Defense (GMD) program will evaluate and confirm what constitutes real cost savings {{as a result of a}} continuous improvement project to reduce the cycle time of interceptor integration. This evaluation includes professional perceptions of lean cost savings as part of the conclusion of what constitutes real cost savings in a lean program. This case study evaluates one particular event of many events done by companies every day. Another area of research could focus on instances of lean programs not capturing and reporting all the effective cost savings from a lean project which can have some of the same negative effects as reporting more costs saving than are truly being realized as this study addresses...|$|R

"Thesis advisor: Dr. Anthony Lupo. After the devastating tornadoes in Joplin, MO and in the Deep South in 2011, it seemed appropriate {{to look at the}} impact that broadcast meteorologists (and their TV coverage) have on their viewers during severe weather events. Broadcast meteorologists {{play a vital role in}} the severe weather warning process and in persuading the public to take the appropriate actions during severe weather. This research was done by developing a survey that addressed the following questions: 1) Is the media doing <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> persuade viewers <b>to</b> take shelter and protect themselves and their property?; 2) What do you do when a tornado warning is issued?; 3) Is there anything broadcast meteorologists can do or say that will make you take immediate action during severe weather? The survey was disseminated through television markets in Missouri. The goal of this research was to find new, improved and different ways of "connecting" with viewing during severe weather coverage. After looking at the results, we want to see if there are specific words, images or anything else a broadcaster can do that will trigger a response by viewers to take cover. It is my hope the results and analyses from this survey will provide broadcast meteorologists with new and improved techniques to connect with the public and to assist them in making an informed decision during severe weather events.

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 532 p. Recognizing that unsafe environments impact learning, school administrators have been forced to address an increasing number of safety concerns within the high school setting. These concerns include school shootings and other violent crimes, increasing signs of student alienation and disconnect from school, high incidents of harassment and bullying behaviors, lack of student support systems, and weakening adult/student relationships at home and at school. This study addressed these concerns with an investigation into the working, safe-school climate strategies, supportive variables, trends, and important recommendations that were embedded in the literature's documented conversations and research findings regarding safe schools and high school climates. The methods employed in this literature review investigation combined both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Spanning the years around the Columbine shooting, 1995 through 2003, 204 literature sources were explored. The safe-school climate sources included textbooks; books and reports from states, the United States government, and other countries; state and national educational membership association books and journals; newspapers; and additional books and journals from book stores and university libraries. Four climate dimensions, ecology, milieu, organization, and culture, served as a literature framework. A detailed coding system, including letters and symbols, was developed to identify and categorize 39 safe-school climate variables and 11 federal recommendations. A massive literature cross-reference matrix was assimilated to show the changes in variable focus over time. The literature review findings, regarding the 39 variables and 11 federal recommendations for safe schools, provided valuable strategies for administrators to utilize. However, 26 of the 39 variables and 6 of the 11 federal recommendations became a definite nonfocus in the literature over time. Administrators often turned to the literature sources to address current and future challenges. Therefore, it was imperative that useful information and recommendations be uncovered in the literature. High school administrators must do <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> possibly <b>can</b> <b>to</b> promote a safe-school environment. This study was significant because it revealed the literature's multiple safe-school climate variables, strategies, and recommendations for administrators to utilize as they searched for new ways to make their schools safer for all students...|$|R
