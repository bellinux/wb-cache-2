5|$|Al-Maʿarri was an ascetic, renouncing worldly {{desires and}} living secluded from others while {{producing}} his works. He opposed {{all forms of}} violence. In Baghdad, while being well received, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> sell his texts, which {{made it difficult for}} him to live. This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in India during his time.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's staff drew up {{detailed}} {{plans for}} a candidacy in the 1984 presidential election that he considered, but with his family opposed and his realization that the Senate was a fully satisfying career, in late 1982 <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> run. Kennedy campaigned hard for Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale and defended vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro from criticism over being a pro-choice Catholic, but Reagan was re-elected in a landslide.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} with Shaw {{led to the}} birth of a daughter in December 1991, although she and Icke had stopped seeing each other by then. Icke wrote in 1993 that <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> visit his daughter and had seen her only once, at the request of Shaw. Icke's wife gave birth to the couple's second son in November 1992.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam {{expressed}} his willingness to consider a second term in office provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election. However, two days later, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes. He did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a renewed mandate.|$|E
5|$|Hogg's mother Prudentia died in 1839. As a {{condition}} of his father's will, upon {{the death of his}} mother, Thomas Jefferson Hogg could purchase his brother's share of Norton House. <b>He</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to,</b> because of the potential cost of maintaining the house and the hostility Jane could face there. Instead, he allowed his brother to buy his interest in the house, a decision that led to conflict between the two brothers regarding the price and timing of the sale. They eventually worked out the details, and their relationship became friendlier once the sale was completed.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{military}} was widely {{dissatisfied with the}} ceasefire; Kościuszko, Prince Poniatowski and many others would criticize the King's decision and many, including Kościuszko, would resign their commission in the coming weeks. Prince Poniatowski even considered rebelling against his uncle's orders, and even issued orders to bring the King to the army's camp by force if necessary, as was postulated by the more radical faction. Ultimately <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> continue fighting against his uncle's will, and the order was rescinded {{at the last moment}} before the departure of the group charged with capturing the King.|$|E

50|$|On 27 April 2006, BBC News {{published}} allegations by Peter Law's widow that Law {{had believed}} {{he would be}} in line for a peerage should <b>he</b> <b>decide</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> stand in the 2005 general election. The Labour Party denied that a peerage was offered.|$|R
5|$|Adams' popularity, however, was declining, and <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> run {{for reelection}} in 1797. A number of popular figures were raised as nominees, {{and in that}} year's election, Sumner won the vote with 15,000 {{out of a total}} of 25,000 votes cast against a divided opposition. On June 2 Sumner rode from his home in Roxbury {{accompanied}} by 300 citizens on horseback to the State House in Boston, where the Secretary of the Commonwealth proclaimed his governorship from the eastern balcony. Sumner was the last governor to preside in what is now called the Old State House as the seat of government was moved to the New State House the following year.|$|E
5|$|As Thompson began porting {{the game}} to the new system, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> base the code {{on any of the}} {{existing}} software for the computer, and instead write his own. As a result, he implemented his own base code libraries for programs to use, including arithmetic packages and graphics subsystems. These initial subsystems were coded in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled, then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP-7. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid this laborious process. The game ran very slowly on the new machine, causing Thompson to branch out from there to design his own file system based on some ideas by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system, with which he then ran Space Travel.|$|E
5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, {{but he was always}} unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do it because he had just played a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} 1950s, Constantine {{supported}} the campaign, led by James, to appoint West Indies cricket's first black captain; {{the success of}} black people like Constantine in attaining government positions while not permitted to captain the cricket team was {{a key factor in}} an ultimately successful campaign. While in government, Constantine assisted {{in the development of the}} West Indies Federation, as a step towards the independence of the islands, and his fame and familiarity with Britain played some part in the negotiations which led to Trinidad's independence in 1962. After <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> stand for re-election in 1961, Williams appointed him as Trinidad and Tobago's first High Commissioner in London.|$|E
5|$|Other {{actors to}} appear in Degrassi: The Next Generation include Jayne Eastwood as Sean Cameron's mother, Billy Ray Cyrus as Duke, a {{limousine}} driver who gets arrested, the result of which leaves Jimmy, Hazel, Paige, and Spinner stranded in the street. Season seven featured appearances from Shirley Douglas as a university professor, Free The Children founder Craig Kielburger, and English pop singer Natasha Bedingfield as themselves. Jonathan Torrens guest starred as Emma's father, Shane, in the two-part season three premiere. The character had been played by Bill Parrott in the original series, but <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> return the former role. In season 10, ballroom dancer Jean-Marc Généreux appears as a teacher, in the episodes Adam's transgender secret is revealed. After moving to MuchMusic cameos became more frequent, including Keke Palmer, Ben Mulroney, Chaz Bono, Hedley, and Fefe Dobson.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, the Enola Gays weaponeer, was {{concerned}} about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb's circuits.|$|E

5|$|When his {{re-election}} in 1975 seemed unsure, Kreisky proposed that his Social Democratic Party should form a coalition with the Freedom Party, headed by Friedrich Peter. Wiesenthal was {{in possession of}} information proving that Peter {{had been a member}} of the 1 SS Infantry Brigade, a unit that had exterminated over 13,000 Jewish civilians in Ukraine in 1941–42. <b>He</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> reveal this information to the press until after the election, but forwarded his dossier to President Rudolf Kirchschläger. Peter denied having participated in, or having knowledge of, any atrocities. In the end, Kreisky's party won a clear majority and did not form the coalition.|$|E
5|$|Beecham {{appointed}} Victor Olof as his orchestral manager, {{and they}} started recruiting. At {{the top of their}} list were leading musicians with whom Beecham had worked before the war. Four had been founder members of the LPO fifteen years previously: Reginald Kell (clarinet), Gerald Jackson (flute), James Bradshaw (timpani) and Jack Silvester (double-bass). From the current LPO they engaged the oboist Peter Newbury. Beecham persuaded the veteran bassoonist Archie Camden, who had been pursuing a solo career, to return to orchestral work. The cellos were led by Raymond Clark, enlisted from the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The principal horn player was Dennis Brain, who already held the same post in Legge's Philharmonia, but managed to play for both orchestras. Jenkins speculates that as Beecham knew all Britain's orchestral leaders at first hand <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> try to lure any of them away. His choice was John Pennington, who had been first violin of the London String Quartet from 1927 to 1934, and had then had a career in the US as concertmaster, successively, of the San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic and Paramount Pictures orchestras.|$|E
5|$|Emile Durkheim {{was born}} in Épinal in Lorraine, the son of Mélanie (Isidor) and Moïse Durkheim. He came {{from a long line}} of devout French Jews; his father, grandfather, and {{great-grandfather}} had been rabbis. He began his education in a rabbinical school, but at an early age, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> follow in his family's footsteps and switched schools. Durkheim led a completely secular life. Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community. Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. Marcel Mauss, a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew. One of his nieces was Claudette (née Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of Maurice Bloch, who became a noted anthropologist.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Julia Wise (Alexis Bledel), new to County General, treats a {{homosexual}} HIV-positive patient who has severe breathing difficulties. It is discovered he has terminal cancer.

5|$|Murray {{considered}} it very unlikely that an attack would occur anywhere {{other than in}} the northern sector and therefore was prepared to reduce the troops in Nos 1 and 2 Sectors to a minimum. <b>He</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> reinforce his four infantry brigades, but to increase the available fire-power at Romani by moving up the 160th and 161st Machine Gun Companies of the 53rd (Welsh) and the 54th (East Anglian) Divisions. He also ordered the concentration of a small mobile column {{made up of the}} 11th Light Horse, the City of London Yeomanry (less one squadron each) with the 4th, 6th and 9th Companies of the Imperial Camel Brigade in No. 2 Sector. He calculated that the whole of the defensive force, including the camel transport necessary to enable infantry in the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division to advance into the desert, would be fully equipped and the camels assembled by 3 August. Approximately 10,000 Egyptian Camel Transport Corps camels concentrated at Romani prior to the battle. British monitors in the Mediterranean Sea off Mahamdiyah got into position to shell the assembling Ottoman force, while an armoured train at Kantara was ready to assist the defence of the right flank, and all available aircraft were on standby at Ismailia, Kantara, Port Said and Romani.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before dawn}} on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla {{surprised}} the German ships in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged {{the other three}} while suffering only minor damage themselves. As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the 4th Flotilla which had been alerted when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired {{by one of the}} destroyers in Narvik. Commander Bey's other two ships were very low on fuel and all three were running low on ammunition, so <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> continue the pursuit of the British ships since they were being engaged by the last two destroyers of Group 1.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June 1513, Henry invaded France, and {{his troops}} {{defeated}} a French army at the Battle of the Spurs – {{a relatively minor}} result, but one which was seized on by the English for propaganda purposes. Soon after, the English took Thérouanne and handed it over to Maximillian; Tournai, a more significant settlement, followed. Henry had led the army personally, complete with large entourage. His absence from the country, however, had prompted his brother-in-law, James IV of Scotland, to invade England {{at the behest of}} Louis. Nevertheless, the English army, overseen by Queen Catherine, decisively defeated the Scots at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513. Among the dead was the Scottish king, thus ending Scotland's brief involvement in the war. These campaigns had given Henry a taste of the military success he so desired. However, despite initial indications, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> pursue a 1514 campaign. He had been supporting Ferdinand and Maximilian financially during the campaign but had received little in return; England's coffers were now empty. With the replacement of Julius by Pope Leo X, who was inclined to negotiate for peace with France, Henry signed his own treaty with Louis: his sister Mary would become Louis' wife, having previously been pledged to the younger Charles, and peace was secured for eight years, a remarkably long time.|$|E
