50|$|Formaldehyde may {{be present}} in hair {{smoothing}} solutions or as a vapor in the air. Stylists and clients may inhale formaldehyde as a gas or a vapor into the lungs and respiratory tract. Formaldehyde vapor can also make contact with mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or throat. Formaldehyde solutions may be absorbed through the skin during the application process of liquid <b>hair</b> <b>straighteners.</b> Solutions of formaldehyde can release formaldehyde gas at room temperature and heating such solutions can speed up this process.

5000|$|The conk (derived from congolene, a <b>hair</b> <b>straightener</b> gel {{made from}} lye) was a hairstyle popular among African-American {{men from the}} 1920s to the 1960s. This hairstyle called {{for a man with}} {{naturally}} [...] "kinky" [...] hair to have it chemically straightened using a relaxer (sometimes the pure corrosive chemical lye), so that the newly straightened hair could be styled in specific ways. Often, the relaxer was made at home, by mixing lye, eggs, and potatoes, the applier having to wear gloves and the receiver's head having to be rinsed thoroughly after application to avoid chemical burns. Conks were often styled as large pompadours although other men chose to simply slick their straightened hair back, allowing it to lie flat on their heads. Regardless of the styling, conks required a considerable amount of effort to maintain: a man often had to wear a do-rag of some sort at home, to absorb sweat or other agents from causing his hair to revert to its natural state prematurely. Also, the style required repeated application of relaxers; as new hair grew in, it too had to be chemically straightened.|$|E
50|$|Roxy {{turns to}} drink and has sex with Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo), later admitting that she likes him. She asks Dean to keep their {{relationship}} secret, due to him being hated by the community for raping Linda Carter (Kellie Bright). Ronnie discovers their relationship and tries {{to stop them from}} seeing each other. However, they carry on seeing each other. Whilst Dean is hiding from Ronnie, he finds the hidden camera Ronnie is using to spy on Roxy and Charlie. When Ronnie threatens him, Dean tells Roxy about this, and, when Roxy confronts Ronnie, they argue, then Roxy moves in with Dean. When Ronnie and Charlie's marriage begins to fall apart after Ronnie has sex with Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), Roxy tries to convince Ronnie to repair the marriage for Matthew's sake. However, when Amy is due to go to France to visit Jack, Charlie asks Roxy if they can join her. After Roxy drops Amy off at the airport the next day, she learns that Charlie wants to take Matthew with them. Although initially hesitant, she says she wants to come with him. However, when she learns that Ronnie has been prescribed anxiety medication, she tells Ronnie the plan and they conspire against Charlie together. Roxy is stunned when Dean, jealous of Charlie, burns her with a <b>hair</b> <b>straightener.</b> Dean becomes insecure that Roxy is spending time working with Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra), so employs her as manager of his salon. When she says he needs to take himself less seriously, Dean cuts a chunk out of her hair in anger, but immediately apologises and proceeds to give her a proper haircut. As a result of this, Ronnie worries about Dean trying to control Roxy. Roxy and Ronnie have a furious row over Charlie and Dean, which turns violent. Roxy then reports Ronnie's murder of Carl to the police. This results in Roxy fighting with Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) as the Mitchells despair of Roxy not seeing Dean as a rapist. When Jack returns, he finds out from Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) that Dean raped Linda, so he packs Amy's belongings and removes her from Roxy's care, pointing out that Roxy's feisty personality has gone since she started dating Dean. As Roxy ends her engagement to Dean, who has assaulted her again, he attempts to rape her but Shirley interrupts. A tearful Roxy is found by Linda and her mother Elaine Peacock (Maria Friedman), who support her. Linda encourages her to tell the police, which Roxy does. Shirley then attempts to drown Dean who finally admits he raped Linda before running away from the police. Roxy is examined in the hospital with bruises and scars left by Dean on her body, and gives her statement. Roxy visits Glenda and decides to leave the country, but Glenda enlists Ronnie to try to stop her. They are unsuccessful after Roxy tells Ronnie she has controlled her all her life and she needs to be alone. Roxy leaves Amy with Jack, who also departs Walford shortly after, in January 2016. One month later, Roxy does not return for Dean's court case, where he pleads not guilty and is remanded in custody until a retrial in June, so Ronnie calls her to inform her of this.|$|E

However the assumption of chemical and toxicological equivalence between formaldehyde (a reactive gas) and methylene glycol (a stable reaction product that forms in an aqueous solution forming the main portion of formalin preparations) is disputed as a conservative assumption (mostly due to the methods of testing that are unable to differentiate the forms) instead of based on empirical toxicological data. According to Golden and Valentini the use of hair products containing less than 3% methelene glycol under controlled conditions should be considered safe from formaldehyde dangers.|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that toxic {{chemicals}} in hair products may be absorbed through the scalp in sufficient amounts to increase the risks of adverse health effects in women or their infants. This case-control study of 525 Black women from three counties in North Carolina who had delivered a singleton, liveborn infant examined whether exposure to chemicals used in hair straightening and curling increased the odds that the infant was preterm or low birth weight. Cases consisted of 188 preterm and 156 low birth weight births (for 123 women, their infant was both low birth weight and preterm). Controls were 304 women who delivered term and normal birth weight infants. Women who used a chemical <b>hair</b> <b>straightener</b> {{at any time during}} pregnancy or within 3 months prior to conception had an adjusted odds ratios (OR) of 0. 7 (95 % confidence interval (Cl) 0. 4 - 1. 1) for preterm birth and 0. 6 (95 % Cl 0. 4 - 1. 1) for low birth weight. Exposure to chemical curl products was also not associated with preterm delivery (adjusted OR = 0. 9, 95 % Cl 0. 5 - 1. 8) or low birth weight (adjusted OR = 1. 0, 95 % Cl 0. 5 - 1. 9).

40|$|O alisamento químico é o método mais empregado para melhorar a penteabilidade e a estilização de cabelos afro-étnicos. O cabelo é composto basicamente de três partes: cutícula, córtex e medula. O {{principal}} constituinte é uma proteína, a queratina. O tratamento com agente alcalino, redutor e/ou oxidante, provoca modificações nessa estrutura, ocasionando danos que podem ocorrer na camada superficial (cutícula) ou em toda a fibra, atingindo inclusive o córtex e modificando as propriedades físico-químicas do cabelo, pois o torna mais quebradiço, frágil, sem brilho, áspero e com mais dificuldade para ser penteado e desembaraçado. O emprego de agentes condicionadores auxilia na melhora dos atributos físicos e sensoriais do cabelo tornando-o mais resistente e facilitando o manuseio. Neste estudo foi preparado um creme-base alisante com tioglicolato de amônio acrescido de agentes condicionadores pré-escolhidos e adicionados no momento do uso. A formulação-base foi submetida ao estudo de estabilidade física por dois meses. Foram realizados testes de: quantificação da perda de proteína equivalente em albumina, empregando-se o método de Lowry modificado por Peterson; penteabilidade e tração de ruptura. Os resultados indicaram que a adição de óleo de jojoba e de silicones, como Lauril PEG/PPG 18 / 18 meticona e Ciclopentasiloxano (e) PEG- 12 polímero de dimeticone reticulado, melhoram os atributos físico-químicos e sensoriais das mechas de cabelo afro-étnico, sendo indicado como agentes condicionadores que poderão ser acrescidos à formulação do creme-base alisante. Chemical hair relaxing is {{the most}} common used method to improve combability and styling on afro-ethnic hair. The hair is basically composed of three parts: cuticle, cortex and medulla. The main basic element is a protein, the keratin. The treatment with an alkaline reducing agent and/or an oxidant agent causes modifications in this structure, and related damages that can occur in the superficial layer (cuticle) through ali the fiber, reaching the cortex and modifying the physical-chemical properties of the hair. In that case, the hair becomes more fragile, it has no shine, gets rough and it is very difficulty to comb and to detangle it. Conditioning agents can improve the physical and sensorial attributes of the hair, thus allowing it to become more resistant and making it easier to take care of. In this study a <b>hair</b> <b>straightener</b> cream-base with ammonium thioglycolate was prepared and the selected conditioning agents added at the moment of the use. The straightener cream-base was submitted to the physical stability study for two months. The tests had been carried through: quantification of protein loss of albumine equivalent, using the Lowry method modified by Peterson; the combability and rupture traction.

40|$|Guanidine hydroxide, or {{guanidine}} monohydrate, is {{a strong}} organic base (12). See Figure 1 in the Appendix for the chemical structure of guanidine hydroxide (13). This chemical is the active ingredient in “no-lye ” hair relaxers, or <b>hair</b> <b>straighteners.</b> See Table 1 for some popular hair relaxers brands, which are available for both consumer (at-home) and professional use. Guanidine hydroxide results in an emulsion, or colloidal suspension of liquids, from the reaction of two ingredients common to all “no-lye ” hair relaxing products: an alkaline earth metal hydroxide and guanidine carbonate. The alkaline earth metal hydroxide is most commonly {{in the form of}} a wax and/or mineral oil and petroleum-based emulsion. By contrast, the “activator, ” guanidine carbonate, is typically in aqueous solution.

5000|$|During the 1920s, {{numerous}} African Americans {{participated in}} skin bleaching {{in an attempt}} to lighten their complexion as well as hair straightening to appear whiter. Skin bleaches and <b>hair</b> <b>straighteners</b> created fortunes worth millions and accounted for a massive thirty to fifty percent of all advertisements in the black press of the decade. [...] Oftentimes, these bleaches and straighteners were created and marketed by African American women themselves. Skin bleaches contained caustic chemicals such as hydroquinone, which suppressed the production of melanin in the skin. These bleaches could cause severe dermatitis and even death in high dosages. Many times these regimens were used daily, increasing an individual’s risk. In the 1970s, at least 5 companies started producing make-up for African American women. Before the 1970s, makeup shades for Black women were limited. Face makeup and lipstick did not work for dark skin types because they were created for pale skin tones. These cosmetics that were created for pale skin tones only made dark skin appear grey. Eventually, makeup companies created makeup that worked for richer skin tones, such as foundations and powders that provided a natural match. Popular companies like Astarté, Afram, Libra, Flori Roberts and Fashion Fair priced the cosmetics reasonably {{due to the fact that}} they wanted to reach out to the masses.|$|R

By 1886 they had moved to Montgomery, where White ran the school (on the location that is now 515 Union Street) and Beard was a faculty member. Their curriculum was strict: school uniforms were mandatory, jewelry and cosmetics (and <b>hair</b> <b>straighteners)</b> were discouraged. Daily devotional services also included lectures on racial equality. Classes were vocational as well as academic, and attempted to instill the kind of self-sufficiency Booker T. Washington had advocated also. It developed a good reputation among the local African-American population, though the local whites ostracized White and her staff: [...] "White and her staff thus lived secluded lives in a dormitory beside the school but found some solace within the local black community. Despite the strict segregation laws in Montgomery, black churches took turns inviting White and her staff to their services, and parents of students invited the teachers to their homes for dinner. They also escaped the hatred and ostracism of white Montgomery when they returned to their homes in the North during summer breaks".|$|R

The series was expected to show the objective of self-sufficiency and recycling throughout and this was represented throughout the house. Inside the house, as housemates entered, they were greeted by a huge wall containing recycled life-sized doors. Behind one of the doors was the Diary Room; a housemate could call to talk to Big Brother in this room {{from the bottom of the}} stairs. Inside the Diary Room was a metallic based chair, layered in slim red padding. Outside of the Diary Room, there was a sweeping staircase leading down to an eco-living room with producers desperate to make the housemates experience 'hell in a hell house'. The living room contained different coloured sofas and chairs and a plasma television. Beside the living room, there was a circular style kitchen for housemates to use. The housemates could store their food items and utensils obtained from the adjacent store room in a purpose-built cow. There was a round table for housemates to sit at and eat together at. Beside the living room, there was a small toilet, and the bedroom. The bedroom was colourful in design this year, and introduced a bike which powered the hair dryers and <b>hair</b> <b>straighteners</b> when active. Both the bedroom and the living area led out into the garden. This series, the garden had a barred prison for any housemates that misbehaved, as well as a treehouse for housemates to get cosy in and it included the returning vegetable patch which was last seen in Big Brother 4. Housemates had to shower outside; with one housemate having to spin a wheel that powered the only shower. The traditional mangle also made its return to the house.
