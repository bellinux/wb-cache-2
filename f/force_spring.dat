40|$|Energy {{storage is}} {{important}} for many applications from hybrid vehicles to off-peak electric power to rotating machinery. A flywheel offers the combination of high energy density and high power density not attainable with other energy storage medium. In many situations, it is desirable to store energy at a constant angular velocity. This work proposes a novel self-governing fluidic variable inertia flywheel that can maintain a constant angular velocity {{across a range of}} energy storage. The fluidic flywheel uses a piston to separate the liquid filled chamber from a chamber vented to atmosphere. A force balance is created on the piston due to the radial pressure gradient of the liquid reacted by a constant <b>force</b> <b>spring.</b> Energy added to the system is stored in equally two forms: increases the kinetic energy of the flywheel at a constant angular velocity and increasing the potential energy of the constant <b>force</b> <b>spring.</b> A design example demonstrates that the fluidic flywheel enables a constant angular velocity with an order of magnitude lower mass moment of inertia than a conventional flywheel. This promising technology enables a simple constant angular velocity energy storage system, yet requires future work in numerous areas. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposed}} a method {{used to analyze}} the motion of hammer-driven type penetrators and built a testbed for validating the result of structure optimization of the penetrator in deep space exploration. This method gave a clear understanding of the working principle of the penetrator. The penetrator mainly comprises five components: hammer element, suppressor element, housing element, brake spring, and <b>force</b> <b>spring.</b> Based on the structure of the penetrator, the maximum forward movement of housing element was chosen as optimal object. In order to describe the working process clearly and properly, the working stroke was divided into three phases: unlocking phase, colliding phase, and penetrating phase. In each phase, the displacement and velocity of hammer element, suppressor element, and housing element were described with equation sets when numerically solved. Then, the corresponding parameters of the penetrator were obtained in the testbed with high-speed camera. At last, comparing the parameters obtained by theoretical analysis with that obtained by experiment test with high-speed camera, the perfect ratio of mass element (hammer element, suppressor element, and housing element) and perfect ratio of stiffness of spring element (brake spring and <b>force</b> <b>spring)</b> were obtained...|$|E

Stress-induced CARP interacts with the N 2 A spring region of the titin filament to modulate muscle compliance. We characterize the interaction between CARP and titin-N 2 A and show that the binding site in titin spans the dual domain UN 2 A-Ig 81. We find that the unique sequence UN 2 A is not structurally disordered, but that it has a stable, elongated alpha-helical fold that possibly acts as a constant <b>force</b> <b>spring.</b> Our findings portray CARP/titin-N 2 A as a structured node and help to rationalize the molecular basis of CARP mechanosensing in the sarcomeric I-band...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- A {{spring is}} an elastic or {{resilient}} body whose {{function is to}} deflect or deform when a load is applied and recover its original shape when the load is removed.

Fatigue loads are generally cyclic and fluctuating in nature and are much less in magnitude than the yield strength of materials but they tend to have unpredictable behavior due to dissimilar and brutal fracture patterns.

The present paper aims to test the endurance limit {{of a wide range of}} coiledcompression springs in the smallest possible time frame using a screw-based modified slider-crank mechanism in a mechanical system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} {{simulate}} soft bodies by using gravitational <b>force,</b> <b>spring</b> and damping forces between surface points, and internal molecular pressure forces. We consider a 3 D soft body model composed of mesh points that define the body’s surface such that the points are connected by springs and influenced by internal molecular pressure forces. These pressure forces have been modeled on gaseous molecular interactions. Simulation of soft body with internal pressure forces is known to become unstable when high constants are used and is averted using an implicit integration method. We propose an approximation to this implicit integration method that considerably reduces the number of computations in the algorithm. Our {{results show that the}} proposed method realistically simulates soft bodies and improves performance of the implicit integration method.

40|$|Polymer {{optical fibre}} (POF) {{is a growing}} {{technology}} in short distance telecommunication due to its flexibility, easy connectorization, and lower cost than the mostly deployed silica optical fibre (SOF) technology. Microstructured POFs (mPOFs) have particular promising potential applica-tions in the sensors and telecommunications field, they could specially help to reduce losses in poly-mer fibres by using hollow-core fibres. However, mPOFs are intrinsically more difficult to cut due to the cladding hole structure and it becomes necessary {{to have a high}} quality polymer optical cleaver. In the well-known hot-blade cutting process, fibre and blade are heated, which requires electrical compo-nents and increases cost. A new method has recently been published to cut POF without the need for heating the blade/fibre, therefore electronically devices are not required if it is used a proper mechani-cal system. In this paper, we present a passive and portable polymer optical cleaver implemented with a mechanical system formed by a constant <b>force</b> <b>spring</b> and a damper...|$|E
