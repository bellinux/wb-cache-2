40|$|We propose local {{strategies}} to protect global quantum information. The protocols, which are quantum error correcting codes for dissipative systems, {{are based on}} environment measurements, direct feedback control and simple encoding of the logical qubits into physical qutrits whose decaying transitions are indistinguishable and equally probable. The simple addition of one extra level in the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subsystems</b> allows for local actions to fully and deterministically protect global resources, such as entanglement. We present codes for both quantum jump and quantum state diffusion measurement strategies and test them against several sources of inefficiency. The use of qutrits in information protocols suggests further characterization of qutrit-qutrit disentanglement dynamics, which we also give together with simple local environment measurement schemes able to prevent distillability sudden death and even enhance entanglement in situations in which our feedback error correction is not possible.

40|$|Composite {{crystals}} are crystals that {{consist of}} two or more subsystems, in first approximation each one having its own three-dimensional periodicity. The symmetry of these subsystems is then characterized by an ordinary space group. Due to their mutual interaction the true structure consists of a collection of incommensurately modulated subsystems. In this paper we derive some general properties for intergrowth structures, using the superspace-group theory as developed by Janner and Janssen [Acta Crystallogr. A 36, 408 (1980) ]. In particular, the pseudoinverse is defined of the matrices relating the subsystem periodicities to the translation vectors in superspace. This pseudoinverse is then used to reformulate the relations between the structure and symmetry in three-dimensional space and in (3 + d) -dimensional superspace. As an extension of the theory, subsystem superspace groups are defined, that characterize the symmetry of the individual, incommensurately modulated subsystems. The relation between a unified description of the symmetry and an independent <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subsystems</b> is analyzed in detail, both on the level of the basic structure (translational symmetric subsystems) and on the level of the modulated structure (incommensurately modulated subsystems).

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{conceptual}} design of a habitable module conceived for long duration space exploration missions. The pressurized habitation module (HAB) was specifically sized for a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) mission, named AENEA ―humAn Exploration mission to a Near Earth Asteroid‖. This mission is conceived as an intermediate step before going to further destinations and aims at testing technologies necessary for reaching more challenging targets. In accordance to the mission objectives, the HAB was devised as a reusable space infrastructure, suitable for different exploration scenarios with only minor changes in the architecture/design. The paper describes the design process that, starting from the mission statement, was followed to define the objectives, the requirements and {{the architecture of the}} module in terms of system and subsystems configuration. In particular, the HAB was designed to safely sustain the life of 4 astronauts, for a mission to a NEA lasting about 6 months. The main subsystems of the HAB were sized in order to provide the astronauts with the needed resources, support the activities during all operational phases, including the Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA) on the asteroid's surface, and protect them against the external environment, with particular attention to the space radiation, {{one of the most critical}} aspects of this kind of mission. In this regard, appropriate analyses were carried out for selecting the best shielding strategy. For the execution of the EVAs on the asteroid surface, a dedicated airlock and specific EVA support tools were included. The paper reports a detailed <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subsystems</b> and their innovative aspects. Starting from the mission phases and the related scenarios, different modes of operations were identified. System budgets were evaluated for the envisaged operational modes. The paper illustrates both the applied methodologies and the results, highlighting the major criticalities to be faced (long exposure to space radiations, EVA operations on the asteroid surface) and the key technologies (radiation shielding, inflatable technology, EVA support tools...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the hypothesis that}} quantum mechanics is an approximation to another, cosmological theory, accurate only for <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsystems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe. Quantum theory is then {{to be derived from}} the cosmological theory by averaging over variables which are not internal to <b>the</b> <b>subsystem,</b> which may be considered non-local hidden variables. We find conditions for arriving at quantum mechanics through such a procedure. The key lesson is that <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coupling to <b>the</b> external degrees <b>of</b> freedom introduces noise into <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system degrees <b>of</b> freedom, while preserving a notion of averaged conserved energy and time reversal invariance. These conditions imply that <b>the</b> effective <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subsystem</b> is Nelson's stochastic formulation of quantum theory. We show that Nelson's formulation is not, by itself, a classical stochastic theory as the conserved averaged energy is not a linear function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probability density. We also investigate an argument of Wallstrom posed against <b>the</b> equivalence <b>of</b> Nelson's stochastic mechanics and quantum mechanics and show that, at least for a simple case, it is in error.
