40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to examine what are factors that drive the value in a young, small, founder <b>dependent</b> <b>company</b> and how can this be maximized in the projection of a potential exit of the founder. The research methodology followed the method of the case study as presented by Yin (2009), and was based on a single case study. Academic literature was used to build a base of information and a framework through which analyze the data collected through interviews in the case company. The company used for this case study is a Finnish SME, that imports and distributes food and beverage products in Finland. My findings suggest that understanding how resources are used, and what capabilities are developed in a young, small, founder-dependent company are crucial factors to understand its value, as they reveal if the company's can enjoy a competitive advantage over the other firms operating in the same market, and if this competitive advantage can be sustainable. They suggest that, even though the value of a founder-dependent company is inversely proportional to its degree of dependency on the founder, this dependence can be minimized in order to maximize the value of the company. The case company detains a good position in terms of resources and capabilities that guarantee it a sustained competitive advantage and, thus, a good value. However, it need to implement a number of steps in order to minimize its dependency over its founder, and consequently maximize its value...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between stakeholder focus capability; an important internal organisational capability with company performances. Stakeholder theory reflects that the firms’ performance {{will depend on how}} organisations balance the needs of their stakeholders. Meanwhile, TQM model, while recognising the stakeholders needs, limits the scope to only few vital groups. Furthermore, TQM model specifies the internal capability to focus on important stakeholders and therefore we shall use TQM as our research framework. This study focuses on three important stakeholders; customer, employee, and community because of their direct relationship with business outcomes. An instrument is developed to measure the related constructs and is found to be reliable. Using exploratory factor analysis, we found that the items clearly group into the three factors; customer focus, employee focus, and community focus. Another factor analysis on the company performance measure results in a single factor. We proceed with the multiple regression analysis to test {{the relationship between}} the <b>dependent,</b> <b>company</b> performances and the independent factors, the three dimensions of stakeholder focus capability. The percentage variance explained by the three factors is 68 percent. Customer, community and employee focus significantly influence the company performances with beta coefficient of 0. 563, 0. 465, and 0. 424 respectively. The relationship is moderated by the company size with large companies is observed to have a higher ability to focus. We conclude that emphasis on these three groups are important thus developing the capability to focus on them must be given due consideration. Theoretical and practical implications are discusse...|$|E

We argue, that it is dangerous to try to capture software quality merely by a set of numbers in terms of software metrics believing that these give an authentic picture.

40|$|Multi-asset credit {{derivatives}} trade in huge volumes, yet no models exist that {{are capable of}} properly accounting for the spread behaviour of <b>dependent</b> <b>companies.</b> In this thesis we consider new ways of incorporating a richer and more realistic dependence structure into multi-firm models. We focus on the structural framework in which firm value is modelled as a geometric Brownian motion, with default as the first hitting time of an exponential default threshold. Specification of a dependence structure consisting of a common driving influence and firm-specific inter-company ties allows for both default causality and default asymmetry and we incorporate default contagion in the first passage framework for the first time. Building on the work by Zhou (2001 a), we propose an analytical model for corporate bond yields in the presence of default contagion and two-firm credit default swap baskets. We derive closed-form solutions for credit spreads, and results clearly highlight the importance of dependence assumptions. Extending this framework numerically, we calculate CDS spreads for baskets of three firms {{with a wide variety of}} credit dependence specifications. We examine the impact of firm value correlation and credit contagion for symmetric and asymmetric baskets, and incorporate contagion that has a declining impact over time.

(Engineering Management) Abstract: Currently, many project <b>dependent</b> <b>companies</b> {{are facing}} a number of {{problems}} such as too many active projects, not enough resources to complete the projects and lack of ability to deal with changes in the project environments. These problems will lead to failure in the company’s ability to fulfil its mandate and execute their strategic imperatives. These problems were identified to lead to numerous complications that may threaten the company’s business. The question that was asked was how can organisations use proper project portfolio management to deal with uncertainties in their environments. Hence, the purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the ability of project portfolio management in handling uncertainty, {{and the extent to which}} project portfolio management is used to circumvent the effects of uncertainty on the projects. To this end, two project-driven companies were investigated. The choice of company was made by looking at the availability of information and the company structures. The author had access to resources within the company. It was found that there is an unclear understanding on the role of project portfolio management in both companies. One company claimed to have a fully functioning project portfolio management department, while the other is still in its infancy in this regard [...] . ...|$|R
