5|$|Puerto Rico's {{waters are}} also an {{important}} breeding site for the <b>humpback</b> whale during the Northern Hemisphere's winter. <b>Humpback</b> whale watching is a popular tourist attraction in the municipality of Rincón in western Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|<b>Humpback</b> whales {{have been}} sighted {{in the lower}} region of Glacier Bay; also in Sitakaday Narrows, Whidbey Passage and the waters around South Marble Island. For kayakers, Hugh Miller Inlet and the Beardslee Islands are good {{locations}} to see <b>humpback</b> whales {{from a safe distance}} of about a quarter mile. Other marine whales sighted are grey, minke, fin, and killer whales (orcas).|$|E
5|$|<b>Humpback</b> whales {{make other}} sounds to communicate, such as grunts, groans, snorts and barks.|$|E
500|$|Whale {{watching}} is {{the leisure}} activity of observing <b>humpbacks</b> in the wild. Participants watch from shore or on touring boats. <b>Humpbacks</b> are generally curious about nearby objects. Some individuals, {{referred to as}} [...] "friendlies", approach whale-watching boats closely, often staying under or near the boat for many minutes.|$|R
5000|$|A {{total of}} 1136 <b>humpbacks</b> and 14,695 sperm whales were caught {{from the station}} between 1952 and 1978.|$|R
50|$|From 1960-1985 Roger Payne {{was married}} to noted {{elephant}} researcher Katharine Payne, who performed similar research on the vocalizations of elephants (and <b>Humpbacks).</b>|$|R
5|$|Saxitoxin, a paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning from contaminated mackerel, was {{implicated in}} <b>humpback</b> whale deaths.|$|E
5|$|Though clearly {{related to}} the giant whales of the genus Balaenoptera, the <b>humpback</b> is the sole member of its genus. More recently, though, DNA {{sequencing}} analysis has indicated the <b>humpback</b> is {{more closely related to}} certain rorquals, particularly the fin whale (B. physalus) and possibly to the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), than it is to other rorquals such as the minke whales.|$|E
5|$|Whale vocalization {{is likely}} to serve several purposes. Some species, such as the <b>humpback</b> whale, {{communicate}} using melodic sounds, known as whale song. These sounds may be extremely loud, depending on the species. <b>Humpback</b> whales only have been heard making clicks, while toothed whales use sonar that may generate up to 20,000 watts of sound (+73dBm or +43dBw) and be heard for many miles.|$|E
5000|$|Individual <b>humpbacks</b> have unique {{patterns}} on their long {{black and white}} tail fin and pectoral fins which allow scientists to positively identify them.|$|R
50|$|Southern Right {{whales and}} <b>Humpbacks</b> enter the bay {{annually}} and details of watching sites {{are available from}} the visitor information centre on the waterfront and via http://whalemail.com.au/.|$|R
500|$|<b>Humpbacks</b> have 270 to 400 darkly colored baleen {{plates on}} each side of their mouths. The plates measure from [...] in the front to about [...] in the back, behind the hinge.|$|R
5|$|In 2010, the IWC {{authorized}} Greenland's native {{population to}} hunt a few <b>humpback</b> whales {{for the following}} three years.|$|E
5|$|In December 1883, a male <b>humpback</b> swam up the Firth of Tay in Scotland, past {{what was}} then the whaling port of Dundee. The whale was {{exhibited}} to the public by a local entrepreneur, John Woods, both locally and then as a touring exhibition that travelled to Edinburgh and London. The whale was dissected by Professor John Struthers, who wrote seven papers on its anatomy and an 1889 monograph on the <b>humpback.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Japan, <b>humpback,</b> minkes, {{sperm and}} many other smaller Odontoceti, {{including}} critically endangered species such as North Pacific right, western gray and northern fin, have been targets of illegal captures. The hunts use harpoons for dolphin hunts or intentionally drive whales into nets, reporting them as cases of entanglement. <b>Humpback</b> meat {{can be found in}} markets. In one case, humpbacks of unknown quantities were illegally hunted in the Exclusive Economic Zones of anti-whaling nations such as off Mexico and South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|Whaling Wall - Painting of Isles of Shoals <b>Humpbacks</b> {{created by}} Robert Wyland, {{situated}} {{on the back of}} Cabot House Furniture. It is in disrepair, and restoration has not been allowed by the owners of Cabot Furniture.|$|R
5|$|Whales {{within a}} large area sing a single song. All North Atlantic <b>humpbacks</b> sing the same song, while those of the North Pacific sing a {{different}} song. Each population's song changes slowly {{over a period of}} years without repeating.|$|R
50|$|Alaska Whale Foundation (AWF) is a {{non-governmental}} organization founded in 1996 and based in Warm Springs Bay, Alaska, that studies <b>humpbacks</b> and their habitat in Southeast Alaska. AWF maintains the Coastal Research and Education Center, a permanent research base on Baranof Island.|$|R
5|$|The {{blue whale}} rose from {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of the Songs of the <b>Humpback</b> Whale. The difference between the <b>humpback</b> and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E
5|$|Unlike their {{toothed whale}} counterparts, baleen whales {{are hard to}} study because of their immense size. Intelligence tests such as the mirror test cannot be done because their bulk and lack of body {{language}} makes a reaction impossible to be definitive. However, studies on the brains of <b>humpback</b> whales revealed spindle cells, which, in humans, control theory of mind. Because of this, {{it is thought that}} baleen whales, or at least <b>humpback</b> whales, have consciousness.|$|E
5|$|After several failed attempts, they harpooned the <b>humpback</b> on 31 December 1883. It was {{a strong}} male, and it towed two rowing boats and two steamboats as far as Montrose {{and then to the}} Firth of Forth. After a {{struggle}} that lasted all night, the harpoon lines broke and the whale escaped.|$|E
50|$|The first Farnell bears closely resembled their German Steiff counterparts, having pointed muzzles, long limbs, <b>humpbacks</b> and webbed toes. Early Farnell bears {{also had}} boot-button eyes which were {{replaced}} by painted glass ones. The soles were of felt and reinforced with cardboard.|$|R
50|$|From April to mid August the <b>Humpbacks</b> {{are heading}} north {{to give birth}} and mate {{in the waters of}} the Coral Sea. At this time of year they tend to swim {{constantly}} north at 4-5 knots (5-9 km/h) and will have regular surface intervals.|$|R
50|$|From mid August to mid December the <b>Humpbacks</b> {{are heading}} south {{to return to}} the Antarctic feeding ground for the {{southern}} hemisphere summer. While they will tend southwards they may swim in any direction for hours at a time, with less consistent surface intervals.|$|R
5|$|Beluga {{whales are}} the only {{cetacean}} being common around the peninsula. Other dolphins, including Atlantic white-sided dolphins, white-beaked dolphins, and harbor porpoises, as well as large whales, such as bowhead, <b>humpback,</b> blue, and finback, also visit the area.|$|E
5|$|Breathing {{involves}} expelling {{stale air}} from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs; a <b>humpback</b> whale's lungs can hold about 5,000 litres of air. Spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{fish species}} in Massachusetts include bass, carp, catfish, and trout, while {{saltwater}} {{species such as}} Atlantic cod, haddock, and American lobster populate offshore waters. Other marine species include Harbor seals, the endangered North Atlantic right whales, as well as <b>humpback</b> whales, fin whales, minke whales, and Atlantic white-sided dolphins.|$|E
50|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that whale populations, especially <b>humpbacks,</b> have been steadily increasing {{since the end of}} whaling in Australian waters. The current state of the sperm whale population in the Southern Ocean off Western Australia is unknown. Whale watching is an increasingly popular activity.|$|R
5000|$|Deep Voices: The Second Whale Record (Capitol/EMI Records 0777 7 11598 1 0) was {{released}} on LP in 1977 from additional recordings made by Roger Payne, and re-released on CD in 1995 by Living Music/Windham Hill/BMG Records. It includes recordings of <b>humpbacks,</b> blues, and rights.|$|R
5|$|Whales are {{air-breathing}} mammals {{who must}} surface {{to get the}} air they need. The stubby dorsal fin is visible soon after the blow (exhalation) when the whale surfaces, but disappears {{by the time the}} flukes emerge. <b>Humpbacks</b> have a , heart-shaped to bushy blow through the blowholes.|$|R
5|$|<b>Humpback</b> {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (Balaenopteridae, {{a family that}} includes the blue, fin, Bryde's, sei and minke whales). The rorquals {{are believed to have}} diverged from the other families of the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Miocene. However, it is not known when the members of these families diverged from each other.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other large}} whales, the <b>humpback</b> was {{a target for}} the whaling industry. Once hunted {{to the brink of}} extinction, its {{population}} fell by an estimated 90% before a 1966 moratorium. While stocks have partially recovered, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships and noise pollution continue to impact the population of 80,000.|$|E
5|$|Machula: {{wearing a}} mask, a <b>humpback,</b> {{and a long}} coat, and {{carrying}} a walking stick, machulas represent the ñawpa machus, the mythical first inhabitants of the Andes. In a similar way to the ukukus, they perform an ambiguous role in the festival, being comical as well as constabulary figures.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 the International Whaling Commission (IWC) {{put them}} in a {{protected}} status worldwide, outlawing whaling, but large illegal kills continued into the 1970s. Currently <b>humpbacks</b> are thought to number about 30,000 - 40,000 worldwide, which is approximately 30 - 35 percent of their pre-whaling population.|$|R
50|$|The {{neighboring}} waters {{provide important}} feeding, wintering, and migrating habitat for many whale species, {{many of which}} are threatened or endangered. Among these are: sperm whales, orcas, several species of beaked whales and porpoises, <b>humpbacks,</b> and endangered species such as the North Pacific right whales. and fin whales.|$|R
50|$|Whales are {{air-breathing}} mammals {{who must}} surface {{to get the}} air they need.
