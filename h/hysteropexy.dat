50|$|The aim of laparoscopic <b>hysteropexy</b> is {{to restore}} and {{reinforce}} normal uterine support by suspending the uterus from the sacral promontory using polypropylene mesh. The mesh is strongly attached at two points: namely the uterus/cervix and the anterior longitudinal ligament over the sacral promontory. <b>Hysteropexy</b> restores the normal {{support of the}} vagina, suspending the uterus back in its anatomical position by reinforcing weakened ligaments with a mesh. This procedure allows {{the length of the}} vagina to be restored without compromising its calibre, and is therefore likely to have a favourable functional outcome.|$|E
5000|$|Treatment is conservative, {{mechanical}} or surgical. Conservative {{options include}} behavioral modification and muscle strengthening exercises such as Kegel exercise. [...] Pessaries are a mechanical treatment as they elevate {{and support the}} uterus. [...] Surgical options are many and may include a hysterectomy or a uterus-sparing technique such as laparoscopic <b>hysteropexy,</b> sacrohysteropexy or the Manchester operation.|$|E
50|$|Uterine {{prolapse}} (or Pelvic organ prolapse) {{occurs when}} the female pelvic organs fall from their normal position, into or through the vagina. Occurring in women of all ages, it is more common as women age, particularly in those who have delivered large babies or had exceedingly long pushing phases of labor. Smoking, obesity, connective tissue disorders, upper respiratory disorders‚ and repetitive strain injuries can all increase prolapse risk. Minor prolapse can be treated with exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles; more serious prolapse, e.g., complete procidentia, requires pessary use or reconstructive surgical treatment. Reconstructive pelvic prolapse surgery may be done without resorting to complete hysterectomy by <b>hysteropexy,</b> the resuspension of the prolapsed uterus. Traditional gynecologic practice favors removal of the uterus or ovaries (or both) {{at the time of}} prolapse surgery, and one estimate states that of the 600,000 hysterectomies performed in the United States every year, 13 percent are for prolapse. However, there is concern that many of these hysterectomies may be unnecessary and that <b>hysteropexy</b> would suffice as a treatment instead.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Our {{previous}} study described the increasing adoption of uterine-preserving {{procedures in the}} surgical approach for uterine prolapse. In this follow-up study, we further explored the reoperation rate and variables for the choice of surgeries after primary uterine prolapse surgery, based on the nationwide claim data in Taiwan. Materials and methods: The data {{of this study was}} obtained from the Inpatient Expenditures by Admission files of the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Women who received primary and repeat surgeries, either <b>hysteropexy</b> or hysterectomy, were identified between 1997 and 2010; and followed up to 2010 or till the event of reoperation. We analyzed the variables including the primary surgical type, concomitant stress urinary incontinence (SUI) surgery, patient age, surgeon age, and hospital accreditation level. Results: Among the total 36, 609 women, a higher reoperation rate was noted in the <b>hysteropexy</b> group (156 / 4095) (3. 81 %) than in the hysterectomy group (116 / 32, 514) (0. 36 %); the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 11. 70 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 8. 86 – 15. 43]. It was lower in patients with concomitant SUI surgery; older patients (aged ≥  60 years and 40 – 69 years vs.  <  40 years); older surgeons (aged ≥  50 years and 40 – 49 years vs.  <  40 years), but not significant in hospital levels.

30|$|Uterovaginal {{prolapse}} is {{a common}} condition, which is usually treated by hysterectomy and pelvic floor repair. Several laparoscopic procedures have been described which treat prolapse while preserving the uterus, including laparoscopic uterine suspension [1], laparoscopic sacral suture <b>hysteropexy</b> [2], laparoscopic suture <b>hysteropexy</b> [3], laparoscopic sacral colpohysteropexy [4] and most recently laparoscopic uterine sling suspension [5]. Laparoscopic uterine suspension has already {{been shown to be}} an ineffective treatment for this condition [6].|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> is a {{minimally}} invasive surgical procedure option for apical prolapse repair. Despite {{a significant number}} of postoperative hemorrhage and hematoma cases reported in the literature, life-threatening hemorrhage as a complication after sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> is rare. In this case, in addition to sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy,</b> midurethral sling surgery was performed via the needleless technique for stress urinary incontinence. The case presented here is of a hematoma that developed following sexual intercourse on the 10 th postoperative day after sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> and its successful management and treatment without re-operation. A review of the literature did not reveal any cases similar to the present one. Method: Both sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> using the Surelift® Contasure Prolapse System and midurethral sling surgeries were performed without any intraoperative complications. Case: A 40 -year-old, female patient who had undergone both sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> and midurethral sling surgery presented with pain following sexual intercourse on the 10 th postoperative day. A hematoma of 4 cm was palpated at vaginal examination on the right posterolateral site and confirmed with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A vaginal tamponade was put in place and removed after 2 days follow-up in the hospital. After two weeks, contrast MRI revealed a hematoma smaller in size and after one month the hematoma was not observed. Discussion: Vascularity of the sacrospinous ligament (SSL) space includes an abundance of collateral blood vessels and significant anatomical variations can result from anastomosis. Finding and repairing injured vessels during SSL and pararectal area surgeries transvaginally or via laparotomy is difficult even for the experienced surgeon. Although sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> is a {{minimally invasive}} transvaginal procedure, adverse effects may result due to the physical trauma of sexual intercourse so the patient should be warned to avoid sexual intercourse during the postoperative recovery period. If concurrent procedures have been performed along with sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy,</b> finding the source of the complication is essential for management and treatment. Conclusion: Knowledge of treatment options and pelvic vascular anatomy is fundamental for the diagnosis and management of complications. Although the literature is lacking in relevant data and case studies, the example of this case indicates that having sexual intercourse can result in postoperative development of hematoma in the SSL area, and that the patient should be warned to avoid sexual intercourse during the 6 -week postoperative period. Vaginal packing should be the first treatment approach for management of intraoperative and postoperative hematoma and hemorrhage...|$|E

40|$|With the {{enormous}} {{growth of the}} world population in the last decades and the higher life expectancy, pelvic organ prolapse has become a world wide health problem. In the Netherlands, {{in case of a}} uterine descent, a vaginal hysterectomy is a popular procedure to perform. However, from current literature, more evidence is gained suggesting that removing the uterus in prolapse surgery might be unnecessary. Moreover, preserving the uterus was associated with less morbidity and a shorter recovery time. The sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy,</b> a procedure in which the uterus is preserved and fixed to the sacrospinous ligament in case of a uterine descent, has been performed since 1989. The few studies published describing this procedure focus on anatomical outcomes, not on functional outcomes and quality of life. We first performed a retrospective study in which the sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> was found to be an efficient procedure with a low complication rate. 84 % of women was (highly) satisfied with the procedure and 91 % would recommend the procedure to other women. Recurrent surgery because of prolapse symptoms was performed in 2. 3 % of women. Recurrent cystocele stage 2 or more was found in 38 % of women, however these women did not experience more functional symptoms compared to women without a recurrent cystocele. A second study showed that functional outcomes and quality of life, measured with validated questionnaires before and after surgery, improved significantly after a sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy.</b> To answer the question if the sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> is a better procedure compared to the more common vaginal hysterectomy in terms of morbidity, anatomical outcomes, functional outcomes and quality of life, a randomized study was performed. Compared with a vaginal hysterectomy, hospitalization was 1 day shorter (P = 0. 03) and women were able to return to work 23 days earlier (P = 0. 02). Although urogenital symptoms and quality of life scores after both procedures were comparable a year after surgery, anatomical outcomes differed. At 1 -year follow-up, the recurrence rates for the anterior and posterior compartment were comparable. Of all women with a stage 2 - 4 prolapse pre operative, a lower recurrence rate was found of the apical compartment after vaginal hysterectomy compared to women who had a sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy.</b> The difference in risk for recurrent apical descent was 17 % (95 % CI, 2 to 30) in favour of the vaginal hysterectomy. Especially high recurrence was noted in the preoperative high stage prolapse patients who underwent a sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy.</b> However, recurrent surgery was not significantly higher after a sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy.</b> Surgery for prolapse after a sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> was performed in 11 % (4 / 35) of patients. Surgery for prolapse after a vaginal hysterectomy occurred in 7 % (2 / 31) of patients (Risk difference: 5 %, 95 % CI = - 9 - 19). We can conclude that the sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> is a good alternative for women who wish to preserve their uterus.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether uterus preserving vaginal sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> is non-inferior to vaginal hysterectomy with {{suspension of the}} uterosacral ligaments in the surgical treatment of uterine prolapse. DESIGN: Multicentre randomised controlled non-blinded non-inferiority trial. SETTING: 4 non-university teaching hospitals, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 208 healthy women with uterine prolapse stage 2 or higher requiring surgery and no history of pelvic floor surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> or vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments. The predefined non-inferiority margin {{was an increase in}} surgical failure rate of 7 %. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was recurrent prolapse stage 2 or higher of the uterus or vaginal vault (apical compartment) evaluated by the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system in combination with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery for recurrent apical prolapse at 12 months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes were overall anatomical recurrences, including recurrent anterior compartment (bladder) and/or posterior compartment (bowel) prolapse, functional outcome, complications, hospital stay, postoperative recovery, and sexual functioning. RESULTS: Sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> was non-inferior for anatomical recurrence of the apical compartment with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery (n= 0, 0 %) compared with vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments (n= 4, 4. 0 %, difference - 3. 9 %, 95 % confidence interval for difference - 8. 6 % to 0. 7 %). At 12 months, overall anatomical recurrences, functional outcome, quality of life, complications, hospital stay, measures on postoperative recovery, and sexual functioning did not differ between the two groups.

CONCLUSIONS: Uterus preservation by sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> was non-inferior to vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments for surgical failure of the apical compartment at 12 months' follow-up.

40|$|Introduction: Studies on pelvic organ {{prolapse}} (POP) surgery show {{conflicting evidence}} regarding {{the impact of}} uterus preservation and hysterectomy on sexual function and no large randomized trials with long-term follow-up have been published on this topic. Aims: The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate and compare sexual function after sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> and vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments in women with uterine prolapse. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the SAVE U trial data, a multicenter trial in 4 nonuniversity hospitals in the Netherlands comparing sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> and vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments in primary surgery of uterine prolapse stage II or higher. Primary outcome of the original study was recurrent prolapse stage II or higher of the uterus or vaginal vault (apical compartment) evaluated by POP-Q examination in combination with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery for recurrent apical prolapse at 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes were overall anatomical recurrences, functional outcome, complications, hospital stay, postoperative recovery, and sexual functioning. Data from patients who had completed the POP/urinary incontinence sexual questionnaire (PISQ- 12) at baseline and 24 months after surgery {{were used in the}} present trial. Total, subscale, and individual question analyses were performed. The SAVE U trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NTR 1866. Main Outcome Measures: Differences and changes in sexual function 24 months after surgery, measured by the PISQ- 12 questionnaire. Results: Between November 2009 and March 2012, 208 women were randomized between sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> (n = 103) and vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments (n = 105). Of these, 99 women completed questionnaires at baseline and after 24 months follow-up and were included in the present study. During a follow-up period of 24 months, no significant differences in total PISQ- 12 scores were observed between the groups. After both interventions the item "avoidance of intercourse due to prolapse" significantly improved, as did the physical subscale of the PISQ- 12 questionnaire. Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference in overall sexual functioning (total PISQ- 12 scores) between uterus-preserving sacrospinous <b>hysteropexy</b> and vaginal hysterectomy with suspension of the uterosacral ligaments after a follow-up period of 24 months.
