From two Dutch soil types the upper 1. 10 m below soil surface {{was placed in}} stainless steel columns. The columns were treated with <b>fentin</b> acetate and leached during one year. An artificial water table was maintained at 1 metre depth. Separately batch sorption and transformation experiments were performed. Soils and soil leachates were analysed for tri-, di- and mono-phynyl-tin compounds. Very high sorption constants were found for <b>fentin</b> acetate or its first transformation product <b>fentin</b> hydroxide. The fungicide is, therefore, practically immobile in both soils. Above mentioned transformation products were found in both the transformation and the soil column experiments.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} evaluation "in vitro" the effect of fungicides and herbicides on Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Btk). The five fungicides: epoxiconazole, <b>fentin</b> hydroxide, azoxystrobin, tebuconazole and carbendazim, and five herbicides: sulfentrazone, lactofen, imazethapyr, fenoxaprop and metribuzin were tested at two concentrations, on cells and spores, in nutrient agar (NA) - solid medium (SM), and in nutrient broth (NB) - liquid medium (LM), in addition to their metabolization (MT) by Btk. For cells, the phytosanitary products in NA were tested incorporated into the medium and on filter paper disks impregnated with the products. The evaluation consisted, respectively, of the number of CFU/mL and of the formation of an inhibition halo. For cells, the Bt+products+NB mixture was incubated in Erlenmeyer flasks (30 Â 2 ÂC, 150 rpm, 24 h) an then the NB was diluted and inoculated onto NA; the number of CFU/mL was evaluated. The MT and spore tests were performed in liquid medium (water for MT and NB for spores). The effects of the products varied with the category (fungicide and herbicide), their concentrations, technique used, contact time, and developmental stage of the pathogen. The LM test is the most indicated to evaluate the effect of the products on cells. It was observed that most fungicides were compatible with cells, and only epoxiconazole and azoxystrobin were metabolized. The herbicides, independents of the concentrations, were incompatible with cells, and only sulfentrazone and imazethapyr were metabolized. <b>Fentin</b> hydroxide was the only product incompatible with sporeObjetivou-se comparar tÃcnicas para a avaliaÃÃo âin vitroâ do efeito de fungicidas e herbicidas sobre Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Btk).

40|$|The {{extraction}} and preconcentration {{capabilities of}} headspace solid-phase microextraction (headspace SPME) were {{combined with the}} separation power of capillary gas chromatography (CGC) and the low limits of detection (LODs) of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for {{the determination of the}} organotin compound triphenyltin (TPhT or <b>fentin)</b> in aqueous standard solutions and in potatoes and mussels after digestion with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) or KOH-EtOH. Throughout, tricyclohexyltin (cyhexatin, TCT) was used as internal standard. Derivatization to transform TPhT and TCT into sufficiently volatile compounds was carried out with sodium tetraethylborate (NaBEt(4)), at pH 8 (0. 2 mol L(- 1) ammonium buffer). Headspace extraction was performed for 10 - 20 min at 75 or 85 degrees C (depending on the type of sample) with a 100 mu m polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber. Absorption curves showed that even at high temperature (75 degrees C) no equilibrium conditions were obtained for either compound. Direct aqueous SPME was also studied, but the sensitivity was 11 times lower at 25 degrees C than that observed when using headspace SPME at 75 degrees C. After 2 min desorption of the SPME fiber at 270 degrees C in the GC inlet, the organotin compounds were separated on a capillary column with a polydimethylsiloxane coating and transported into the ICP by means of a home-made heated (270 degrees C) transfer line. Monitoring of the (120) Sn(+) signal by ICP-MS during the run of the GC provided extremely low LODs for <b>fentin</b> in water: 2 pg L(- 1) (instrumental) and 125 pg L(- 1) (procedure) as well as a good repeatability of 8 % RSD (n = 10).

Azocyclotin foi avaliado à dose de 125 g i. a. 100 L- 1 de água e trifenil hidróxido de estanho a 41, 25 g i. a. 100 L- 1. Os delineamentos experimentais foram inteiramente ao acaso, com cinco repetições. Em condições de campo, foi realizado um experimento com seis tratamentos. Os tratamentos e as doses em g ha- 1 de i. a foram: 1) tebuconazole + trifenil hidróxido de estanho (100 + 200); 2) tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin (40 + 100); 3) trifloxystrobin (125); 4) tebuconazole + azocyclotin (100 + 500); 5) azocyclotin (500) e 6) testemunha. O delineamento foi em blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições. Para a avaliação in vitro foram medidos diâmetros ortogonais do crescimento micelial do fungo em BDA; in vivo e no campo usou-se escala de notas de 1 a 9, sendo 1 = sem sintoma e 9 = igual ou mais de 25 % de área foliar afetada. In vitro, o tratamento 7 proporcionou maior inibição do desenvolvimento micelial. Em plântulas, observou-se controle de C. lindemuthianum até 144 horas, pelos dois produtos. Uma nova constatação em campo foi o controle de antracnose pelo acaricida azocyclotin, em que se observou também efeito sobre mancha-angular e mancha-de-alternária. Concluiu-se que o acaricida azocyclotin é eficiente no controle da antracnose do feijoeiro, semelhante ao trifenil hidróxido de estanho. The control effect of azocyclotin acaricide was tested to common bean anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, in vitro, seedlings and in field conditions.

40|$|Among the {{biocidal}} triorganotin compounds, triphenyltin derivatives (TPTs, <b>Fentin),</b> i. e. acetate (TPTA), hydroxide (TPTH), and chloride (TPTC) {{are used}} world wide as fungicide – mainly against Cercospora beticola -, herbicides, antifeedings, and molluscicides. They are of environmental concern owing to direct introduction into the marine {{water and sediments}} by leaching from employment in agriculture with particular contamination of coastal areas as in the Venice Lagoon. As lipophilic compounds, TPTs accumulate by oral and via gill intake especially in the fatty compartments of the teleostean fishes. In the latters the resulted bioconcentration is responsible of mortality after continue exposure, together with the decreased resistance to infections. Such effect appears {{in accord with the}} highly selective toxicity on the immune system in mammals. Our previous studies showed that organotin compounds, such as butyltin derivatives mainly employed in antifouling paints, are immunotoxic in tunicates causing inhibitory effects on yeast phagocytosis by hemocytes of the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, which is spread in Venice Lagoon. Therefore we have extended the study to TPTs with the aim of investigating whether hemocytes of this species were still sensitive biosensors with the same mechanism. TPTs were first dissolved in DMSO and then diluted and always employed at concentrations of 0. 1, 1, 10 µM in sea water. After 1 hr exposure, viability of hemocytes was not affected up to 100 µM for TPTA and TPTC, and 1 mM for TPTH, indicating and about tenfold lesser sensitivity than mammal thymocytes. Only at 100 µM TPTs caused some morphological changes without cytolysis, suggesting an interaction with cytoskeletal constituents. Analogously to butyltin, TPTs exerted significant inhibitory effects on yeast phagocytosis – TPTC > TPTA > TPTH – in a concentration-dependent manner. The same order of inhibition was observed for Ca 2 +-ATPase activity, suggesting that the inhibition of this enzyme and of phagocytosis might be strictly linked, as we demonstrated with butyltin. So, in general, organotins may influence cell calcium homeostasis. As for alkyl trorganortins – TBT > TET > TMT -, addition of 20 µg/ml calmodulin (CaM) was able to reverse the inhibition of Ca 2 +-ATPase activity by TPTs, but not restoring the phagocytosis index. These results supported the hypothesis that the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation might also be involved. In fact, O 2 °- production was inhibited – TPTA > TPTC > TPTH – in a concentration-dependent manner, but not restored by CaM. So CaM {{does not seem to be}} involved in the respiratory burst of mitochondria. In conclusion, TPTs inhibit the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in tunicates as shown in teleosts, but impair the cell-mediated immunity compromising the phagocyte system, differently from mammals where e. g. TPTH is not immunotoxic. Therefore tunicates appear effective candidates for sentinel organisms of organotin pollutants...|$|E
