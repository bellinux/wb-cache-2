5|$|<b>Iron(III)</b> {{chloride}} undergoes hydrolysis {{to give an}} acidic solution. When heated with <b>iron(III)</b> oxide at 350°C, <b>iron(III)</b> chloride gives iron oxychloride, a layered {{solid and}} intercalation host.|$|E
5|$|Anhydrous <b>iron(III)</b> {{chloride}} adopts the BiI3 structure, {{which features}} octahedral Fe(III) centres interconnected by two-coordinate chloride ligands. <b>Iron(III)</b> chloride hexahydrate consists of trans-+ cationic complexes and chloride anions, {{with the remaining}} two H2O molecules embedded within the monoclinic crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iron(III)</b> {{chloride}} {{is used in}} {{sewage treatment}} and drinking water production. In this application, FeCl3 in slightly basic water reacts with the hydroxide ion to form a floc of <b>iron(III)</b> hydroxide, or more precisely formulated as FeO(OH)−, that can remove suspended materials.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iron(III)</b> chloride, {{also called}} ferric chloride, is an {{industrial}} scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the +3 oxidation state. The colour of <b>iron(III)</b> chloride crystals {{depends on the}} viewing angle: by reflected light the crystals appear dark green, but by transmitted light they appear purple-red. Anhydrous <b>iron(III)</b> chloride is deliquescent, forming hydrated hydrogen chloride mists in moist air. It is rarely observed in its natural form, the mineral molysite, known mainly from some fumaroles.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} {{hydrated}} metal chlorides, hydrated <b>iron(III)</b> chloride {{can be converted}} to the anhydrous salt by refluxing with thionyl chloride. Conversion of the hydrate to anhydrous <b>iron(III)</b> chloride is not accomplished by heating, as HCl and iron oxychlorides are produced.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>iron(III)</b> {{chloride}} and PAC {{are used}} as flocculation and coagulation agents in sewage treatment, drinking water production, and paper production.|$|E
5|$|Iron(II) {{complexes}} {{are less}} stable than <b>iron(III)</b> complexes but {{the preference for}} O-donor ligands is less marked, so that for example 2+ is known while 3+ is not. They {{have a tendency to}} be oxidized to <b>iron(III)</b> but this can be moderated by low pH and the specific ligands used.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iron(III)</b> {{chloride}} is a mild oxidising agent, for example, it {{is capable}} of oxidising copper(I) chloride to copper(II) chloride.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iron(III)</b> {{chloride}} is harmful, highly corrosive and acidic. The anhydrous {{material is}} a powerful dehydrating agent.|$|E
5|$|Oxalates react rapidly with aqueous <b>iron(III)</b> {{chloride}} to give 3−. Other carboxylate salts form complexes, e.g. citrate and tartrate.|$|E
5|$|Reducing agents such as {{hydrazine}} convert <b>iron(III)</b> chloride to complexes of iron(II).|$|E
5|$|Solutions of <b>iron(III)</b> {{chloride}} {{are produced}} industrially both from iron and from ore, in a closed-loop process.|$|E
5|$|The ferric {{chloride}} test {{is a traditional}} colorimetric test for phenols, which uses a 1% <b>iron(III)</b> chloride solution that has been neutralised with sodium hydroxide until a slight precipitate of FeO(OH) is formed. The mixture is filtered before use. The organic substance is dissolved in water, methanol or ethanol, then the neutralised <b>iron(III)</b> chloride solution is added—a transient or permanent coloration (usually purple, green or blue) indicates {{the presence of a}} phenol or enol.|$|E
5|$|The iron {{compounds}} {{produced on}} the largest scale in industry are iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) and <b>iron(III)</b> chloride (FeCl3). The former {{is one of}} the most readily available sources of iron(II), but is less stable to aerial oxidation than Mohr's salt ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O). Iron(II) compounds tend to be oxidized to <b>iron(III)</b> compounds in the air.|$|E
5|$|Used {{in water}} and {{wastewater}} treatment to precipitate phosphate as <b>iron(III)</b> phosphate.|$|E
5|$|When {{dissolved}} in water, <b>iron(III)</b> chloride undergoes hydrolysis and gives off heat in an exothermic reaction. The resulting brown, acidic, and corrosive solution {{is used as}} a flocculant in sewage treatment and drinking water production, and as an etchant for copper-based metals in printed circuit boards. Anhydrous <b>iron(III)</b> chloride is a fairly strong Lewis acid, and it {{is used as a}} catalyst in organic synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Although gallium has {{no natural}} {{function}} in biology, gallium ions interact with {{processes in the}} body {{in a manner similar}} to <b>iron(III).</b> Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of <b>iron(III)</b> by bacteria such as Pseudomonas, the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} <b>iron(III)</b> chloride is etching copper in two-step redox reaction to copper(I) chloride {{and then to}} copper(II) chloride {{in the production of}} printed circuit boards.|$|E
5|$|By {{recuperation}} of {{the spent}} acid, a closed acid loop is established. The <b>iron(III)</b> oxide by-product of the regeneration process is valuable, {{used in a}} variety of secondary industries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iron(III)</b> {{chloride}} {{is used as}} {{catalyst for}} the reaction of ethylene with chlorine, forming ethylene dichloride (1,2-dichloroethane), an important commodity chemical, which is mainly used for the industrial production of vinyl chloride, the monomer for making PVC.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{compounds}} {{have been}} used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass. The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds. In the glass industry, manganese compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less-colored <b>iron(III)</b> and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the <b>iron(III).</b> Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{products}} {{can be produced}} with hydrochloric acid in normal acid-base reactions, resulting in inorganic compounds. These include water treatment chemicals such as <b>iron(III)</b> chloride and polyaluminium chloride (PAC).|$|E
5|$|A colour {{reaction}} for salts of acetic acid is <b>iron(III)</b> chloride solution, {{which results in}} a deeply red colour that disappears after acidification. A more sensitive test uses lanthanum nitrate with iodine and ammonia to give a blue solution. Acetates when heated with arsenic trioxide form cacodyl oxide, which can be detected by its malodorous vapours.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iron(III)</b> {{chloride}} has {{a relatively}} low melting point and boils at around 315°C. The vapour consists of the dimer Fe2Cl6 (c.f. aluminium chloride) which increasingly dissociates into the monomeric FeCl3 (D3h point group molecular symmetry) at higher temperature, in competition with its reversible decomposition to give iron(II) chloride and chlorine gas.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} acid {{catalyst}} is very important. Bronsted acids such as HCl, H2SO4, polyphosphoric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid {{have been used}} successfully. Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride, zinc chloride, <b>iron(III)</b> chloride, and aluminium chloride are also useful catalysts.|$|E
5|$|The {{descriptor}} hydrated or anhydrous is {{used when}} referring to <b>iron(III)</b> chloride, {{to distinguish between the}} two common forms. The hexahydrate is usually given as the simplified empirical formula FeCl3⋅6H2O. It may also be given as trans-Cl⋅2H2O and the systematic name tetraaquadichloroiron(III) chloride dihydrate, which more clearly represents its structure.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide as {{a mixture}} with about 0.5% <b>iron(III)</b> oxide (Fe2O3) is called {{calamine}} {{and is used}} in calamine lotion. Two minerals, zincite and hemimorphite, have been historically called calamine. When mixed with eugenol, a ligand, zinc oxide eugenol is formed, which has applications as a restorative and prosthodontic in dentistry.|$|E
5|$|As pH {{rises above}} 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form {{and as it}} rises above 2–3, reddish-brown hydrous <b>iron(III)</b> oxide {{precipitates}} out of solution. Although Fe3+ has an d5 configuration, its absorption spectrum is not like that of Mn2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe3+ has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region. On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion 2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added, which instead results in white iron(II) carbonate being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form <b>iron(III)</b> oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.|$|E
5|$|Iron(II) sulfate {{is used as}} a {{precursor}} to other iron compounds. It is also used to reduce chromate in cement. It is used to fortify foods and treat iron deficiency anemia. <b>Iron(III)</b> sulfate is used in settling minute sewage particles in tank water. Iron(II) chloride {{is used as a}} reducing flocculating agent, in the formation of iron complexes and magnetic iron oxides, and as a reducing agent in organic synthesis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iron(III)</b> {{chloride}} finds use {{in water}} purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in paints, as an additive in animal feed, and as an etchant for copper {{in the manufacture of}} printed circuit boards. It can also be dissolved in alcohol to form tincture of iron, which is used as a medicine to stop bleeding in canaries.|$|E
5|$|Mars is {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} Earth with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by <b>iron(III)</b> oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{amounts of}} iron {{occur in the}} iron sulfide mineral pyrite (FeS2), but it is {{difficult}} to extract iron from it and it is therefore not used. In fact, iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it. During weathering, iron tends to leach from sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate. Both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even mildly elevated pH as <b>iron(III)</b> oxide.|$|E
5|$|Mars is a {{terrestrial}} planet {{that consists of}} minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained <b>iron(III)</b> oxide dust.|$|E
5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when {{the charges are}} high, and {{the distance between the}} nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low vapour pressure. Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account. Above their melting point ionic solids melt and become molten salts (although some ionic compounds such as aluminium chloride and <b>iron(III)</b> chloride show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase). Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100°C), and are termed ionic liquids. Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.|$|E
25|$|When phenol {{reacts with}} <b>iron(III)</b> {{chloride}} solution, an intense violet-purple solution is formed.|$|E
25|$|Much of the Martian {{surface is}} deeply covered by dust {{as fine as}} talcum powder. The global {{predominance}} of dust obscures the underlying bedrock, making spectroscopic identification of primary minerals impossible from orbit over {{many areas of the}} planet. The red/orange appearance of the dust is caused by <b>iron(III)</b> oxide (nanophase Fe2O3) and the <b>iron(III)</b> oxide-hydroxide mineral goethite.|$|E
