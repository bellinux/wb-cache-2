5|$|Grace {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in June 1865 appearing for the <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South against the Players of the South at The Oval, {{but did not}} score his first century until his tenth match, making an unbeaten 224 for England against Surrey County Cricket Club at the same ground. In 1871, he reached 100 on 10 different occasions, the most during any season of his career. In doing so, {{he became the first}} batsman to pass 2,000 first-class runs in a season, tallying 2,739 in total. He scored the first triple century in first-class cricket in 1876, amassing 344 for the Gentlemen of Marylebone Cricket Club against Kent after the Gentlemen had been forced to follow on. Less than two weeks later, Grace passed 300 once more, scoring 318 not out for Gloucestershire against Yorkshire. He scored 177 in his only innings between the two triple-centuries, and scored 839 runs in eight days.|$|E
5|$|In October 1549 Andrew Dudley {{became one}} of Edward VI's Chief <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Privy Chamber and later keeper of the Palace of Westminster, in which {{function}} {{he was responsible for}} the Royal Wardrobe and Privy Purse. In early 1553 he was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Emperor Charles V to suggest peace talks between France and the Empire. Andrew Dudley was bethrothed to Margaret Clifford, a first cousin of Lady Jane Grey, in June 1553; yet his marriage plans came to naught with the accession of Mary I, and on 19 August 1553 he was condemned to death for his part in his brother's attempt to establish Lady Jane on the English throne. Released in January 1555, he lived in London until his death in 1559.|$|E

5|$|In total, the Central Recreation Ground hosted 228 {{first-class}} matches, and 14 List A matches. The {{ground was}} initially leased from the Cornwallis family (the descendants of Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis), until 1869 when {{the ground was}} purchased by the cricketing trust. Between 1887 and the 1960s, the ground hosted the Hastings & St. Leonards Festival in September, which was the southern equivalent of the Scarborough Festival. During these festivals, seven Gentlemen v Players matches were played on the ground between 1889 and 1903, and in 1907 & 1909, matches took place between <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South and Players of the South. The 1909 match was the only first-class match played by British Army officer Leonard Slater, and was {{a victory for the}} Players of the South by 228 runs.|$|E
5|$|George did {{not play}} a senior role in {{government}} until his wife Anne succeeded as queen on William's death in 1702. George was the chief mourner at William's funeral. Anne appointed him generalissimo of all English military forces on 17 April, and Lord High Admiral, the official but nominal head of the Royal Navy, on 20 May. Actual power at the Admiralty was held by George Churchill, whose elder brother was John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, a great friend of Anne's and the captain-general of English land forces. Prince George had known the Churchills for years: another brother Charles Churchill, {{had been one of}} his <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bedchamber in Denmark, and Marlborough had accompanied George on his journey from Denmark to England for his marriage to Anne in 1683. His secretary in the 1680s was Colonel Edward Griffith, brother-in-law of the Duchess of Marlborough, who was Anne's close confidante and friend. George followed William III as Captain-General of the Honourable Artillery Company, and was made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Anne failed, however, in her attempts to persuade the States General of the Netherlands to elect her husband captain-general of all Dutch forces, to maintain the unified command of the Maritime Powers that William had held.|$|E
5|$|In 1697, Parliament granted King William £50,000 to {{establish}} a household for the Duke of Gloucester, though the King only permitted the release of £15,000, keeping the difference for himself. The establishment of Gloucester's own household in early 1698 revived the feud between Anne and William. William was determined to limit Anne's involvement in the household, and therefore appointed, against her wishes, the low church Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, as Gloucester's preceptor. Anne was high church, and Burnet, knowing she was unhappy, attempted to decline the appointment, but the King insisted he accept it. Anne's anger was only placated by an assurance from King William that she could choose all the lower servants of the household. The Earl of Marlborough, a friend of Anne's, was appointed Gloucester's governor, after the Duke of Shrewsbury declined the office {{on the grounds of}} ill health. Shortly before the King sailed for the Netherlands, he received Anne's choices from Marlborough but he refused to confirm them. His favourite, the Earl of Albemarle, eventually convinced him to agree to Anne's appointments, and the King's acceptance was sent from the Netherlands in September 1698. The Marlboroughs' twelve-year-old son, Lord Churchill, was appointed Gloucester's Master of the Horse, and became a friend and playmate. Abigail Hill, a kinswoman of the Countess of Marlborough, was appointed his laundress, and Abigail's brother, Jack Hill, was made one of Gloucester's <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bedchamber.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to officials, teachers, merchants, farmers, artisans, and retainers, {{there were many}} other occupations. The pig-breeder was not seen as a lowly profession if it was merely utilized by a poor scholar {{to pay for a}} formal education. For example, the first chancellor in Han to lack either a military background or a title as marquess was the pig-breeder Gongsun Hong (公孫弘) of Emperor Wu's reign. Physicians who practiced medicine and studied medical classics could not only make a decent income, but were also able to gain an education and become officials. The physician Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was nominated for office while another became Prefect of the <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Palace (郎中令). Those who practiced occult arts of Chinese alchemy and mediumship were often employed by the government to conduct religious sacrifices, while on rare occasions—such as with Luan Da (d. 112 BCE)—an occultist might marry a princesses or be enfeoffed as a marquess. While it was socially acceptable for gentry scholars to engage in the occult arts of divination and Chinese astrology, career diviners were of a lower status and earned only a modest income. Other humble occultist professions included sorcery and physiognomy; like merchants, those who practiced sorcery were banned from holding public office. Being a butcher was another lowly occupation, yet there is one case where a butcher became an official during Emperor Gaozu's reign, while Empress He (d. 189 CE) and her brother, the regent He Jin (d. 189 CE), came from a family of butchers. Runners and messengers who worked for the government were also considered to have a lowly status, yet some later became government officials.|$|E
5|$|The Minister of the Household (Guangluxun 光祿勳), {{also known}} as Superintendent of the Household and Supervisor of Attendants, was {{originally}} titled the Prefect of the <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Palace (Lang zhongling 郎中令) before 104 BC. He {{was responsible for the}} emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks, and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot. However, to ensure that the emperor's entire safety was not entrusted to a single officer, the subordinates of the Minister of the Guards were given sole right to patrol the palaces' entrances and walls while the eunuchs guarded the emperor's private apartments and harem. Three of the five cadet corps commanded by the Minister of the Household were actually armed civilian nominees serving a period of probation before appointment to a government office; the other two corps were composed of imperial bodyguards who were never appointed to civilian offices. The former were often recommended by commandery-level Administrators as Filial and Incorrupt, while others could be relatives of high officials in central government. The Minister of the Household oversaw subordinate court advisors (Yi Lang /议郎） who advised the emperor and engaged in scholarly debates. They were allowed to openly criticize the emperor, participate in provincial inspections, and conduct mourning ceremonies for recently deceased kings and marquesses while installing their successors. Internuncios (Yezhe 謁者), led by a Supervisor of the Internuncios (Yezhe puye 謁者僕射), were subordinates of the Minister of the Household who participated in state ceremonies, condoled on behalf of the emperor for recently deceased officials, inspected public works and military camps along the frontiers, and acted as diplomats to the semi-autonomous fiefs and non-Han-Chinese peoples along the borders.|$|E

25|$|His next {{appearance}} in first-class cricket didn't come until 1859, {{when he played}} for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the Surrey Club at The Oval. He made further first-class appearances in 1859, for the <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South against the <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, {{as well as for}} the Surrey Club against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He also made two appearances for Sussex, both against Kent. The following year he made three appearances in first-class cricket, for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Cambridge University at Fenner's, for the Gentlemen against the Players and for the <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South against the <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North. In 1861, he played two matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Cambridge University and Sussex, as well as a single match for the <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South against the <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North. Two years later he played for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Sussex, following this up in 1864 with a single appearance for the club against Oxford University. He made two further first-class appearances in 1865, one for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Oxford University and another for the Gentlemen of England against the Gentlemen of Middlesex. In 24 appearances in first-class cricket, Wynch scored 758 runs at an average of 21.05, with a high score of 87. One of four half centuries he made, this score came against the <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North in 1859.|$|E

25|$|During the 1870s {{the fixture}} {{received}} {{competition in the}} shape of matches between the equivalent professional touring teams, the United North of England Eleven and the United South of England Eleven. There were 11 games involving the United sides and then one (the last) in 1880 when the United South played against the official North. Other variations featured teams called <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South, Players of the North and Players of the South who played against each other on several occasions.|$|E
25|$|In 1879 Evans {{represented}} Oxford University in four first-class matches, as well {{as representing}} the Gentlemen in two Gentlemen v Players fixtures. Also during the 1879 season, Evans played a single first-class match for I Zingari against Yorkshire and a single match for the <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North v <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South, where Evans represented the South. In the 1879 season Evans took 41 wickets at a bowling average of 12.09, with five five wicket hauls and two ten wicket hauls in a match. Evans best bowling figures were 7/31.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year {{he made his}} debut for I Zingari, representing the amateur side against Harrow School, and {{a few weeks later}} played for the Gentlemen of England against the Gentlemen of Kent, the England side being captained by Spencer Ponsonby, one of the I Zingari founders. Arkwright continued to represent I Zingari and other amateur sides, making occasional first-class appearances for representative amateur sides such as <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MCC and he twice played for the Gentlemen against the Players. His best bowling performance was for the <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MCC in 1861, when he claimed nine wickets in each innings against the Gentlemen of Kent, finishing with 18 wickets in the match. At the time, only William Lillywhite had taken that many wickets in a first-class match, doing so in the Gentlemen v Players fixture of 1837. Since then, only Jim Laker has achieved the total, surpassing it when he claimed 19 wickets for England against Australia in 1956.|$|E
