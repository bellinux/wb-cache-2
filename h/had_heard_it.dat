5|$|The {{attempts}} of the Mortaras {{and their allies}} to identify {{who was supposed to}} have baptised Edgardo quickly bore fruit. After their present servant Anna Facchini adamantly denied any involvement, they considered former employees and soon earmarked Morisi as a possible candidate. In late July 1858 the Mortara home was visited by Ginerva Scagliarini, a friend of Morisi's who had once worked for Marianna's brother-in-law Cesare De Angelis. Marianna's brother Angelo Padovani tested Scagliarini by saying falsely that he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> was Morisi who had baptised Edgardo. The ruse worked—Scagliarini said that she had been told the same thing by Morisi's sister Monica.|$|E
25|$|Skeptical {{scholars}} {{account for}} the many similarities between the Quran and the Jewish and Hebrew Scriptures by saying that Muhammad was teaching what he {{believed to be a}} universal history, as he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> from the Jews and Christians he had encountered in Arabia and on his travels - as well as his exposure to the Hanif tradition by way of his paternal-grandfather, Abdul Muttalib. These scholars also disagree with the Islamic belief that the whole of the Quran is addressed by God to humankind. They note that there are numerous passages where God is directly addressed, or mentioned in the third person, or where the narrator swears by various entities, including God.|$|E

He saw action at the Battle of Lowestoft on 3 June 1665 {{as one of the}} junior flag officers. Reports of his actions during the battle were confused and contradictory, some accounts suggesting that he had taken a squadron of six ships and pursued nine Dutch vessels, others stating that he had abandoned the fight {{after the death of his}} brother, Charles. Poet Andrew Marvell added a critical verse suggesting the latter view was correct in his 1666 poem 'The Second Advice to a Painter': Berkeley <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> soon, and thought not goodTo venture more of royal Harding's blood …With his whole squadron straight away he bore,And, like good boy, promised to fight no more.|$|E

He became friends with Oliver Cromwell, who was second in command, supporting him in his disputes with Manchester. He fought with distinction at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644. Shortly afterwards he asked permission to attack the Royalist stronghold at Tickhill Castle, because he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> was willing to surrender. Manchester refused, dismissing him as a madman. Taking that as a yes, he went and took the Castle without a shot being fired.|$|E

500|$|Meisdalshagen {{was also}} discontented with the {{deregulation}} policy {{to which the}} Labour Party gradually adhered in the 1950s. Trygve Bratteli, on the other hand, {{was viewed as a}} proponent of gradual deregulation. In November 1958 there were rumours that Meisdalshagen would return to the cabinet, probably as Minister of Transport of Communications. Some believed that Meisdalshagen worked together with Karl Trasti to have Trygve Bratteli removed from the cabinet; Trasti would succeed Bratteli as Minister of Finance, according to the rumour, with was told to Bratteli by Meisdalshagen's predecessor as Minister of Agriculture, Rasmus Nordbø. At the time Karl Trasti {{was a member of the}} ad-hoc Paulson Committee, which worked with questions regarding the Ministry of Finance's policy. It was thought that some of the committee's policy proposals could be undesirable to Bratteli, and thereby compromise his minister position. This information was given to Trygve Bratteli from parliamentary secretary Haakon Bingen in January 1959. Binge <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> from Egil Lothe, at the time a deputy under-secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance. A friend of Meisdalshagen, Lothe was thereby tied to the alleged intriguers. Jens Haugland noted the scheme of Trasti and Meisdalshagen in his diary, and that this caused Bratteli to keep himself [...] "in the background". This was a part of a broader schism in the party, where Meisdalshagen was the [...] "strongest man in the group" [...] consisting of parliamentarians who deviated in questions of foreign policy: Finn Moe, Trygve Bull, Hans Offerdal, Sverre Løberg and Meisdalshagen. Meisdalshagen had been a supporter of the [...] "Easter Uprising" [...] of 1958, a voicing of dissent within the Labour Party, where the socialist students' association gained the signatures of Labour MPs on a NATO-critical resolution. In Meisdalshagen's obituary, he was likened to Olav Oksvik, another NATO-critical Labour politician.|$|E
500|$|Sifton's {{first foray}} into {{politics}} was in 1878, when he campaigned for the introduction of prohibition {{under the auspices of}} the Canada Temperance Act in the Manitoba electoral districts of Lisgar and Marquette. [...] His first bid for elected office took place in 1882, when he was elected to Brandon's first city council. [...] He was re-elected in 1883, and did not seek re-election at the conclusion of this second term, though he did briefly consider running for mayor before concluding that he had insufficient support to be elected. [...] He also served on the local school board. [...] When his brother Clifford became Wilfrid Laurier's Minister of the Interior in November 1896, Sifton advised him on Liberal Party affairs in western Canada. [...] This advice included suggested patronage appointments, one of which was an unimplemented proposal that Arthur himself be appointed chief justice of the Northwest Territories (a position that did not at the time exist). [...] In 1898, Sifton re-entered politics—Hall speculates to increase his chances at a judgeship—by challenging Robert Brett, the long-time Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories for Banff, in the 1898 territorial election. [...] Election day returns showed Sifton with a plurality of thirty-six votes, but by the time contested ballots were dealt with this had turned into a majority of two votes for Brett. [...] Sifton successfully challenged this result in court, and in the ensuing by-election he defeated Brett by a comfortable margin. [...] One oft-repeated anecdote from the campaign involved a campaign forum for which Brett was late. [...] After giving his own speech, Sifton offered to give the still-absent Brett's speech as well, since he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> so many times. [...] He did so, and when Brett eventually arrived to give a speech nearly identical to the one Sifton had given on his behalf he was puzzled by the audience's amusement.|$|E
