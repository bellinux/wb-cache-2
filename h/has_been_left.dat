5|$|The {{project was}} halted in March 1989, {{for lack of}} funding, after costs had quickly {{escalated}} that January, from £35million to £230million. By this point huge sections of the building's roof had been removed, so that machinery could be taken out. Without a roof, the building's steel framework <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> exposed and its foundations have been prone to flooding.|$|E
5|$|A large Tesco {{supermarket}} {{was constructed}} {{on the outskirts}} of Chatteris at a cost of £22 million. It was due to be opened in November 2014, but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> unopened and empty following the company's decision to halt the opening of 49 out-of-town supermarkets following poor financial results. As of April 2016, Tesco are looking for another retailer to take over the store, which remains mothballed.|$|E

60|$|And {{these the}} Dean would lay upon the rustic table, {{and he would}} add them up {{forwards}} and backwards, going first up the column and then down it to see that nothing <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> out, and then down it again {{to see what it}} <b>was</b> that must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> out.|$|R

5|$|Both the High Court and the Charities Commission are {{authorised}} {{to establish}} schemes administering charities. These can come about when money <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> for a charitable purpose {{which is not}} specified, or with no suggestion as to {{how it should be}} administered. The scheme may be used to appoint new trustees, except when the trustee's identity is crucial to the intentions of the testator, as in Re Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-près.|$|E

Thomas <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> Kedleston by his father, but his grandmother, Alice (formerly De Somerville), claimed she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> the Manor by her husband. The depute was solved by giving Croxall Manor to Alice {{for the duration}} of her life, after which time it passed back to Richard.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the largest}} craters <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>left,</b> often too large to fill-in, even today. The largest crater on the Western Front, the Lochnagar Crater, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> for 50 years, but it <b>had</b> begun to <b>be</b> used by motorbikers and as a rubbish dump. Privately {{purchased}} in 1979, {{it is now a}} recognized 1914-1918 historic battlefield site.|$|R

5|$|Construction was of crossed wooden poles, {{driven into}} the {{waterlogged}} soil to support a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was used {{for a period of}} only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the British Museum and at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. A reconstruction has been made on which visitors can walk, on the same line as the original in Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Fiona Belli is an 18-year-old {{girl who}} {{recently}} moved to college. While visiting her parents, she {{is involved in a}} car accident, and awakens in a cage in the dungeon of a castle. Her memories of the incident are hazy. Noting that the cage that keeps her prisoner <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> unlocked, she steps out and begins searching for answers and {{a way out of the}} castle. Soon after, she befriends a White Shepherd named Hewie. As Fiona begins to unravel the mystery in which she finds herself, she learns that she is the carrier of the Azoth, an alchemic element, which for unknown reasons is being sought by Riccardo, the castle's keeper.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor the house is split into east and west bedchambers, linked across the central hall by a gallery. The east bedchamber is {{at the front of}} the house, and {{projects}} out into the street—this was a feature used to add space to houses, and is also seen in properties in Shrewsbury, Tewkesbury and York. Some of the makers' marks of the original builders can still be seen on the timbers in the room. The west bedchamber more closely resembles its 19th-century appearance rather than the medieval, as the Victorian-era ceiling <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> in place. The roof of the house is an identical replacement for the medieval original, tiled with Cornish slate.|$|E

Two peasants were engaged as guides and, in the afternoon, the corps started for their destination.|$|R
5|$|The Phra Thinang Siwalai Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งศิวาลัยมหาปราสาท) {{is located}} on the southern-eastern end of the Siwalai Garden. The Siwalai Maha Prasat is a Thai-style edifice with a Mondop style spire of seven tiers. Built during the reign of King Rama V in 1878 to house the metal statues of his four predecessors, which were cast in 1869. The hall was {{to be used as a}} royal pantheon, where the lives of {{previous}} monarchs were to be commemorated and worshiped. Later King Rama VI had the statues removed and rehoused at the Prasat Phra Thep Bidorn in the Temple of the Emerald Buddha compound, where they would be more assessable to the public. On 6 April 1918 the first ceremony of worship was inaugurated, this ceremony continues to be performed annually. Since the removal of the statues, the Siwalai Maha Prasat <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> vacant.|$|E
5|$|The Arkham Knight {{activates}} the Cloudburst, {{flooding the}} city with fear toxin. Batman destroys the Cloudburst and convinces Ivy to empower an ancient tree that can neutralize the toxin; she succeeds and saves Gotham, but the strain kills her, while Batman's exposure to the toxin strengthens Joker's control. Batman pursues the Arkham Knight to a construction site to rescue Gordon. The Knight reveals himself as Jason Todd, the previous Robin, who was seemingly murdered by the Joker, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> traumatized by torture at the Joker's hands. Todd blames Batman for abandoning him, and although Batman offers to help Todd recover, he escapes.

5|$|Wizards & Warriors III: Kuros: Visions of Power {{takes place}} {{immediately}} after the events {{at the end of}} the previous game, , when Kuros has defeated his nemesis, the evil wizard Malkil, on the peak of IceFire Mountain. Unaware that Malkil's spirit has survived, Kuros is struck by a bolt of magic from the spirit, knocking him out and removing his armor, memory, and honor. A weakened Malkil then flees and takes refuge in the peaceful city of Piedup, where he dethrones Good King James and takes control of the city. Meanwhile, Kuros <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> to wander in the wilderness without any weapons, armor, or food. After wandering for several months, he finally reaches the city of Piedup, where Malkil's spirit lies.

25|$|Two {{things must}} be noted about the locative case and its limited nature. First, it only exists as a case for masculines and neuters, {{which is why the}} {{corresponding}} feminine cell <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> blanked out. Rather, for marked feminine and unmarked nouns the locative is a postposition, which are explained on later in the article. Second, there is no distinction of gender.|$|E
