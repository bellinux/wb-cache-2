25|$|The World War II era {{also brought}} on rising {{production}} costs {{that resulted in}} a reduced number of elaborate gags and outdoor sequences, Del Lord's stock in trade; as such, the quality of the team's films (particularly those directed by Lord) began to slip after 1942. According to Okuda and Watz, entries such as Loco Boy Makes Good, What's the Matador?, Sock-A-Bye Baby (all 1942), I Can <b>Hardly</b> <b>Wait</b> and A Gem of a Jam (both 1943) are considered to be lesser quality works than previous films. Spook Louder (1943), a remake of Mack Sennett's The Great Pie Mystery (1931), is often cited as the Stooges' worst film because of its repetitious and rehashed jokes. Three Smart Saps (1942), a film considered to be an improvement, features a reworking of a routine from Harold Lloyd's The Freshman (1925), in which Curly's loosely basted suit begins to come apart at the seams while he is on the dance floor.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Chris Nelson of MTV News wrote, [...] ""Dammit"'s staccato {{rhythm and}} melancholy pop-spirit call to mind Chicago punks Screeching Weasel {{as much as}} they do the {{emotional}} fretting of the Descendents." [...] Scott Heisel of Alternative Press called [...] "Dammit" [...] the [...] "perfect punk song, everyone knows it, and it's probably being covered in someone's basement right now." [...] Consequence of Sound, in a 2015 top 10 of Blink-182's best songs, ranked [...] "Dammit" [...] at number one, commenting, [...] "The best songwriters don't capture what you're going through individually in your life – they capture the things that are common to all humanity, and there's something about [...] "Dammit"'s chorus, something about its opening C, D, E riff that sounds universal." [...] Complex in 2012 examined the song through the lens of its inclusion in Can't <b>Hardly</b> <b>Wait</b> (1998), calling it, [...] "one of the most iconic songs of the 90s – those three, unmistakable guitar chords, the two voices trading in verse (one sneering punk, the other, a throaty few octaves lower), and a soaring punk chorus." [...] At Billboard, it is described as a [...] "jump-around pop punk song".|$|E

500|$|... "Dumpweed" [...] {{kicks off}} the record, and explores sexual frustration. The song is based around the hook [...] "I need a girl that I can train," [...] as in dog training. DeLonge, the song's {{primarily}} lyricist, explains {{the song in}} a 2000 tour booklet: [...] "Girls are so much smarter than guys and can see the future as well as never forget the past. So that leaves the dog as the only thing men are smarter than." [...] The song is a [...] "callow complaint about girls not always doing exactly what you wish they would," [...] and is followed by Hoppus' [...] "Don't Leave Me," [...] a song about a breakup, in irony. Hoppus wrote the song in ten minutes. The guitar swell preceding the second chorus is actually a digital reversal of the delaying guitar preceding it. [...] "Aliens Exist" [...] originates from DeLonge's interest in UFOs and conspiracy theories. [...] "Going Away to College" [...] was written in ten minutes by Hoppus while at home sick on Valentine's Day 1999. While watching the movie Can't <b>Hardly</b> <b>Wait,</b> Hoppus {{began to think about}} [...] "how much it sucks when people are in love in high school" [...] and are forced to be separated after graduation by different colleges in different cities. Since it was recorded late in production, the band {{had to go back to}} Los Angeles to record Barker's drum track.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins at}} a formal party in which Spears {{seems to be}} looking for someone. The opening shot of her was {{inspired}} by the scene of Jennifer Love Hewitt walking into the party in Can't <b>Hardly</b> <b>Wait</b> (1998). Her boyfriend (Bradshaw) talks with two people next to her. He persuades her to smile to avoid embarrassment from the guests then verbally abuses her and grabs her face, after which she leaves to the restroom, where she wipes away a tear and puts on her fragrance Radiance. She comes back to the party and catches her boyfriend flirting with another woman; Spears tells her [...] "So you're not working the street corner tonight I see?", making her boyfriend angry. He apologizes to the other woman for his girlfriend's remark then grabs Spears by the arm and carries her outside the building. After he slaps her, one of the waiters of the party (Trawick) wearing a leather jacket punches her boyfriend several times. The waiter asks Spears if she is okay, and after she kicks her boyfriend in the crotch goodbye, she replies [...] "Now I'm okay." [...] She and the waiter climb on his motorcycle and leave the scene. When they get to his house, it is revealed by a newspaper that he is a criminal. She opens one of the lockers in his house and finds a gun, after which the couple kisses. This is followed by scenes of them having sex.|$|E
500|$|Their debut album, Your Body Above Me, co-produced by David Bianco and the band, was {{released}} on October 21, 1997 in the United States. Two singles from the album charted in the U.S., the power ballad [...] "Time Ago" [...] and the alternative rock hit [...] "Wash It Away"; the album also featured the PJ Harvey-penned [...] "All the Money in the World". The LP peaked on Billboard's Heatseekers charts at No.19 in 1998, and sales of the album eventually topped 120,000. Reviews of Your Body Above Me noted the album's dark, melodic modern rock sound, and were mixed but generally positive. The Washington Post called Your Body Above Me [...] "moodily sumptuous", Guitar Player described the music as having [...] "drama and rhythmic urgency", and Allmusic noted the album's [...] "brooding yet propulsive sound that's actually quite intriguing". The band subsequently toured with Days of the New, Cracker, and Our Lady Peace, and were called [...] "The American U2" [...] by the San Francisco Chronicle. Black Lab songs were featured on soundtracks to Can't <b>Hardly</b> <b>Wait,</b> Varsity Blues, Permanent Midnight, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and the song [...] "Wash It Away" [...] was also included on a charity album, Live in the X Lounge. Just as momentum was building on their debut, however, Geffen {{went out of business}} after being subsumed by Universal; dissatisfied with the new label arrangement, Durham moved to Los Angeles, and the band broke up in 1999.|$|E

Richard did have reservations about the lyrics, however, which he found a little too suggestive. After changing [...] "I can <b>hardly</b> <b>wait</b> to sleep with you again" [...] to [...] "I can <b>hardly</b> <b>wait</b> to be with you again," [...] he recorded Karen singing the song, reading the revised lyrics from a napkin. What wound up on the finished recording was the first time Karen had ever sung [...] "Superstar".

2500|$|Johnie's Broiler (originally Harvey's Broiler) was a {{drive-in}} restaurant and coffee shop, {{which has been}} in movies and sitcoms as well as TV commercials and music videos. Completed in 1958, it is an example of Googie architecture. Johnie's was well known to Southern California locals, many of which drove miles to cruise through its massive lot. In the mid-1960s, renowned author Tom Wolfe immortalized the cruising, car and fashion scene that surrounded Harvey's Broiler at the time; The article, [...] "The Hair Boys," [...] appears in a bestselling 1968 collection of his articles titled, The Pump House Gang. He made drawings of the denizens of Harvey's that appear in a later book, The Purple Decades. The Broiler was a regular commercial and movie location for films such as Heat, What's Love Got to Do with It, Unstrung Heroes, Reality Bites, Can't <b>Hardly</b> <b>Wait,</b> Jawbreaker, as well as a television episode of The X-Files and [...] Mad Men.

2500|$|... "Superstar", {{written by}} Bonnie Bramlett and Leon Russell, became the duo's next hit.

Karen {{was familiar with}} the album, but Richard first heard the song when it was covered by Bette Midler on The Tonight Show, and realised its potential as a Carpenters hit. The duo changed the line [...] "I can <b>hardly</b> <b>wait</b> to sleep with you again" [...] to [...] "... to be with you again", as they knew the former would not be played on Top 40 radio. The single sold a million copies, attaining gold status, and became the Carpenters' third No.2 single on the Billboard Hot 100 (this time held off the top spot by Rod Stewart's [...] "Maggie May" [...] / [...] "Reason to Believe"). On May 14, 1971, the Carpenters performed a sell-out show at Carnegie Hall, and they released their third album, Carpenters the same day. It became one of their best sellers, earning RIAA certification for platinum four times, and rising to No. 2 on Billboards pop album chart for two weeks (behind Carole King's Tapestry) with over a million pre-sales orders. The album won a Grammy Award, as well as receiving three nominations. Shortly after this, the duo recorded a short television series, Make Your Own Kind of Music, which drew mixed reviews.|$|E

Lost alum Jorge Garcia recurs as Anton the Giant, referenced from Jack and the Beanstalk. Garcia was originally scheduled to appear in only one episode, but his character was later expanded. Actor Raphael Sbarge, who portrays Jiminy Cricket, was made part of the recurring guest cast this season, as opposed to being included in the first season's main cast.
