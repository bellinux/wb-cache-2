40|$|We {{develop a}} large scale quantum master {{equation}} approach to describe dynamical processes of practical open quantum systems driven by both coherent and stochastic interactions by including more than one thousand true states of the systems, motivated {{by the development of}} highly bright and fully coherent lasers in the X-ray wavelength regime. The method combines the processes of coherent dynamics induced by the X-ray laser and incoherent relaxations due to spontaneous emissions, Auger decays, and electronic collisions. As examples, theoretical investigation of real coherent dynamics of <b>inner-shell</b> <b>electrons</b> of a neon gas, irradiated by a high-intensity X-ray laser with a full temporal coherence, is carried out with the approach. In contrast to the rate equation treatment, we find that coherence can suppress the multiphoton absorptions of a neon gas in the ultra-intense X-ray pulse, due to coherence-induced Rabi oscillations and power broadening effects. We study the influence of coherence on ionization processes of neon, and directly prove that sequential single-photon processes for both outer- and <b>inner-shell</b> <b>electrons</b> dominate the ionizations for the recently typical experiments with a laser intensity of ≈ 10 ^ 18 W/cm^ 2. We discuss possible experimental implementations such as signatures for coherent evolution of <b>inner-shell</b> <b>electrons</b> via resonance fluorescence processes. The approach can also be applied to many different practical open quantum systems in atomic, quantum optical, and cold matter systems, which are treated qualitatively by a few-level master equation model before.

50|$|As one {{progresses}} down a {{group on}} the periodic table, the ionization energy will likely decrease since the valence electrons are {{farther away from the}} nucleus and experience a weaker attraction to the nucleus's positive charge. There will be an increase of ionization energy from left to right of a given period and a decrease from top to bottom. As a rule, it requires far less energy to remove an outer-shell electron than an <b>inner-shell</b> <b>electron.</b> As a result, the ionization energies for a given element will increase steadily within a given shell, and when starting on the next shell down will show a drastic jump in ionization energy. Simply put, the lower the principal quantum number, the higher the ionization energy for the electrons within that shell. The exceptions are the elements in the boron and oxygen family, which require slightly less energy than the general trend.|$|E
50|$|In {{electron}} energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) a material {{is exposed to}} a beam of electrons with a known, narrow range of kinetic energies. Some of the electrons will undergo inelastic scattering, {{which means that they}} lose energy and have their paths slightly and randomly deflected. The amount of energy loss can be measured via an electron spectrometer and interpreted in terms of what caused the energy loss. Inelastic interactions include phonon excitations, inter- and intra-band transitions, plasmon excitations, inner shell ionizations, and Cherenkov radiation. The inner-shell ionizations are particularly useful for detecting the elemental components of a material. For example, one might find that a larger-than-expected number of electrons comes through the material with 285 eV less energy than they had when they entered the material. This is approximately the amount of energy needed to remove an <b>inner-shell</b> <b>electron</b> from a carbon atom, which can be taken as evidence that there is a significant amount of carbon present in the sample. With some care, and looking at a wide range of energy losses, one can determine the types of atoms, and the numbers of atoms of each type, being struck by the beam. The scattering angle (that is, the amount that the electron's path is deflected) can also be measured, giving information about the dispersion relation of whatever material excitation caused the inelastic scattering.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} spectral {{model has}} been developed for the computer simulation of the 2 p {yields} 1 s K{alpha} X-ray emission from highly charged Fe ions in the Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT). The spectral features of interest occur {{in the range from}} 1. 84 {angstrom} to 1. 94 {angstrom}. The fundamental radiative emission processes associated with radiationless electron capture or dielectronic recombination, <b>inner-shell</b> <b>electron</b> collisional excitation, and <b>inner-shell</b> <b>electron</b> collisional ionization are taken in account. For comparison, spectral observations and simulations for high-temperature magnetic-fusion (Tokamak) plasmas are reviewed. In these plasmas, small departures from steady-state corona-model charge-state distributions can occur due to ion transport processes, while the assumption of equilibrium (Maxwellian) electron energy distributions is expected to be valid. Our investigations for EBIT have been directed at the identification of spectral features that can serve as diagnostics of extreme non-equilibrium or transient-ionization conditions, and allowance has been made for general (non-Maxwellian) electron energy distributions. For the precise interpretation of the high-resolution X-ray observations, which may involve the analysis of blended spectral features composed of many lines, it has been necessary {{to take into account the}} multitude of individual fine-structure components of the K{alpha} radiative transitions in the ions from Fe XVIII to Fe XXV. At electron densities higher than the validity range of the corona-model approximation, collisionally induced transitions among low-lying excited states can play an important role. It is found that <b>inner-shell</b> <b>electron</b> excitation and ionization processes involving the complex intermediate ions from Fe XVIII to Fe XXI produce spectral features, in the wavelength range from 1. 89 {angstrom} to 1. 94 {angstrom}, which are particularly sensitive to density variations and transient ionization conditions...|$|E

40|$|Photoionisation of an atom by X-rays usually removes an <b>inner-shell</b> <b>electron</b> {{from the}} atom, {{leaving behind a}} perturbed "hollow ion" whose {{relaxation}} may take different routes. In light elements, emission of an Auger electron is common. However, the energy and {{the total number of}} electrons released from the atom may be modulated by shake-up and shake-off effects. When the <b>inner-shell</b> <b>electron</b> leaves, the outer-shell electrons may find themselves in a state that is not an eigen-state of the atom in its surroundings. The resulting collective excitation is called shake-up. If this process also involves the release of low energy electrons from the outer shell, then the process is called shake-off. It is not clear how significant shake-up and shake-off contributions are to the overall ionisation of biological materials like proteins. In particular, the interaction between the out-going electron and the remaining system depends on the chemical environment of the atom, which can be studied by quantum chemical methods. Here we present calculations on model compounds to represent the most common chemical environments in proteins. The results show that the shake-up and shake-off processes affect about 20 % of all emissions from nitrogen, 30 % from carbon, 40 % from oxygen, and 23 % from sulphur. Triple and higher ionisations are rare for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, but are frequent for sulphur.
