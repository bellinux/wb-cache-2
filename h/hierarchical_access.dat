50|$|A {{simple but}} {{constrained}} {{solution is to}} include a time attribute. This solution would require each message to be encrypted with a modiﬁed access tree T0, which is constructed by augmenting the original access tree T with an additional time attribute. The time attribute, ζ represents the current ‘time period’. Formally, the new access structure T0 is as follows: T0 = (T AND ζ). For example, ζ can be the ‘date’ attribute whose value changes once every day. It is assumed that each non-revoked user receives his fresh private keys corresponding to the ‘date’ attribute once everyday directly from the mobile key server MKS (which is the central authority) or via the regional delegates. With a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>access</b> structure, the key delegation property of CP-ABE can be exploited to reduce the dependency on the central authority for issuing the new private keys to all users every time interval. There are signiﬁcant trade-oﬀs between the extra load incurred by the authority for generating and communicating the new keys to the users {{and the amount of}} time that can elapse before a revoked user can be eﬀectively purged. This above solution has the following problems: a) Each user X needs to periodically receive from the central authority the fresh private key corresponding to the time attribute, otherwise X will not be able to decrypt any message.b) It is a lazy revocation technique the revoked user is not purged from the system until the current time period expires.c) This scheme requires an implicit time synchronization (a loose time synchronization may be suﬃcient) among the authority and the users.|$|E

Several constructions of ideal hierarchical secret sharing schemes have been proposed, but it was not known what access structures admit such a scheme. We solve this problem by providing a natural definition for the family of the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>access</b> structures and, more importantly, by presenting a complete characterization of the ideal <b>hierarchical</b> <b>access</b> structures, that is, the ones admitting an ideal secret sharing scheme. Our characterization deals with the properties of the hierarchically minimal sets of the access structure, which are the minimal qualified sets whose participants are in the lowest possible levels in the hierarchy. By using our characterization, it can be efficiently checked whether any given <b>hierarchical</b> <b>access</b> structure that is defined by its hierarchically minimal sets is ideal. We use the well known connection between ideal secret sharing and matroids and, in particular, the fact that every ideal access structure is a matroid port. In addition, we use recent results on ideal multipartite access structures and the connection between multipartite matroids and integer polymatroids. We prove that every ideal <b>hierarchical</b> <b>access</b> structure is the port of a representable matroid and, more specifically, we prove that every ideal structure in this family admits ideal linear secret sharing schemes over fields of all characteristics.

Many applications that require SGC are now widely practiced, such as teleconferencing, tele-medicine, real-time information services, distributed interactive simulations, collaborative work and the deployment of VPN (Virtual Private Network). ^ We investigate burst behavior in secure group communications and propose two efficient schemes to deal with burst operations. <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>access</b> control is a general and important problem in distributed computing environments and a particular problem in secure group communications.

Physical constraints on minimum device size and maximum signal speed imply that, for a memory laid out in d dimensions, a(&khgr;) = &OHgr;(&khgr; 1 /d).
