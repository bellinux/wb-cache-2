40|$|For a {{short period}} of time, between the end of the 19 th century and the middle of the 20 th, {{newspapers}} and journalists were under the spotlight as never before. However, the comprehensive reviews of the theories of the press do not acknowledge the thought of this period and its development into “the social theories of the press” (H. Hardt, 1979). This article is positioned in this <b>gap</b> of <b>press</b> studies, and it uses as a starting point the foucaultian description of the diﬀ erent thresholds that establish the levels of discourse elaboration (Foucault, 1995). It aims at exploring the theoretical production that approximates German and American scholars such as Albert Schäffle (1831 - 1903); Karl Knies (1821 - 1898); Karl Bücher (1847 - 1930); Ferdinand Tönnies (1835 - 1936); Albion Small (1854 - 1926); Edward Ross (1856 - 1951); Max Weber (1864 - 1920); Robert Park (1864 - 1944) and Walter Lippmann (1889 - 1974), rescuing this production from the pre-history of the press to materialize evidence that this production coincides, in its external origin, with the modern newspaper practices, although {{there seemed to be no}} dependence between them at the time...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays dry {{granulation}} of powders {{has become a}} very important research topic {{because it is the}} most economic way of granulation, making the particle handling easier, and avoiding the loss of material during particle processing, or particle transfers. This kind of process has been deeply studied but a better knowledge appears necessary to control the great number of parameters of the process. This is particularly important in cases where the nature of the powder may lead to very complex phenomena during compaction. In order to try and optimise {{dry granulation}} process for organic compounds, a roll press has been designed with a series of instruments enabling to control the compaction process. The apparatus consists of three parts: a vertical container with rotating steel blades avoiding arches into which the powder is poured, a feeder transferring the powder towards the rolls; the feeder is equipped with an horizontal helical screw in a cylindrical draft tube (10 mm in internal diameter, 500 mm long) and in the end of the feeder, a junction allows the change from the cylindrical symmetry of the feeder to the prismatic symmetry existing in the roll <b>gap.</b> The roll <b>press</b> (0 - 500 kN, load per unit length 0 - 10 exp 4 kNm- 1) has been developed to record different major classical parameters: the roll speed, the roll <b>gap,</b> the <b>press</b> strength, the rotation angle, and the feeding rate (between 0 and 20 gs- 1). In comparison with different kinds of roll press described in the literature, in this work an original instrumentation system has been developed to catch specific data. The 3 D-pressure distribution profiles at the interface between powder and the roll wall and the drive torque applied to the rolls were measured. A large-sized smooth steel-made roll (240 mm diameter, 50 mm width) has been chosen to compare the results to the industrial scale. The results obtained with an organic compound exhibited the dependence [...] sometimes unexpected [...] of the rotation angle, the feeding and the rotation speed on the pressure distribution, the roll width, and the drive torque...|$|R
40|$|The <b>gap</b> {{between the}} <b>press</b> and civic {{society has been}} a {{paramount}} concern for media research on Latin America. Press systems {{in the region have}} been historically dominated by states and markets. During the past decades, two “media movements” have emerged to strengthen the linkages between the press and civic society: one set of efforts have promoted reforms in media policies, and the other one developed alternative media independently from governments and markets. This chapter examines the rise of “civic media advocacy” as a third “media movement” in the region. Civic media advocacy aims to change news coverage of civic and social problems in the mainstream press. The analysis examines its strategies and political underpinnings and discusses its achievements and limitations. The experience of civic media advocacy in contemporary Latin America offers insights into whether and how civic society can effectively transform journalis...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{analytical}} description of temperature "elds and heat #uxes in thermoacoustic devices (such as refrigerators and prime-movers) is discussed. It is demonstrated {{that for the}} precise analysis of the thermoacoustic process near {{the edges of the}} stacks and the heat exchangers, and also for the prediction of the heat #uxes between the stack and the heat exchangers, it is necessary to avoid the traditional &&mean-"eld’’ approximation. In other words, on the spatial scale of the order of a particle displacement in the standing acoustic wave, hydrodynamical (advective) transport of heat cannot be described as a di!usional transport with an e!ective (depending on the acoustic wave power) di!usivity. In order to get insight into the non-linear phenomena, related to axial (along the stack) advective transport of heat, the simpli"ed description of the transverse heat exchange between the gas and the stack (the relaxation-time approximation) has been adopted in the present investigation. The analytical descriptions obtained of the temperature distribution and of the heat #ux predict, in particular, that in some cases the thermoacoustic heat #ux between two stacks separated by an adiabatic gap can increase with the increasing width of the <b>gap.</b> (2000 Academic <b>Press</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|After {{completion}} of the studies using the PressterTM {{it can be concluded}} that comparative results between PressterTM and rotary tablet presses can be achieved if the compression parameters are correctly set up. Firstly manufacturing of tablets with the same mass is important for the comparison. In addition the studies revealed that tablets need to have the same thickness because otherwise they were differently densified. Thickness is often specified for packaging of tablets being an important parameter for this reason. To achieve the same thickness the same band height needs to be set up on both tableting machines. The PressterTM offers the possibility to measure punch displacement to find out the actual punch <b>gap.</b> If tablet <b>presses</b> are not instrumented only the out-of-die thickness can be measured and the band height can be adjusted accordingly. The set up of two presses to the same compression force is not reliable because the compression force {{is a result of the}} tablet mass and the punch gap and therefore only an indirect parameter. Calibration of the strain gages is complicated and subject to failures e. g. with temperature changes. Recalibration of the PressterTM strain gages using Pfizer Freiburg calibration equipment revealed excellent results. When the experiments were performed using the same resulting compression force, the band height set up on PressterTM partly deviated significantly from the band height set up on a rotary tablet press, leading to differently densified tablets. If materials are compressed to the same thickness different compression forces are produced depending on material and/or batch variability. Thus the height of compression force indicates material properties and compression force variability points out differences in material properties. The experiments of this study confirm that precompression of the tablets is very important regarding the tablet properties. This is even more important if materials show a high tendency to elastic relaxation in order to prevent capping. PressterTM offers the instrumented die as a very useful tool to measure the radial die wall pressure. The mainly directly compressible formulations tested in this study were robust and compressible on PressterTM and rotary tablet presses without any issues. Only at extreme conditions: short dwell time, high main compression force and no precompression force capping occurred with a 90...|$|R
