25|$|Biological invasions and {{the spread}} of {{pathogens}} and diseases are two mechanisms that spread both inadvertently and purposefully. Biological invasions begin with introductions of foreign species or biota into an already <b>existing</b> <b>environment.</b> They can be spread by stowaways on ships or even as weapons in warfare. In some cases a new species may wreak havoc on a landscape, causing the loss of native species and destruction of the landscape. In other cases, the new species may fill a previously empty niche, and play a positive role. The spread of new pathogens, viruses, and diseases rarely have any positive effects; new pathogens and viruses sometimes destroy populations lacking immunities to those diseases. Some pathogens have the ability to transfer from one species to another, and may be spread as a secondary effect of a biological invasion.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} loci in a {{vertebrate}} species {{has been estimated}} at about 40,000. 'Good' species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci, even if the differences at {{most of them are}} very slight. But it takes as many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one. If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the mean rate of gene substitution, as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000 generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a good deal more, for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in the <b>existing</b> <b>environment</b> and the residual environment.|$|E

25|$|A {{key issue}} {{that remains is}} the lack of female {{representation}} in management. Of all legislators, senior officials and management, females are found in only 9% of the positions. This disparity has contributed to the larger overall gender wage gap of females earning only 66.5% of male earnings in 2002. Prevalent social opinions suggest that this disparity is {{due to the lack of}} commit of Japanese women to their jobs due to their perspectives regarding marriage, family, and children. While the government had imposed the Equal Opportunity Law, companies responded by creating a ‘double-track management system’ (DPM), where a career track allows for promotions but requires transfers, and a non-career track that does not require transfers but has low chances of promotion. Previously, employers often maintained a core workforce mainly consisting of male employees which was expected to work at head office and be transferred around the world, and a peripheral workforce of female employees working at local branches with restricted career advancement. However, uptake by females of the career track is extremely low at less than 4% in all industries. Given the strong internal labour market of Japanese companies which stipulates that senior positions are only given to those in the career track and not from sources external to the company, this has contributed to the low proportion of female managers. This DPM system is also prevalent, especially among larger firms, with 51.2% of firms with more than 5,000 employees using the system. Gendered divisions exist in the workplace and are replicated by both male and female workers. Although both genders may be allocated to the same section, males were often trained and allocated towards management jobs. As a result, female workers often were not in or chose not to be in management jobs due to lack of training, experience, and opportunity. In addition, more than half of surveyed companies indicated that they were attempting to eradicate instances of sexual harassment and discriminatory practices by males towards female workers, indicating an <b>existing</b> <b>environment</b> of a male-dominated workplace.|$|E

40|$|Parallel data {{warehouses}} {{have mostly}} {{been seen as}} dedicated decision support systems, but {{as the need for}} cost effective multi-application business solutions grows, non-dedication and adaptation to <b>existing</b> <b>environments</b> become evermore tempting.

Therefore it is critical to distribute a data warehouse’s information {{in such a way that}} no node be overloaded or underestimated. This paper presents the Capacity Evaluator (CE), an application capable of measuring the system’s ability to process information, which in turn helps the Data Warehouse Parallel Architecture’s (DWPA) automatic data placer determine exactly how much data should be allocated to each node. 1...|$|R

50|$|In a {{development}} environment with multiple languages, navigation {{is much more}} difficult. <b>Existing</b> <b>environments</b> are not geared to parsing and representing DSL models as abstract syntax trees for arbitrary and perhaps even application-specific languages such as the languages from the previous example. Furthermore without this internal representation, <b>existing</b> <b>environments</b> cannot resolve neither intra- nor inter-language references for such languages and hence cannot provide useful navigation. This means that developers must maintain a conceptual model of how the parts of their system are related. New tools with navigation facilities geared to multiple languages would {{on the other hand}} be very helpful in understanding the relations between languages. In terms of the create survey example such tools should display the relations between the three languages by using the soft references as navigation points.|$|R
