5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N <b>from</b> <b>English</b> 'on', and A-P-T <b>from</b> <b>English</b> 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.|$|E

5|$|English has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the vocabulary of other languages. The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and {{the large number of}} books and films that are translated <b>from</b> <b>English</b> into other languages. That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed <b>from</b> <b>English</b> mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.|$|E
