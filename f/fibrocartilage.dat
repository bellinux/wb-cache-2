5|$|In 1946, Magnusson {{established}} {{the use of}} stem cells from bone marrow with the first surgical debridement of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into <b>fibrocartilage</b> and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline cartilage and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this {{can be attributed to}} the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the <b>fibrocartilage.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative <b>fibrocartilage,</b> new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveDespite {{the female}} predilection for joint diseases, and the known effects of female hormones in {{regulating}} chondrocyte function, the various female hormone receptor subtypes in joints {{are not well}} characterized, and comparisons in receptor profiles between joints and genders are lacking. This investigation characterized and compared the relative levels of estrogen receptors (ER) -α and -β, relaxin receptors LGR 7 and LGR 8, and progesterone receptor (PR) in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc, knee meniscus (KM) and pubic symphysis <b>fibrocartilages.</b> MethodsFibrocartilaginous cells from 12 -week-old mice were maintained in serum-containing α-modified Eagle's medium (MEM) until confluence. Total RNA and cell lysates were assayed by RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry and Western blots, and joint sections subjected to immunohistochemistry. ResultsAll hormone receptors assayed {{were present in the}} three joints, but showed substantial differences in expression levels between joints. TMJ cells had higher ER-α (> 2. 8 -fold), ER-β (> 2. 2 -fold), LGR 7 (> 3 -fold) and PR (> 1. 8 -fold), and lower LGR 8 (0. 5 -fold) gene expression levels than KM cells. The ratio of ER-α:ER-β and LGR 7 :LGR 8 was 1. 8 - and 7. 5 -fold higher, respectively, in TMJ than in KM cells. The profile of hormone receptors in the TMJ disc was similar to those in the pubic symphysis. Immunochemistry confirmed the differential expression patterns of these receptors in the three tissues. The TMJ cells demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the levels of both ER isoforms, but not of LGR 7, LGR 8 or PR. ConclusionsThe findings suggest that these <b>fibrocartilages</b> are putative target tissues for actions of female hormones. The differential expression profiles of the hormone receptors in the three joint <b>fibrocartilages</b> and the sexual dimorphism in ERs in TMJ disc cells are likely to result in varied downstream effects in response to hormones within these fibrocartilaginous tissues...|$|R

Chondrocalcinosis is very frequent in the elderly asymptomatic population, reaching possibly 45 % of the population aged 85  years old or above [21, 23]. It is seen most frequently in the knee, followed by the wrist, pubic symphysis and the hip [21].

Based on a cartilage explant study showing greater tensile properties after chondroitinase ABC (C-ABC) treatment, C-ABC {{as a strategy}} for cartilage tissue engineering was investigated. A scaffold-less approach was employed, wherein chondrocytes were seeded into non-adherent agarose molds. C-ABC was used to deplete GAG from constructs 2 weeks after initiating culture, followed by 2 weeks culture post-treatment. Staining for GAG and type I, II, and VI collagen and transmission electron microscopy were performed. Additionally, quantitative total collagen, type I and II collagen, and sulfated GAG content were measured, and compressive and tensile mechanical properties were evaluated. At 4 wks, C-ABC treated construct ultimate tensile strength and tensile modulus increased 121 % and 80 % compared to untreated controls, reaching 0. 5 and 1. 3 MPa, respectively. These increases were accompanied by increased type II collagen concentration, without type I collagen. As GAG returned, compressive stiffness of C-ABC treated constructs recovered to be greater than 2 wk controls. C-ABC represents a novel method for engineering functional articular cartilage by departing from conventional anabolic approaches.

40|$|The knee meniscus, {{intervertebral}} disc, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc all possess complex {{geometric shapes}} and anisotropic matrix organization. While these characteristics are imperative for proper tissue function, they are seldom recapitulated following injury or disease. Thus, this study's {{objective was to}} engineer <b>fibrocartilages</b> that capture both gross and molecular structural features of native tissues. Self-assembled TMJ discs were selected as the model system, as the disc exhibits a unique biconcave shape and functional anisotropy. To drive anisotropy, 50 : 50 co-cultures of meniscus cells and articular chondrocytes were grown in biconcave, TMJ-shaped molds and treated with two exogenous stimuli: biomechanical (BM) stimulation via passive axial compression and bioactive agent (BA) stimulation via chondroitinase-ABC and transforming growth factor-β 1. BM+BA synergistically increased Col/WW, Young's modulus, and ultimate tensile strength 5. 8 -fold, 14. 7 -fold, and 13. 8 -fold that of controls, respectively; it also promoted collagen fibril alignment akin to native tissue. Finite element analysis found BM stimulation to create direction-dependent strains within the neotissue, suggesting shape plays an essential role toward driving invitro anisotropic neotissue development.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo compare {{temporomandibular}} joint (TMJ) condylar cartilage {{cells in}} vitro to hyaline cartilage cells cultured in a three-dimensional (3 D) environment for tissue engineering of mandibular condylar cartilage. DesignMandibular condylar cartilage and hyaline cartilage cells were harvested from pigs and cultured for 6 weeks in polyglycolic acid (PGA) scaffolds. Both types of cells {{were treated with}} glucosamine sulfate (0. 4 mM), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (100 ng/ml) and their combination. At weeks 0 and 6, cell number, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen content were determined, types I and II collagen were visualized by immunohistochemistry and GAGs were visualized by histology. ResultsHyaline cartilage cells produced from half an order to a full order of magnitude more GAGs and collagen than mandibular condylar cartilage cells in 3 D culture. IGF-I was a highly effective signal for biosynthesis with hyaline cartilage cells, while glucosamine sulfate decreased cell proliferation and biosynthesis with both types of cells. In vitro culture of TMJ condylar cartilage cells produced a fibrous tissue with predominantly type I collagen, while hyaline cartilage cells formed a fibrocartilage-like tissue with types I and II collagen. The combination of IGF and glucosamine had a synergistic effect on maintaining the phenotype of TMJ condylar cells to generate both types I and II collagen. ConclusionGiven the superior biosynthetic activity by hyaline cartilage cells and the practical surgical limitations of harvesting cells from the TMJ of a patient requiring TMJ reconstruction, cartilage cells from elsewhere in the body may be a potentially better alternative to cells harvested from the TMJ for TMJ tissue engineering. This finding may also apply to other <b>fibrocartilages</b> such as the intervertebral disc and knee meniscus in applications where a mature cartilage cell source is desired...|$|R
40|$|The menisci {{and their}} insertions into bone (entheses) {{represent}} a functional unit. Thanks to their firm entheses, the menisci {{are able to}} distribute loads and therefore reduce the stresses on the tibia, a function which is regarded essential for cartilage protection and prevention of osteoarthrosis. The tissue of the hypocellular meniscal body consists mainly of water and a dense elaborate type I collagen network with a predominantly circumferential alignment. The content of different collagens, proteoglycans and nonproteoglycan proteins shows significant regional variations probably reflecting functional adaptation. The meniscal horns are attached via meniscal insertional ligaments mainly to tibial bone. At the enthesis, the fibres of the insertional ligaments attach to bone via uncalcified and calcified <b>fibrocartilages.</b> This anatomical configuration of gradual transition from soft to hard tissue, which is identical to other ligament entheses, is certainly essential for normal mechanical function and probably protects this vulnerable transition between 2 biomechanically different tissues from failure. Clinical treatment of meniscal tears needs {{to be based on}} these special anatomical and functional characteristics. Partial meniscectomy will preserve some of the load distribution function of the meniscus only when the meniscal body enthesis entity is preserved. Repair of peripheral longitudinal tears will heal and probably preserve the load distribution function of the meniscus, whereas radial tears through the whole meniscal periphery or more central and complex tears may be induced to heal, but probably do not preserve the load distribution function. There is no proof that replacement of the meniscus with an allograft can reestablish some of the important meniscal functions, and thereby prevent or reduce the development of osteoarthrosis which is common after meniscectomy. After implantation, major problems are the remodelling of the graft to inferior structural, biochemical and mechanical properties and its insufficient fixation to bone which fails to duplicate a normal anatomical configuration and therefore a functional meniscal enthesis...|$|R
40|$|Injuries to {{avascular}} {{regions of}} menisci do not heal {{and result in}} significant discomfort to patients. Current treatments, such as partial meniscectomy, alleviate the symptoms, but lead to premature osteoarthritis due to reduced stability and changes in knee biomechanics. An alternative treatment {{to overcome these problems}} involves functional tissue engineering. This thesis examined several exogenous factors to enhance the capability of meniscus cells (MCs) to synthesize relevant ECM markers and improve the functionality of constructs in vitro. First, the effect of passage on the phenotype of MCs in monolayer was investigated, and rapid changes were observed in collagen I, collagen II, and COMP expression. Collagen I and aggrecan protein coatings assisted in reversing expression levels of certain ECM markers; however, collagen II expression could not be reversed. Next, 3 D tissue engineering studies were conducted using a cell-scaffold approach with MCs seeded on PLLA meshes. Anabolic stimuli that aided in meniscus regeneration included (1) hypoxia and bFGF, which resulted in synergistic increases in the total glycosaminoglycan content and compressive properties of constructs; (2) 10 MPa static hydrostatic pressure (HP), which resulted in increases in collagen content and the relaxation modulus of constructs; and (3) 10 MPa static HP and TGF-beta 1, which resulted in additive increases in collagen content, and synergistic increases in the compressive moduli of constructs. Finally, a self-assembly, scaffoldless approach was employed for meniscus regeneration using co-cultures of MCs and articular chondrocytes (ACs). A high density of cells were seeded on non-adherent agarose molds and allowed to coalesce into a construct without a scaffold. Different co-culture ratios of MCs and ACs resulted in a spectrum of <b>fibrocartilages</b> that recapitulated some biochemical and biomechanical properties of the rabbit meniscus. Cell culturing conditions were optimized with the identification of a smooth 1 % agarose mold that resulted in geometrically-mimetic meniscus constructs. In conclusion, this thesis quantified phenotypic changes in MCs over passage, and used scaffold-based and scaffoldless approaches to regenerate constructs with biochemical and biomechanical properties in the range of native tissue values. Successful replacement of a damaged meniscus will improve the quality of patient life and reduce the risk of osteoarthritis...|$|R
