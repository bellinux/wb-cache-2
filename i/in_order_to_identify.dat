Without fulfilling these factors, a region of the galaxy cannot create or sustain life with efficiency.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} before its release, a number of texts {{purporting}} to be genuine leaks appeared in various forms. On 16 July, a set of photographs representing all 759 pages of the U.S. edition was leaked and was fully transcribed prior to the official release date. The photographs later appeared on websites and peer-to-peer networks, leading Scholastic to seek a subpoena <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> one source. This represented the most serious security breach in the Harry Potter series' history. Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks. Reviews published in both The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times on 18 July 2007, corroborated many of the plot elements from this leak, and about one day prior to release, The New York Times confirmed that the main circulating leak was real.|$|E

25|$|The medical {{practices}} of the Byzantine Empire originated from the Greek physician Hippocrates and Roman Physician Galen. Evidence {{of the use of}} ancient Greek medicinal ideas is seen through Byzantine physician’s reliance on humors to diagnose illness. Byzantine physicians followed the Hippocratic Theory that the body consisted of four humors, blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. These humors were connected to particular seasons, hot or cold and dry or moist. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>identifying</b> these humors Byzantine physicians relied heavily on Galen's works.|$|R

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> {{the visible}} church, Reformed theologians have spoken of certain {{marks of the}} Church.

Others, such as those following the Scots Confession, include a third mark of rightly administered church discipline, or exercise of censure against unrepentant sinners. These marks allowed the Reformed to identify the church based on its conformity to the Bible rather than the Magisterium or church tradition.|$|E

25|$|Public Health {{surveillance}} {{systems can}} be passive or active. A passive surveillance system consists of the regular, ongoing reporting of diseases and conditions by all health facilities in a given territory. An active surveillance system is one where health facilities are visited and health care providers and medical records are reviewed <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> a specific disease or condition. Passive surveillance systems are less time consuming and less expensive to run but risk under-reporting of some diseases. Active surveillance systems are most appropriate for epidemics or where a disease has been targeted for elimination.|$|E
25|$|The λ-red {{system has}} also been {{optimized}} for scarless recombination; however, this is a two-step system consisting of selection and counterselection. In this case, a gene cassette with a dual selectable marker {{can be incorporated into}} the DNA at the specific location of mutagenesis. After selection of recombinants, a subsequent transformation to transfect linear DNA with the desired mutation is performed, which will then be homologously recombined into the cellular DNA in place of the marker.
