40|$|The {{purpose of}} this reasearch {{was to develop a}} {{respiratory}} monitoring system using a reflective object sensor based belt to measure the thoracic expansion of a neonatal for future application at the medical center of the Universidad Evangelica Boliviana (UEB). This medical center, being founded by the UEB University, is dedicated to help and serve the poor and currently has no respiratory monitoring system. The methodology used was first to build and test the respiratory sensor belt and test the relationship between the blet expansion and the voltage generated. The, to incorporate the respiratory sensor belt in a system that would allow individual testing as well as group testing in a wireless network. The system was simulated using an <b>expandable</b> <b>plastic</b> container that was expanded and extracted periodically, registering the results in a MATLAB software. The system gave successful results and generated the frequency results of each cycle, average frequency and deviation frequency. The system demonstrated to be reliable and to have repeatable results...|$|E
5000|$|Burple is a {{discontinued}} drink {{mix that}} was packaged in an <b>expandable</b> accordion-like <b>plastic</b> container. There were two sizes of Burple available, a lunchbox-size (8 oz) and a full-size (64 oz) container. [...] It was distributed by Sundale Beverages of Belmont, California and sold {{mainly in the}} Midwest.|$|R
25|$|Head {{and neck}} markers are very visible, {{and may be}} used in species where the legs are not {{normally}} visible (such as ducks and geese). Nasal discs and nasal saddles can be attached to the culmen with a pin looped through the nostrils in birds with perforate nostrils. They should not be used if they obstruct breathing. They should not be used on birds that live in icy climates, as accumulation of ice on a nasal saddle can plug the nostrils. Neck collars made of <b>expandable,</b> non-heat-conducting <b>plastic</b> are very useful for larger birds such as geese.|$|R
40|$|SEMS {{are highly}} {{valuable}} {{in the management}} of patients with malignant colon obstruction with high technical and clinical success. Currently, their role is in colon decompression as a bridge before surgery and in the palliative management of inoperative patients. SEMS appear to be more effective and less costly than emergency surgery. SEMS should be avoided in benign strictures. More data is needed in reference to the role of <b>plastic</b> <b>expandable</b> stents {{in the management of}} patients with benign colon strictures...|$|R
40|$|There is {{no clear}} {{consensus}} concerning the best endoscopic treatment of benign refractory esophageal strictures due to caustic ingestion. Different procedures are currently used: frequent multiple dilations, retrievable self-expanding stent, nasogastric intubation and surgery. We describe a new technique to fix a suspended esophageal silicone prosthesis to the neck in benign esophageal strictures; this permits us to avoid the frequent risk of migration of the <b>expandable</b> metallic or <b>plastic</b> stents. Under general anesthesia a rigid esophagoscope {{was placed in the}} patient's hypopharynx. Using transillumination from the optical device, the patient's neck was pierced with a needle. A n. 0 monofilament surgical wire was pushed into the needle, grasped by a standard foreign body forceps through the esophagoscope and pulled out of the mouth (as in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy procedure). After tying the proximal end of the silicone prosthesis with the wire, it was placed through the strictures under endoscopic view. This procedure was successfully utilized in four patients suffering from benign refractory esophageal strictures due to caustic ingestion. The prosthesis and its suspension from the neck were well-tolerated until removal (mean duration 4 months). A postoperative transitory myositis was diagnosed in only one patient. One of the most frequent complications of esophageal prostheses in refractory esophageal strictures due to caustic ingestion is distal migration. Different solutions were proposed. For example the suspension of a wire coming from the nose and then fixed behind the ear. This solution is not considered optimal because of patient complaints and moreover the aesthetic aspect is compromised. The procedure we utilized in four patients utilized the setting of a silicone tube hanging from the neck in a way similar to that of endoscopic pharyngostomy. This solution is a valid alternative both for quality of life and for functional results...|$|R
