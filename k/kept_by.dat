5|$|The Pipe rolls {{from the}} 13th century onwards are less {{important}} for historical study {{because there are}} other surviving financial records. Some, such as the receipt rolls, were also <b>kept</b> <b>by</b> the exchequer, and were used by the treasury clerks to prepare the Pipe rolls. Other surviving records were <b>kept</b> <b>by</b> the sheriffs for their own use in submitting accounts to the Pipe rolls. However the post 13th-century Pipe rolls are occasionally the sole source for historical facts such as William Shakespeare's residence in the parish of St Helen's Bishopsgate, and in Southwark.|$|E

5|$|Alpine spaniels were <b>kept</b> <b>by</b> the {{canons of}} the monasteries in the Alps {{in order to}} search for {{travellers}} during heavy snow storms, including the Great St. Bernard Hospice in the Great St Bernard Pass between Italy and Switzerland.

The Alpine breed was also used as a watchdog to guard sheep and cattle of mountainous regions, including the Himalayas.|$|E

5|$|Although several Roman sources {{including}} Livy and Polybius talk {{extensively about}} the Roman {{army of the}} Roman Kingdom period that followed the Etruscan capture of the city, no contemporary accounts survive. Polybius, for example, was writing some 300 years after the events in question, and Livy some 500 years later. Additionally, what records were <b>kept</b> <b>by</b> the Romans at this time were later destroyed when the city was sacked. The sources for this period cannot therefore be seen as reliable, {{as they can be}} for later military history, e.g. from the First Punic War onwards.|$|E

5|$|As General Building Inspector, Speer was {{responsible}} for the Central Department for Resettlement. From 1939 onward, the Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures. Speer was aware of these activities, and inquired as to their progress. At least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still exists, as does the Chronicle of the Department's activities, <b>kept</b> <b>by</b> Wolters.|$|E
