I dreamed of painting glasses from which no-one would ever think of drinking, beaches that would be quite unsuitable for bathing, nudes who would be definitively chaste. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>an</b> art which in the first place would appear as a representation of the impossible.

50|$|Roger Corman said he <b>wanted</b> <b>an</b> {{unknown to}} play the lead.My demands were -- I felt -- not {{difficult}} in Hollywood. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>an</b> actress who was beautiful and had a great figure. Because we economized {{on the amount of}} cloth we used in the costume... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> tall actress. She does a lot of martial arts. I couldn't have a 5-foot-1 actress beating up all these big guys. So <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> tall, beautiful woman with a good figure, who was a good actress but I wasn't looking for Meryl Streep, just a good actress. I figured this would be pretty easy in Hollywood. It turned out to be incredibly difficult. I've never seen so many beautiful bad actresses in my life.|$|R
60|$|What did <b>I</b> <b>want?</b> <b>I</b> didn't tell HIM; but I'll tell YOU, in confidence. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> {{whiff of}} my pipe, and a turn at ROBINSON CRUSOE.|$|R

500|$|Takemitsu {{summed up}} his initial aversion to Japanese (and all non-Western) {{traditional}} musical forms {{in his own}} words: [...] "There may be folk music with strength and beauty, but I cannot be completely honest {{in this kind of}} music. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> more active relationship to the present. (Folk music in a 'contemporary style' is nothing but a deception)." ...|$|E

But <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> new challenge. I made that choice to be here in Boston because I need a new challenge." [...] In 126 games of 2015, Sandoval batted [...]245 with 10 home runs and 47 RBI, all career lows since his first full season in 2009.|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, Willis {{appeared}} in Manhattan {{to talk about}} his film 16 Blocks with reporters. One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on the current government, but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence: [...] "I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican. I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down. I'm not a Republican." ...|$|E

500|$|One common {{technique}} is to memorize {{a story or}} poem in which the word lengths represent the digits of : The first word has three letters, the second word has one, the third has four, the fourth has one, the fifth has five, and so on. An early example of a memorization aid, originally devised by English scientist James Jeans, is [...] "How <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics." [...] When a poem is used, it is {{sometimes referred to as}} a piem. Poems for memorizing [...] have been composed in several languages in addition to English. [...] Record-setting [...] memorizers typically do not rely on poems, but instead use methods such as remembering number patterns and the method of loci.|$|E
500|$|... "When {{she played}} it for me, {{it took me a}} while to find out the visual {{interpretation}} that I could give back to her. And so I woke up one night and I got it, and I said, 'I got it: We have to birth a new race.' From the gate, Gaga was like, 'I want Nick Knight for this video. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> visual.' She was always birthing something visual in her head, and Nick Knight is just, well, he's prolific but he's so genius. It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be. [...] It's a different time; it's a different era; there are no limits. It is a viral message. I think that there's something in there for everyone, and that's what's so amazing about the video and so specific about the message." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} its sexually {{explicit}} nature, the singer responded: [...] "Erm, yeah. I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about what it is that really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to say. When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E
30|$|T:'Want’ {{is another}} word. It means to desire. For example <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>an</b> ice cream. <b>Want</b> is the present tense. Want/wanted/wanted.|$|R

500|$|On 20 June 1995 the USAF {{announced}} a [...] "nullification" [...] verdict by Wang's 10-member court-martial jury, effectively acquitting Wang of the charges. Nullification {{is not a}} finding of innocence, but instead it is a refusal to convict on the stated charges. After the verdict, Wang stated, [...] "I want to say the fight is nowhere near over for me. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> congressional hearing or investigation into why I {{was the only person}} charged." [...] Major General Nolan Sklute, the USAF's top legal officer, stated, [...] "An incident like this {{does not necessarily mean that}} the conduct of all those involved rises to the level of criminal culpability. I'm satisfied with the handling of the case." [...] Secretary of the Air Force Sheila Widnall added, [...] "The Black Hawk helicopters were downed as a result of a tragic series of errors and unfortunate events involving numerous people. The mishap was not the result of any one individual's actions; the conduct of numerous officers and the system itself contributed." ...|$|E

[...] Although a Hobart nomination had been talked about at least since Griggs' victory the previous November, Hobart expressed reluctance {{in a letter to}} his wife from the convention: [...] "It looks to me I will be nominated for Vice-President whether I want it or not, and as I get nearer to the point where I may, I am dismayed at the thought... If <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> nomination, everything is going my way. But when I realize all that it means in work, worry, and loss of home and bliss, I am overcome, so overcome I am simply miserable." [...] Despite Hobart's expressed hesitation, he was welcomed home by a crowd of 15,000 at the Paterson Armory. [...] City officials, feeling they had insufficient fireworks to properly honor Hobart, obtained more from New York City.|$|E
500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set up that way from the beginning, so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was just hoping for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I never saw it the way he sees it but I can see his point of view. I never really looked at it like that." ...|$|E

[...] <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> lawyer who's going to get me off. [...] <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> lawyer who will invent the Twinkie defense. ...
