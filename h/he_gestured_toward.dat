50|$|On 5 November 2011 Archbishop Betori survived an {{apparent}} assassination attempt. An unidentified man confronted the archbishop outside his office, shot and wounded the prelate's secretary, and waved {{a gun at}} the archbishop before escaping. Fr Paolo Brogi, the archbishop's secretary, was reportedly in satisfactory condition after surgery to repair an abdominal wound. Archbishop Betori and witnesses stated that the gunman said something as <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> <b>toward</b> the prelate with his firearm, {{but they could not}} understand his intent.|$|E
5000|$|When sent to trial, David Birnie {{pled guilty}} to four counts of murder and one count each of {{abduction}} and rape. When asked why he had pled guilty, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> <b>toward</b> the victims' families and said, [...] "It's the least I could do." [...] He was sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment. After being found sane enough to stand trial, Catherine Birnie was also sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment by the Supreme Court of Western Australia; under law at the time, both were required to serve 20 years before being eligible for parole.|$|E

Meanwhile, Lehnsherr sits alone at a chessboard in a San Francisco park. As <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> a metal chess piece, it wobbles slightly, indicating his powers to be returning and the [...] "cure" [...] to be temporary.|$|R

His tired horse is ready to fall asleep as <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> the water, where {{there appear to be}} more people.

5000|$|The {{argument}} {{has been made}} that Albert Brooks, who was 11 years old when Einstein died, has dealt with the trauma of his father's passing through vignettes in his movies. For example, early in Defending Your Life (1991), Brooks’s recently deceased character, Albert, finds himself in an afterlife nightclub, watching a terrible comedian. “How’d you die?” the comic asks him; Albert replies, “Onstage, like you.” Later, Meryl Streep's character invites Albert to leave with her. “I can’t,” <b>he</b> says, <b>gesturing</b> <b>toward</b> the stage. “That’s my father.” ...|$|R
30|$|Here <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> {{embodiment}} as {{a component}} of imagination, even if he does not explicitly take this direction as he theorizes the imagination. For our own purposes, I suggest it may make sense to keep in mind cognitive science linguists George Lakoff’s and Mark Johnson’s proposals that metaphors, both primary and complicated secondary metaphors, and in Lakoff and Johnson’s view, even complex philosophical systems, all derive from embodiment. The way we see the world arises out of our bodies’ location in space, the way our arms and legs move, the kinds of neuronal connections the brain’s synapses take. Metaphor, that perennial tool of the imagination, the force that lifts thought into its spectacular flights of creativity, the poet’s best friend, these cognitive scientists tell us, is intimately connected to being in a body. With this, {{it should come as no}} surprise to find imagination within the context of meditation for these thoughtful medieval Indian thinkers as also deriving from our lived engagement with the body, our personal and subjective experiences, even if as a culture today we tend to think of meditation popularly as bringing us to transcendent, bodiless spaces (Lakoff and Johnson, 1999).|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> made a <b>gesture</b> <b>toward</b> {{the open}} door and then {{went up to the}} table and poured himself out a final stirrup-cup. He was wrapped from head to foot in a threadbare cloth coat, lined with shaggy fur, a fur-edged bonnet was on his head, and he carried a stout stick to which was {{attached}} a large bundle done up in a red cotton handkerchief. This now he slung over his shoulder.|$|R
50|$|Jerry and Tuffy then {{throw the}} entire platter of dishes down and Tom {{is forced to}} catch all of them on his sword, head, arm, and foot. Tom uses his {{remaining}} foot to tiptoe out of the castle so that the dishes falling do not wake the king, and then rushes back in. He steps on tacks scattered by the two mice and goes out again before yelling out in pain and pulling out the tack. Tom runs back in {{for the second time}} and barely stops before he steps on the tacks again. Tom puts a gauntlet on his feet in order to tiptoe across the tacks without being hurt. Tom then confronts Jerry, but Jerry stabs him in the nose. The cat is forced to cover the king's ears so that he does not hear his cry of pain. Tom spots some champagne corks and then hears mysterious clanking. A suit of armor is being used as a puppet, and it dances noisily. Jerry raises the visor and sees only Tom, standing nonchalantly next to the suit. <b>He</b> <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> the king, having plugged his ears with corks, and then slices apart the suit of armor. Jerry dodges while Tuffy escapes and plugs the king's nose with clothespins, which causes his face to bloat again. Tom has caught Jerry on the end of his blade, but Jerry points at the king, and Tom can only watch as the clothespins and corks are blown off and the king opens his eyes. Tom hurriedly plays Brahms's Lullaby on a soothing violin to cause the king to fall asleep again.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the use of sensory modalities relative to a partner’s behavior in gesture sequences during captive chimpanzee play at the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute. We hypothesized that chimpanzees would use visual <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> attentive recipients and auditory/tactile <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> inattentive recipients. We also hypothesized that gesture sequences would be more prevalent toward unresponsive rather than responsive recipients. The chimpanzees used significantly more auditory/tactile rather than visual gestures first in sequences with both attentive and inattentive recipients. They rarely used visual <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> inattentive recipients. Auditory/tactile gestures were effective with and used with both attentive and inattentive recipients. Recipients responded significantly more to single gestures than to first gestures in sequences. Sequences often indicated that recipients {{did not respond to}} initial gestures, whereas effective single gestures made more gestures unnecessary. The chimpanzees thus gestured appropriately relative to a recipient’s behavior and modified their interactions according to contextual social cues...|$|R

5000|$|In Bond's play, Lear is a {{paranoid}} autocrat, building a wall {{to keep out}} imagined [...] "enemies". His daughters Bodice and Fontanelle rebel against him, causing a bloody war. Lear becomes their prisoner and goes on a journey of self-revelation. He is blinded and haunted by {{the ghost of a}} Gravedigger's Boy, whose kindness towards the old King led to his murder. Eventually Lear, after becoming a prophet reminiscent of Leo Tolstoy, makes a <b>gesture</b> <b>toward</b> dismantling the wall <b>he</b> began. This <b>gesture</b> leads to his death, which offers hope as an example of practical activism.|$|R
