Background and Purpose: The <b>Geranium</b> <b>Bronze</b> Cacyreus marshalli (Butler, 1898) is the only butterfly introduced (non-native) into the Euro-pean fauna. It was introduced in 1988 on the Balearic Islands from where it spread across Europe. Materials and Methods: Cacyreus marshalli observations were conduct-ed during the day at all locations. At a number of localities, geraniums as larval host plants were inspected to determine the presence of C. marshalli caterpillars. Results and Conclusions: In Croatia, C. marshalli first appeared {{on the island of}} Lo{inj. The paper presents new distribution data for the <b>Geranium</b> <b>Bronze</b> and its expansion across Croatia (all in the Mediterranean area) and discusses possibilities of spread due to climate change. Further systematic monitoring of spreading of C. marshalli in Croatia is necessary for it to {{be assigned}} to changing climate and above average temperatures in the last years, in particular since 2000...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that around 200 cry genes from Bacillus thuringiensis have already been cloned, only a few Cry {{proteins}} are toxic towards a given pest. A crucial step {{in the mode of}} action of Cry proteins is binding to specific sites in the midgut of susceptible insects. Binding studies in insects that have developed cross-resistance discourage the combined use of Cry proteins sharing the same binding site. If resistance management strategies are to be implemented, the arsenal of Cry proteins suitable to control a given pest may be not so vast as it might seem at first. The present study evaluates the potential of B. thuringiensis for the control of a new pest, the <b>geranium</b> <b>bronze</b> (Cacyreus marshalli Butler), a butterfly that is threatening the popularity of geraniums in Spain. Eleven of the most common Cry proteins from the three lepidopteran-active Cry families (Cry 1, Cry 2, and Cry 9) were tested against the <b>geranium</b> <b>bronze</b> for their toxicity and binding site relationships. Using 125 I-labeled Cry 1 A proteins we found that, of the seven most active Cry proteins, six competed for binding to the same site. For the long-term control of the <b>geranium</b> <b>bronze</b> with B. thuringiensis-based insecticides it would be advisable to combine any of the Cry proteins sharing the binding site (preferably Cry 1 Ab, since it is the most toxic) with those not competing for the same site. Cry 1 Ba would be the best choice of these proteins, since it is significantly more toxic than the others not binding to the common site...|$|E

40|$|Studies on {{the biology}} of <b>geranium</b> <b>bronze</b> {{butterfly}} were conducted in Milan (nothern Italy) on Pelargonium spp. from April {{to the end of}} December, observing directly the presence of adult, larvae eggs or damage. To test the susceptibility to the attack of the butterfly, 40 different ornamental geraniums were used (see the table) : 10 cvs of zonal pelargoniums (Pelargonium × hortorum); 3 cvs of ivy-leafed pelargoniums (P. peltatum); 3 cvs of regal pelargoniums (P. × domesticum); and 16 species or cvs of scented-leafed pelargoniums. The plants were exposed to the pest from the end of May to the end of September, in two different localities. The plants were observed every week, and data on damage and their symptomatology were collected. Different cvs of Pelargonium Larvae on cv Lady plymout...|$|E
