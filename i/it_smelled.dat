The designer talked {{of what was to}} happen to the dress after the awards show, [...] "The dress will be put in an archive with all of her dresses. The Gaga Archives, I suppose. It won't last, that's the beauty of it. When it is brought out again, hopefully it will be in a retrospective, {{and it will be a}} different dress, which is the best thing. I like the idea of it changing and evolving into something else". He later explained that the dress would be preserved and made into a type of jerky before being archived.|$|E
500|$|St.André {{was ordered}} by the king to travel back to Guildford and to bring Toft to London, so that further {{investigations}} could be carried out. [...] He was accompanied by Richard Manningham, a well-known obstetrician who was knighted in 1721, and the second son of Thomas Manningham, Bishop of Chichester. [...] He examined Toft and found {{the right side of}} her abdomen slightly enlarged. [...] Manningham also delivered {{what he thought was a}} hog's bladder—although St.André and Howard disagreed with his identification—but became suspicious as <b>it</b> <b>smelled</b> of urine. [...] Nevertheless, those involved agreed to say nothing in public and on their return to London on 29November lodged Toft in Lacey's Bagnio, in Leicester Fields.|$|E

500|$|Authorities have {{acknowledged}} {{that since the}} exact cause of Bella's death remains unknown, asserting that it was homicide to a jury could be [...] "difficult to prove." [...] Rachelle Bond alleged that McCarthy had punched the toddler in the stomach multiple times after claiming Bella was a [...] "demon", {{and that he was}} the sole perpetrator of the murder. Prosecutors of McCarthy allege that Bella was murdered in one of many abusive occasions after she had been uncooperative about going to bed. Citing that McCarthy had decided to [...] "calm the child down," [...] they say Rachelle had not entered the room alongside her boyfriend. When she did enter, they say she witnessed him near the girl's body, which was [...] "swollen and gray," [...] indicating she was deceased. Rachelle Bond's attorney claims McCarthy threatened to murder her client if she contacted authorities. She also maintained that Rachelle was not involved with hiding the victim's body, which had initially been placed in garbage bags and concealed in a refrigerator. Bond later admitted to this accusation as part of a future plea deal. A cadaver dog brought to the house later indicated that <b>it</b> <b>smelled</b> something on the refrigerator. Bond contradicted the belief that the body was placed on Deer Island; she stated that McCarthy had [...] placed the body in a weighted duffel bag and disposed of it in the water, suggesting it drifted to the location where it was found.|$|E

60|$|She {{felt the}} squeeze of his hand, warm and dry, but rather soft, as {{of a man}} who uses a pen too much; saw him {{following}} her uncle across the room, with his shoulders a little hunched, as if preparing to inflict, and ward off, blows.
