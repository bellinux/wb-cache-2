5|$|Wizard was a {{stallion}} at Elmsal Lodge near Ferrybridge, Yorkshire. In 1812 his {{stud fee}} was ten guineas plus half a guinea for the groom. He also stood at Emsal, {{for the same}} fee, in 1813. He only stood as a stallion for these two seasons and died on 30 June 1813 at Elmsal Lodge two days after running into a post. He broke three ribs and an iron bar attached to the post became so lodged in his backbone that <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>two</b> men to remove it. Wizard sired three winners of eleven races.|$|E

Rowan, {{who had just}} been elected to the U.S. Senate, was Desha's primary defense counsel, assisted by the governor's Secretary of State (and later U.S. Senator) William T. Barry, former Congressman William Brown, T. P. Taul, and James Crawford. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>two</b> days to empanel a jury. Witness testimony consumed the next week, and Governor Desha attended each day of the trial. The closing statements of Rowan and Barry, both known as outstanding orators, took several days, and Chambers spoke last.|$|E
5|$|Each {{player was}} {{acquired}} by the Canucks through various trades. Once each member arrived in Vancouver <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>two</b> years before the line played together regularly. Once they did, they helped to set a Canucks franchise record for points in 2002–03 season (later surpassed), a season in which the West Coast Express accounted for 45% of the team's goal production. All three players recorded their most individually recognized and best statistical seasons while playing on the line. Despite regular season success, the Canucks {{were never able to}} advance past {{the second round of the}} playoffs during the West Coast Express years. The line was disbanded when Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers after the 2005–06 season. Both Morrison and Naslund played through the 2007–08 season with the Canucks before leaving the organization via free agency.|$|E

5|$|In La Pintada, {{a remote}} fishing village of around 400residents {{situated}} {{to the west}} of Acapulco, a mudslide occurred on September14, which within a few minutes, swept through the center of town. As such, many residents initially wandered throughout town in a state of panic and confusion; <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>two</b> days for word of the mudslide to spread to the public. Throughout the village, 71people were killed. Over half the town, including 20homes, were demolished due to the mudslide. A total of 334people were evacuated by police, though 30elected to stay in the area until all the victims had been identified. Many surviving citizens of La Pintada were also hurt, including one seriously.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Russia, they settled into a 200-room palace (the former Baryatinsky mansion) at 46 Sergievskaya Street (today Tchaikovsky Street), Saint Petersburg. The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olga and Peter had {{separate}} bedrooms {{at opposite ends of}} the building, and the Grand Duchess had her own art studio. Unhappy in her marriage, she fell into bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>two</b> years for her hair to regrow.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{founding}} of the State of Israel, the Yishuv leadership anticipated an attack by regular Arab armies, of which Egypt's was the strongest in terms of manpower, arms and equipment. As such, Plan Dalet took stopping a potential Egyptian attack into account, and the Ad Halom (Sukrir) dual bridge over the Lakhish River was blown up as part of Operation Barak on May 12. In the eyes of the Givati command, this part of the operation was of marginal importance. A platoon from the 54th Battalion, two mules and 300 kilograms of explosives were allocated for it. The mules fled the scene, and the explosives were divided among the soldiers, who delivered them to the bridge. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>two</b> attempts to destroy it, as some of the explosives did not work the first time.|$|E

5|$|While {{out to sea}} in August of the 1965 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, Stormfury meteorologists {{decided that}} Hurricane Betsy was {{a good candidate for}} seeding. However, the storm immediately swung towards land, and on September 1, the planned flights were canceled. For some reason, the press was not notified that there were no seedings, and several newspapers reported that it had begun. As Betsy passed close to the Bahamas and smashed into southern Florida, the public and Congress thought that seeding was underway and blamed Stormfury. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>two</b> months for Stormfury officials to convince Congress that Betsy was not seeded, and the project was allowed to continue. A second candidate, Hurricane Elena, stayed too far out to sea.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>two</b> {{hours of}} intense {{discussion}} to elect the presidium of the Seimas. Jonas Basanavičius, officially nonpartisan, was elected {{as the chairman}} and Steponas Kairys, leader of the Social Democrats, was chosen as vice-chairman. Other members were Antanas Smetona, priest Petras Būčys, and Juozas Stankūnas; the secretaries were Liudas Gira, Pranas Klimaitis, and Juozas Gabrys-Paršaitis. The organizational committee proposed a rather academic agenda geared toward cultural issues for the assembly; this initial agenda was vetoed by the delegates. They adopted a new schedule that was more political and highlighted two main goals: holding hearings on the current situation in Lithuania, and deciding which political demands should be submitted to the Tsarist authorities. A major portion of the first day's proceedings was devoted to reports presented by delegates from rural areas. The content of these reports was repetitious and did not carry much weight. The most important question was that of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|The 38th Engineer Battalion's {{electrical}} group {{studied the}} batteries, the electrical firing {{systems and the}} radar fuzes which detonated the bomb at the required altitude. The mechanical group dealt with the exploding-bridgewire detonators and the explosive lenses. The nuclear group moved to Los Alamos to study the cores and initiators. As part of their training, they attended lectures by Edward Teller, Hans Bethe, Lise Meitner and Enrico Fermi. The electrical and mechanical groups at Sandia, although not the nuclear group, completed their training {{around the end of}} October 1946 and spent the next month devising the best methods of assembling a Fat Man, drawing up detailed checklists so that later bomb assembly teams could be trained. They also drew up a proposed table of organization and equipment for an assembly team. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>two</b> weeks for them to assemble their first bomb in December 1946.|$|E

5|$|The German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) ordered Westfalen {{under the}} {{provisional}} name Ersatz Sachsen {{as a replacement}} for , the lead ship of the elderly s. The Reichstag secretly approved and provided funds for Nassau and Westfalen at the end of March 1906, but construction on Westfalen was delayed while arms and armor were procured. She was laid down on 12 August 1907 at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. As with her sister , construction proceeded swiftly and secretly; detachments of soldiers guarded both the shipyard and the major contractors who supplied building materials, such as Krupp. The ship was launched on 1 July 1908, underwent an initial fitting-out, and then in mid-September 1909 was transferred to Kiel by a crew composed of dockyard workers for a final fitting-out. However, the water level in the Weser River was low at this time of year, so six pontoons had to be attached to the ship to reduce her draft. Even so, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>two</b> attempts before the ship cleared the river.|$|E
5|$|The film used Technicolor's Oz process during post-production. This is {{a partial}} silver {{retention}} on the interpositive, similar to bleach bypass, {{which will be}} used to lend to the sense of detachment from the modern world McG was looking for. Industrial Light & Magic developed shader programs to make the desaturated lighting of the CGI realistic and well-integrated to the on-set footage. The filmmakers consulted with many scientists about the effects of an abandoned world and nuclear winter. McG cited , the original Star Wars trilogy and Children of Men, as well as the novel The Road, as his visual influences. He instructed his cast to read the latter as well as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Like Children of Men, McG would storyboard scenes so that it would be edited together to resemble a seamless, continuous shot. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>two</b> weeks to film a two-minute shot of Connor getting caught up in a bombing on the Skynet base where he discovers plans for the T-800.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was complex, often {{with three or}} more usurpers in existence at once. Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger, both rebel generals declared to be emperors by the troops they commanded, clashed {{for the first time}} in 193 AD at the Battle of Cyzicus, in which Niger was defeated. However, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>two</b> further defeats at the Battle of Nicaea later that year and the Battle of Issus the following year, for Niger to be destroyed. Almost as soon as Niger's userpation had been ended, Severus was forced to deal with another rival for the throne in the person of Clodius Albinus, who had originally been allied to Severus. Albinus was proclaimed emperor by his troops in Britain and, crossing over to Gaul, defeated Severus' general Virius Lupus in battle, before being in turn defeated and killed in the Battle of Lugdunum by Severus himself.|$|E
