5|$|In 1960, Allan Williams, the Beatles manager, {{arranged}} {{a season of}} bookings in Hamburg, starting on 17 August 1960, but complained {{that they did not}} impress him, and hoped that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a better act.|$|E

5|$|Barrett {{made his}} first {{appearance}} of 2010–11 in the second match, starting in a 0–0 draw away to Grimsby Town on 17 August 2010. He scored his first goal {{of the season with}} an effort from six yards out to score the final goal in a 4–0 victory away to Rushden & Diamonds on 20 November 2010. He finished the season with 25 appearances and two goals before being released on 23 June 2011 after being told <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> another club.|$|E

5|$|Darlington's {{promotion}} campaign was dealt a blow in February 2009, when club chairman George Houghton placed {{the club in}} administration. As a result, the club were deducted 10points, a penalty from which they could not recover finally finishing 12th. Burgmeier finished with two goals during the season having played 35games, but {{like the rest of}} the playing squad, was told <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a new club by Darlington's administrators.|$|E
5|$|Poor and fatherless, Garfield was mocked by {{his fellow}} boys, and {{throughout}} his life was very sensitive to slights. He escaped through reading, devouring all the books <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> He left home at age 16 in 1847. Rejected by the only ship in port in Cleveland, Garfield instead found work on a canal boat, responsible for managing the mules that pulled it. This labor {{would be used to}} good effect by Horatio Alger, who penned Garfield's campaign biography in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{television}} series Smallville, the character of Chloe Sullivan appeared in her own web-based spin-off series, titled Smallville: Chloe Chronicles. Allison Mack continued her duties as the investigative, high school reporter, with the series originally airing exclusively on AOL.com. The first volume aired between April 29, 2003 and May 20, 2003. The web series eventually {{made its way to}} Britain's Channel 4 website. Smallville: Chloe Chronicles was created by Mark Warshaw, with the scripts written by Brice Tidwell; Allison Mack was given final script approval. This final approval allowed Mack to review and make changes to the script as she saw fit. Warshaw also communicated regularly with Gough and Millar so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> more unique ways to expand Smallville stories over to Chloe's Chronicles.|$|E

5|$|Chapman's playing {{career was}} that of a typical journeyman, owing mostly to the fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that whether he could play for a {{particular}} club was dictated by whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, before leaving home in 1895. He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, and although he lacked the skill of his brother Harry, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.|$|E
5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star in record production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but was certainly the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{was born}} on 23 May 1924 in Ilford, Essex, {{the son of a}} Welsh clergyman. By his early teenage years, Grant had read widely on the subject of Western esotericism and Asian religions, {{including}} the work of prominent occultist Helena Blavatsky. He had made use of a personal magical symbol ever since being inspired to do so in a visionary dream he experienced in 1939; he spelled its name variously as A'ashik, Oshik, or Aossic. Aged 18, {{in the midst of the}} Second World War, Grant volunteered to join the British Army, later commenting that he hoped to be posted to British India, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a spiritual guru to study under. He was never posted abroad, and was ejected from the army aged 20 due to an unspecified medical condition.|$|E

5|$|The Stanley {{opened on}} December 15, 1930. Originally envisioned as a {{vaudeville}} venue, {{it was built}} by Frederick Guest, owner of a chain of theatres in Ontario, who reportedly {{fell in love with}} Vancouver and decided to build his dream theatre there. He hired Henry Holdsby Simmonds as the architect, who designed it with a neoclassical interior and an Art Deco exterior, with seating for 1,216 people. In order to make as high quality a theatre as possible, Simmonds used only the best materials <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find,</b> including tindle stone from Winnipeg and tiles from Italy, along with chandeliers, carpets and furnishings from local merchants. Like the Stanley Cup and Stanley Park, the theatre was named after Governor General of Canada Lord Stanley.|$|E
5|$|While Cope and Marsh dueled for fossils in the American West, {{they also}} tried {{their best to}} ruin each other's {{professional}} credibility. Humiliated by his error in reconstructing the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus, Cope tried to cover up his mistake by purchasing every copy <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> of the journal {{in which it was}} published. Marsh, meanwhile, made sure to publicize the story. Cope's own rapid and prodigious output of scientific papers meant that Marsh had no difficulty in finding occasional errors with which to lambast Cope. Marsh himself was not infallible; he put the wrong skull on a skeleton of Apatosaurus and declared it a new genus, Brontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|While G Company {{was trying}} to escape from Hill 464, {{the rest of the}} 2nd Battalion was cut off at the eastern base of Hill 380, to the south. Nist {{organized}} all the South Korean carriers <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> before dark and loaded them with water, food, and ammunition for the 2nd Battalion, but the carrier party was unable to find the battalion. At dawn on September 7 the men in G Company was discovered and attacked by North Korean troops in nearby positions. At this time, West heard what he recognized as fire from American weapons on a knob to his west. There, G Company was reunited with its Weapons Platoon which had become separated from him during the night.|$|E

5|$|Although the IUCN {{lists the}} Rodrigues {{solitaire}} as going extinct by 1778, the species probably became extinct some {{time between the}} 1730s and 1760s; the exact date is unknown. Its disappearance coincided with the tortoise trade between 1730 and 1750, when traders burnt off vegetation, hunted solitaires, and released cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks. In 1755, Joseph-François Charpentier de Cossigny attempted to obtain a live specimen, {{as he had been}} assured the Rodrigues solitaire still survived in remote areas of the island. After searching for 18 months and offering large rewards, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> none. He noted that cats were blamed for decimating the species, but suspected that it was really due to hunting by humans. When he visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, Alexandre Guy Pingré encountered no solitaires, although he had been assured that they survived.|$|E
5|$|Black's fellow Group members {{arrive to}} help, {{though he had}} not yet {{contacted}} any of them. They set up roadblocks throughout the city but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder case in which the dismembered infant's body had been found in a cooler. He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> the killer—years later, he still only has his three daughters, which has caused him to realize it is impossible to sacrifice one thing to gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents—Black comments that he thought he already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black is the reason for the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine in a dark room.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} for Times Higher Education, Jack Harris says that Walker is an {{extremely}} good writer and even {{those who do not}} specialise in technical fields will derive enjoyment from the book. According to Harris, Walker has unique experience as historian to the NRC which has placed him in an unrivalled position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is little on the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and the Chernobyl disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have been initiated, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> no reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E

5|$|Koṇḍañña {{thereafter}} {{vowed that}} he would follow when Siddhartha became an ascetic {{to learn from the}} future Buddha's findings. In the meantime, Suddhodana attempted to foil Koṇḍañña's prediction because he wanted his son to succeed him in ruling and expanding the kingdom. Suddhodana made intricate arrangements to shield Siddhartha from all worldly suffering in order to steer his mind away from spiritual matters, pampering him with all the material luxury and sense pleasures that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> However, Siddhartha finally persuaded his father to allow him out of the palace to meet his subjects. Suddhodana agreed, but attempted to present a sanitised image of human existence by ordering beggars, old people and sick people to be kept from the streets. Despite this, Siddhartha saw the four sights which prompted him to reevaluate his view of the world.|$|E
5|$|While Glenn {{was on duty}} at Patuxent and in Washington, he read {{everything}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> about space. His office was asked to send a test pilot to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to make runs on a spaceflight simulator, as part of research by the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) into re-entry vehicle shapes. The pilot would also {{be sent to the}} Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and would be subjected to high g-forces in a centrifuge for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at Langley and a week in Johnsville for the testing. NASA asked military-service members to participate in planning the mockup of a spacecraft. Since he had participated in the research at Langley and Johnsville, he was sent to the McDonnell plant in St. Louis as a service adviser to NASA's spacecraft mockup board.|$|E
5|$|With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. Bellerophons decks {{had largely}} been cleared by French fire, and {{boarding}} parties {{began to make}} their way onto the ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto Bellerophons spritsail yard, but a Bellerophon crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them to fall into the sea. French sailors holding onto Bellerophons rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. Bellerophons ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> and climbed up into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on Aigle reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into Bellerophon exploded in the gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.|$|E
