40|$|Previously unreported stratigraphic-structural {{features}} {{have been}} identified during a geological mapping project (1 : 10. 000 scale) in the southernmost part of the Amelia-Narni Range (Central Apennines, Italy). The study area exhibits a Meso-Cenozoic succession of the Umbria-Marche-Sabina type, with a Jurassic structural high at Mt. Cosce, flanked {{to the west and}} north by basins. While the footwall-block top condensed deposits are not preserved due to tectonics and modern erosion, the marginal escarpments are observed locally. These are marked by the onlap of basin-fill deposits, by sparse pockets of fossiliferous condensed deposits unconformably resting on the Early Jurassic substrate (Calcare Massiccio) (epiescarpment deposits), and by a peculiar diagenetic feature (silicification) at the contacts between the shallow water Calcare Massiccio Fm. and the silica-rich basinal lithologies. The silicification process also affects the huge C. Massiccio olistoliths (up to 1 km longer axis; Mt. Mandrione) embedded in the basinal successions flanking the structural high. The main stratigraphic feature discovered in this area is a sedimentary breccia (Mt. Cosce Breccia) resting through an angular unconformity on the footwall-block C. Massiccio. The breccia is a chaotic deposit with clasts of C. Massiccio, of Jurassic basinal formations and of condensed pelagites, also with white pebbly mudstones bearing calpionellids and radiolarians (Maiolica Fm.). The lack of lithoclasts younger than the earliest Cretaceous, the absence of calpionellids, and the presence of Hedbergella sp. in the matrix all suggest an Hauterivian-Barremian age for the deposit. Field relationships and geometries suggest that the breccia is a syntectonic deposit, marking an Early Cretaceous rejuvenation of the western margin of the Jurassic Mt. Cosce High. During the Miocene shortening, the Mt. Cosce horst-block was dissected by the Narni Thrust, becoming a part of its hangingwall, while the N-dipping Jurassic paleoescarpment acted as NE-striking lateral ramp. The NE-dipping forelimb of the thrust overrides an overturned footwall syncline with a thin Jurassic basinal succession (Configni-Vasciano). Our cross-sections suggest a modest shortening (few 100 ’s of metres), unlike previous interpretations (layer-cake models) where larger displacements were implied. The C. Massiccio olistoliths could locally develop shear contacts with the embedding units, due to the contrasting mechanical behavior of the two lithologies when subjected to <b>folding.</b> <b>Last,</b> Pliocene extensional faults apparently exploited the strikes of the rotated pre-orogenic margins...|$|E
40|$|Evidence for an extensional {{phase in}} the Early Cretaceous was {{detected}} in the western sector of Central Apennines during a geological mapping project (1 : 10, 000 scale) in the Narni Ridge, at Mt Cosce (~ 100 km N of Rome). A pelagic succession of the Umbria-Marche-Sabina type overlies shallow-water carbonates (Calcare Massiccio Fm., Hettangian). Jurassic sedimentation was controlled by the local architecture of the W-Tethyan rift, which dismembered the vast Calcare Massiccio platform. While tectonic subsidence forced the drowning of hangingwall-block carbonate factories around the Hettangian/Sinemurian boundary, followed by deeper marine sedimentation, benthic carbonate production survived on horsts until the early Pliensbachian, when they became sites of condensed pelagic deposition. From the Pliensbachian to Early Cretaceous, basin-fill deposits onlapped and eventually buried the inactive marginal escarpments of structural highs. A Jurassic structural high corresponds to Mt. Cosce. While its top and condensed succession are not exposed due to orogenic deformation and modern erosion, its margins are locally preserved, marked by the angular unconformity with basinal units and the diagenetic modification (silicification) of the C. Massiccio. One arresting feature at Mt. Cosce is a sedimentary breccia (Mt. Cosce Breccia), forming sparse to laterally continuous outcrops, which rests unconformably on the horst-block C. Massiccio. The polygenic breccia is chaotic, and displays: I) heterometric clasts made of rocks not younger than the Early Cretaceous, set in a greenish matrix; II) white pebbly mudstones, with radiolarian- and calpionellid-rich (Maiolica Fm.) elements. The lithoclasts were clearly fed locally, and represent formations from the C. Massiccio to the Jurassic basinal succession, as well as various Jurassic condensed facies. The youngest age detected within clasts, the absence of calpionellids and the occurrence of Hedbergella sp. in the matrix, suggest an Hauterivian-Barremian age for the breccia. The unconformity and breccia indicate in our interpretation an episode of reactivation of an Early Jurassic fault, and exhumation of a paleoescarpment tract that had been buried by {{the lower part of}} the Maiolica Fm. (with calpionellids). A purely gravitative cause must be ruled out based on the geometries and composition of the breccia: several clasts represent pre-Cretaceous units, like Middle/Late Jurassic radiolarian cherts. Their presence can only be explained by inferring that they found themselves topographically uplifted with respect to the Cretaceous basin. In our interpretation the clasts were fed from the exhumed vestiges of the Middle/Late Jurassic onlap wedge, including the peritidal substrate and the former epi-escarpment deposits (condensed facies), as a product of escarpment rejuvenation, erosion, and displacement along an Early Cretaceous fault. A non-tectonic interpretation would imply deep (100 ’s of m) erosion down to the Jurassic part of the basin-fill sequence along submarine canyons, for which no evidence whatsoever exists in the area. While the breccia now occupies the eastern slopes of Mt. Cosce, undoing the Neogene thrusting-related deformation (Mt. Cosce is part of the hangingwall anticline of the Narni Thrust) indicates it must in fact document a former W-facing margin as the Mesozoic paleoescarpment was rotated due to <b>folding.</b> <b>Last,</b> Quaternary extensional faults further dissected the folded and thrusted rocks embedding the Jurassic rift...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy, nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy, and numerical simulations were used to study the thermostability of the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein. The transition temperature of the RBD in a mixing buffer, composed of glycine, sodium acetate, and sodium phosphate with 100 mM sodium chloride, at pH 6. 8, determined by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism, is 48. 74 C. Experimental {{results showed that the}} thermal-induced unfolding-folding transition of the RBD follows a two-state model with a reversibility> 90 %. Using a simple Go-like model and Langevin dynamics we have shown that, in agreement with our experiments, the folding of the RBD is two-state. Theoretical estimates of thermodynamic quantities are in reasonable agreement with the experiments. Folding and thermal unfolding pathways of the RBD also were experimentally and numerically studied in detail.

40|$|Partially folded protein species transiently form during folding of most proteins. Often, {{these species}} are molten {{globules}}, {{which may be}} on- or off-pathway to the native state. Molten globules are ensembles of interconverting protein conformers that have {{a substantial amount of}} secondary structure, but lack virtually all tertiary side-chain packing characteristics of natively folded proteins. Due to solvent-exposed hydrophobic groups, molten globules are prone to aggregation, which can have detrimental effects on organisms. The molten globule observed during folding of the 179 -residue apoflavodoxin from Azotobacter vinelandii is off-pathway, as it has to unfold before native protein can form. Here, we study folding of apoflavodoxin and characterize its molten globule using fluorescence spectroscopy and Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Apoflavodoxin is site-specifically labeled with fluorescent donor and acceptor dyes, utilizing dye-inaccessibility of Cys 69 in cofactor-bound protein. Donor (i. e., Alexa Fluor 488) is covalently attached to Cys 69 in all apoflavodoxin variants used. Acceptor (i. e., Alexa Fluor 568) is coupled to Cys 1, Cys 131 and Cys 178, respectively. Our FRET data show that apoflavodoxin’s molten globule forms in a non-cooperative manner and that its N-terminal 69 residues <b>fold</b> <b>last.</b> In addition, striking conformational differences between molten globule and native protein are revealed, because the inter-label distances sampled in the 111 -residue C-terminal segment of the molten globule are shorter than observed for native apoflavodoxin. Thus, FRET sheds light on the off-pathway nature of the molten globule during folding of an a-b paralle...|$|R
