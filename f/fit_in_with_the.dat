5|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{taken into}} account when designing the building include the polycarbonate cladding, used for natural light and passive heating; and a hydronic heating and cooling system using the constant temperature of the sea water below the pontoon. As a floating structure, {{it will not be}} affected by rises in the sea level. The gabled roof design is intended to <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other buildings in Sullivans Cove including PW1, Elizabeth Street Pier and the Mac02 Cruise Terminal– which themselves are based on the historic use of the area as a freight port.|$|E
5|$|Originally, this genus was {{believed}} to be a prosauropod because of the knife-shaped teeth found near its fossils, which <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea that prosauropods were omnivorous. Scientists now know that the teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass. Vulcanodon is now known to be a true sauropod. Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus, both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae, though this has not been universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Rebuilding work did {{not begin}} in earnest until 1863, when William Gibbs had the {{property}} substantially remodelled in a Gothic Revival style. William Cubitt & Co. were the builders and John Norton was the architect. Norton's design enveloped the original house. He added an extra floor, two new wings and towers. Norton emphasised the importance of architectural continuity in restoration and rebuilding relating to several historical periods. As a result, while some walls remained plain, others were adorned with Gothic and naturalistic carvings to <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> previous architectural styles.|$|E

25|$|In his tracts, Sanielevici {{suggests}} that the Romanian ethnicity and the Romanian Jewry are both racial conglomerates, not racial entities. He speaks about fundamental differences occurring between people from the distinct Romanian historical regions—Moldavia, Wallachia, Transylvania etc.—with many hybrid individuals straddling the supposed divides. La Vie des mammifères... postulated that the Moldavians were Mousterian-Magdalenians originally feeding on fruit, fish and snails, whereas Wallachians (or, more restrictively, Muntenians) represented the Aurignacian-Solutrean mixture—horses in summer, and mainly onions in winter.
