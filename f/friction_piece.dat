40|$|The {{subject of}} {{friction}} {{is important in}} all engineering applications wherever solid surfaces are in sliding contact with each other. This is particularly true in metal working processes where the sliding pair of surfaces are metals and where plastic deformation of the softer of the two metals usually takes place under conditions of high normal pressure. In orthogonal metal cutting processes frictional drag apparently is encountered on the rake face between chip and tool and as the tool wears, additional frictional drag also occurs between flank of the tool and the work <b>piece.</b> <b>Friction</b> at these contact regions affects the chip formation process, power consumption, metal removal rate, quality of machined surface and active life of the cutting tools.

Clean platina, {{by which}} I mean such {{as has been}} made the {{positive}} pole of a pile (570.), or has been treated with acid (605.), and has then been put into distilled water for twelve or fifteen minutes, has a peculiar <b>friction</b> when one <b>piece</b> is rubbed against another. It wets freely with pure water, even {{after it has been}} shaken and dried by the heat of a spirit-lamp; and if made the pole of a voltaic pile in a dilute acid, it evolves minute bubbles from every part of its surface. But platina in its common state wants that peculiar friction: it will not wet freely with water as the clean platina does; and when made the positive pole of a pile, it for a time gives off large bubbles, which seem to cling or adhere to the metal, and are evolved at distinct and separate points of the surface. These appearances and effects, as well as its want of power on oxygen and hydrogen, are the consequences, and the indications, of a soiled surface.|$|R
40|$|International Symposium on Genesis and Role of Transfer Layer Mechanically Mixed Layer in Wear of Materials, Hyderabad : Inde (1998) International audienceMechanically mixed layers (MMLs) and {{transfer}} layers (TLs) {{are present in}} the metal forming industry, in rolling processes among others, just as in other fields of Materials and Mechanical science and engineering. Due to the asymmetry of mechanical properties between workpieces and tools, however, TLs are much more frequent - indeed, almost systematic - and the present paper focuses on them. A review is given of experiments performed both on an experimental rolling mill and on a tribological simulation test, the plane strain compression test (PSCT). Various metals and alloys have been investigated under a range of deformation conditions. As in other systems, the origin is abrasive wear followed by adhesion, or adhesive wear. Constant exchanges between the tool surface, the workpiece and the re-circulating lubricant lead to a steady state TL, the characteristics of which (density and size of transferred particles, hardness and roughness of the TL) depend on the tool-workpiece contact conditions. Tribological consequences, in terms of <b>friction</b> and formed <b>piece</b> surface aspect, vary with the TL properties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Friction {{surfacing}} is {{an advanced}} process of great potential and an enhanced technology in surface modification. It {{is a solid}} state process, which allows deposition welding at temperatures below the melting range. The present study is on the coating of stain-less steel on Spheroidal Graphite Iron {{through the process of}} friction surfacing. This work explains the perfection obtained through various combination of the parameters used in friction surfacing namely traverse speed, rotational speed and the applied load. Series of test was performed on the <b>friction</b> surfaced work <b>piece.</b> Fine bonding has been accomplished between the selected materials out of the process done with variable combination of process parameters. Mechanical tests like bending test, micro-hardness test and corrosion test were conducted. Appreciable hardness values (200 HRC) have been obtained in micro-hardness test. Bend test performed on the surface revealed good strength and reliability of the bonding. The Corrosion test was conducted to find the suitability of these deposits for chemical pumps, pressure vessels and joints of dissimilar metals. The presence of pearlite and ferrite matrix in the microstructure exemplifies the strength of the bond. These results are expected to find great use for important applications in defence, aerospace, electrical, automobile and many other industrial sectors in the engineering fields...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{knowledge}} of ice friction influences on vessels and offshore structures is desirable when {{we seek to}} optimize designs by reducing the forces applied by impinging ice. Friction {{is known to be}} important in terms of the overall load experienced by ships or offshore structures. This includes both the direct friction between ice and structure and the <b>friction</b> between ice <b>pieces</b> themselves as they move around the structure. Traditionally, a friction coefficient is considered to be independent of velocity, pressure and temperature; however, the friction of ice has been widely studied and is known to be highly variable. Numerous tests have been performed by researchers to investigate the friction between ice and various materials such as steel, concrete and other materials under various conditions. The result shows that ice friction coefficient is not generally constant when sliding velocity, pressure and temperature change. Much is still not known about iceâs frictional properties. Relatively few studies have considered the friction of ice on ice, despite {{the fact that this is}} an important factor when considering the relative movement of pack ice when it impinges on a fixed or floating structure. The ice-ice friction influences the movement of ice pieces relative to each other as pack ice âflowsâ around a structure and this in turn influences the load on the structure. This study examines the effect of friction of ice against ice under relatively high pressures such as those that might be experienced during full scale interactions. The objective of the study is to quantify the effects of temperature, pressure, velocity and other parameters on the ice-ice friction coefficient...|$|R
