5|$|In 1534, Cromwell {{initiated}} a Visitation of the Monasteries ostensibly to <b>examine</b> <b>their</b> character, but in fact, to value their assets {{with a view}} to expropriation. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, in contrast to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Suppression of monasteries to raise funds was not unknown previously. Cromwell had done the same thing on the instructions of Cardinal Wolsey to raise funds for two proposed colleges at Ipswich and Oxford years before.|$|E
5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} possess an eye-like mechanical device attached {{to the left side}} of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can <b>examine</b> <b>their</b> victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E

Hu's words, however, were thinly veiled criticism. Nevertheless, in his January 2005 Policy Address, Tung gave a rather critical verdict on his own performance.|$|E
25|$|Web {{crawlers}} typically {{identify themselves}} to a Web server by using the User-agent field of an HTTP request. Web site administrators typically <b>examine</b> <b>their</b> Web servers' log and use the user agent field to determine which crawlers have visited the web server and how often. The user agent field may include a URL where the Web site administrator may find out {{more information about the}} crawler. Examining Web server log is tedious task, and therefore some administrators use tools to identify, track and verify Web crawlers. Spambots and other malicious Web crawlers are unlikely to place identifying information in the user agent field, or they may mask their identity as a browser or other well-known crawler.|$|E

25|$|M.D. William E. Seidelman is a {{professor}} from the University of Toronto who in collaboration with Dr. Howard Israel of Columbia University published a report on an investigation on the Medical experimentations performed in Austria under the Nazi Regime. In that report he mentions a Doctor Hermann Stieve, whom used the war to experiment on live humans. Dr. Stieve specifically focused on the reproductive system of women. He would tell women their execution date in advanced, and he would evaluate how their psychological distress would affect their menstruation cycles. After they were murdered, he would dissect and <b>examine</b> <b>their</b> reproductive organs. Some {{of the women were}} even raped after they were told the date when they would be killed, so that Dr. Stieve could study the path of sperm through their reproductive system.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{prompted}} by a dispute over the annulment of the marriage of Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon, the Church of England separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534, and became the established church by an Act of Parliament in the Act of Supremacy, beginning {{a series of events}} known as the English Reformation. In the same year there was a Visitation of the Monasteries, ostensibly to <b>examine</b> <b>their</b> character, but in fact to value their assets with a view to expropriation. The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535, however, was an entirely candid valuation of the income of the monasteries. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, allied to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Shrewsbury Abbey's income was assessed by the Valor at precisely £527 15s. 5¾d. Of this, £414 1s. 3¼d. was contributed by the temporalities; essentially, property rents drawn from estates in 26 manors of Shropshire and seven in other counties.|$|E
