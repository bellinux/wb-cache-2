He had not achieved world peace. He had not attained victory in his two wars." [...] At the same time, the book largely supports the 'surge' strategy and lauds the President for adopting it.|$|E

Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), a ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ("House Intelligence Committee"). Ruppersberger, who was a guest on the show, responded, [...] "We have rules {{as far as the}} committee and what you can have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement I just made, is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus.... And we will continue to do that because what we're trying to do now is to get the American public to know more about what's going on." [...] Rep. King, who was also a guest on This Week as a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: [...] "o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question. So anyone who says that Congress is somehow being stonewalled is just wrong and [...] is generally, I think, raised by {{people who are trying to}} make a name for themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his resignation, {{from his}} post as Commissioner of the Food and Drugs Administration in December 1969, Dr. Herbert L. Ley, Jr. [...] In an {{interview}} to the New York Times, warned {{the public about the}} FDA’s inability to safeguard consumers. People were being misled, he believed “The thing [...] that bugs me is that the people think the FDA is protecting them - it isn’t. What the FDA is <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> the public thinks it’s doing are as different as night and day,” he said. The agency, in his opinion, did not have the motivation to protect consumers, faced budget shortfalls, and lacked support from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Dr. Ley was critical of Congress, the Administration and the drug industry, he stated that he had [...] "constant, tremendous, sometimes unmerciful pressure" [...] from the drug industry and that the drug company lobbyists, combined with the politicians who worked on behalf of their patrons, could bring “tremendous pressure” to bear on him and his staff, to try preventing FDA restrictions on their drugs. The interview concluded with Ley stating that the entire issue was about money, “pure and simple”. On December 15, 1999, interviewed for the oral history program of the FDA History Office, Dr. Ley shared that from the first controversy in his tenure as FDA Commissioner he had a [...] "gut feeling" [...] that his life expectancy at the FDA was probably limited. He said he had done everything by the book, both in the FDA and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and he thinks that what the Administration was really wishing, was that he would stonewall the whole Academy report, because it was goring too many pharmaceutical companies.|$|E

[...] But this is not true. [...] It {{is very difficult to}} find in the land [...] cultivated fields that are not used for planting. [...] Only those sand fields or stone mountains that would require the investment of hard labour and great expense to make them good for planting remain uncultivated and that's because the Arabs do not like working too much in the present for a distant future. Therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} find good land for cattle. [...] And not only peasants, but also rich landowners, are not selling good land so easily...We who live abroad {{are accustomed to}} believing that the Arabs are all wild desert people who, like donkeys, neither see nor understand what is happening around them.
