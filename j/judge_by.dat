5|$|The Mundo Perdido {{continued}} {{to serve as}} an important burial site during the 8th and 9th centuries. The final version of the Talud-Tablero Temple received three elite status burials, possibly {{members of the royal family}} to <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> the extremely high quality of the associated offerings. These burials have been dated to the second half of the 8th century, during the reign of YaxNuunAyiinII.|$|E
5|$|Robert de Bethune (died 1148) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Hereford. From a knightly family, {{he became a}} teacher before {{becoming}} a canon, a type of monk, by 1115. He was elected prior of Llanthony Priory in the middle 1120s, and was named bishop by King Henry I of England in 1130. As bishop, he was often appointed a <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> the papacy, and was known for the care he took of his diocese.|$|E

5|$|On June 19, 1915, Major General Luis R. Esteves of the U.S. Army {{became the}} first Puerto Rican and the first Hispanic to {{graduate}} from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. While he attended West Point, he tutored classmate Dwight D. Eisenhower in Spanish; a second language was {{required in order to}} graduate. He was a second lieutenant in the 8th Infantry Brigade of the army under the command of John J. Pershing when he was sent to El Paso, Texas in the Pancho Villa Expedition. From El Paso, he was sent to the town of Polvo, where he was appointed mayor and <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> its citizens. Esteves helped organize the 23rd Battalion, which would be composed of Puerto Ricans and be stationed in Panama during World War I. He would also {{play a key role in}} the formation of the Puerto Rico National Guard.|$|E
5|$|The {{first act}} {{in this new}} war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting {{on the far side}} of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares. He used the grain for his own {{supplies}} and the ships' timbers to build siege engines. However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although to <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot have spent more than three months besieging Byzantion. The walls of Byzantion were very tall and strong, and the city was full of defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it. The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory. Philip's motives are as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided to go straight to the root of the problem, rather than be detained at Byzantion.|$|E
5|$|When Baxter {{returned}} to Batesville, he organized the 4th Arkansas Mounted Infantry for the Union and commanded {{it until he}} was named a State Supreme Court <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> Governor Murphy in the Spring 1864. Shortly after being named a judge, {{he was elected to}} the U.S. Senate by the legislature along with Rev. Andrew Hunter, but they were not seated in the Senate as the senate did not recognize the Murphy Administration. In 1867, he was appointed by Governor Clayton judge of the 3rd Judicial circuit. In 1868 he was appointed the 1st Congressional district of Arkansas. He held these two positions until he was nominated for governor in 1872. Baxter was virtually unknown and privately clean of scandals, unlike most of the Minstrels. They believed he could attract votes from Unionists and Northerners, their core base, as well as natives of the state.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the quality of life}} (QOL) of elderly people as <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> university students. A comparison was made between the QOL of the elderly as <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> university students with the actual QOL of the elderly. Subjects were 136 elderly {{with a mean age of}} 73. 1 ± 5. 5 years, and 35 students with a mean age 21. 7 ± 1. 12 years. A basic QOL scale was applied for the measurement of QOL. It was found that the elderly QOL <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> the students was generally a low value. Moreover, subjective well-being was viewed differently by the two groups. It was found that the elderly QOL <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> students was influenced by the students own QOL. It was concluded that the QOL of elderly peoples as <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> university students related to the actual QOL of the students...|$|R

5|$|Justice David Josiah Brewer's {{death on}} March 28, 1910 gave Taft a second {{opportunity}} {{to fill a}} seat on the high court; he chose New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes. Taft told Hughes that should the chief justiceship fall vacant during his term, Hughes would be his likely choice for the center seat. The Senate quickly confirmed Hughes, but then Chief Justice Fuller died on July 4, 1910. Taft took five months to replace Fuller, and when he did, it was with Justice Edward Douglass White, who became the first associate justice to be promoted to chief justice. According to Lurie, Taft, who still had hopes of being chief justice, may have been more willing to appoint an older man than he (White) than a younger one (Hughes), who might outlive him, as indeed Hughes did. To fill White's seat as associate justice, Taft appointed Willis Van Devanter of Wyoming, a federal appeals <b>judge.</b> <b>By</b> the time Taft nominated White and Van Devanter in December 1910, he had another seat to fill due to William Henry Moody's retirement because of illness; he named a Louisiana Democrat, Joseph R. Lamar, whom he had met while playing golf, and had subsequently learned had a good reputation as a judge.|$|E
