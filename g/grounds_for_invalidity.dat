40|$|A recent {{decision}} by the Supreme Court has overcome the inconsistencies of the classical jurisprudential position {{on the importance of}} the judge's relief of the voidness in case of request for termination. The pronunciation, however, has excluded from the scope of Art. 1421 c. c., the cases of voidness "special" on the implicit assumption of their ontological diversity and of the alleged different discipline, compared with the general scheme. The "method" logical-systematic and teleological-axiological reveals the fallacy of the classic dogmas on invalidity behind the recent solution; in particular the natural relativity of the voidness in codex and the homogeneity of the new hypotheses with respect to the normative concept both for what regards the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>invalidity</b> "special" both for what concerns the discipline...|$|E

40|$|The The Diploma Thesis {{deals with}} the {{institute}} of Catholic marriage, also called matrimony, and aims to provide detailed analyses on nullity of matrimony due to invalidity of matrimonial consent and its declaration. Firstly, the Thesis states a definition of matrimony with respect to Sacrament of Marriage being governed by the divine law, the canonical law, and, in regards to certain effects, the civil law. Pursuant to Code of Canon Law [CIC], 1983, canon 1055, § 1, the matrimonial covenant, by which {{a man and a}} woman establish between themselves a communion of the whole life, is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and procreation and education of offspring. Hence, marriage is a contract by which {{a man and a woman}} become irrevocably united, the Code of Canonic Law set up essential properties of marriage obligationes matrimonii essentialis, which are not to be excluded by either contractants. The Thesis further provides commentary on the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> the <b>invalidity</b> of the matrimonial consent, by descripting the reasons for nullity of matrimony which are defined by the Code of Canon Law, and can be grouped under these main causes: serious mental incapacity, incapacity to assume obligations, ignorance, error of person,simple error, fraud, simulation, conditional marriage, force and [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Revocation and Invalidity of European Trade Mark Revocation and {{invalidity}} of European trade mark, {{more precisely}} termed as Community trade mark (hereinafter as "CTM"), {{is a specific}} field of trade mark law of the European Union. It is Council Regulation (EC) No 207 / 2009 of 26 February 2009 on the Community trade mark which forms a legal basis in this regard. The practice of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market and especially the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union play very significant role in this area. The practice of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market and the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding Directive 2008 / 95 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 to approximate {{the laws of the}} Member States relating to trade marks is also relevant for the revocation and invalidity of CTM as this Directive provides for the revocation and invalidity of national trade marks in similar manner. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the nature of revocation and invalidity of CTM and individual <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> revocation and <b>invalidity</b> as well as selected related issues, e. g. of procedural nature.

Simultaneous measurements are also performed on equivalent clamped-clamped beams. All experimental results are quantitatively and accurately predicted using elasticity theory.

40|$|Summary: Often {{competing}} hypotheses for biochemical networks {{exist in}} the form of different mathematical models with unknown parameters. Considering available experimental data, it is then desired to reject model hypotheses that are inconsistent with the data, or to estimate the unknown parameters. However, these tasks are complicated because experimental data are typically sparse, uncertain, and are frequently only available in form of qualitative if–then observations. ADMIT (Analysis, Design and Model Invalidation Toolbox) is a MatLabTM-based tool for guaranteed model invalidation, state and parameter estimation. The toolbox allows the integration of quantitative measurement data, a priori knowledge of parameters and states, and qualitative information on the dynamic or steady-state behavior. A constraint satisfaction problem is automatically generated and algorithms are implemented for solving the desired estimation, invalidation or analysis tasks. The implemented methods built on convex relaxation and optimization and therefore provide guaranteed estimation results and certificates <b>for</b> <b>invalidity...</b>|$|R

In this Article, we critically evaluate judicial application of the functionality doctrine in design protection systems, focusing on the U. S. design patent and EU design protection regimes. We argue that the doctrine as applied in these settings is too often aimless and inconsistent. Some simple doctrinal refinements would help, particularly in the U. S., where the Federal Circuit should definitively adopt the “dictated by” standard and should distinguish explicitly between functionality <b>for</b> <b>invalidity</b> purposes and functionality for scope purposes. Ultimately, a more carefully-considered theoretical justification for the functionality doctrine in design protection systems is needed, one that recognizes that trade dress functionality and design protection functionality serve different goals...|$|R
