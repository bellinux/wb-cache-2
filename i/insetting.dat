The main pillars of a casement may stand for centuries unshaken under the steady weight of the superincumbent wall, but the cement and various <b>insetting</b> of the balconies are sure to be disturbed by the irregular pressures and impulses of the persons leaning on them; while, whatever extremity of decay may be allowed in other parts of the building, the balcony, as soon as it seems dangerous, will assuredly be removed or restored. The reader will not, if he considers this, be surprised to hear that, among all the remnants of the Venetian domestic architecture of the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, there is not a single instance of the original balconies being preserved. The palace mentioned below (§ XXXII.), in the piazza of the Rialto, has, indeed, solid slabs of stone between its shafts, but I cannot be certain that they are of the same period; if they are, this is the only existing example of the form of protection employed for casements during this transitional period, and it cannot be reasoned from as being the general one.|$|E

40|$|M. Ed. An {{assessment}} of in-service training (<b>INSET)</b> programmes {{offered by the}} Department of Education in the Northern Province of the Republic of South Africa was conducted. The {{purpose of the study}} was to assess the effectiveness of the <b>INSET</b> programmes as they were implemented. The assessment was based on a theoretical framework and empirical research. Qualitative research was adopted as a suitable research paradigm to collect authentic data because interviewees' opinions and perceptions formed the basis against which the status of <b>INSET</b> was assessed. Literature about <b>INSET</b> models and <b>INSET</b> provision strategies was reviewed with the purpose of developing criteria of effective <b>INSET.</b> These criteria were built into interview questions that were applied to educators and officials. Empirical data from the interviews was triangulated in order to ensure credibility of the results of this study. Data from educators, <b>INSET</b> coordinators and districts managers were compared to control similarities and differences in the results. Literature control, from similar research studies, was also applied to verify and ensure authenticity of the results of this study. In this study, it was found that the provision of <b>INSET</b> of educators was ineffective. This research indicates that the ineffectiveness of <b>INSET</b> is a product of an interplay of many factors that revolve mainly around the financial and human resources management. This research further shows that the <b>INSET</b> programmes are inconsiderate of the contextual training needs of educators, and there is an uncoordinated <b>INSET</b> services from different providers. Recommendations about improving the delivery of in-service training of educators are made. The recommendations focus on funding, management of partnerships in providing <b>INSET,</b> educator involvement, motivating educators, support and encouragement, educators' needs, <b>INSET</b> staffmg and important factors for <b>INSET</b> scheduling. These recommendations are discussed to show how <b>INSET</b> can be improved if they are implemented...|$|R

5000|$|Great {{advances}} in open airway reconstruction {{were made in}} the 1970s, many of which occurred in Toronto, Canada. In 1971, Fearon and Ellis described a child with severe subglottic stenosis who, after failed dilatations and anterior cricoid split with auricular cartilage graft augmentation, eventually underwent tracheotomy, placement of an anterior costal cartilage graft with buccal mucosa and a stent and was eventually decannulated. Fearon and Cotton further investigated tracheal augmentation using thyroid cartilage (harvested from the inferior border) in African green monkeys and proved that the cricoid could be divided without inhibition of laryngeal growth. [...] In 1976, Fearon and Cinnamond reported on 35 patients operated on using this technique between 1970 and 1976, noting that free thyroid grafts were more feasible than pedicled grafts and that costal cartilage was most suitable for repairing long segment stenoses. They also proposed that shaping anterior costal cartilage grafts with flanges might prevent them from being displaced inward into the trachea. Cotton would later be the first to describe in detail the process of harvesting, carving and <b>insetting</b> an anterior costal cartilage graft along with his success using this technique in 11 children after moving to Cincinnati. In 1973, Crysdale visited Grahne in Helsinki, Finland, to observe an anterior-posterior cricoid split with stent placement and was the first to perform this procedure in a child in North America. A search for less morbid sources of cartilage for anterior cricoid augmentation in neonates allowed Park and Forte (1999) to demonstrate that bilateral cartilaginous grafts could be harvested from the superior aspect of the thyroid cartilage in kittens without airway compromise. Success using this technique was later demonstrated in 2001 by Forte, Chang, and Papsin in a series of 17 children. For more severe subglottic stenoses, Gerwat and Bryce (1974) described the first cricotracheal resection with preservation of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Pearson and Gullane would later report their success using this procedure over the ensuing 22 years in 80 consecutive adults with benign subglottic stenosis. Impressed by the results of Gerwat and Bryce, Monnier, Savary, and Chapuis performed the first cricoid resection with primary anastomosis in a child in 1978.|$|E

Concretely, what is the strongest linearity and the most changeful of the following three sorts of time? 1. The time outputting all cylinders from a block. 2. The time <b>insetting</b> all cylinders into a block. These cylinders were put in order before <b>insetting.</b> 3. The time <b>insetting</b> all cylinders into a block. These cylinders were put at random before <b>insetting.</b> In this paper I use the data which appeared in Otoda's paper(1978). Subjects ares twenty-eight normal children, from two years to five years seven months old. In order to examine the linearity I calculate the Pearson's moment correlation coefficient. In order to examine the change I calculate the regression coefficient. In conclusion, the linearity of the time <b>insetting</b> all cylinders which were put at random into a block is the strongest, and its rate of change is the hardest.

40|$|The {{central focus}} of this study {{concerns}} the impact in Korea of an in-service teacher training (<b>INSET)</b> course on teachers’ classroom practice and their perception change. A qualitative case study involving observation and interviews was carried out {{during a period of}} six months before and after an <b>INSET</b> course. The three-week <b>INSET</b> course itself was observed. This was followed by the observation of five consecutive English lessons given by the two teachers. The teachers also took part in four semi-structured interviews. While the observations shed light on how the teachers implemented what they had learnt from the <b>INSET</b> into their teaching practice, the interviews explored a range of issues. These included their general expectations and outcomes of the <b>INSET</b> course, their perception changes and difficulties in putting new ideas into practice. Interviews also explored their perceptions of longer-term outcomes. The main finding in this study indicated that the two teachers faced some difficulties and challenges in implementing new ideas or knowledge obtained from the <b>INSET</b> course into their classroom practice, and did not do so to the same extent. The contextual differences between the <b>INSET</b> and real practice, the content of the <b>INSET,</b> and lack of school support were identified as constraining factors that limit implementation. The analysis also showed that the teachers’ confidence and motivation resulting from the <b>INSET</b> led to their better career prospects and affected their professional identity. Some important implications from the study for language teacher training are discussed to highlight how the potential impact of <b>INSET</b> could be optimised: (i) <b>INSET</b> should provide ongoing support to promote developmental continuity after the course; (ii) <b>INSET</b> should consider teaching contexts sensitively, especially large classes and limited materials; and (iii) trainees continue their professional development under their own initiative even after the <b>INSET</b> course.

30|$|The {{introduction}} of microsurgery has decreased {{the frequency of}} using the pedicled transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap, owing to its higher incidence of fat necrosis and limitations in flap <b>insetting</b> (vs. the free TRAM flap). We devised an efficient method of using zones 2 and 4, based on the pedicled flap’s vascular anatomy, to reduce fat necrosis and achieve superior aesthetic outcomes during immediate breast reconstruction using the pedicled TRAM flap. Between April 2011 and February 2015, we performed immediate breast reconstruction using the contralateral unipedicled TRAM flap for 136 breast cancer patients. The conventional method (<b>insetting</b> by removing zone 4 and part of zone 2) was used for 83 patients (Group A), and selective salvage of zones 2 and 4 (our proposed method) was used for 53 patients (Group B). Fat necrosis was observed in 17 patients (20.48  %) and 4 patients (7.55  %) from Groups A and B, respectively (p =  0.033). The average patient satisfaction scores at 6  months (comparing the reconstructed and contralateral breasts) were 7.01 and 8.02 in Groups A and B, respectively (p <  0.001). Liposuction to improve the upper-pole contour was performed at 6  months for 13 patients in Group A, although no patients in Group B required a secondary procedure (p =  0.002). Fat necrosis can be reduced via selective salvage of zones 2 and 4, based on the pedicled TRAM flap’s vascular anatomy. Furthermore, superior aesthetic outcomes can be achieved via flap <b>insetting</b> using the three-dimensional concept. Level of evidence Procedure comparison, Level II.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the many challenges faced when designing and developing the automated mapping system {{needed to produce}} nearly 15 million maps to support 2010 census data collection operations. The U. S. Census Bureau used handheld technology to collect and update housing unit locations, addresses, and street features in its address canvassing operation for the 2010 census. The information collected was reflected on maps produced for subsequent field data collection operations. While the use of handheld technology substantially improved the effectiveness and efficiency of field operations, it posed a number of challenges for the development and production of maps for 6. 7 million blocks, each map displaying housing unit locations that had been collected during address canvassing. Map design and development occurred before and concurrently with the uploading of housing unit location data; as a result, cartographic design, scaling, and <b>insetting</b> decisions {{had to be made}} based on a limited set of data from the 2008 Dress Rehearsal, and general knowledge of data in the MAF/TIGER database.

In any {{education}} system “no other single factor determines {{to such an}} extent the quality of education in a country as the quality of the corps of teachers, lecturers and instructors” (HSRC 198 : 180). This factor is of greater significance {{in the context of the}} new South Africa that politiicans and educationists are planning. In planning for a uniary system of education and provincial education departments, the study investigates the organizational aspects of management of In-Service Education and Training (<b>INSET)</b> mainly for teachers in the Natal-KwaZulu region. The primary objectives of the study are: 1. 	To investigate on a macro-level the management of <b>INSET</b> in each of the former five education departments in Natal-KwaZulu region; 2. 	 To establish whether: (a) 	there is common ground in respect of <b>INSET</b> amongst the various former education departments in Natal-KwaZulu; and, (b) 	the different control mechanisms acts as a hampering factor in sharing of resources relating to <b>INSET.</b> 3. 	To make recommendations to the Natal-KwaZulu education authority so that primarily <b>INSET</b> for teachers may be improved. As a background to the study, key terms were discussed and <b>INSET</b> models and methods reviewed. Brief reference was made to change strategies relating to <b>INSET.</b> This was followed by a discussion of national and regional strategies for <b>INSET,</b> agencies and locations for courses. To obtain a better perspective of <b>INSET</b> a scan of <b>INSET</b> provision study involving England and Wales, Scotland and several Sub-Saharan countries was undertaken. A situational analysis of <b>INSET</b> in each of the former five education departments in Natal-KwaZulu was followed by an empirical study. Conclusions and recommendations were then suggested. The major findings were as follows: 1. 	There was no structured, documented national or regional policy for <b>INSET.</b> 2. 	The funding formula for education discriminated against the Black, Indian and Coloured teachers. Funding for <b>INSET</b> was inadequate. 3. 	There was no co-ordination amongst the former five education departments as far as <b>INSET</b> was concerned. 4. 	Structures and staffing for <b>INSET</b> at Head Office were limited. Resulting in and ad hoc provision of courses in most Departments. Valuable human resources at schools in the private sector <b>INSET</b> projects and at tertiary institutions were not used effectively. This was a management flaw. 5. 	The expertise of the inspectorate with respect to <b>INSET</b> was the only common ground that existed amongst the former five education departments. However, such expertise was not shared. 6. 	In view of the foregoing the management of <b>INSET</b> in most departments in Natal-KwaZulu was not very effective...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundRobots {{have allowed}} {{head and neck}} {{surgeons}} to extirpate oropharyngeal tumors safely {{without the need for}} lip-split incision or mandibulotomy. Using robots in oropharyngeal reconstruction is new but essential for oropharyngeal defects that result from robotic tumor excision. We report our experience with robotic free-flap reconstruction of head and neck defects to exemplify the necessity for robotic reconstruction. MethodsWe investigated head and neck cancer patients who underwent ablation surgery and free-flap reconstruction by robot. Between July 1, 2011 and March 31, 2012, 5 cases were performed and patient demographics, location of tumor, pathologic stage, reconstruction methods, flap size, recipient vessel, necessary pedicle length, and operation time were investigated. ResultsAmong five free-flap reconstructions, four were radial forearm free flaps and one was an anterolateral thigh free-flap. Four flaps used the superior thyroid artery and one flap used a facial artery as the recipient vessel. The average pedicle length was 8. 8 cm. Flap <b>insetting</b> and microanastomosis were achieved using a specially manufactured robotic instrument. The total operation time was 1, 041. 0 minutes (range, 814 to 1, 132 minutes), and complications including flap necrosis, hematoma, and wound dehiscence did not occur. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the clinically applicable use of robots in oropharyngeal reconstruction, especially using a free flap. A robot can assist the operator in <b>insetting</b> the flap at a deep portion of the oropharynx without the need to perform a traditional mandibulotomy.

We have to ask ourselves what technology or Technology Education means. Therefore, this study provides the meaning and the rationale for Technology Education in our curriculum. This study also attempts {{to shed light on}} the form of training educators should attend for Technology Education. Although there are different methods of training, for example PRESET and <b>INSET,</b> this study concentrates on various forms of <b>INSET.</b> <b>INSET</b> is chosen because it is a means through which the present need for Technology Education educators can be solved. The percentage of educators involved in part-time study will increase in relation to the number in full-time education. The closing down of some of colleges of education in South Africa reduces the use of PRESET and increases <b>INSET</b> as a means of educator training.
