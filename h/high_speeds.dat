5|$|The ostrich is a flightless bird {{native to}} Africa. It {{is the largest}} living species of bird. It is {{distinctive}} in its appearance, with a long neck and legs {{and the ability to}} run at <b>high</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|E
5|$|The rider applies {{torque to}} the {{handlebars}} {{in order to}} turn the front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance. At <b>high</b> <b>speeds,</b> small steering angles quickly move the ground contact points laterally; at low speeds, larger steering angles are required {{to achieve the same}} results in the same amount of time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at <b>high</b> <b>speeds.</b> As self-stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold, going faster increases the chances that a bike is contributing to its own stability.|$|E

5|$|For most bikes, {{depending}} on geometry and mass distribution, capsize is stable at low speeds, and becomes less stable as speed increases {{until it is}} no longer stable. However, on many bikes, tire interaction with the pavement is sufficient to prevent capsize from becoming unstable at <b>high</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although railroads {{have lost}} much of the general-freight-carrying {{business}} to semi-trailer trucks, they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such bulk commodities as coal, grain, chemicals, and ore over long distances. The development of containerization has made the railroads more effective in handling finished merchandise at relatively <b>high</b> <b>speeds.</b> In addition, the introduction of piggyback flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.|$|E

Civilian casualty reports were conflicting: one resident claimed 15 dead bodies lay in a single street and another that his family were dead under rubble.

5|$|Due to its <b>high</b> <b>speeds,</b> large {{forces were}} applied to the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The idealized bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of the torques that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with the pavement cannot prevent the capsize mode from becoming unstable at <b>high</b> <b>speeds,</b> as Wilson and Cossalter suggest happens in the real world.|$|E

5|$|For safety, Canada's Wonderland uses a ride {{rating system}} that classifies the attractions {{based on the}} {{intensity}} of the ride. The ratings vary from 1, for rides that are calm and gentle, to 5, for rides that have <b>high</b> <b>speeds,</b> aggressive forces, and rapid elevation changes. A separate set of ride ratings criteria is used for attractions inside Splash Works, though the rides are still rated on a scale from 1 to 5.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At <b>high</b> <b>speeds,</b> motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{designed}} as a fighter-like aircraft capable of very <b>high</b> <b>speeds</b> and altitudes, the project was repeatedly scaled back over time and the U.S. Air Force eventually abandoned it. Development was then {{taken up by the}} U.S. Army for a tactical combat aircraft requirement, a sort of high-performance helicopter. In flight testing, the Avrocar proved to have unresolved thrust and stability problems that limited it to a degraded, low-performance flight envelope; subsequently, the project was cancelled in September 1961.|$|E

Before the B-70 was to replace the B-52 in the long-range role, SAC had introduced the B-58 Hustler to replace the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the medium-range role. The Hustler was expensive to develop and purchase, and required enormous amounts of fuel and maintenance {{in comparison to the}} B-47. It was estimated that it cost three times as much to operate as the much larger and longer-ranged B-52.|$|E

40|$|In {{the splash}} of a liquid drop on a deep pool of water, bubble en-trapment occurs over a {{limited range of}} Froude number. Using <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> video {{photography}} at framing rates between 10000 - 100000 fps, the bubble entrapment regime was studied for water drops impacting on a deep pool of water. It is known that a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> jet accompanies the entrapment of a bubble. In this study {{it was found that}} preceding the appearance of the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> jet, a series of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> droplets, having diameters up to a mag-nitude smaller than droplet previously observed, appears. The speed of these droplets were 50 % higher than those formed from the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> jets. We believe that these smaller <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> droplets were the result of a focusing of the ejecta sheet into a thin <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> jet. This thin <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> jet breaks up rapidly on formation and cannot be observed above the bath free surface. In conjunction with the upward <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> jet, an entrapped bubble was found to be expelled downwards from the cavity with a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> downward jet of liquid penetrating into the bubble. If the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> downward jet penetrated far enough into the bubble, such that its length exceeded Rayleighs wave-length for instability, it broke up to form a single drop within the bubble.
