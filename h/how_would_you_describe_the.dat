40|$|M. A. South Africa {{is still}} {{struggling}} to overcome the burden of race, class and gender-based inequality inherited from colonialism and Apartheid (Kieffer, 2003). The main goals of the transformation process include the facilitation of socio-economic development and growth through the empowerment of historically disadvantaged people, particularly poor black women. Throughout the world, governments’ policy documents are increasingly focusing on empowering the poor. Literature indicates {{that there are many}} different interpretations of empowerment, these interpretations are often inconsistent even within a single organiation. Limited material is also available on the practicalities of measuring, tracking and evaluating progress made toward empowerment of the poor. Moreover, although the poor are the target of empowerment efforts little is known about their experience of these efforts. The present study explored poor, black rural women’s lived experiences of participating in an empowerment program. In South Africa, {{the poorest of the poor}} are those rural households headed by black women. Throughout their lives black women from rural communities are more vulnerable to poverty and deprivation. This is increased by the rigidity of societal gender roles. Findings from available research indicate that poverty is not only a social and political problem in South African context, but is also a significant problem for psychological practice especially in the field of mental health. Poverty concerns the issue of individuals and households being denied opportunities and choices most basic to human development. It also deprives people of decent standard of living, freedom, dignity, high self-esteem, emotional expression and respect from others (Saris & Johnston-Roben, 2000). However, the discipline of psychology has not contributed much in the area of poverty and poverty alleviation. By investigating poor rural women’s lived experiences of participating in an empowerment program this investigation aimed to enrich the psychological understanding of the phenomena of empowerment as a means of poverty eradication. It engaged poor rural women in a dialogue with the aim of describing their experience of participating in an empowerment program. In order to ensure that the women's own subjective experiences, interpretations and understandings remained the focal point of the research the existential-phenomenological system of inquiry was employed. A qualitative research paradigm was employed to fully understand the subjective and lived experiences of empowerment as a means of poverty eradication. The data was collected through in-depth, open-ended interviews that facilitated unique and personal descriptions. A pilot interview was conducted with a woman participating in an empowerment program. The pilot study indicated that the research question (<b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> experience of participating in an empowerment program?), combined with other broad open-ended questions, facilitated the attainment of rich, vital, substantive descriptions of the experience being investigated...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the lived-experiences of single-mother students {{in order to understand}} their ability to satisfactorily perform the daily occupations required within their multiple roles of mother, student, employee, friend, and/or daughter. Following IRB approval, single-mother volunteers were recruited from a large, urban, public university. Informed consent was secured and 8 women were individually interviewed for 1 - 3 hours utilizing open-ended questions. The mothers ranged in age from 21 to 38; 5 were undergraduates; 5 were African-American, and all had 1 - 2 dependents. The children’s mean age was 7. 1 years. Observations were noted about verbal and non-verbal communication during the interviews. The analysts maintained reflective journals to discern their own biases and reactions. Member checking was attempted with minimal response from the participants. The researchers individually reviewed and coded the transcripts, and then met 4 times to discuss the underlying meanings of the participants’ responses before reaching a consensus. The analysis was framed within the theoretical dimensions of Matuska and Christiansen’s (2008, 2009) model of life balance. Emergent themes indicated single-mothers experienced high levels of stress on a daily basis as they attempted to fulfill their multiple roles. They expressed an over-arching theme of embracing temporary self-sacrifice in order to eventually achieve a better life for themselves and their children. The findings also indicate the singlemothers struggled in most dimensions of the life balance model. They discussed having (1) a decreased ability to meet basic needs such as nutrition, sleep or self-care, (2) a narrow range of rewarding and selfaffirming relationships since any free time was focused primarily upon being with their children, (3) minimal opportunities to create personal meaning within their lifestyle (unscheduled time was devoted to ‘napping’), and (4) being over-challenged in organizing their time and energy levels to the degree that nearly every moment was experienced as “crunch time. ” However, the single-mother students did express satisfaction in the fifth area of the life balance model: They reported feeling engaged, challenged and competent within their role of student and desired acceptance by their academic community. As a study of how single-mother students struggle to satisfactorily perform their chosen daily occupations, this paper presents a clear picture of the negative implications of life imbalance and adds to the growing body of literature examining life balance. Discussion questions: Even though they were voiced that they were experiencing extreme stress in their daily lives, the single-mother students persevered toward their goal of attaining a university degree. What types of occupations did they engage in that bolstered their health and wellness, even if for a only short time periods? Were they more concerned about their physical or emotional life balance?

40|$|Q. Whose {{photographs}} were more influential {{than those of}} Eadward Muybridge? A. Control’s. In 1968, Burroughs discovered the existence of two Nova Agents, ex-IBM employees resident on Fulham Road, SW 10, {{who claimed to have}} established a computer link with Control (ostensibly on Venus) and offered a means to put questions to Control for a fee of twelve shillings per question. Burroughs took immediate advantage of the offer, sending as many questions as he could afford, usually receiving his answers within a 48 hour period. As we have ascertained, at great cost, this line of communication is still open, deep in dark address space. The Society for Ontofabulatory Research, represented here by Coley and Lockwood, engaged in the Q and A from which we here extract: Q. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> present situation? A. A War Universe. An image-prison. Nothing has changed since the responses Mr. Burroughs elicited. Q. What role does photography play today in this image-prison? A. It’s the old Army game, subvert from within, get your adversary addicted to your vectors. Q. How’s that? A. Decades ago, Mr. Martin, the Man of a Thousand Lies, already divulged that ‘the entire human film is prerecorded’. Pre-emptive control functions through virus negatives, the affective power of pre-personal images seeded within human bodies, set to develop at a given time and desingularize the subject. Circumscription of perception. Q. Yes, we’re still at war with the autonomic scanning patterns of so-called ‘reality’, attentional association lines operating on the basis of compulsive preoccupations. But where is the front line today? A. Neither science nor religion, but magic. In the middle of a battlefield of magical reality. The subtle ‘push or pull’ which exploits the immanent potential of the future, a constellation of universes. Q. Does photography offer any weapons, any chance, for us? A. Yes Q. What is the nature of these weapons? A. The camera is a scrambling device which confronts magic on its own terms. It expresses the power of time travel, the attunement of the present to zones of futurity. Q. Can you be more specific? A. Paraphotographic synchronicity – say, organized and conducted on the street, in walking practices – processes recognition patterns into transformative encounters. Q. The very same that Burroughs called ‘intersection pictures’? A. Yes. Maps. New pre-recordings of a people to come. You should now be {{in a better position to}} understand these processes. Q. Give us a clue? A. Experiments with the weed-like properties of pictures, ‘image vines’ moving transversally, spreading virally and terroristically from small-scale experiments to weird global media events exposing vectoral space. Only then can you create ‘new worlds, new beings, new modes of consciousness’, as Burroughs said. Q. Will these forces of photography succeed in resingularizing subjectivity? A.

The Health Orientation Scale (HOS) was used to evaluate perceived feelings about three situations: (a) <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> your feelings about yourself when you consider your test result? (b) How do you think most people feel when they are told that they carry the CF gene? (c) How do you think most people feel when they are told that they do not carry the CF gene? Comparing the profiles of CF carriers and non-carriers, we found that carriers had significantly less positive feelings about themselves than non-carriers. Carriers as well as non-carriers attribute significantly more negative feelings to most carriers of the CF gene than to most non-carriers. Moreover, carriers of the Cf gene attribute more negative feelings to other CF carriers than to themselves. Analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of carrier status on self-description, as well as a significant effect of carrier status and degree of kinship with a CF patient on feelings attributed to most carriers. Although these results suggest some danger of stigmatization of CF carriers, the cognitive bias of 'illusory superiority' seems to counterbalance some of its effects. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Take a {{look around}} <b>you.</b> <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> your {{surroundings}} to best give {{an idea of what}} everything looks like to someone not there? Maybe you will give a category to the scene, say, ‘bedroom’. You might try to list some of the objects around you, like ‘bed’, ‘lamp’, and ‘desk’. Or perhaps you’ll describe it with adjectives like ‘indoors’, ‘cozy’, and ‘cluttered’. In computer vision, (or more specifically, in scene understanding), {{the most effective way to}} describe a visual scene is also a major question. Of the these three ways of describing a scene, (commonly referred to as categorization, scene parsing, and attribute-based representation respectively), categories have historically been the method of choice. In categorization, an image (scene) is allowed to fall into exactly one of an arbitrary number of buckets. Attribute representations, however, are typically composed of several sets of buckets each of which will have a value associated with that scene. For instance, a simple category-based model would place an image in one of urban/rural/room, whereas a binary attribute-based model would have as attributes indoors and warm, each of which are marked as either present or not. In larger models, this leads to high dimensionality for attribute-based models, which has been a large disincentive for its use. In addition, classifying a scene’s entire attribute set non-trivially falls unde...|$|R
30|$|For each {{eligible}} subject, {{a single}} caregiver {{was instructed to}} complete the GRCD, Parent Global Impression of Severity (PGIS), and Parent Global Impression of Change (PGIC), the last two of which {{were used in the}} validation analyses of the GRCD [13, 14]. The PGIS (“On average, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> your child’s RSV symptoms right now?” 1 [*]=[*]“Mild” 2 [*]=[*]“Moderate,” 3 [*]=[*]“Severe,” or 4 [*]=[*]“Very Severe”) was completed once at the initial visit while the PGIC (“Since the start of the study, my child’s RSV symptoms are ___” 1 [*]=[*]“Very much improved” 2 [*]=[*]“Much improved,” 3 [*]=[*]“Minimally improved,” 4 [*]=[*]“No change” 5 [*]=[*]“Minimally worse,” 6 [*]=[*]“Much worse,” or 7 [*]=[*]“Very much worse.”) was recorded daily for 13 consecutive days starting the day after enrollment. Caregivers were asked to complete the GRCD by recording their responses directly into an Internet portal or on a paper-based version of the questionnaire (for those without Internet access) twice daily for 14  days— 10 daytime symptoms were recorded in the evening (“since your child awoke this morning until you put your child to bed”) and 9 nighttime symptoms were recorded in the morning (“in the morning after your child has woken up for the day”). GRCD items are scored on 5 - to 6 -point ordinal rating scales assessing severity, with an additional option of “I don’t know” for items assessing overnight symptoms. The schedule of key events is included in the Additional file (Additional file 1 : Table S 2, online).|$|R
40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} {{in response to}} a set of four questions submitted by the International Energy Agency`s (IEA) Energy Technology Policy Division to the US Department of Energy`s Office of Energy Research. The IEA`s questions all center on trends in US industrial energy R{ampersand}D spending over the decade 1985 [...] 1995. IEA has asked all of its member countries similar questions and intends to use the resulting multi-country data set on trends in private-sector energy R and D as basis for discussions at its October 16, 1996, Governing Board Meeting. This report first describes the principal data sets used with caveats about their shortcomings, then characterizes the context of US R and D spending over the recent past and short-term future. The remainder of the report is organized by addressing each of the four IEA questions. The appendices provide further information. IEA Question {number_sign} 1 : Are industry (energy) R and D expenditures monitored by the US Government? If so, please describe the types of data that are collected. Question {number_sign} 2 : How much money did industry spend to support energy technology development in your country in the following years: 1985, 1993, 1994, 1995 ?

In a survey of my Facebook friends, I found that people rarely give scientists descriptors like great orators or teachers. This problem points to a weakness in {{a key component of}} being a scientist and following the process of the scientific method – communication. In one of my graduate courses, we were asked to interview a faculty member about how they communicate science to various audiences. I chose to interview Dr. Joshua Weiner, the instructor of a Developmental Neurobiology course. This molecular neuroscience-heavy class covered how the developing brain orchestrates complex signaling cascades that eventually form the most intricate organ in the body (see Figure), yet Dr. Weiner made the class material clear and enjoyable. I had a hunch that he would have some good suggestions for science communication, so I drafted some interview questions, tested out my recorder for the first time, and set up an interview with him, featured in the audio clip above. I expected Dr. Weiner 2 ̆ 7 s advice to echo what I had heard previously; to tailor your information for the specific audience, to use visual aids, and to reiterate key messages. Although he did agree with all of these communication tools, Dr. Weiner 2 ̆ 7 s empathy and understanding towards his students struck me during the interview. This advocacy for compassion in a world of science that can be very detached from emotions and feelings served as a reminder for me to put myself in other people 2 ̆ 7 s shoes in science communication and in all aspects of my life...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between educational level and self-reported health in an Iranian population, in order to provide evidence on social inequalities in health from a country in which such data need to be collected. Methods This population-based study was carried out in Tehran, Iran. Individuals aged 15 years and over were interviewed. Self-reported health was measured by asking each individual to respond to the question: "In general <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> your health at present?" We used years of formal education as a measure of socioeconomic status and categorized the answers in five levels. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals indicating the contribution of educational level to self-reported health, adjusting for age, gender, marital status, and chronic diseases. Results In all, 4163 individuals were interviewed. The mean age of the respondents was 35. 1 years (SD = 16. 0); 52 % were female; the mean duration of formal education was 10. 0 years (SD = 4. 5); and 31 % rated their health 'less than good'. Overall, women rated their health more poorly than men (P Conclusion The findings indicated an inverse relationship between educational level and self-rated health, and that age, gender, and chronic conditions had independent effects on self-reported health status. The findings of this first study from Iran suggest that health inequalities in developing countries such as Iran need to be addressed and policies for tackling the problem should be considered. In this respect, less well-educated people and women should be seen as the first target populations. It seems that although expanding the educational system might help the state to provide people with more educational options, it is also necessary to ensure that equal opportunities and access to quality education are provided for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds; otherwise the current situation might cost the government more in the long term because of poor health among disadvantaged groups. </p...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the global}} and local {{response}} to the HIV epidemic, the disclosure of HIV status in the workplace is still a problem globally and in South Africa, due to the stigma attached to the disease. However, often, by “going public” about their HIV status, HIV infected people give a face to the disease. This however {{has not been the}} case in the workplace due to fear of discrimination and stigma (Lutaaya, 1999; Van der Borght, van,Janseens, der Loeff, Kajemba, Rijckborst, Lange&de Wet, 2009 : 676). It has been discovered that HIV and AIDS are not only medical problems but a psycho-social issue as well. Adding to the problem of HIV status disclosure in South Africa prior to 2010, HIV and AIDS were met with denial and a lack of political will to take action and thus adding to the reluctance in HIV status disclosure. The goal {{of the study was to}} explore the experiences of HIV positive employees in the transport sector after they have disclosed their HIV status in the workplace. A qualitative phenomenological approach was appropriate for this study using in-depth interviews. And as such one question that was put forward to all participants was: <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> your daily living with HIV after you have disclosed your HIV status in the workplace? Fifteen participants from Organisation Alpha formed a sample for this study. Some conclusions based on the findings were that: Participants’ experiences varied from one participant to the other. There were participants who experienced support in the workplace while others experienced isolation and rejection. One issue that stood out was the experience of stigma in the workplace. The experiences felt by the participants were mostly attributed to lack of HIV knowledge in the workplace which needs to be addressed by the application of various strategies and action programmes. The study was concluded with relevant recommendations to the transport sector. CopyrightDissertation (MSocSci) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012. Social Work and Criminologyunrestricte...|$|R
