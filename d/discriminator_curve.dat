40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of correlation shift discriminators {{is carried out}} regarding the stabilization accuracy of their <b>discriminator</b> <b>curve</b> (DC). A modification of the classical correlation discriminator is proposed that provides higher accuracy of estimating a shift between signals. It is shown that the modified discriminator is free of "edge effects. " Â© 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Multipath {{is one of}} {{the main}} error sources when {{tracking}} signals in the GNSS systems. The presence of reflected signals gives place to a bias when estimating the propagation delay of the direct signal. There are several ways for mitigating this multipath problem. Several solutions have already been discussed for different techniques such as Narrow Correlator, Double delta or Early 1 /Early 2 where the key factor concerns the <b>discriminator</b> <b>curve</b> shape to be used in a conventional DLL(delay lock loop) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose the {{derivation}} of the expressions for the non-coherent Delay Locked Loop (DLL) <b>Discriminator</b> <b>Curve</b> (DC) in the absence and presence of Multipath (MP). Also derived, are the expressions of MP tracking errors in non-coherent configuration. The proposed models are valid for all Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) modulated signals in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and Future Galileo. The non- coherent configuration is used whenever the phase of the received signal cannot be estimated and thus cannot be demodulated. Therefore, the signal must be treated in a transposed band by the non-coherent DLL. The computer implementations show that the proposed models coincide with the numerical ones. </p...|$|E
40|$|Differences in {{the memory}} {{characteristics}} of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) were investigated with tests that assess learning and retention of words, line-drawn objects, and locations. Large groups of AD, HD, and PD patients were administered the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) and the Hopkins Board (HB). Eight learning and memory measures were subjected to discriminant function analysis. A 91 % classification accuracy was achieved for the separation of cortical and subcortical dementias and 79 % accuracy for the discrimination of the three groups. The delayed recall of items was the best <b>discriminator.</b> Receiver-operating <b>curve</b> analysis indicated up to 90 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity in differentiating the three diseases using the discriminant scores. Individual learning and memory measures of the HVLT-R and the HB provided very high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing cortical versus subcortical dementias and modest accuracy in separating the two subcortical diseases...|$|R
40|$|Two automatic-frequency-control (AFC) loops are {{introduced}} and analyzed in detail. The algorithms are generalizations {{of the well}} known cross-product AFC loop with improved performance. The first estimator uses running overlapping discrete Fourier transforms to create a <b>discriminator</b> <b>curve</b> proportional to the frequency estimation error, whereas the second one preprocesses the received data and then uses an extended Kalman filter to estimate the input frequency. The algorithms are tested by computer simulations in a highly dynamic environment at low carrier/noise ratio (CNR). The algorithms are suboptimum tracking schemes with a larger frequency-error variance compared to an optimum strategy, but they offer simplicity of mechanization and a CNR with a very low operating threshold...|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} {{frequency control}} (AFC) loop is introduced and analyzed in detail. The new scheme is a generalization of the well known Cross Product AFC loop that uses running overlapping discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) to create a <b>discriminator</b> <b>curve.</b> Linear analysis is included and supported with computer simulations. The algorithm is tested in a low {{carrier to noise ratio}} (CNR) dynamic environment, and the probability of loss of lock is estimated via computer simulations. The algorithm discussed is a suboptimum tracking scheme with a larger frequency error variance compared to an optimum strategy, but offers simplicity of implementation and a very low operating threshold CNR. This technique can be applied during the carrier acquisition and re-acquisition process in the Advanced Receiver...|$|E
