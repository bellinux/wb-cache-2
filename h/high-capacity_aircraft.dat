With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models. The 747SR had an economic design life objective of 52,000 flights during 20 years of operation, compared to 24,600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747. The initial 747SR model, the -100SR, had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from {{a greater number of}} takeoffs and landings. Extra structural support was built into the wings, fuselage, and the landing gear along with a 20 percent reduction in fuel capacity.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a {{methodology}} is {{proposed for the}} conceptual design and optimisation of twin-turboprop Commuter & Regional aircraft suitable for operation over a spe¬cific short-haul route. Using this methodology, the optimum configuration and flight profiles of such aircraft for operation over various stage-lengths can be obtained. By significantly modifying an existing computer code for synthesis and trajectory opti¬misation of Commuter aircraft (CASTOR), a new code (CRAGER) has been developed to estimate the Generalised cost of travel incurred by a passenger for air-travel be¬tween two cities. A new sub-module has been developed for the geometric sizing of a suitable airport as per ICAO/FAA recommendations, and estimation of the Airport cost, i. e. the cost associated with setting-up and operating this airport {{at one of the}} two cities. This module is incorporated into CRAGER. Generalised cost is assumed to consist of the Access cost, Flight cost, Time cost and the Airport cost, and is proposed as a new objective function to be minimised. In an exploratory case study, the efficacy of two stochastic optimisation methods viz. Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) was demonstrated for handling complicated objective functions related to aircraft conceptual design. In particular, the SIMANN SA code was found to be quite robust and easy to imple¬ment, and came up with better solutions compared to conventional gradient based optimisers for multi-modal objective functions. As an example of the application of the proposed methodology, several case studies were carried out for business travel in India, using both CASTOR & CRAGER. Based on a survey of existing regional airports in India, the airports were classified under three levels, enabling estimation of Airport cost associated with operating a specific aircraft. A model was developed for predicting the demand for business travel in India between a metropolitan city (hub) and another city located near-by (spoke). The case studies revealed the non-linear nature of the airport sub-module, due to the airport classification system followed by ICAO & FAA. It was seen that when the annual travel demand is low, the Generalised cost is dominated by the Airport cost and the Time cost. With increase in annual travel demand, however, the Flight costs dominate the Generalised cost, hence larger aircraft have lower Generalised costs. <b>High-capacity</b> <b>aircraft</b> were seen to have a low Flight cost, but this advantage was more than overcome by the excessively high Airport and Time costs associated with them. Compared to pressurised aircraft, the un-pressurised commuter aircraft suffer from severe penalties due to limitations imposed on their cruising altitude and descent profile. Finally, the optimum 50 seater aircraft obtained by CRAGER had better or marginally lower DOC and Generalised cost compared to existing aircraft...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{unconventional}} aircraft configurations, such as Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) aircraft, are being investigated and researched {{with the aim}} to develop more efficient aircraft configurations, in particular for very large transport aircraft that are more efficient and environmentally-friendly. The BWB configuration designates an alternative aircraft configuration where the wing and fuselage are integrated which results essentially in a hybrid flying wing shape. The first example of a BWB design was researched at the Loughead Company in the United States of America in 1917. The Junkers G. 38, the largest land plane {{in the world at}} the time, was produced in 1929 for Luft Hansa (present day; Lufthansa). Since 1939 Northrop Aircraft Inc. (USA), currently Northrop Grumman Corporation and the Horten brothers (Germany) investigated and developed BWB aircraft for military purposes. At present, the major aircraft industries and several universities has been researching the BWB concept aircraft for civil and military activities, although the BWB design concept has not been adapted for civil transport yet. The B- 2 Spirit, (produced by the Northrop Corporation) has been used in military service since the late 1980 s. The BWB design seems to show greater potential for very large passenger transport aircraft. A NASA BWB research team found an 800 passenger BWB concept consumed 27 percent less fuel per passenger per flight operation than an equivalent conventional configuration (Leiebeck 2005). The purpose of this research is to assess the aerodynamic efficiency of a BWB aircraft with respect to a conventional configuration, and to identify design issues that determine the effectiveness of BWB performance as a function of aircraft payload capacity. The approach was undertaken to develop a new conceptual design of a BWB aircraft using Computational Aided Design (CAD) tools and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. An existing <b>high-capacity</b> <b>aircraft,</b> the Airbus A 380 Contents RMIT University, Australia was modelled, and its aerodynamic characteristics assessed using CFD to enable comparison with the BWB design. The BWB design had to be compatible with airports that took conventional aircraft, meaning a wingspan of not more than 80 meters for what the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) regulation calls class 7 airports (Amano 2001). From the literature review, five contentions were addressed; i. Is a BWB aircraft design more aerodynamically efficient than a conventional aircraft configuration? ii. How does the BWB compare overall with a conventional design configuration? iii. What is the trade-off between conventional designs and a BWB arrangement? iv. What mission requirements, such as payload and endurance, will a BWB design concept become attractive for? v. What are the practical issues associated with the BWB design that need to be addressed? In an aircraft multidisciplinary design environment, there are two major branches of engineering science; CFD analysis and structural analysis; which is required to commence producing an aircraft. In this research, conceptual BWB designs and CFD simulations were iterated to evaluate the aerodynamic performance of an optimal BWB design, and a theoretical calculation of structural analysis was done based on the CFD results. The following hypothesis was prompted; A BWB configuration has superior in flight performance due to a higher Lift-to-Drag (L/D) ratio, and could improve upon existing conventional aircraft, in the areas of noise emission, fuel consumption and Direct Operation Cost (DOC) on service. However, a BWB configuration needs to employ a new structural system for passenger safety procedures, such as passenger ingress/egress. The research confirmed that the BWB configuration achieves higher aerodynamic performance with an achievement of the current airport compatibility issue. The beneficial results of the BWB design were that the parasite drag was decreased and the spanwise body as a whole can generate lift. In a BWB design environment, several advanced computational techniques were required to compute a CFD simulation with the CAD model using pre-processing and CFD software...|$|E

The two variants are the GP7270 and the GP7277.|$|R
50|$|Following more refinements, in 1979 the DC-10 Super 60 was {{proposed}} in three distinct versions like the DC-8. The DC-10-61 {{was designed to}} be a <b>high-capacity</b> medium-range <b>aircraft.</b> It would have a fuselage stretch of 40 ft over the earlier DC-10 models, enabling it to carry 390 passengers in a mixed class or 550 passengers in an all-economy layout, similar to Boeing's later 777-300 and Airbus A340-600. Like the DC-8, the series 62 {{was proposed}} for long-range routes. It would feature a more modest fuselage stretch of 26 ft, along with an increased wingspan and fuel capacity. It would be capable of carrying up to 350 passengers (mixed class) or 440 passengers (all-economy), similar to the later Boeing 777-200 or the Airbus A330-300/A340-300/500. Finally, the series 63 would have incorporated the same fuselage as the DC-10-61 as well as all the larger wing of the -62. After high-profile accidents in the 1970s, such as Turkish Airlines Flight 981 and American Airlines Flight 191, the trijet's reputation was seriously damaged by doubts regarding its structural integrity. For these reasons, and due to a downturn in the airline industry, all work on the Super 60 was stopped.|$|R
5000|$|The {{award of}} a five-year licence by the CAB in October 1966 to engage in cargo and {{passenger}} charter operations including all-expense tour charters between the US and points in Canada and Mexico enhanced Modern Air's new status as a permanently certificated US supplemental carrier. Following the award of these new foreign charter rights, the airline concluded a US$17.5 million purchase agreement with American Airlines to acquire five of the latter's Convair CV-990A jetliners between January 1967 and February/March 1968, in anticipation of major growth for low-cost overseas travel by US tour groups. The first two examples sported a new natural metal [...] "Silver Palace" [...] livery, which replaced the Modern Air Transport/MAT fuselage titles used in previous schemes with Modern Air titles. Modern Air's first jet, Convair CV-990A N5609, was {{handed over to the}} airline in February 1967. It was based in Miami and contracted by GAC to operate charter flights for prospective investors in its real estate development projects in Florida and Arizona. Modern received its second CV-990A, N5605, the following month. This aircraft was repainted in the contemporary Air France livery, in preparation of a short-term wet lease beginning in April that enabled the French national airline to introduce <b>high-capacity</b> jet <b>aircraft</b> on four daily round trips between Paris Orly and London Heathrow while awaiting delivery of its own Boeing 727-200s. Modern Air's CV-990s were configured in a spacious 139-seat, single-class seating arrangement. The aircraft's standard flight deck crew complement comprised three, including a flight engineer holding a mechanic's and inspector's licence. On flights involving long overwater sectors a navigator supplied by a third party joined the other three flight deck crew.|$|R
40|$|Together Amsterdam Airport Schiphol {{airport and}} KLM form the largest {{chunk of the}} Dutch air {{transport}} industry. As the market for air transport in the Netherlands itself is too small, KLM developed a worldwide route network with many transferring passengers. Schiphol facilitates connecting passengers with the best possible experience. During prosperous times this business model can create leverage in growth for an airline network. But due to the small margins in the air transport market, this business model is proving vulnerable during failing times. New carriers from the Gulf region have copied KLM’s business model. Significant cost advantages (and some critics even claim state aid), have allowed these carriers to grow rapidly. Thanks to additional advantages, the Gulf carriers can outcompete legacy European carriers, including KLM. The social and economic effects of air transport are many-sided: direct, indirect and catalytic it stimulates a nation. This research elaborates on the air transport system, {{with a focus on}} the Dutch situation, with the main question “How do the Gulf carriers influence the economic contribution of air transport to the Dutch society?”. Using a mixed method approach, most issues are addressed with a small quantitative analysis, though the underlying structure is unravelled with a qualitative approach. Various methods are used, emphasizing on the various aspects of this research: a theoretical framework on influences and change, a study of the contribution of KLM to the Dutch society and the possible futures for the Gulf carriers. Theoretically the air transport system consists of three sub systems: technology, market size and regulation. All sub systems are equally important, and have contributed to the evolution of the system into its current form. This structure is constantly subjected to changes, from both an endogenous and exogenous nature, resulting in temporary and permanent systemic transformations. The changes in market size of the various air traffic markets (Europe, U. S., Asia) over the years (due to globalisation) have fundamentally altered the air transport system, and enabled the Gulf carriers to take a key position in the system, as intermediaries between the old economies and Asia. Technology- and regulation-wise the Gulf carriers are docile to the old economies, although on the latter aspect early signs of trying to take a substantial role are visible. The Dutch government considers KLM as very valuable for the Dutch GDP, both in a direct sense as well as indirectly via Schiphol airport, as a large employer and connector to the world – for tourists and business alike. Over half of the operations currently undertaken at Schiphol airport are attributable to KLM. However given the abovementioned trend in air transport, it is questionable whether KLM is irreplaceable. Wider effects of this possible event – for example de- or re-hubbing of Schiphol – are uncertain, partly due to a missing political vision. Looking at examples of re-hubbing at Brussels, Budapest and Zürich airports, volume wise the impact of a defunct airline on the hub-function of an airport is limited. But in terms of connections and network, multiple visions are possible. When the Gulf carriers are analysed, one cannot but conclude that they employ similar business strategies. Emirates uses large, <b>high-capacity</b> <b>aircrafts</b> and high frequencies to forge its own airline network. Etihad buys airlines {{all over the world to}} create an equity alliance. Qatar resembles the more traditional strategy, cooperating in one of the old alliances. Looking at this strategic differences is interesting, as they can lead to different outcomes, when costs become an issue more than they do now, for instance due to a decrease in government funding of air transport. Emirates seems to have the most stable financial outlook, with reasonable ticket fares and a stable network. The other two might be more dependent on external sources of funding (i. e. government money), which could undermine a part of their business model. The research concludes that there is a possible future perspective which the Gulf carriers are a threat to KLM, eroding the profitability of its network – especially transfer passengers from the UK. This can be reflected in the operational volumes at Schiphol, and thus the Dutch GDP. However this assessment is dependent of the political vision used. De-hubbing theory and practise show volume wise a ceasing hub airline is not significantly affecting an airport. But in another perspective, for instance connectivity, de-hubbing can lead to a significant decrease in destinations, and thus network quality. Without government interaction it is likely the Gulf carriers will evolve to a role that is comparable with other competitors of KLM at Schiphol. Currently their operations at Schiphol do not erode KLM’s network. Consequently, it could be concluded that the Gulf carriers are a valuable addition to the Dutch air transport system that increases the network quality and connectivity, without derogation of KLM at Schiphol. Despite this seemingly comfortable conclusion, there is a point of attention. Currently the Dutch government does recognise the importance of a strong network, but has no policies in force to ensure the current network quality. Without a clear vision and policies by the Dutch government on the role of air transport, it is not possible to answer the question of the effects of the Gulf carriers to Dutch society, as answers cannot be interpreted.
