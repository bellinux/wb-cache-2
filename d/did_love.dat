It {{has been suggested}} that Mackenzie was the basis for the character Mr Cathcart in D.H. Lawrence's The Man who Loved Islands, about a man who moved to ever smaller islands much as Mackenzie moved from Herm to the smaller Jethou, but Lawrence himself denied it. At one point Mackenzie threatened to sue. However, Mackenzie <b>did</b> <b>love</b> islands and would graduate from Herm to the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I <b>did</b> <b>love</b> the richness of that video. To me it felt like a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E
5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues that Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her. The only reason Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced {{her in that}} direction and she ended up getting in over her head. By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels that Lana <b>did</b> <b>love</b> Lex, and {{that she did not}} make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. Dries believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E

In 1998 Lionel realized he really <b>did</b> <b>love</b> Kirsty but missed her by seconds as she left Ferndale. He was shocked to discover he had an illegitimate teenage son - Luke Billingham (Greg Freeman) and he started to date Mackenzie (Ingrid Park). The two married in 1999 but shortly after the wedding, Lionel discovered evidence to suggest his wife had tried to murder Oscar (Christopher Brown) and was washed off a rock whilst trying to escape her. His body was never recovered, however his wallet was found.|$|E

500|$|In London, Anne {{adopted a}} {{cosmopolitan}} lifestyle, while James preferred {{to escape the}} capital, most often at his hunting lodge in Royston. Anne's chaplain, Godfrey Goodman, later summed up the royal relationship: [...] "The King himself was a very chaste man, and there was little in the Queen to make him yet they <b>did</b> <b>love</b> as well as man and wife could do, not conversing together." [...] Anne moved into Greenwich Palace and then Somerset House, which she renamed Denmark House. After 1607, she and James rarely lived together, by which time she had borne seven children and suffered at least three miscarriages. After narrowly surviving the birth and death of her last baby, Sophia, in 1607, Anne's decision to have no more children may have widened the gulf between her and James.|$|E
500|$|The {{nation was}} shocked. Shops put up their shutters. The Prince of Wales wrote to Queen Victoria, [...] "Gladly would I have given {{my life for}} his".

[...] His younger brother Prince George wrote, [...] "how deeply I <b>did</b> <b>love</b> him; & I {{remember}} with pain nearly every hard word & little quarrel I ever had with him & I long to ask his forgiveness, but, alas, it is too late now!" [...] George took Albert Victor's place in the line of succession, eventually succeeding to the throne as George V in 1910. Drawn together during their shared period of mourning, Prince George later married Mary himself in 1893. She became queen on George's accession.|$|E

This fragile, malleable, devastated child, basically, is sitting there without anybody to comfort him, and if she had been there, he wouldn't have gone out that window. She failed him, and she alone failed him here." [...] Benioff continued about portraying the mindset of Cersei Lannister, saying [...] "I think the idea of Cersei without her children is a pretty terrifying prospect. It was the one thing that really humanized her, you know, her love for her kids. And as much of a monster as she could sometimes be, she was a mother who truly really <b>did</b> <b>love</b> her children, and now those children are gone, and all she's got is power." [...] In a subsequent interview after the episode airing, Weiss stated that Cersei's mindset following the ramifications of this episode will {{play an important role in}} the story for the next season.|$|E

500|$|According to writer Brian Peterson, where Clark brings [...] "angst" [...] and [...] "depth" [...] to his {{relationship}} with Lana, Jason is designed to bring [...] "joy", [...] "levity", and [...] "fun". On the topic of Jason's relationship with Lana, Ackles believes the character <b>did</b> <b>love</b> Lana, because he saw an innocence in her {{that had not been}} able to experience growing up in the upper class society; Jason grew up having to question the actions of his mother, and with Lana he had the opportunity to experience an honest relationship. Ackles was Gough and Millar's first choice to play Jason Teague, as the actor had been the runner up for the role of Clark Kent when they were casting for the pilot. Ackles was contracted to remain through season five, but was written out of the show in the season four finale, which, according to Ackles, was due to his commitments to the WB's new series Supernatural. Gough contends that Supernatural did not alter any of their plans, and that Jason Teague was intended to be a single season character.|$|E
500|$|Toby Whithouse {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} different episode, but Moffat and Wenger thought it was too similar to other episodes in the series and Whithouse wrote [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] instead, while his original episode was pushed to the next series. Whithouse was asked to write [...] "a big bold romantic episode" [...] {{that would be a}} [...] "good jumping off point" [...] for new viewers to Doctor Who. Moffat figured that {{in the middle of the}} series a viewer could [...] "start watching it again" [...] and that it should be [...] "something romantic and funny". For the next episode, Moffat asked comedy writer Simon Nye to write a story that challenged the relationship between Amy and the Doctor. The episode, titled [...] "Amy's Choice", was intended to be Amy's decision between excitement with the Doctor or life with Rory. The scene in which Rory dies in the false reality was intended to be when Amy realised her feelings for him. Nye wanted to stress that Amy really <b>did</b> <b>love</b> Rory and he was not [...] "just a cypher boyfriend or fiancé".|$|E
500|$|While in Paris, Lana {{begins a}} new romantic {{relationship}} with Jason Teague. Kreuk believes that Lana <b>did</b> <b>love</b> Jason Teague, {{but she also}} still loved Clark at the same time. With Clark, it was the [...] "first love" [...] that she never {{had the chance to}} discover, and that lingered with her while she was in Paris during the space between seasons three and four. According to Kreuk, before Lana can experience successful relationships with other people she will need to know {{what it is like to}} truly be in a relationship with Clark, because of the [...] "intense connection between [...] two". Allison Mack shares her insight into the relationship between Clark and Lana, believing that the pair should have remained apart until they could finally be honest with each other: [...] "There's no honesty in their relationship, and there's no way that they could have a healthy relationship without that honesty [...] You can't be with someone if you're not honest with them." [...] Kreuk echoes Mack's sentiments, acknowledging that Lana is not stupid, and if Clark wants a real relationship then he is going to have to be honest with her.|$|E

All the demi-gods and demi-goddesses are so afflicted.

[...] It's shown that Noah {{started out as a}} too-honest used-car salesman who had a pregnant wife until she was killed by a man with telekinetic powers during a robbery which sent Noah after him looking for revenge. [...] He also becomes a lot less honest. [...] When he finds a man with powers, Noah demands the location of the killer's location which the man doesn't know and attacks him. [...] Noah is forced to kill the man, the first time he ever killed anyone and this brings him {{to the attention of the}} Company who recruits him. [...] In order to curb his more violent tendencies towards specials, they have him marry Sandra who is a waitress at a restaurant where he and Thompson eat together. [...] Though Claire is horrified by the origin of her parents marriage, Noah assures her he really <b>did</b> <b>love</b> Sandra despite their arranged marriage and her opinion of Noah doesn't change for the worse, so Samuel locks them in a trailer together and buries them underground {{in order to}} force Claire to witness his death while she survives due to her powers.|$|E

I {{remember}} that, because while we were recording it I was playing the bass drum with a maraca {{in one hand and}} a tambourine in the other." [...] John Lennon in Anthology stated: [...] "We'd had a top 30 entry with 'Love Me Do' and we really thought we were on top of the world. Then came 'Please Please Me'—and wham! We tried to make it as simple as possible. Some of the stuff we've written in the past has been a bit way-out, but we aimed this one straight at the hit parade. … We almost abandoned it as the b-side of 'Love Me Do'. We changed our minds only because we were so tired the night we <b>did</b> <b>Love</b> Me Do. We'd been going over it a few times and when we came to the question of the flipside, we intended using 'Please Please Me'. Our recording manager, George Martin, thought our arrangement was fussy, so we tried to make it simpler. We were getting very tired, though, and we just couldn't seem to get it right.
