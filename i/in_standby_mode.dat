2500|$|The Wii was {{released}} {{during the holiday}} season of 2006 worldwide. The system features the Wii Remote controller, which {{can be used as a}} handheld pointing device and which detects movement in three dimensions. Another notable feature of the console is WiiConnect24, which enables it to receive messages and updates over the Internet while <b>in</b> <b>standby</b> <b>mode.</b> It also features a game download service, called [...] "Virtual Console", which features emulated games from past systems. Since its release, the Wii has spawned many peripheral devices, including the Wii Balance Board and Motion Plus, and has had several hardware revisions. The Wii Family Edition variant is identical to the original model, but is designed to sit horizontally and removes the GameCube compatibility. The Wii Mini is a smaller, redesigned Wii which lacks GameCube compatibility, online connectivity, the SD card slot and Wi-Fi support, and has only one USB port unlike the previous models' two. , Nintendo reports sales of 101.63 million Wii hardware units and 914.28 million Wii software units worldwide, making it Nintendo's best-selling home video game console.|$|E

40|$|Automated home {{applications}} are {{to ease the}} use of technology and devices around the house. Most of the electronic devices, like shutters or entertainment products (Hifi, TV and even WiFi), are constantly <b>in</b> a <b>standby</b> <b>mode,</b> where they consume a considerable amount of energy. The <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> is necessary to react to commands triggered by the user, but the time the device spends <b>in</b> a <b>standby</b> <b>mode</b> is considered long. In our work, we present a receiver that is attached to home appliances that allows the devices to be activated while they are completely turned off {{in order to reduce the}} energy consumed <b>in</b> the <b>standby</b> <b>mode.</b> The receiver contains a low power wake-up module that reacts to an addressable acoustic 20 -kHz sound signal that controls home devices that are connected to it. The acoustic wake-up signal can be sent by any kind of speaker that is available in commercial smartphones. The smartphones will operate as transmitters to the signals. Our wake-up receiver consists of two parts: a low power passive circuit connected to a wake-up chip microcontroller and an active micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) microphone that receives the acoustic signal. A duty cycle is required to reduce the power consumption of the receiver, because the signal reception occurs when the microphone is active. The current consumption was measured to be 15 μA in sleep mode and 140 μA in active mode. An average wake-up range of 10 m using a smartphone as a sender was achieved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a new power minimizing method by optimizing supply voltage control and minimizing leakage <b>in</b> active and <b>standby</b> <b>modes,</b> respectively. <b>In</b> the active mode, {{the control system}} determines the optimal trade-off between supply voltage and the forward body bias voltage to satisfy the performance requirement. <b>In</b> the <b>standby</b> <b>mode,</b> a new optimal body-bias technique in nanoscale CMOS technology is implemented to monitor subthreshold, gate tunneling, and bandto-band tunneling leakage current and reduce leakage current by optimal substrate bias voltage(forward of reverse biasing).

40|$|Low {{supply voltage}} {{requires}} the device threshold {{to be reduced}} {{in order to maintain}} performance. Due to the exponential relationship between leakage current and threshold voltage in the weak inversion region, leakage power can be no longer negligible in such circuits. In this paper we present a technique to accurately estimate leakage power by accurately modeling the leakage current in transistor stacks. The standby leakage current model has been verified by HSPICE. We demonstrate that the dependence of leakage power on primary input combinations can be accounted for by this model. Based on our analysis we can determine good bounds for leakage power <b>in</b> the <b>standby</b> <b>mode.</b> As a by-product of this analysis, we can also determine the set of input vectors which can put the circuits <b>in</b> the low-power <b>standby</b> <b>mode.</b> Results on a large number of benchmarks indicate that proper input selection can reduce the standby leakage power by more than 50 % for some circuits.
