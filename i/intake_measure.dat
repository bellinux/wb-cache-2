The data were collected from 65 schools in six inner London education authorities in 1990, and were analysed using multilevel value added analysis. Some teaching materials using these data have been developed. Details are available at the following website: [URL]. Main Topics : The variables recorded are: GCSE examination scores for English and mathematics; a combined examination score from all subjects; pupil and school identifiers (numerical only); school gender (mixed, boys or girls school); pupil gender; continuous <b>intake</b> <b>measure</b> of reading ability; categorical <b>intake</b> <b>measure</b> of verbal reasoning ability. percentage of children in a school on free school meals, an indicator for social deprivation...|$|E
40|$|Maternal {{consumption}} of dietary methyl donors (DMDs) such as folate, methionine, choline, {{as well as}} co-factors including zinc, vitamins B 2, B 6 and B 12 can lead to permanent alterations in the DNA and gene expression of the developing fetus. This study aimed to identify patterns of DMD intake during the second trimester of pregnancy and their associations with infant birth weight, small and large for gestational age (SGA and LGA, respectively). From food sources alone, most pregnant women were below the estimated average requirement for dietary folate equivalent (DFE) (69 %) and below the adequate <b>intake</b> <b>measure</b> for choline (99 %). Zinc {{seemed to be the}} most important nutrient for attaining adequate birth weight. DFE and vitamin B 12 were positively associated with birth weight. DFE also reduced the risk for SGA whereas choline increased the risk for LGA. Therefore, DMD intake from food sources during pregnancy may be important to ensure optimal infant birth weight...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{discussion}} of the multi-level intake application status of high dam reservoir, this paper takes the Jinping-I hydropower project reservoir in the Yalong River as an example, which is shaped by the highest 305 m high arch dam, and carries out the forecasting research on the reservoir temperature by numerical simulation and physical model testing. This paper studies the intake effect of withdrawing the surface warm water by the stoplog gates inlets and verifies the reliability of the mathematical model by comparative analysis. The results show that for a high dam hydropower station, taking the appropriate multi-level <b>intake</b> <b>measure</b> can withdraw the surface warm water in the spawning season and provide a favorable environment for the fish reproduction. Innovative technical ideas and implementation scheme are adopted in this research. It can provide technical reference for the solutions of similar problems in the future and it also has important engineering significance on the research of water temperature in large deep reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 114, 351 Holstein first {{lactation}} records {{collected by the}} Quebec Dairy Herd Analysis Service (DHAS-PATLQ) between September, 1979 and January, 1994 were used to {{study the effects of}} adjusting records for linear and quadratic effects of 90 - and 305 -d feed <b>intake</b> <b>measures</b> (total energy, total protein and total dry matter) on estimation of heritabilities of and genetic correlations among yield and composition traits. Genetic parameters of feed <b>intake</b> <b>measures,</b> relationships between feed intake and age and weight at calving, and feed conversion efficiency traits were also examined in a series of studies. A sire model fitted by REML estimated heritabilities of 305 -d milk, fat and protein yields, fat and protein percents as. 45 +/-. 04,. 48 +/-. 04,. 44 +/-. 03,. 92 +/-. 06, and. 88 +/-. 05, respectively. Correction of 305 -d records for differences among cows in feed intake levels reduced heritabilities of milk, fat and protein yields to. 35 +/-. 03,. 52 +/-. 04, and. 38 +/-. 03, respectively. Heritabilities of composition traits (fat and protein percents) remained unchanged. Genetic and phenotypic correlations for yield traits were also reduced (48 [...] 170 %, and 16 [...] 51 %, respectively) which may indicate that genetic associations between yield traits are less than what we believed them to be. Heritabilities of 305 -d total energy, total protein, total DM intake, grain energy, grain protein, grain DM, base energy, base protein, and base DM were. 30 +/-. 03,. 24 +/-. 02,. 35 +/-. 03,. 23 +/-. 02,. 23 +/-. 02,. 23 +/-. 02,. 31 +/-. 03,. 26 +/-. 02, and. 40 +/-. 03, respectively. Genetic correlations between feed <b>intake</b> <b>measures</b> were very high; they were approaching unity in some cases. Therefore, any one of these feed <b>intake</b> <b>measures</b> can represent the others. A multi-trait REML analysis estimated heritabilities of age and weight at first calving as. 11 +/-. 01 and. 37 +/-. 03, respectively.

40|$|The {{development}} of the alcohol dependence syndrome and its inclusion in the International Classification of Diseases in January 1979 led to a demand for brief, easy-to-administer screening questionnaires explicitly based on the syndrome. The Short Alcohol Dependence Data (SADD) questionnaire {{is presented as a}} 15 -item, self-report instrument which uses a forced choice, four-point, frequency scale to assess severity of alcohol dependence. The SADD is based on the tenets of the alcohol dependence syndrome and the present work is an attempt to explore its validity and internal homogeneity. In Chapter 4 a series of correlational studies are presented in which SADD is compared with related variables including the Severity of Alcohol Dependence questionnaire (SADQ), a semi-structured interview schedule; the Edinburgh Alcohol Dependence Scale, blood tests, an index of alcohol intake and a measure of the problems resulting from consistent heavy drinking. Chapter 5 examines the internal homogeneity of the scale {{through the use of a}} series of confirmatory factor analyses. A supplementary study is reported in Chapter 6 which explores the meaning of the recent alcohol <b>intake</b> <b>measure</b> used throughout the thesis. Although the validation of such an instrument is an ongoing process the evidence is interpreted as justification for the continued use of SADD, albeit in a slightly modified form, as a valid scale for the assessment of alcohol dependence. The scale also formed a consistent and strong first factor which suggests that SADD is unidimensional...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Oxidative {{stress is}} {{detrimental}} to sperm function {{and a significant}} factor in the etiology of male infertility. This report examines the association between dietary and supplementary intake of the antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene and sperm chromatin integrity. Eighty-seven healthy male volunteers donated semen samples, completed food-frequency questionnaires, and provided information about their sociodemographic characteristics, medical and reproductive histories, and lifestyle habits. Sperm chromatin integrity was measured using the DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and related parameters, obtained from the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA�). SCSA measures the susceptibility of sperm DNA to acid-induced denaturation in situ. After adjusting for age and duration of abstinence, there was no dose-response association between any DFI outcome and any antioxidant <b>intake</b> <b>measure.</b> Non-dose–related associations were found between betacarotene intake and both the standard deviation of DFI (SD DFI) and the percent of immature sperm. Participants with moderate, but not high, beta-carotene intake had an increase in SD DFI compared with participants with low intake (adjusted means 206. 7 and 180. 5, respectively; P �. 03), as well as an increase in the percentage of immature sperm (adjusted means 6. 9 % and 5. 0 %, respectively; P �. 04). If antioxidant intake in the range studied is indeed beneficial for fertility in healthy men, it {{does not appear to be}} mediated through the integrity of sperm chromatin. The results of this study do not preclude possible beneficial effects of high antioxidant intake on sperm chromatin integrity for men with fertility problems...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: assess {{reproducibility}} and {{concurrent validity}} of the questionnaire focusing on a typical physical activity and food intake day (DAFA) to measure physical activity and food intake in children between seven and ten years old. METHODS: sixty nine children recruited {{in a public school}} located in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina participated of the survey. Reproducibility was determined by comparing measures of two DAFA applications in a two week interval while concurrent validity of physical activity was assessed by comparing DAFA with a questionnaire filled by parents/teachers. As for food intake, the reference method was a 24 hour recordatory. Analysis included concordance coefficient determination, intraclass correlation, adjusted kappa coefficient and Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: concordance coefficient was of 88 % (school commuting) and 68 % (physical activity related attitude) while intraclass correlation was of 0. 85 for the general measure for physical activity. Using the report of parents/teachers, the children were broken into three groups of physical activities (low/medium/high), it should be considered that DAFA scores differed significantly. As for food <b>intake</b> <b>measuring,</b> 80 % of concordance was determined between DAFA applications. Interinstrument convergence was substantial/moderate in relation to 17 food items.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{ubiquitous}} {{supply of}} junk foods in our food environment has been partly {{blamed for the}} increased rates in overweight and obesity. However, consumption of these foods has generally been examined individually perhaps obscuring the true extent of their combined consumption and impact on health. An overall measure of children’s junk food consumption may prove useful {{in the development of}} child obesity prevention strategies. We describe the development of a children’s Junk Food <b>Intake</b> <b>Measure</b> (JFIM) to summarise temporal change in junk food consumption and examine the association between the JFIM and health-related behaviours. Methods Cross-sectional population surveillance survey of Australian children age 5 – 16  years collected in 2010 and 2015. Data were collected by questionnaire with parent’s proxy reporting for children in years K, 2 and 4 and children in years 6, 8 and 10 by self-report. Information on diet, screen-time and physical activity was collected using validated questionnaires. The JFIM comprised consumption of fried potato products, potato crisps/salty snacks, sweet and savoury biscuits/cakes/doughnuts, confectionary and, ice cream/ice blocks. Results A total of 7565 (missing =  493, 6. 1 %) and 6944 (missing n =  611, 8. 1 %) children had complete data on consumption of junk foods, in 2010 and 2015, respectively. The 2015 survey data showed that among students from high socio-economic status neighbourhoods, there were fewer high junk food consumers than low junk food consumers. Children from Middle Eastern cultural backgrounds had higher junk food consumption. High junk food consumers were more likely to consume take-away ≥ 3 /week, eat dinner in front of the television, receive sweet rewards, be allowed to consume snacks anytime, have soft drinks available at home and a TV in their bedroom. There was a lower proportion of high junk food consumers in 2015 compared to 2010. Conclusion This is the first study to provide and examine a summary measure of overall junk food consumption among Australian children. The results indicate that junk food consumption among Australian children is lower in 2015, compared with 2010. Still, the public health workforce must continue their efforts as levels of junk food consumption remain of concern among Australian children...|$|E
40|$|Major {{depressive}} {{disorder is}} a devastating disease characterized by intense and prolonged sadness {{and feelings of}} hopelessness and worthlessness. While developments in drug therapy have provided {{some insight into the}} mechanisms underlying depression, investigations employing animal models have provided another strategy for studying the neurobiology of depression. The first generation of these models evolved to evaluate the therapeutic potential of novel drugs, and included the reserpine reversal test, forced swimming test, and the brain-stimulation reward (BSR) procedure. The rationale {{in the case of the}} latter was that since one of the core symptoms of depression is a decreased capacity to experience pleasure, interventions that relieve these symptoms in humans will enhance reward transmission; in animals, this was interpreted from decreases in thresholds for BSR. In the first experiment, we evaluated the effects of paroxetine, an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class, on BSR thresholds and observed only modest decreases in thresholds. These results mimicked the minimal mood altering effects that antidepressants are reported to have in "normal" individuals. Next, as a means of inducing a depressive state in rats, the chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure, developed to model anhedonia, a core symptom of depression, was employed in the subsequent experiments. Its consequences were measured on several indices of depressive behaviours, sucrose consumption (1 and 24 h intake and preference), BSR thresholds, and the forced swim test. Genetic variation was considered by comparing male and female rats of two outbred strains. While CMS produced little change in BSR thresholds, its effects on sucrose consumption were varied; in male rats, we observed an initial reduction in 1 h sucrose intake in Long Evans exclusively, while a CMS-induced reduction on the 24 h <b>intake</b> <b>measure</b> was evident in both strains of female rats, with a greater effect in the Sprague-Dawley group. In evaluating the effects of CMS on forced swimming behaviour, we saw no group or strain difference in the female rats and a notable strain difference in male rats. Long Evans animals with a history of stress significantly reduced the duration of the test engaged in escape-type behaviours on the second exposure to forced swim, as would be expected in animals experiencing learned helplessness, a behaviour characteristic of depressed individuals.

40|$|Background: Energy excess, low {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} intake and other suboptimal dietary habits contribute to an increased poor health and the burden of disease in males. However {{the best way to}} engage males into nutrition programs remains unclear. This review provides a critical evaluation of the nature and effectiveness of nutrition interventions that target the adult male population. Methods: A search for full-text publications was conducted using The Cochrane Library; Web of Science; SCOPUS; MEDLINE and CINAHL. Studies were included if 1) published from January 1990 to August 2011 and 2) male only studies (≥ 18 years) or 3) where males contributed to > 90 % of the active cohort. A study must have described, (i) a significant change (p< 0. 05) over time in an objective measure of body weight, expressed in kilograms (kg) OR Body Mass Index (BMI) OR (ii) at least one significant change (p< 0. 05) in a dietary <b>intake</b> <b>measure</b> to qualify as effective. To identify emerging patterns within the research a descriptive process was used. Results: Nine studies were included. Sample sizes ranged from 53 to 5042 male participants, with study durations ranging from 12 weeks to 24 months. Overlap was seen with eight of the nine studies including a weight management component whilst six studies focused on achieving changes in dietary intake patterns relating to modifications of fruit, vegetable, dairy and total fat intakes and three studies primarily focused on achieving eight loss through caloric restriction. Intervention effectiveness was identified for seven of the nine studies. Five studies reported significant positive changes in weight (kg) and/or BMI (kg/m 2) changes (p≤ 0. 05). Four studies had effective interventions (p< 0. 05) targeting determinants of dietary intake and dietary behaviours and/or nutritional intake. Intervention features, which appeared to be associated with better outcomes, include the delivery of quantitative information on diet and the use of self-monitoring and tailored feedback. Conclusion: Uncertainty remains as to the features of successful nutrition interventions for males due to limited details provided for nutrition intervention protocols, variability in mode of delivery and comparisons between delivery modes as well as content of information provided to participants between studies. This review offers knowledge to guide researchers in making informed decisions on how to best utilise resources in interventions to engage adult males while highlighting the need for improved reporting of intervention protocols...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{studies have}} found an {{association}} between sodium intake and blood pressure. Salt taste threshold {{is thought to be}} another marker of sodium intake. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to assess two markers of sodium intake, 24 -hour-urinary sodium and salt-taste threshold. We also determined the relationship between these two markers and blood pressure. METHODS: Salt taste threshold was measured by the ability of the subjects to discern the taste of salt in graded solutions of saline. Twenty-four urinary sodium was measured by flame photometry in a 24 -hour urine collection. Other plasma and urine electrolytes and creatinine were measured using standard automated chemistry methods. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher salt <b>intake</b> <b>measured</b> as 24 -hour urinary sodium/mmol of creatinine in the hypertensive group, (36. 6 ± 20 mmol/L/mmol creatinine) compared with the normotensive group (14. 8 ± 5. 8 mmol/L/mmol creatinine) p < 0. 001. Urinary potassium was also higher in the hypertensive subjects. When the subjects were grouped into low and high salt taste threshold, the high salt threshold group also had significantly higher 24 hour urinary sodium (30. 3 ± 5 mmol/L creatinine vs the low STT urinary sodium of (19. 5 ± 14 p <. 05). CONCLUSION: Sodium <b>intake</b> <b>measured</b> as 24 -hour urinary sodium is increased in subjects with hypertension attesting to sodium intake as a risk factor for the development of high blood pressure. Subjects with high salt taste threshold also have increased urinary sodium excretion which may predispose them to deveploment of hypertension. WAJM 2011; 30 (5) ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. While it is a presumably {{accepted}} {{fact that}} rural and farming communities represent an important {{sector in the}} life of every nation due to their contribution to food security and nutrition, there is limited available empirical knowledge on their lives. This study intended to explore the health profile of the rural and farming communities in South Africa, and to explore the relationships between the physical and psychological health, the needs and quality of life facets of a specific group of farm workers and to provide guidelines for intervention in the said areas. This objective was achieved through a literature review, empirical study and suggested guidelines for bio psychosocial health promotion. The end product of this study is presented in three separate, but related manuscripts or articles. A holistic conceptual framework was adopted in the literature review and is described in manuscript 1. This overview focused on life on farms and in rural areas through both the social and natural sciences lenses in a parallel and integrative manner. The needs domain was conceptualised in its broad and narrow uses, and health was broadly defined in terms of the World Health Organization's (WHO, 1999 : 6) conceptualisation. The term "rural" was narrowly described {{for the purposes of the}} current study, i. e. according to the typical descriptive aspects of population dynamics, geographic, economic and other social considerations. Although studies from elsewhere in the world were used to provide a clearer picture of rural contexts, the focus was on available local South African literature. The literature review suggested a situation of serious disparities in the lives of the rural communities in comparison to their counterparts living in urbanised settings in South Africa. They suffer poor socioeconomic status, poor access to services, physical infrastructure problems, food insecurity and nutritional problems, physical and mental health problems, and violence and violations of their human rights. Manuscript 2 reports on an empirical, mixed-methods investigation that was conducted on a convenience sample of 52 farm workers (18 - 60 years) from three farms near Potchefstroom, in the North West Province. All participants completed quantitative measures and interviews were conducted with a random sample of 25 participants. As a conceptual framework, health was defined comprehensively in terms of physical, psychological and social dimensions (World Health Organization, 1999). Psychological well-being was defined on a continuum from symptoms of stress to a focus on strengths, capacities, mental well-being or psychological health (Wissing & Van Eeden, 2002, 1997; Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan & Frederick, 1997) and measured with the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC) Scale (Antonovsky, 1987), the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) (Diener, Emmons, Larsen & Griffin, 1985), the Affectometer 2 (AFM) (Kammann & Flett, 1983), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) (Goldberg & Hiller, 1979) the Need Satisfaction Scale (NSC) (La Guardia et al., 2000), and the Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS) (Ryan & Frederick, 1997). Quality of life was operationalised in terms of the Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) (Frisch, 1994). Physical health was operationalised in terms of standardised measures of blood pressure heart rate body mass index, waist-hip ratio and a nutritional <b>intake</b> <b>measure,</b> the Quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (QFFQ) (Vorster et al. 2000). Participants reported relatively poor states of physical health nutritional deficiencies poor mental health and poor quality of life. In manuscript 3 specific guidelines for the promotion of the bio psychosocial health of farm workers were suggested to address the specific and identified problems in an integrated manner. The guidelines were grouped into operational and administrative/bureaucratic interventions. Recommendations were also made for further exploration of the relationship between the farm workers' context and the bio psychosocial health indicators. Farm workers suffer problems of physical and psychological distress as well as shortages of health care providers, lack of the necessary health infrastructure and other social and physical infrastructure amenities. For successful and sustainable interventions health professionals and health workers, policy makers and bureaucrats, human rights activists and rural/farm employee organisations as well as the broader social movement and other interested/affected parties need to jointly contribute to health programmes aimed at addressing the challenges facing rural communities in general, and farm workers in particular.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and {{implementation}} intentions {{have been used}} effectively to explain and influence diet in middle-class, but not exclusively low SES populations. Furthermore, dietary research among low SES populations requires <b>intake</b> <b>measures</b> that are feasible and acceptable. Using three lines of research we evaluated 1) {{the utility of the}} TPB to explain fruit and vegetable (FV) intake, 2) efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of an implementation intention intervention to improve FV intake, and 3) agreement, feasibility, and acceptability of 2 dietary <b>intake</b> <b>measures</b> of FV <b>intake</b> in low SES women. DESIGN: Participants were adult female residents of Boston Public Housing. Study 1 : Using a cross-sectional survey (n= 144), we evaluated the utility of the TPB to explain FV intake. Study 2 : We conducted a pilot randomized controlled implementation intention intervention to promote FV intake (n= 20), and semi-structured interviews to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of the intervention (n= 8). Study 3 : We administered 2 24 -hour recalls, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and structured interviews (n= 36) to determine agreement, feasibility and acceptability dietary <b>intake</b> <b>measures.</b> RESULTS: Study 1 : The TPB construct perceived behavioral control significantly predicted intention to consume FV (OR= 2. 55, 95 %CI: 1. 23, 5. 27) and with BMI, FV intake (βPBC= 0. 37,t(1) = 2. 29,p= 0. 0235; βBMI= - 0. 02,t(1) = - 2. 41,p= 0. 0174; R 2 =. 08,F[2, 130]= 5. 72,p= 0. 0042). Study 2 : Feasibility goals were met for retention and days to follow up, but not recruitment. Participants characterized the intervention as enjoyable. Limited hypothesis testing showed no significant increase in mean FV intake within (control (n= 11) :+ 0. 50, 95 % CI:- 0. 56, 1. 58 servings; intervention (n= 9) :+ 0. 17, 95 % CI:- 0. 85, 1. 20 servings) or between groups (control group + 0. 33, 95 % CI:- 1. 06, 1. 73 servings). Study 3 : Feasibility targets were met for contacts and retention, but not for enrollment. There was no significant association between 24 -hr recall and FFQ measures for fruit (r= 0. 32, p= 0. 09) or vegetable (r= 0. 16, p= 0. 40) intake and no marked preference for method (35 % FFQ; 31 % 24 -hour recall).

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} compare intake {{prediction}} equations with values obtained by direct methods using chopped elephant-grass offered to crossbreed lactating cows with rumen canulas. The experimental design was a 3 x 3 Latin square (three animals and three cutting ages: 30, 45 and 60 days). The equations used for intake prediction (y) were: (1) y= - 1. 19 + 0. 035 (a+b) + 28. 5 c; (2) y= [%NDF on DM]*[NDF intake]/[(1 - a - b) /KP+b/(c+kp) ]/ 24; (3) y= - 0. 822 + 0. 0748 (a+b) + 40. 7 c and (4) equation 2 with values of <b>intake</b> <b>measured</b> directly. The predictions of NDF intake by equations were not different among treatments, {{instead of the}} difference among values measured directly: the 30 day-old had lower intake (5. 29 kg/day) in relation to 45 (6. 57 kg/day) and 60 (7. 31 kg/day) day-old grasses. In general, equations overestimated the DM intake in relation to direct measuring (9. 0 kg/cow/day), with exception of equation 3 which underestimated the intake (7. 7 kg/day). The means of DM intake found by equations 1 and 2 (13. 7 and 13. 4 kg/cow/day, respectively) were similar between themselves and superior in relation to those found by equation 4 (9. 7 kg/cow/day). The <b>intakes</b> <b>measured</b> directly {{were similar to those}} found in equation 4 and higher than those found by equation 3.

40|$|Compensatory {{growth is}} an {{integral}} part ofNew Zealand beef production systems (Nicol and Kitessa, 1997) with restricted winter nutrition followed by good spring and summer feeding enabling a better fit with seasonal pasture production. Purchasers of store cattle (including feedlotters) often prefer animals with a previous history of perturbed growth because they believe they can benefit from higher liveweight gains. Twenty-eight Angus and twenty-eight Simrnental steers were purchased as weaners and allocated to two groups. Group 1 steers, Angus and Simmental, were transferred to a feedlot and adjusted to a concentrate diet of 70 % maize grain and 30 % pasture silage, fed ad libitum.

40|$|This study {{extended}} client-focused {{research by}} using the nearest neighbor (NN) approach, a client-specific sampling and prediction strategy derived from research on alpine avalanches. Psychotherapy clients (N = 203) seen in routine practice settings in the United Kingdom completed a battery of <b>intake</b> <b>measures</b> and then completed symptom intensity ratings before each session. Forecasts of each client's rate of change and session-by-session variability were computed {{on the basis of}} that client's NNs (n = 10 - 50 in different comparisons). Alternative forecasts used linear or log-linear slopes and were compared with an alternative prediction strategy. Results showed that the NN approach was superior to the alternative model in predicting rate of change, though the advantage was less clear for predicting variability.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{of a short}} recall questionnaire for predicting total dietary intakes was tested {{in a group of}} 55 Japanese-American men in 1967. Multiple regression equations, computed from a 1965 study of the same men, were used to predict individual daily intakes of total calories, protein, fat, carbohydrate, and sodium from the reported frequencies of 23 food groups. Comparison of the predicted values with <b>measured</b> <b>intakes</b> in 1967 revealed that differences of 1 0 % or lessoc-curred in a range from 12 persons for carbohydrate to 21 for calories, and those of 2 0 % or less in a range from 2 7 persons for sodium to 4 0 for calories. The 1965 equations showed a general tendency to overestimate the <b>measured</b> <b>intakes</b> in 1967 and a relative tendency to overestimate the low and underestimate the high intakes. Stepwise regression analysis of the 1967 <b>measured</b> <b>intakes</b> on the frequencies reported in the questionnaires resulted in lower multiple R's than the 1965 equations. Except for sodium, the values were fairly dose.
