40|$|The {{origin of}} {{services}} is often {{one of the}} issues that regulators have to address to determine whether there is trade in services. It is also indispensable for the application of preferential trade commitments including national and most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment, among others. This article examines the relevant provisions to ascertain whether there are any defects in <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> for services of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and, if so, how they could possibly be handled. It concludes, first, that there is the twofold typology for the origin rules: general <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> and special <b>origin</b> <b>rules.</b> Second, four defects exist in general <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> for commercial presence, particularly the ownership or control requirement. They are insufficient to determine the origin for juridical persons of equal or scattered shareholding structure or services co-supplied by providers of different nationality. Neither are they always capable of identifying the economic service suppliers and the ultimate owner or controller of suppliers. Third, the application of the general interpretation rule leaves the meaning ambiguous. A substantial input test based on the value added criteria could be adopted as the supplementary means of interpretation...|$|R

25|$|The {{interest}} {{generated by}} the experimental state of origin matches of 1980 and 1981 {{and the potential for}} financial rewards were enough to convince the authorities to play all three games under state of <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> the following year.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, McCabe was {{selected}} to play for both New South Wales and Queensland. He played {{the first two games}} of the series for the Blues and the third game, selected on state of <b>origin</b> <b>rules,</b> for the Maroons.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} authors have argued, quite convincingly, {{that the current}} country of <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> are antiquated and should be change (Lloyd, 1993; Falvey and Reed, 1998; Ho, 1998). The main {{argument}} is that a single country of origin does not fit the reality of global production in the modern world. The logical conclusion is therefore the replacement of a single country of <b>origin</b> (SCO) <b>rule</b> by a multiple country of origin (MCO) description. Whereas a SCO rule is unavoidably arbitrary because of the global nature of production, a MCO description is only a factual, objective statement about the country of origin of the values added {{in proportion to the}} contributions by various countries (Ho, 1998; Lloyd, 1993). Lloyd and Ho have separately proposed tariff and quota regimes that accommodate the multiple country of origin reality and thus are free from the trade and investment diversion consequences that characterize single country of <b>origin</b> <b>rule</b> regimes...|$|R

5000|$|The Association {{competed in}} the second {{division}} of the 1988 Adelaide Bicentennial Carnival, held from 2 March to 5 March. The carnival was played under state of <b>origin</b> <b>rules,</b> so the Association was given permission to play up to five players from the VFL, SANFL or WAFL who began their senior careers in the Association, in addition to any currently-listed Association players regardless of their origin. It {{was the first time}} the Association had played representative games under <b>origin</b> <b>rules.</b> Barry Round (Williamstown) captained the Association team. The Association finished in second place after being defeated by Northern Territory in the Grand Final. Terry Wallace ( [...] , formerly of Camberwell) won the Dolphin Medal as the best player in Division 2 during the carnival, and he was the sole Association player selected in the All-Australian team.|$|R

40|$|<b>Rules</b> of <b>origin</b> {{form part}} of the {{traditional}} trade policy landscape. They are necessary for any government that seeks to distinguish between different foreign sources of supply of a product. This paper provides a basic introduction to the conceptual issues that arise in this area. It discusses both <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> for products and producers, the latter being crucial {{in the context of}} trade in services, and summarizes the results of the economic literature with respect to <b>rules</b> of <b>origin.</b> The intention is to provide a `primer' to this increasingly complex area. The increasing attention being given to <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> by policy-makers and analysts is in large part a reflection of the spread of regional trade arrangements. Much of the analysis therefore focuses on preferential <b>origin</b> <b>rules.</b> Free Trade Areas; Rules of Origin; Trade in Services...|$|R
50|$|Although Lang {{played in}} {{nineteen}} state matches for Queensland, he also played for New South Wales in 1980. The inaugural year of State of Origin contests, only one match of three was played under {{a state of}} <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> and, as a Sydney-based player, Lang was selected {{to play in the}} first match, playing a starring role in the win over Queensland. He then returned to Queensland for the third game of the series (and first ever match between the two states played under the <b>origin</b> selection <b>rule),</b> where Queensland defeated New South Wales 20 - 10.|$|R

Since 1980, Queensland has completed just the 7 series with a team completely made up of players of a Queensland birth, while for New South Wales the total is only 6.

50|$|Queensland's win in game 2 {{ensured that}} the third game would also be played under <b>Origin</b> <b>rules.</b> According to some reports, had NSW wrapped up the series in the second game, the third game in Sydney would have reverted to the old State of Residence rules and would most likely have been played at Leichhardt Oval {{instead of on the}} hallowed turf of the Sydney Cricket Ground.|$|R
