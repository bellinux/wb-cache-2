Rolls-Royce followed 747 engine production with a launch order from British Airways for four aircraft. The option of RB211-524B engines was announced on June 17, 1975. The -200 was the first 747 to provide a choice of powerplant <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> major engine manufacturers.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning a}} clear victory, and as pursuit became too {{hazardous}} near Wake, American forces retired. Spruance once again withdrew {{to the east}} to refuel his destroyers and rendezvous with the carrier Saratoga, which was ferrying much-needed replacement aircraft. Fletcher transferred his flag to Saratoga {{on the afternoon of}} 8 June and resumed command of the carrier force. For the remainder of that day and then 9 June, Fletcher continued to launch search missions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> carriers to ensure the Japanese were no longer advancing on Midway. Late on 10 June a decision was made to leave the area and the American carriers eventually returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins were struck at Philadelphia {{than at the}} other mints during the years the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 were struck there in 1955, fewer than at the Denver Mint or at San Francisco. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins that caused the Mint to {{announce}} in January that the San Francisco Mint would be shuttered {{at the end of}} the year. The 1955 dimes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> facilities are the lowest mintages by date and mint mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in rolls of 50.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} to construct all the circles that intersect three given circles at a precise angle θ, or at three specified crossing angles θ1, θ2 and θ3; the ordinary Apollonius' problem corresponds to a special {{case in which the}} crossing angle is zero for all three given circles.

At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Chongqing was {{reeling from}} {{problems}} such as air and water pollution, unemployment, poor public health, and complications <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Three</b> Gorges Dam. According to analysts, Hu wanted to transfer his ally Wang Yang out of Chongqing before these problems intensified. Bo was initially reluctant to go to Chongqing and was reportedly unhappy with his new assignment. He had hoped to become vice-premier instead, but Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice-premier Wu Yi argued against Bo's promotion to vice-premiership. In particular, Wu was critical of Bo's penchant for self-promotion, and Wen cited international lawsuits against Bo by Falun Gong adherents {{as a barrier to}} his holding higher office.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, US131 {{had been}} realigned as an {{expressway}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Three</b> Rivers bypass to Moorepark. The section of freeway in the Grand Rapids area opened near the southern county line north to 28th Street. This latter freeway segment was extended further south to Wayland {{by the middle of}} 1958. By the middle of 1960, the freeway was extended to M-118 in Martin, where traffic used M-118 to connect back to the old routing. The southern end of US131 was moved to another location on the state line. Instead of running concurrently with US112 between White Pigeon and Mottville, US131 ran directly south of White Pigeon to the state line. In the process, the M-103 designation was swapped with US131.|$|E

Melish had hired sculptor Constance Ortmayer to design the coin, but the Commission of Fine Arts refused to recommend the designs. Members objected to the depiction of Stephen Foster on the obverse, finding no connection between Foster, who died in 1864, and the supposed anniversary. Nevertheless, the designs were approved by the Bureau of the Mint, and 5,000 sets <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> mints were issued and sold to Melish's group, the only authorized purchaser.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, it was a non-fee paying voluntary-aided school, but {{following}} {{local council}} plans to remove this status and merge the Grammar School with a nearby secondary modern school, the governors took the decision to become fully independent in 1983. Now a fee-paying day school, 650 pupils aged 4 to 18 attend <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> counties of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire. Following {{the closure of the}} nearby St Audrey's Convent, a significant feeder for the senior school, a new junior and infant preparatory school was opened in 1997, now known as Magdalene House.|$|E

In his 27 first-class innings, Hassett batted at Nos. 3, 4 and 5, 21 times. Aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> instances in which he batted outside these positions in the Tests, Hassett made 139 while opening in the second match against Surrey {{in place of the}} injured Bill Brown, and 35 and seven not out against Worcestershire and Leveson-Gower's XI, batting at No. 7 and No. 10 respectively.N- An occasional medium pacer, Hassett delivered 12 oversnone in Testswithout taking a wicket. He took 23 catches, the most by an Australian (excluding wicket-keepers).|$|E
5|$|However, Seymour later recanted her story, {{and another}} man came forth {{claiming}} to know {{the identity of the}} real killer.

Despite many requests for clemency, all appeals were denied, and Williams was executed in 1913.

5|$|In 1985, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) {{formed a}} Joint Working Party (JWP) aimed at {{assessing}} discoveries and establishing final {{names for the}} elements in question. The party held numerous meetings with delegates <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria on recognizing an element and in 1991, they completed the work on assessing discoverer statuses and the party was disbanded. These results were published in 1993. According to the report, the first definitely successful experiment was the April 1970 experiment in Berkeley, followed closely by the June 1970 Dubna experiment; thus, credit for discovery of the element should be shared between the two competing teams.|$|E
5|$|In Vietnam, {{heavy rains}} {{produced}} by the typhoon caused widespread flooding in northern provinces. Early assessments from the Vietnamese flood control committee indicated that 60,000hectares (148,000acres) of rice fields were submerged and 6,700metric tons (7,400short tons) of grain were soaked. High winds also caused extensive damage. At least 29,000homes collapsed and 119,000others were left roofless. Additionally, 572 hospitals or clinics were damaged. Several fatalities were reported in the region; however, they {{had yet to be}} verified by October12. Within two weeks of Brian's passage, Typhoons Angela and Dan struck the country, causing further damage and loss of life. Due to the rapid succession of storms, losses resulting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> typhoons are difficult to differentiate. Because of the widespread damage caused by the storms, the Vietnamese Government appealed for international assistance.|$|E
