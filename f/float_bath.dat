40|$|Float {{glass is}} widely used in {{architecture}} and in the automotive industry. During the float process tin diffuses into and reacts with the glass melt. The presence of tin in the glass surface region causes mismatch in thermoelastic properties between the bulk and the surface. This, in turn, can lead to wrinkling of the surface after the glass is subject to a toughening heat treatment. This project involves {{trying to understand the}} diffusion and reaction mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon. A set of partial differential equations describing the important reaction-diffusion mechanisms has been proposed. This mathematical model is based on 3 redox reactions in the glass melt. 6 diffusing and reacting species have been considered, which comprise 3 redox couples, namely stannous and stannic tin, ferrous and ferric iron, and hydrogen atoms and ions. Using guessed parameters, the computer simulation shows the most striking feature of the tin depth profile - the tin hump, which is observed experimentally by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) and Electron Probe Micro-Analysis (EPMA). It can be observed from the simulations that stannous tin diffusing into the glass is oxidised to stannic tin by ferric iron. The tin hump is due to the immobile stannic tin. The shape and location of the hump can be influenced by the <b>float</b> <b>bath</b> atmosphere and the oxidising species in the glass. These features are in agreement with experimental findings. The simulation also reveals that the tin hump forming process is a dynamic process. The Sn(IV) forms and converts back to Sn(II) simultaneously as the hump moves in the glass melt. However, an inverse method has not been found to recover the parameters of the mathematical model from SIMS data. This is due to SIMS's data being only qualitative, as well as the complexity of the model. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

50|$|Only a {{small number}} of Parisians had indoor {{plumbing}} or bathtubs; for most, water for washing had to be carried from a fountain or purchased from a water-bearer and stored in a container, and was used sparingly. Paris had a number of bath houses, including some, such as the Chinese Baths on the Boulevard des Italiens, which catered to upper-class customers. For the working class, there was a row of <b>floating</b> <b>baths</b> along the Seine between the Pont d'Austerlitz and the Pont d'Iéna that operated during the summer. These were basins of river water surrounded by fences and usually by floating arcades of changing rooms. They were open day and night for an admission fee of four sous or twenty centimes. They had separate sections for men and women, and bathing costumes could be rented. They were often condemned by the church and in the press as an offense to public morality, but were always crowded with young working-class Parisians on hot summer days. Some of the <b>floating</b> <b>baths</b> were designed for wealthier patrons, some were used as schools to teach swimming, and some were reserved for women only; one was located in front of the Hôtel Lambert on the Quai d'Anjou.|$|R

40|$|From 1870 to the present, {{the city}} of New York has built and {{maintained}} municipal bathing places including river baths, indoor bathhouses, indoor pools, and outdoor pools, designed around competing motivations of hygiene, recreation, and play. In this paper, I consider {{what it means for}} different groups to play in public space using Caillois 2 ̆ 7 s division of ludus [...] competitive, rule-bound play, and paidia [...] exuberant, unstructured play. First, using historical examples, I show how these notions of play were expressed in two shifts in the construction of municipal swimming and bathing infrastructure in New York City. In 1870, the enclosure of formerly unstructured bathing spaces at the riverbanks, and the establishment of <b>floating</b> <b>baths</b> in the rivers was meant to structure both time and behavior in the water; in 1936, the construction of 11 enormous swimming pools under Parks Commissioner Robert Moses provided bathing spaces, with recreation at the center of their design program and social function. Second, I offer contemporary ethnographic data from two outdoor pools in Brooklyn to demonstrate how rules around acceptable play are differentially enforced inside of the same institution. Through these historical shifts and contemporary variations, I demonstrate how both the construction and everyday use of municipal bathing infrastructure has been the site of an ongoing tension between ludus and paidia, inflected with urban problematics of class and race...|$|R

Another Seine institution was the bateau-lavoir, or floating laundry, where lavandrieres, or laundry women, came to wash clothing and bed linen. They were mostly located on the right bank, where they profited from the sunshine for drying the laundry. By the Restoration, they were very large, and generally had two levels the lower deck had benches or tables close to the water, where the washing was done, and then clothes were taken to the upper deck to dry in the sun. The lavandrieres paid a charge to the owner of the barge for each visit. The last bateau-lavoir closed in 1937.|$|R

Despite this condition he still was able to design ferry landings, <b>floating</b> public <b>baths</b> and a bridge over Breakfast Creek. Such was his courage that he still kept control over his business: when plans were explained to him he ordered the necessary quantities of material and was even able to check the performance of his building workers; he used his cane if not satisfied. The Petries had nine sons and a daughter. With advancing years Petrie handed over more and more control to his eldest son, John, who became first mayor of Brisbane. His third son, Thomas, gained much knowledge of the Aboriginal tribes and their customs and languages. Their house {{was one of the}} social centres of Brisbane and readily offered accommodation to squatters coming from the outback, especially in the days before Brisbane had a few inns.

40|$|This work is {{a report}} on the study of {{hardness}} characteristics of Nickel and Cobalt thin films with and without chromium powder. The coatings are prepared by electrodeposition or electroless deposition [1]. The dispersed phase was Cr particles in a concentration of 50 to 100 mg/l added in the electrolyte, magnetically stirred in 400 rev. /min. - 1 for a few minutes then stopped for a certain period of time. Purpose of this is to let bigger particles settle down on the bottom and only the finest particles <b>floating</b> in the <b>bath</b> evenly. It is shown that many factors contribute {{to the quality of the}} obtained coatings [2]. Thus for instance, the effects of Cr particles on the hardness depend on the deposition conditions. In this work, the chemical composition of the coatings was studied using optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results obtained showed that the dispersed Cr particles were incorporated in the coatings. Mechanical properties of the layers were investigated and revealed different results. For Nickel, the addition of Chromium particles lowered the hardness of the coating; while for Cobalt, the hardness was enhanced significantly.

50|$|To {{support the}} higher-order lenses (which <b>floated</b> in a <b>bath</b> of mercury), exposed {{ferro-concrete}} towers were sometimes buttressed, {{such as at}} Point Atkinson http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:W060326_lighthouse_park_023_adj.JPG in Lighthouse Park near Vancouver BC, Natashquan Point in Quebec, Ile Parisienne in Lake Superior, or at Langara and Sheringham Point on Vancouver Island. In 1910 one of these towers was built at the windswept summit of Triangle Island, 25 mi off {{the northern tip of}} Vancouver Island. However, {{this turned out to be}} a costly blunder; at an elevation of 650 ft, the light was far too high to be visible in bad weather. After 10 years, the lantern was dismantled and brought back to the Coast Guard base in Victoria while the original plan of building a lighthouse at Cape Scott was carried out in 1927.The art of building tall lighthouses using reinforced concrete reached its ultimate expression in the flying buttresses of Estevan Point on the Pacific Coast, at Michipicoten Island and remote Caribou Island in Lake Superior, at Northeast Belle Isle in the Strait of Belle Isle, at Bagot Bluff on Anticosti Island, and at Pointe-au-Pere near Rimouski, Quebec. At 109 ft the latter ranks with Point Amour Lighthouse as Canada's second-tallest lighthouse.|$|R

50|$|An {{isolated}} {{physical system}} may be inhomogeneous, or may be composed of several subsystems separated from each other by walls. If an initially inhomogeneous physical system, without internal walls, is isolated by a thermodynamic operation, it will in general over time change its internal state. Or if it is composed of several subsystems separated from each other by walls, it may change its state after a thermodynamic operation that changes its walls. Such changes may include change of temperature or spatial distribution of temperature, by changing the state of constituent materials. A rod of iron, initially prepared to be hot {{at one end and}} cold at the other, when isolated, will change so that its temperature becomes uniform all along its length; during the process, the rod is not in thermal equilibrium until its temperature is uniform. In a system prepared as a block of ice <b>floating</b> in a <b>bath</b> of hot water, and then isolated, the ice can melt; during the melting, the system is not in thermal equilibrium; but eventually its temperature will become uniform; the block of ice will not re-form. A system prepared as a mixture of petrol vapour and air can be ignited by a spark and produce carbon dioxide and water; if this happens in an isolated system, it will increase the temperature of the system, and during the increase, the system is not in thermal equilibrium; but eventually the system will settle to a uniform temperature.|$|R
