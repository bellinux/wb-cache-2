The defendant's solicitor complained of these, alleging <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> hard to find an unbiased jury. On 8 August 1817, people filled {{the street in front}} of County Hall in Warwick, where the trial was to take place. When the judge, Sir George Sowley Holroyd (a justice of the Court of King's Bench) began proceedings at 8a.m., people rushed to fill the available seating, and the public benches remained full throughout the one-day trial. Because of the nature of the evidence, women were not permitted to witness the trial.|$|E

He left {{them in order to}} deal with the intruder. Thirty seconds later, they witnessed an explosion and a CR.42 fall to the ground while Pattle rejoined them. It is believed he attacked a reconnaissance Dornier Do 17 from Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 ("dive bomber wing 2") which he claimed destroyed, though it appears <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back to German lines damaged. On 8 April, despite bad weather, Pattle led an attack on Petrich in Yugoslavia and left a number of enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground.|$|E
5|$|After the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was {{ratified}} in 1920, the Russian SFSR recognized Lithuanian {{claims to}} the Vilnius Region and continued to support them. In its responses to the 1938 ultimatum, the Soviet Union expressed concerns over Lithuania's independence and threatened to abrogate the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1932. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> clear, though, {{that it did not}} wish to be drawn into an armed conflict. This stance has been attributed to the growth of a threat from Japan; armed assistance to Lithuania would have required the Red Army to invade either Poland or Latvia and could have resulted in a war on two fronts. The Soviets urged France, a major ally of Poland at the time, to de-escalate the conflict and encourage a more moderate version of the ultimatum. France and the United Kingdom, preoccupied with the Anschluss, pressured Lithuania to normalize the relationship with Poland as soon as possible. They feared that the ultimatum had been approved by Nazi Germany.|$|E

5|$|Bednar {{joined the}} theatre {{production}} company Live Entertainment Corporation of Canada, Inc. (Livent) in 1989, {{while it was}} still a division of motion picture exhibitor Cineplex Odeon. Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb purchased the division from their employers in December 1989, as Cineplex looked to offload assets. Originally the assistant general manager of The Pantages Theatre, he became its general manager. In 1993, he moved to North York Performing Arts Centre to prepare it for the stage revival of the musical Show Boat. Livent used Toronto as the test site for the original Broadway production of Ragtime; <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> world premiere at North York Centre in 1996, and Bednar was involved in production. As of 1997, Bednar was general manager of The Pantages Theatre. and general manager of theatre for its parent company, Livent. From 1997 to 1998, {{near the end of his}} time with the company, he spent a year in New York City preparing the Ford Center for the Performing Arts for its opening and that of Ragtime; he had worked on the production previously in Toronto. He was scheduled to oversee the remake of Chicago's Oriental Theatre into the Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars {{at the end of the}} 18th century, Southsea Castle's importance increased once again. In 1797, a French invasion appeared imminent and the castle was urgently readied for action; only eight 32-pounder (1.45 kg) and five 6-pounder (2.7 kg) guns were available and these were in a poor condition. In 1813, work was begun to expand the castle, under the direction of Major-General Benjamin Fisher. Fisher had the work carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian contractors, arguing that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> easier to contain costs and prevent union activity and the project cost an estimated £18,105. The fort was extended north by up to , with the keep and interior bailey redesigned in brick. The moat was rebuilt and a counterscarp galley was built round the edge. Most of the work was finished by 1814 although the final elements were not completed until 1816.|$|E

25|$|The prototype, {{named the}} Stipa-Caproni, first flew on October 7, 1932. Remarkably ungainly in appearance, the plane {{nonetheless}} proved Stipa's concept in that its intubed propeller increased its engine's efficiency, and the airfoil {{shape of the}} tube gave it an improved rate of climb compared to conventional aircraft of similar engine power and wing loading. The Stipa-Caproni also had a very low landing speed and was much quieter than conventional aircraft. Its rudder and elevators were mounted in the propeller's slipstream in the opening at {{the trailing edge of}} the tube in order to improve handling, and this configuration gave the aircraft handling characteristics that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> very stable in flight.|$|E
25|$|It {{turned out}} however that Siam {{was not his}} {{greatest}} adversary. It was the remote mountainous states like Lan Xang, Mohnyin and Mogaung whose guerrilla warfare gave him constant trouble. Many of his men died from starvation and disease while fruitlessly searching for elusive bands of rebels, year after year. (The death toll must have been significant since <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the chronicles.) He was fortunate that a charismatic guerrilla leader like Setthathirath died. In the end, his military might alone could not bring lasting peace. He needed competent local rulers, who commanded respect of the local populace, to rule the lands on his behalf. History shows that he used the political solution instead to maintain peace.|$|E
