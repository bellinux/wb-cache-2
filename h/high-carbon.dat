5|$|The {{reputation}} of Seric iron of South India (wootz steel) amongst {{the rest of}} the world grew considerably. Metal production sites in Sri Lanka employed wind furnaces driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing <b>high-carbon</b> steel. Large-scale Wootz steel production in Tamilakam using crucibles and carbon sources such as the plant Avāram occurred by the sixth century BC, the pioneering precursor to modern steel production and metallurgy.|$|E
5|$|While {{working in}} the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's {{interest}} in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models {{as well as from}} ancient texts that could provide additional information. Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments. He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and low-carbon steel while having two sharp edges of <b>high-carbon</b> steel. Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle. In his assessment of the carved reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) era clothing.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium <b>high-carbon</b> steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of the {{earliest}} production of high carbon steel in the Indian Subcontinent are found in Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu area, Golconda in Andhra Pradesh area and Karnataka, and in Samanalawewa areas of Sri Lanka. This {{came to be known}} as Wootz steel, produced in South India by about sixth century BC and exported globally. The steel technology existed prior to 326 BC in the region as they are mentioned in literature of Sangam Tamil, Arabic and Latin as the finest steel in the world exported to the Romans, Egyptian, Chinese and Arab worlds at that time – what they called Seric Iron. A 200 BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period. The Chinese and locals in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel from the Chera Dynasty Tamils of South India by the 5th century AD. In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing <b>high-carbon</b> steel. Since the technology was acquired from the Tamilians from South India, the origin of steel technology in India can be conservatively estimated at 400–500 BC.|$|E

25|$|Terra preta, an anthropogenic, <b>high-carbon</b> soil, is {{also being}} {{investigated}} as a sequestration mechanism.|$|E
25|$|These {{processes}} are {{most commonly used}} on low-carbon, low-alloy steels, however they are also used on medium and <b>high-carbon</b> steels. Common applications include spindles, cams, gears, dies, hydraulic piston rods, and powdered metal components.|$|E
25|$|High-speed steel (HSS) {{is a form}} of tool steel; HSS bits {{are hard}} and much more {{resistant}} to heat than <b>high-carbon</b> steel. They can be used to drill metal, hardwood, and most other materials at greater cutting speeds than carbon-steel bits, and have largely replaced carbon steels.|$|E
25|$|Bits {{made from}} <b>high-carbon</b> steel are more durable than {{low-carbon}} steel bits {{due to the}} properties conferred by hardening and tempering the material. If they are overheated (e.g., by frictional heating while drilling) they lose their temper, resulting in a soft cutting edge. These bits {{can be used on}} wood or metal.|$|E
25|$|Hooks for {{saltwater}} flies {{must also}} be extremely durable and corrosion resistant. Most saltwater hooks are made of stainless steel, but the strongest (though less corrosion resistant) hooks are of <b>high-carbon</b> steel. Typically, these hooks vary from size #8 to #2 for bonefish and smaller nearshore species, to size #3/0 to #5/0 for the larger offshore species.|$|E
25|$|The carbon {{can come}} from a solid, liquid or gaseous source; if {{it comes from a}} solid source the process is called pack carburizing. Packing low carbon steel parts with a {{carbonaceous}} material and heating for some time diffuses carbon into the outer layers. A heating period of a few hours might form a <b>high-carbon</b> layer about one millimeter thick.|$|E
25|$|Case-hardening {{involves}} {{packing the}} low-carbon iron within a substance high in carbon, then heating this pack to encourage carbon migration into {{the surface of}} the iron. This forms a thin surface layer of higher carbon steel, with the carbon content gradually decreasing deeper from the surface. The resulting product combines much of the toughness of a low-carbon steel core, with the hardness and wear resistance of the outer <b>high-carbon</b> steel.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{electricity}} generation, the IPCC envisage that renewable energy can provide 30 to 35% of electricity by 2030 (up from 18% in 2005) at a carbon price {{of up to}} US$50/t, and that nuclear power can rise from 16% to 18%. They also warn that higher oil prices might lead to the exploitation of <b>high-carbon</b> alternatives such as oil sands, oil shales, heavy oils, and synthetic fuels from coal and gas, leading to increasing emissions, unless {{carbon capture and storage}} technologies are employed.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary hooks are {{manufactured}} from either <b>high-carbon</b> steel, steel alloyed with Vanadium, or stainless steel, depending on application. Most quality fish hooks {{are covered with}} some form of corrosion-resistant surface coating. Corrosion resistance is required not only when hooks are used, especially in saltwater, but while they are stored. Additionally, coatings are applied to color and/or provide aesthetic value to the hook. At a minimum, hooks designed for freshwater use are coated with a clear lacquer, but hooks are also coated with gold, nickel, Teflon, tin and different colors.|$|E
25|$|Oxy-acetylene can cut only low- to medium-carbon steels and wrought iron. <b>High-carbon</b> steels are {{difficult}} to cut because the melting point of the slag {{is closer to the}} melting point of the parent metal, so that the slag from the cutting action does not eject as sparks but rather mixes with the clean melt near the cut. This keeps the oxygen from reaching the clean metal and burning it. In the case of cast iron, graphite between the grains and the shape of the grains themselves interfere with the cutting action of the torch. Stainless steels cannot be cut either because the material does not burn readily.|$|E
25|$|As {{development}} {{began on}} the nail, there were three major causes of failure to be overcome. These were having the nail — head and all — rip through the sheathing, having the entire nail {{pull out of the}} frame, and having the nail's midsection snap under stress. Early research showed that the larger the head, the less chance there was of the nail being ripped through the sheathing. However, the difficult task was increasing the nail's head while still making it compatible with popular nail gun models. After finding the ideal nail head size, the next task to conquer was preventing the entire nail from pulling out of the frame. This was overcome by adding barbed ring shanks around the lower portion of the nail. During the testing of the shanks, it was noted that above a certain point the shanks no longer strengthened the nail but instead weakened the nail by making it more susceptible to shearing. The final touch to the original prototype was a special <b>high-carbon</b> alloy designed by a metallurgist that had the perfect combination of stiffness and pliability, giving it the highest possible strength.|$|E
25|$|Raising {{the price}} of carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to {{consumers}} about what goods and services are <b>high-carbon</b> ones and should therefore be used more sparingly. Second, it will provide signals to producers about which inputs use more carbon (such as coal and oil) and which use less or none (such as natural gas or nuclear power), thereby inducing firms to substitute low-carbon inputs. Third, it will give market incentives for inventors and innovators to develop and introduce low-carbon products and processes that can replace {{the current generation of}} technologies. Fourth, and most important, a high carbon price will economize on the information that is required to do all three of these tasks. Through the market mechanism, a high carbon price will raise {{the price of}} products according to their carbon content. Ethical consumers today, hoping to minimize their “carbon footprint,” have little chance of making an accurate calculation of the relative carbon use in, say, driving 250 miles as compared with flying 250 miles. A harmonized carbon tax would raise the price of a good proportionately to exactly the amount of CO2 that is emitted in all the stages of production that are involved in producing that good. If 0.01 of a ton of carbon emissions results from the wheat growing and the milling and the trucking and the baking of a loaf of bread, then a tax of $30 per ton carbon will raise the price of bread by $0.30. The “carbon footprint” is automatically calculated by the price system. Consumers would still not know how much of the price is due to carbon emissions, but they could make their decisions confident that they are paying for the social cost of their carbon footprint.|$|E

500|$|Plain carbon-iron alloys with {{a higher}} than 2.1% carbon content are known as cast iron. [...] With modern {{steelmaking}} techniques such as powder metal forming, {{it is possible to}} make very <b>high-carbon</b> (and other alloy material) steels, but such are not common. Cast iron is not malleable even when hot, but it can be formed by casting as it has a lower melting point than steel and good castability properties. [...] Certain compositions of cast iron, while retaining the economies of melting and casting, can be heat treated after casting to make malleable iron or ductile iron objects. Steel is also distinguishable from wrought iron (now largely obsolete), which may contain a small amount of carbon but large amounts of slag.|$|E

2500|$|The {{carbon content}} of steel greatly affects its machinability. <b>High-carbon</b> steels are {{difficult}} to machine because they are strong and because they may contain carbides that abrade the cutting tool.
