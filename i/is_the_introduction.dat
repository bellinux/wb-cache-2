5|$|Boccaccio {{introduces}} {{a number of}} features {{of the story that}} were to be taken up by Chaucer. Most obvious is that Troilus' love is now called Criseida or Cressida. An innovation in the narrative <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of the go-between Pandarus. Troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly, weeping when his love is unsuccessful, generous when it is.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{represents a}} threat to biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while habitat fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic habitat. Agricultural monocultures have also been identified as {{a threat to}} biodiversity.|$|E

5|$|Introduction of {{non-native}} {{species has}} occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of Nile perch into Lake Victoria in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic cichlid species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct. Carp, snakeheads, tilapia, European perch, brown trout, rainbow trout, and sea lampreys are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water. This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter in the mine water pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments. However, it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure.|$|E
5|$|The {{selective}} breeding of crop plants often involves selection against the plant's intrinsic resistance strategies. This makes crop plant varieties particularly susceptible to pests unlike their wild relatives. In breeding for host-plant resistance, {{it is often}} the wild relatives that provide the source of resistance genes. These genes are incorporated using conventional approaches to plant breeding, but have also been augmented by recombinant techniques, which allow introduction of genes from completely unrelated organisms. The most famous transgenic approach <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of genes from the bacterial species, Bacillus thuringiensis, into plants. The bacterium produces proteins that, when ingested, kill lepidopteran caterpillars. The gene encoding for these highly toxic proteins, when introduced into the host plant genome, confers resistance against caterpillars, when the same toxic proteins are produced within the plant. This approach is controversial, however, due {{to the possibility of}} ecological and toxicological side effects.|$|E
50|$|A {{couple of}} {{interesting}} events {{took place during}} the volunteer time. <b>The</b> first <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of a cable radio station, 'Greenwich Sound', which operated from a third garage which the TV station had used as a store, and <b>the</b> second <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of a breakfast TV service using early colour portable cameras, which pre-dated BBC Breakfast by a week.|$|R

25|$|Another current {{trend in}} Greeklish <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of Leet phrasing and vocabulary. Many Leet words or slang have been internalized within the Greek spoken {{language}} through Greek gamers online in games such as World of Warcraft.|$|E
25|$|Another problem <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of {{caustic soda}} and other {{industrial}} chemicals into the process, {{which not only}} gets into the environment and water supply, can also directly poison artisans who do not handle it properly.|$|E

25|$|Another use of {{gene therapy}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of enzymes into these cells {{that make them}} {{susceptible}} to particular chemotherapy agents; studies with introducing thymidine kinase in gliomas, making them susceptible to aciclovir, are in their experimental stage.|$|E
25|$|Back {{contamination}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of extraterrestrial {{organisms and}} other forms of contamination into Earth's biosphere. It also covers infection of humans and human habitats in space and on other celestial bodies by extraterrestrial organisms, if such habitats exist.|$|E
25|$|While {{studies of}} single AGN show {{important}} {{deviations from the}} expectations of the unified model, results from statistical tests have been contradictory. The most important short-coming of statistical tests by direct comparisons of statistical samples of Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of selection biases due to anisotropic selection criteria.|$|E

25|$|In late 2008, Aston Martin debuted {{an updated}} version of the N24, known as the V8 Vantage GT4. Its primary {{alteration}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of the new 4.7L V8 that also debuted in the production V8 Vantage. This replaces the 4.3L V8 in the V8 Vantage N24. The suspension and brakes have also been updated.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{profound}} geobiological event <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of oxygen into the atmosphere by photosynthetic bacteria. This oxygenation of Earth's primoidial atmosphere (the so-called oxygen catastrophe or Great Oxygenation Event) and the oxygenation of the oceans altered surface biogeochemical cycles {{and the types of}} organisms that have been evolutionarily selected for.|$|E
25|$|Pollution <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of {{contaminants}} into {{the natural environment}} that cause adverse change. Pollution can {{take the form of}} chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution.|$|E

25|$|A {{principal}} {{similarity between}} Mael Duin and the Voyage of Brendan <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> {{in both of}} three additional passengers. Mael Duin is joined by his foster brothers; Brendan by three extra monks. In both instances these additions upset the equilibrium of the voyage, and it is when the extra persons are no longer on board, can each voyage be completed.|$|E
25|$|Yet another {{prominent}} {{example of}} an introduced species that became invasive is the European rabbit in Australia. Thomas Austin, a British landowner had rabbits released on his estate in Victoria because he missed hunting them. A more recent example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of the common wall lizard to North America by a Cincinnati boy, George Rau, around 1950 after a family vacation to Italy.|$|E
25|$|Dravidian {{and other}} South Asian {{languages}} share with Indo-Aryan {{a number of}} syntactical and morphological features that are alien to other Indo-European languages, including even its closest relative, Old Iranian. Phonologically, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of retroflexes, which alternate with dentals in Indo-Aryan; morphologically there are the gerunds; and syntactically there {{is the use of}} a quotative marker (iti). These are taken as evidence of substratum influence.|$|E
50|$|A {{big change}} for 1982 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of Saab's Automatic Performance Control (APC), a.k.a. boost controller. The APC {{employed}} a knock sensor, allowing {{the engine to}} use different grades of gasoline without engine damage. Another new feature that year <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of central locking doors (on the GLE and Turbo). Asbestos-free brakes were introduced in 1983, an industry first. A new model also appeared that year in Sweden—the GLi, which used the fuel injected engine.|$|R
