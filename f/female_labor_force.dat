25|$|In Bangladesh and Indonesia, two {{majority}} Muslim {{countries with}} high <b>female</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation rates, 11.70% and 31.70% of female workers are salaried, respectively. Perhaps counter intuitively, majority Muslim {{countries such as}} Egypt, Iran, Syria, and Tunisia which have low rates of <b>female</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation and {{a relatively small number}} of actual female laborers have high rates of female salaried employees. In Egypt, 47.9% of employed females have salaried jobs.|$|E
25|$|However, as {{one is a}} subsect of the other, the {{two figures}} {{generally}} move collinearly. Despite a lower <b>female</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation rate and a smaller female to male worker ratio, Nigeria's female workers represent the largest component, in terms of percentage, of a nation's labor force {{when compared to the}} other ten countries. According to the International Labour Organization, 42.84% of the Nigerian labor force is composed of women. Bangladesh and Indonesia are a close second and third with 39.87% and 38.23%, respectively. Iraq, Syria, and Turkey's labor force's female composition rates (14.30%, 15.20%, and 28.69%, respectively) are quite close to their <b>female</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation rates which suggests a population parity between men and women. This is interesting as many other Developing countries do not have population parity by gender.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{the ratio}} of female to male workers {{in the labor force}} is the {{percentage}} of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force participation rate of women because it shows female workers {{as a percentage of the}} total number of workers in the economy as opposed to the percentage of the population of women that are involved in the formal economy. A large <b>female</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation rate does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females in the labor force. However, a high <b>female</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation rate demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size of the labor market itself that these women compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human capital formation through education, good nutrition, and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.|$|E

25|$|Of these eleven countries, Bangladesh and Indonesia had {{the highest}} rates of female {{participation}} in the labor force in 2010 with 57% and 51%, respectively. Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan have the lowest rates of <b>female</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation among these eleven nations with 13%, 14%, and 15%, respectively. However, numerically large discrepancies exist in the data for a couple of nations when drawn from different sources. Afghanistan's <b>female</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation rate, for example, was 15% in 2010 according to World Bank figures. That percentage nearly doubles to 28.9% if data from UNESCAP is cited. The same discrepancy is true for figures for Iran for which the World Bank lists its female participation rate at 16% in 2010 and UNESCAP lists it as 26.9%. It is unclear why these two sources give significantly different numbers as their methodology and definitions of labor force participation were similar.|$|E

25|$|According to Moghadam, {{women are}} victims of clear political, economic, and social disparities in many Islamic {{countries}} which create gender distinctions within {{the public and private}} spheres. This inhibits the ability of women to participate in the government or to advance in the private sector.

25|$|The wide {{gap between}} male and <b>female</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> {{participation}} rates and ratios, and the gap {{between male and}} female employers is indicative of gender inequality within the private sector of majority Muslim countries. However, numerous reasons may account for these outcomes such as weak education infrastructure for women, low levels of economic development, or simply capital-intensive resource development. The latter characteristic is probably given how many majority Muslim nations are net oil exporters.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there are}} {{more men than women}} for a limited number of jobs, more men, in {{absolute}} terms, are excluded from formal employment. Consequently, the ratio of female to male workers increases because women represent a larger percentage of those who work than they represent the entire labor force. Therefore, women would have a relatively higher ratio of female to male workers than its <b>female</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation rate may suggest. The sheer size of the male component of the workforce may be sufficient to create a small ratio of female to male workers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the gender wage gap and its composition in China's urban labor market using the 2009 survey {{data from the}} Chinese Family Panel Studies. Several estimation and decomposition methods have been used and compared. First, we examine the gender wage gap using ordinary least square regression method with a gender dummy variable. Then, we apply Oaxaca (1973) decomposition method with different weighting systems to analyze the logarithmic wage differential. To be more specific, we prove the existence of sample selection bias caused by the <b>female's</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation. We eliminate it by using the Heckman's two-step procedure. Empirical results reveal that male workers generally receive a higher wage than female workers, {{and a great deal}} of this difference is unexplained. Meanwhile, this unexplained part, which is usually referred to as discrimination turns out to be higher when the adjustment is made for the selection bias. A further breakdown of the wage gap shows that among all the individual characteristics, occupations explain the largest share of the wage gap, followed by their working experience. On the other hand, education acts as a contributor for discrimination in the labor market. discrimination, wage gap, decomposition, gender, Chinese labor market...|$|R

25|$|While {{labor force}} {{participation}} rate {{sheds light on}} how many women work in the formal sectors of the economy, it says nothing about the type of work or the stable presence {{of women in the}} labor force. Countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia, when <b>female</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation rate or the ratio of male to female workers or similar indicators are considered, appear to have substantial female involvement in their economies. However, very few of the women in these nations have salaried work which means they may go through cycles of short periods of work punctuated by long periods of unemployment. Alternatively, these women may be shuffled from task to task for different employers and never develop a stable basis at a particular firm or within a particular field.|$|E

A 2012 World Bank study showed that the expansion of public day care had no effect on <b>female</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers {{changes in}} the jobless population between 1964 and 2000, the importance of including them in <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> discussions, and how these persons differ from labor market participants. The jobless are here defined as persons who are not working and not looking for work and include the retired, disabled students, and homemakers. ^ The results of the decomposition and multinomial regression analyses are consistent with other studies that look at {{changes in the}} <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> and report fewer homemakers, more retired persons, and more persons with disabilities. It also shows a convergence in <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation, particularly in employment, between males and females. For both males and females, the largest component contribution {{to changes in the}} growth rate of the jobless population is participation in non-labor force activities (schooling and exclusive engagement in housework) or existence in particular non-labor force states (retirement and disability) rather than changes in age composition over the period. Declining rates of involvement in these activities reduced overall joblessness for women, while increasing the rate of joblessness for males. ^ Logistic regression analyses reveal differences between the jobless and persons in the <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> by gender and year. For both males and <b>females,</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> members are significantly more likely to be older and more educated than the jobless with the exception of students. <b>Labor</b> <b>force</b> members also have a greater likelihood of being married and having a child in the household.

The jobless are no more or less likely to rely on spousal income except for homemakers.
