5|$|Vasil Levski's hanging is {{observed}} annually across Bulgaria on 19 February instead of 18 February, {{due to the}} erroneous calculation of 19th-century Julian calendar dates after Bulgaria adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1916. Although the location of Levski's grave has not been determined, some of <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> on exhibit at the National Museum of Military History. After Levski gave up monkhood in 1863, he shaved his hair, which his mother and later his sister Yana preserved. Levski's personal items—such as his silver Christian cross, his copper water vessel, his Gasser revolver, made in Austria–Hungary in 1869, and the shackles from his imprisonment in Sofia—are also exhibited in the military history museum, while Levski's sabre {{can be seen in}} the Lovech regional museum.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} Gold cuts <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> because, during production, Robert Carlyle was {{also working on}} the set of Trainspotting 2, which {{required}} his hair to be shortened.|$|E
25|$|He {{is seated}} in an armed chair, {{not a very}} common {{convenience}} in a desert, nor a very proper attitude for a preacher; but <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> greyish which I suppose to be an apology for the sitting.|$|E

60|$|He was a tall, spare {{man like}} my father, a Scotchman, but <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> in a cue.|$|R
25|$|<b>His</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> {{completely}} white (there {{was hardly}} a tinge of white before) {{when he first came}} out, he collapsed completely, physically and mentally, largely as the result of insufficient food. He says one only gets three quarters of an hour reading in the whole day – {{the rest of the time}} is spent on prison work, etc.|$|E
25|$|Balarama is {{depicted}} as light skinned, in contrast to his brother, Krishna, who is dark skinned, Krishna in Sanskrit means dark. His ayudha or weapons are the plough hala and the gadā. The plough is usually called Balachita. He often wears blue garments and a garland of forest flowers. <b>His</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> tied in a topknot and he has earrings, bracelets and armlets and he {{is known for his}} strength.|$|E
25|$|Legolas's {{hair colour}} is not {{definitively}} stated. Both Ralph Bakshi and Peter Jackson make him blond {{in their respective}} film adaptations (see below). This {{is supported by the}} fact that Thranduil, Legolas's father and a Sindarin elf, is described in The Hobbit as having golden hair. In a musical version of The Lord of the Rings, Legolas is dark-haired. In the real-time strategy game , <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> white or silver.|$|E

25|$|In the Livre d'Artus, Merlin enters Rome in {{the form}} of a huge stag with a white fore-foot. He bursts into the {{presence}} of Julius Caesar and tells the emperor that only the wild man of the woods can interpret the dream that has been troubling him. Later, he returns {{in the form}} of a black, shaggy man, barefoot, with a torn coat. In another episode, he decides to do something that will be spoken of forever. Going into the forest of Brocéliande, he transforms himself into a herdsman carrying a club and wearing a wolf-skin and leggings. He is large, bent, black, lean, hairy and old, and his ears hang down to his waist. His head is as big as a buffalo's, <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> down to his waist, he has a hump on his back, his feet and hands are backwards, he is hideous, and is over 18 feet tall. By his arts, he calls a herd of deer to come and graze around him.|$|E
25|$|Several {{scenes are}} also {{omitted from the}} director's cut, {{including}} one where the knights sit around a camp fire asking about their intended Sarmatian life, in which Bors reveals that his children do not even have names, most simply have numbers. In addition, a sex scene between Guinevere and Arthur is shifted to be chronologically before he is informed of the incoming Saxons towards Hadrian's Wall. This seemingly minor change arguably helps the story flow more smoothly. In the original film he is seen in full battle armour, contemplating a broken image of Pelagius on his floor, and then is disturbed by a call to come outside. When he comes outside, he is hastily putting on a shirt, and <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> disheveled. In the Director's Cut, after an intimate moment between Arthur and Guinevere explaining Arthur's morals, they carry on into their sexual encounter, and are thus disturbed so that Arthur can be briefed on the Saxons. During the sexual encounter, he is wearing the same outfit he wears during the briefing. The scene where he is examining Pelagius's image is removed.|$|E
25|$|In Ikari Warriors, Ralf's attire {{was based}} on Rambo. He wore green pants, a red {{headband}} and a belt full of bullets. In the first game from The King of Fighters series, he wore jeans and a T-shirt, along with a military vest and a red bandanna. In The King of Fighters '99 is sightly changed with green jeans, red gloves {{and he did not}} wear the belt. In The King of Fighters 2000, his outfit is once again modified but with darker colors from all his clothes. His attire from Ikari appears as alternate outfit for the character in the first Maximum Impact game. In , Ralf retains his 2003 outfit but with a red jacket. His Armored Ralf version from the same game {{is very different from the}} original Ralf, as his skin is darker and <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> lighter. He additionally sports a green jacket, military pants, a white T-shirt and a green headband instead of his red bandana. He was also given green protectors in his hands which have spikes. The additional outfits from the common Ralf are cosplays from Marco Rossi from the Metal Slug series and Jack Turner from the Art of Fighting series.In The King of Fighters XII, Ralf becomes bulkier and wears a dark olive military vest over a pair of dark olive cargo pants. His attire in The King of Fighters XIV is a mix of his 99 and XII outfits, with a white tank top and green camouflage cargo pants. His body also sports light green war paint in this.|$|E

500|$|Delilah, however, {{persists}} and Samson finally wears {{down and}} tells Delilah that God supplies his power {{because of his}} consecration to God as a Nazirite, symbolized {{by the fact that}} a razor has never touched his head, and that if <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> cut off he will lose his strength. [...] Delilah then woos him to sleep [...] "in her lap" [...] and calls for a servant to shave his hair. [...] Samson loses his strength and he is captured by the Philistines who blind him by gouging out his eyes. [...] They then take him to Gaza, imprison him, and put him to work turning a large millstone and grinding corn.|$|E
500|$|Tolkien {{described}} Saruman at {{the time}} of The Lord of the Rings as having a long face and a high forehead, [...] "...he had deep darkling eyes ... His hair and beard were white, but strands of black still showed around his lips and ears." [...] <b>His</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> elsewhere described as having been black when he first arrived in Middle-earth. He is referred to as 'Saruman the White' and is said to have originally worn white robes, but on his first entry in The Fellowship of the Ring they instead appear to be [...] "woven from all colours [...] shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered" [...] and he names himself 'Saruman of Many Colours'.|$|E
500|$|Bertin is {{presented}} as strong, energetic and warm-hearted. <b>His</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> grey verging on white, his fingers spread across his knees. Bertin's fingers were described in 1959 by artist Henry de Waroquier as [...] "crab-like claws... emerging from the tenebrous caverns that are {{the sleeves of his}} coat." [...] The bulk of his body is compacted in a tight black jacket, black trousers and brown satin waistcoat, with a starched white shirt and cravat revealing his open neck. He wears a gold watch and a pair of glasses in his right pocket. In the view of art historian Robert Rosenblum, his [...] "nearly ferocious presence" [...] is accentuated by the tightly constrained space. The chair and clothes appear too small to contain him. His coiled, stubby fingers rest on his thighs, barely protruding from the sleeves of his jacket, while his neck cannot be seen above his narrow starched white collar.|$|E

500|$|For DmC: Devil May Cry, a reboot of the series, Dante was {{completely}} redesigned {{as a result}} of comments by the Capcom staff. Dante's original design was originally meant to be similar to the ones from previous games, but Capcom told the Ninja Theory staff it had to be completely different in order to appeal to a younger demographic. Motohide Eshiro stated this Dante {{was completely}} set apart from the previous Dantes which they expected would generate major criticism. While the original Dante was designed from a Japanese perspective, the new one was made from a Western perspective. After several drafts of Dante's new character, the designers settled on a look as inspired by Christopher Nolan's film The Dark Knight. Dante's coat is not long, only coming down to his lower-back, <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> shorter and is black; he has a Devil Trigger form which makes him look close to the classic Dante. [...] Art designer Alessandro Taini drew the character as a child and explain with reboot's origin story why he has white hair. Director Tameem Antoniades denied rumors that his design was modelled after him.|$|E
500|$|By 1836, the Duchess's brother, Leopold, who {{had been}} King of the Belgians since 1831, hoped to marry his niece to his nephew, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Leopold, Victoria's mother, and Albert's father (Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) were siblings. Leopold {{arranged}} for Victoria's mother to invite her Coburg relatives to visit her in May 1836, {{with the purpose of}} introducing Victoria to Albert. William IV, however, disapproved of any match with the Coburgs, and instead favoured the suit of Prince Alexander of the Netherlands, second son of the Prince of Orange. Victoria was aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes. According to her diary, she enjoyed Albert's company from the beginning. After the visit she wrote, [...] " [...] is extremely handsome; <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> about the same colour as mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful." [...] Alexander, on the other hand, was [...] "very plain".|$|E
500|$|In the stanzas that follow, Helgi {{responds}} {{that none}} of these things have occurred, and so Sigrún's maid goes home to Sigrún. The maid tells Sigrún that the burial mound has opened up, and that Sigrún should go to Helgi there, as Helgi has asked her to come and tend his wounds, which have opened up and are bleeding. Sigrún goes into the mound, and finds that Helgi is drenched in gore, <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> thick with frost. Filled with joy at the reunion, Sigrún kisses him before he can remove his coat of mail, and asks how she can heal him. Sigrún makes a bed there, and the two sleep together in the enclosed burial mound. Helgi awakens, stating that he must [...] "ride along the blood-red roads, to set the pale horse to tread the path of the sky," [...] and [...] return before the rooster Salgófnir crows. Helgi and the host of men ride away, and Sigrún and her servant go back to their house. Sigrún has her maid wait for him by the mound the next night, but when she arrives at dawn, she finds that he has not returned. The prose narrative {{at the end of the}} poem relates that Sigrún dies of sadness, but that the two are thought to have been reborn as Helgi Haddingjaskati and the valkyrie Kára.|$|E

500|$|By 1836, {{the idea}} of {{marriage}} between Albert and his cousin, Victoria, had arisen {{in the mind of}} their ambitious uncle Leopold, who had been King of the Belgians since 1831. At this time, Victoria was the heiress presumptive to the British throne. Her father, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III, had died when she was a baby, and her elderly uncle, King William IV, had no legitimate children. Her mother, the Duchess of Kent, was the sister of both Albert's father—the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha—and King Leopold. Leopold arranged for his sister, Victoria's mother, to invite the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his two sons to visit her in May 1836, with the purpose of meeting Victoria. William IV, however, disapproved of any match with the Coburgs, and instead favoured the suit of Prince Alexander, second son of the Prince of Orange. Victoria was well aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes. She wrote, [...] " [...] is extremely handsome; <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> about the same colour as mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful."
