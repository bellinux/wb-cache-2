6000|$|Genlisea ornata (Brazil).--This {{species has}} been {{described}} and figured by Dr. Warming,* who states that it bears two kinds of leaves, called by him spathulate and utriculiferous. The latter include cavities; and as these differ much from the bladders of the foregoing species, it will be convenient to speak of them as utricles. The accompanying figure (fig. 29) {{of one of the}} utriculiferous leaves, about thrice enlarged, will illustrate the following description by my son, which agrees in all essential points with that given by Dr. Warming. The utricle (b) is formed by a slight enlargement of the narrow blade of the leaf. A <b>hollow</b> <b>neck</b> (n), no less than fifteen times as long as the utricle itself, forms a passage from the transverse slit-like orifice (o) into the cavity of the utricle.

On each side of the orifice there is a long spiral arm or tube (a); the structure of which will be best understood by the following illustration.

40|$|The frail patient, the <b>hollow</b> femoral <b>neck,</b> the {{precarious}} blood supply {{and the difficulties}} ofreduction and fixation all contribute to the problem ofthe intracapsular fracture. The relative importance of these factors has recently been reassessed. First, avascular necrosis-once thought to occur in a minority ofcases and automatically to imply non-union-is now known to occur nearly always to some extent in the capital fragment. It does not by itselfprevent the process ofrepair from starting from the lower fragment (Harrold 1960, Barnes 1962). Thus, the higher the rate ofbony union the greater is the incidence of late avascular necrosis. The term viable is no longer applicable as {{a description of the}} condition of the femoral head after fracture. Secondly, in considering methods of internal fixation it is necessary to recognise that the functional effectiveness of the trabecular system which supports the head is destroyed by fracture through the neck. It will be suggested that this is an important reason for the limited success of the trifin nail.

50|$|Instruments {{designed}} exclusively as lap steel guitars {{typically have}} modified necks that make fretted playing impossible. The <b>hollow</b> <b>neck</b> acoustic lap steel, developed by Chris Knutsen and popularized by Weissenborn, extends the body cavity behind the neck {{all the way}} to the head. The square-necked resonator guitar has a strengthened square profile neck, allowing heavier string gauges and/or higher tunings that would normally be considered impossible (or certainly ill-advised) on a conventional guitar. The electric lap steel guitar typically incorporates the entire neck into the solid body of the guitar, again providing extra strength to allow a greater variety of string gauges and tunings.|$|E
40|$|The {{recommendation}} to change breathing patterns {{from the mouth}} to the nose can have a significantly positive impact upon the general well being of the individual.

50|$|Stealthy murder: A {{more direct}} method of killing that {{requires}} two people. A thin kangaroo or emu bone up to 37 cm in length is split in half lengthwise, then one half is sharpened to an extremely fine point. The {{shape of the}} bone forms a semicircular point similar to the nib of a pen. One person holds the victim (usually while he sleeps) while a second inserts the bone in the <b>hollow</b> of the <b>neck</b> behind the collarbone and pushes it down until it pierces the heart. When the bone is withdrawn, it leaves a very small semi circular flap of flesh which is then pressed down to seal the wound. The wound does not bleed and is almost invisible. In 1884, two such murders were recorded near Adelaide {{and in the early}} 1970s a 6,000-year old skeleton was unearthed at Roonka, a site 5 km south of Blanchetown, South Australia, that had a similar bone still in position within the ribcage. The burial was of a young person of high status but it is unclear if the bone was the cause of death or if it had been used in a ritual post mortem.|$|R
60|$|Siegmund lay still, {{with his}} eyes closed, {{enduring}} the exquisite torture of the trickling of drops of sweat.

While yet the nerves in the track of this drop were quivering, raw with sensitiveness, another drop would start from off the side of his chest, and trickle downwards among the little muscles of his side, to drip on to the bed. It was like the running of a spider over his sensitive, moveless body. Why he did not wipe himself he did not know. He lay still and endured this horrible tickling, which seemed to bite deep into him, rather than make the effort to move, which he loathed to do. The drops ran off his forehead down his temples. Those he did not mind: he was blunt there. But they started again, in tiny, vicious spurts, down the sides of his chest, from under his armpits, down the inner sides of his thighs, till he seemed to have a myriad quivering tracks of a myriad running insects over his hot, wet, highly-sensitized body. His nerves were trembling, one and all, with outrage and vivid suspense. It became unbearable. He felt that, if he endured it another moment, he would cry out, or suffocate and burst.|$|R

It has 3 courses (either single or double) of metal strings. The Afghan tanbur is played in the same style as the normal tanbur and sitar, with a wire finger plectrum. The music can be accompanying singing and dancing, or (more rarely) playing classical ghazals. The Afghan tanbur has sympathetic strings.|$|E
40|$|Hollow {{asymmetrical}} silica dumbbells {{containing a}} movable inner core were fabricated by a template-assisted method. Three different templates were employed for the fabrication of the hollow asymmetrical dumbbells. For {{the preparation of}} the first template, silica particles were uniformly covered with a cross-linked polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) shell and the polymerization of styrene was conducted to induce a protrusion of polystyrene (PSt) from the PMMA shell. Anisotropic colloids composed of silica, PMMA, and PSt were used as templates, coated with a silica shell, and held at 500 °C for 2 h to remove the polymer interior components of the template colloid. The heat treatment successfully produced hollow asymmetrical silica dumbbells containing an inner silica core. After being dried, approximately 50 % of the inner silica particles that were originally coated with PMMA ended up in the other hollow sphere in which the PSt component existed before heat treatment, indicating that the inner silica particles could pass through the <b>hollow</b> asymmetrical dumbbells’ <b>necks</b> and were free to move in the interior. In {{the preparation of the}} second and third asymmetrical dumbbell templates, magnetic silica particles and titania particles, respectively, were covered with a PMMA shell to incorporate externally responsive particles into the hollow silica shells as above. The successful syntheses demonstrated the generality of our approach. The passage of the responsive particles through the dumbbell’s neck enabled active control of the position of the responsive particles inside the asymmetrical dumbbells by external fields...|$|R
60|$|Romata {{accompanied}} us on board, {{and explained}} that a great chief from another island was then {{on a visit to}} him, and that he was to be ceremoniously entertained on the following day. After begging to be allowed to introduce him to us, and receiving permission, he sent his canoe ashore to bring him off. At the same time he gave orders to bring on board his two favourites, a cock and a paroquet. While the canoe was gone on this errand, I had time to regard the savage chief attentively. He was a man of immense size, with massive but beautifully moulded limbs and figure, only parts of which--the broad chest and muscular arms--were uncovered; for although the lower orders generally wore no other clothing than a strip of cloth called maro round their loins, the chief, on particular occasions, wrapped his person in voluminous folds of a species of native cloth made from the bark of the Chinese paper-mulberry. Romata wore a magnificent black beard and moustache, and his hair was frizzed out {{to such an extent that}} it resembled a large turban, in which was stuck a long wooden pin! I afterwards found that this pin served for scratching the head, for which purpose the fingers were too short without disarranging the hair. But Romata put himself to much greater inconvenience on account of his hair; for we found that he slept with his head resting on a wooden pillow, in which was cut a <b>hollow</b> for the <b>neck,</b> so that the hair of the sleeper might not be disarranged.|$|R
40|$|Background Salivary gland {{scintigraphy}} gives functional {{information on}} irradiated glands. Upon irradiation, their size may become less than 2 – 3 times {{the resolution of}} the gamma camera hence underestimation of the regional distribution of administered activity due to partial volume effects (PVEs) which hinder accurate quantification of their function. Aim To accurately quantify planar images of spheres mimicking irradiated parotid and submandibular glands with view of implementing salivary gland scintigraphy that involves quantification of PVEs. Methods A <b>hollow</b> head and <b>neck</b> phantom was fitted with spheres (diameters: 20 mm; 14 mm; 12 mm and 10 mm) filled with technetium- 99 m solution of activity concentration of 300 kBq/mL. The spheres mimicked irradiated parotid glands (right (RP) and left (LP)) and submandibular glands (right (RSM) and left (LSM)) respectively. The phantom was filled with technetium- 99 m solution of activity concentration 144 kBq/mL. 1 A planar image was acquired in 5 minutes using Siemens E-Cam dual head gamma camera detector positioned 5 cm vertically above the phantom, on 128 × 128 matrix size following a thyroid protocol. The detector was fitted with low energy high resolution collimators. ImageJ software was used for quantification. Results The image counts post PVEs quantification were: LP= 252, 690; LP= 160, 836; RSM= 149, 315; LSM= 68, 292. The percentage quantification errors were: 44 per cent, 48 per cent, 51 per cent and 75 per cent for the LP, RP, RSM and LSM glands respectively. Conclusion ImageJ software improved quantitative accuracy of sphere images hence it provides a robust quantification tool for irradiated salivary glands...|$|R
50|$|Z. M. Dagar {{was born}} in the town of Udaipur, Rajasthan and began musical study with his father, Ustad Ziauddin Khan Dagar, court {{musician}} for the Maharana of Udaipur. He was trained both in vocals and in the rudra veena, an instrument used by vocalists to practice melodies. The veena was traditionally not played in public, but the young Zia Mohiuddin adopted it as his primary instrument, giving his first recital at age 16. Although he was discouraged by his father from experimenting with the structure of the veena, he nevertheless modified the instrument after his father's death to better equip it for solo performance, transforming it into a larger bass instrument (sometimes called a 'Dagar veena'): With the help of the instrument house Kanailal & Brother, he enlarged the tumbas (gourds) and dhandhi (<b>hollow</b> <b>neck)</b> to create greater resonance and to allow the notes to sustain longer and so better reproduce the techniques used in dhrupad singing. Because of these modifications, the instrument was too heavy to be held in the standard Northern posture (with one tumba on the left shoulder), so he played instead in the Southern posture, with one tumba on the ground and one on the left knee.|$|E
50|$|About {{four feet}} in length, its design {{consists}} of a large resonator (kudam) carved and hollowed out of a log (usually of jackfruit wood), a tapering <b>hollow</b> <b>neck</b> (dandi) topped with 24 brass or bell-metal frets set in scalloped black wax on wooden tracks, and a tuning box culminating in a downward curve and an ornamental dragon's head (yali).If the veena is built from {{a single piece of}} wood it is called (Ekantha) veena. A small table-like wooden bridge (kudurai) - about 2 x 2½ x 2 inches - is topped by a convex brass plate glued in place with resin. Two rosettes, formerly of ivory, now of plastic or horn, are on the top board (palakai) of the resonator. Four main playing strings tuned to the tonic and the fifth in two octaves (for example, B flat-E flat below bass clef - B flat- E flat in bass clef) stretch from fine tuning connectors attached {{to the end of the}} resonator across the bridge and above the fretboard to four large-headed pegs in the tuning box. Three subsidiary drone strings tuned to the tonic, fifth, and upper tonic (E flat - B flat- E flat in the tuning given above) cross a curving side bridge leaning against the main bridge, and stretch on the player's side of the neck to three pegs matching those of the main playing strings. All seven strings today are of steel, with the lower strings either solid thick.|$|E
40|$|When walking long distances, hip {{prostheses}} heat up due to friction. The {{influence of}} articulating materials and lubricating properties of synovia {{on the final}} temperatures, {{as well as any}} potential biological consequences, are unknown. Such knowledge is essential for optimizing implant materials, identifying patients who are possibly at risk of implant loosening, and proving the concepts of current joint simulators. An instrumented hip implant with telemetric data transfer was developed to measure the implant temperatures in vivo. A clinical study with 100 patients is planned to measure the implant temperatures for different combinations of head and cup materials during walking. This study will answer the question of whether patients with synovia with poor lubricating properties may be at risk for thermally induced bone necrosis and subsequent implant failure. The study will also deliver the different friction properties of various implant materials and prove the significance of wear simulator tests. A clinically successful titanium hip endoprosthesis was modified to house the electronics inside its <b>hollow</b> <b>neck.</b> The electronics are powered by an external induction coil fixed around the joint. A temperature sensor inside the implant triggers a timer circuit, which produces an inductive pulse train with temperature-dependent intervals. This signal is detected by a giant magnetoresistive sensor fixed near the external energy coil. The implant temperature is measured with an accuracy of 0. 1 °C in a range between 20 °C and 58 °C and at a sampling rate of 2 - 10 Hz. This rate could be considerably increased for measuring other data, such as implant strain or vibration. The employed technique of transmitting data from inside of a closed titanium implant by low frequency magnetic pulses eliminates the need to use an electrical feedthrough and an antenna outside of the implant. It enables the design of mechanically safe and simple instrumented implants...|$|E
5000|$|June Evelyn Bronson Cleaver (Barbara Billingsley) is {{the wife}} of Ward Cleaver {{and the mother of}} two sons, Wally and Beaver, who is also the main {{character}} of the series. She grew up in the Mayfield area and summered with her aunt, Martha Bronson, at Riverside, a community a few hours from Mayfield. June attended boarding school, dated Ward in her teens, and attended college. June mentions that her Aunt Martha [...] "practically raised her". When Beaver asks her about her life, June doesn't mention she ever held down a full-time job. She merely indicates she had a part-time job and was dismissed when she got her books messed up so bad. When the show opens, she is a full-time wife and mother, often seen tidying the house, preparing meals in the kitchen, or tending her family. Her outside interests include social events such as weddings and her sons' school events. In the later seasons, many episodes feature a brief [...] "after-school" [...] scene in the kitchen for June and Wally. Wally breezes through the back door and regales his mother with a short recital couched in teen-speak of his school day. The camera zooms-in on June's amusingly mystified countenance as Wally trots away with a hot dog or other snack-in-hand. During the course of the series' run, June has several housekeepers, including Minerva, Mrs. Manners (who smells like gingerbread according to Beaver), Mrs. Manners' teen daughter Margie (who becomes a romantic interest for Wally), and other unnamed women. Actress Barbara Billingsley appeared in the pilot, every episode of the series, and in the show's spin-offs. Throughout the series' run, she wore either a necklace or a dress with a high collar, jabot, or scarf to hide a surgery-inflicted <b>hollow</b> in her <b>neck</b> which would have caused on-screen shadows.|$|R
6000|$|The flat {{had belonged}} to an artist {{who was at the}} war. It was but a pocket {{dwelling}} on the third floor. The two windows of the little square sitting-room looked out on some trees and a church. But Leila, who hated dining by daylight, had soon drawn curtains of a deep blue over them. The picture which Fort remembered was this: A little four-square table of dark wood, with a Chinese mat of vivid blue in the centre, whereon stood a silver lustre bowl of clove carnations; some greenish glasses with hock cup in them; on his left, Leila in a low lilac frock, her neck and shoulders very white, her face a little powdered, her eyes large, her lips smiling; opposite him a black-clothed padre with a little gold cross, over whose thin darkish face, with its grave pointed beard, passed little gentle smiles, but whose deep sunk grey eyes were burnt and bright; on his right, a girl in a high grey frock, almost white, just <b>hollowed</b> at the <b>neck,</b> with full sleeves to the elbow, so that her slim arms escaped; her short fair hair a little tumbled; her big grey eyes grave; her full lips shaping with a strange daintiness round every word--and they not many; brilliant red shades over golden lights dotting the black walls; a blue divan; a little black piano flush with the wall; a dark polished floor; four Japanese prints; a white ceiling. He was conscious that his own khaki spoiled something as curious and rare as some old Chinese tea-chest. He even remembered what they ate; lobster; cold pigeon pie; asparagus; St. Ivel cheese; raspberries and cream. He did not remember half so well what they talked of, except that he himself told them stories of the Boer War, in which he had served in the Yeomanry, and while he was telling them, the girl, like a child listening to a fairy-tale, never moved her eyes from his face. He remembered that after supper they all smoked cigarettes, even the tall child, after the padre had said to her mildly, [...] "My dear!" [...] and she had answered: [...] "I simply must, Daddy, just one." [...] He remembered Leila brewing Turkish coffee--very good, and how beautiful her white arms looked, hovering about the cups. He remembered her making the padre sit down at the piano, and play to them. And she and the girl on the divan together, side by side, a strange contrast; with just as strange a likeness to each other. He always remembered how fine and rare that music sounded in the little room, flooding him with a dreamy beatitude. Then--he remembered--Leila sang, the padre standing-by; and the tall child on the divan bending forward over her knees, with her chin on her hands. He remembered rather vividly how Leila turned her neck and looked up, now at the padre, now at himself; and, all through, the delightful sense of colour and warmth, a sort of glamour over all the evening; and the lingering pressure of Leila's hand when he said good-bye and they went away, for they all went together. He remembered talking a great deal to the padre in the cab, about the public school they had both been at, and thinking: 'It's a good padre--this!' He remembered how their taxi took them to an old Square which he did not know, where the garden trees looked densely black in the starshine. He remembered that a man outside the house had engaged the padre in earnest talk, while the tall child and himself stood in the open doorway, where the hall beyond was dark. Very exactly he remembered the little conversation which then took place between them, while they waited for her father.|$|R
