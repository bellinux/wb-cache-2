25|$|The first-generation IS {{interior}} featured unique elements {{not typically}} {{found in other}} Lexus models. These included a chrome metal ball shifter, pop-up navigation screen, and chronograph-style instrument panel (with mini gauges for temperature, fuel economy, and volts). For the European market, the IS 300 gained <b>full</b> <b>leather</b> seats rather than the leather/escaine of the 200, plus Auto-dimming rear view and side mirrors, and HID headlamps. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency listed the IS 300 as a subcompact car; although it technically had enough overall volume {{to be called a}} compact, rear seat room exhibited subcompact dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} is the {{restoration}} of the book cover; This can be as complicated as completely re-creating a period binding to match the original using whatever is appropriate for that time it was originally created. Sometimes this means a new <b>full</b> <b>leather</b> binding with vegetable tanned leather, dyed with natural dyes, and hand-marbled papers may be used for the sides or end-sheets. Finally the cover is hand-tooled in gold leaf. The design of the book cover involves such hand-tooling, where an extremely thin layer of gold is applied to the cover. Such designs can be lettering, symbols, or floral designs, depending on the nature of any particular project.|$|E

25|$|In 2004 the re-introduction of the Pontiac GTO (based on the Holden Monaro from Australia) took place, {{effectively}} {{replacing the}} spot {{left by the}} Firebird and Camaro. The GTO was also initially powered by the 350 HP LS-1 V8 in 2004. It had an independent front and rear suspension and an upscale <b>full</b> <b>leather</b> interior. Its clean lines and understated looks drew some criticism. Sales did not reach the 18,000 units that GM predicted. Initial dealer mark ups, slow shipping transit from Australia, and lack of advertisement by GM were to blame. Due to the retirement of the LS1 engine in 2004, Pontiac added the drive-by-wire 400 HP LS2 V8 for 2005–2006 model years at no additional cost. Additional upgrades also consisted of stainless steel dual exhaust outlets, larger Corvette sourced PBR brakes with EBD, larger front vented rotors with vented rear rotors, and functional heat extractor hood scoops. The Bonneville introduced the GXP trim level to replace the SSEi. The Bonneville GXP featured a 4.6 Northstar V8, borrowed from Cadillac, and replaced the Supercharged 3800 Series II. The redesigned Grand Prix made its appearance, and featured a GT and GTP trim level. The GTP's new 3.8L supercharged V6 now made , up 20 from the previous generation. TAPshift was also introduced {{as well as a}} Competition Group package (Comp G).|$|E
500|$|Equipe: The Equipe was {{a luxury}} special edition Berlina {{released}} in 2011 under the Series II badge. It {{was based on}} the Berlina but also had many Calais features. In many ways it was similar to the previous limited edition Berlina International but was even better equipped.The car featured 18" [...] Calais alloy rims, <b>full</b> <b>leather</b> Calais interior, fog lamps, rear parking sensors, rear view camera and came as a Sedan or Sportswagon model. The Sportwagon also featured a cargo blind. The car had $9600 of additional features. This special edition was limited to 7 colours and limited build numbers. The colours were Heron White, Sizzle, Karma, Nitrate, Alto Grey, Phantom and Mirage Glow. Satellite Navigation was available as an option.|$|E
2500|$|In the past, {{the police}} were using their {{standard}} issued drill boots for their daily duties; however, using of the drill boots for daily duties such as patrols and chasing after suspects proved impractical as they were severely uncomfortable, causing blisters, or worse, causing the officer to be injured. In 2012, the police trialed the Magnum Stealth Force 6.0 and 8.0, subsequently they became the standard issue for their officers. While the Special Operations Command were previously using the traditional <b>full</b> <b>leather</b> combat boot, the force also rolled out the Magnum Spider 8.1 SZ for their troopers.|$|E
40|$|The shoes {{manufacturing}} {{implies the}} use of various types of leathers, leather substitutes and fabric. The sewing plays {{a very important role}} in shoe making, having an impact both in terms of functionality and outlook. One of the most important indicators of the sewed products quality is seam strength, which is influenced by a series of technological parameters such as: the shape of the needle’s top, the needle’s diameter, the seam thickness, the number of seams, the gauge of the thread, the type of seam and the material type. This paper studies the stitching strength of the <b>full</b> grain <b>leather</b> and <b>full</b> grain <b>leather</b> shiny surface used for footwear uppers, in order to improve productivity and seam quality. The experimental researches obtained for the stitching strength allow calculating the weakening coefficient of the material in the process of sewing (a= 0. 33 - 0. 48). The “a” coefficient is dependent on the stitch density, the shape of the needle’s top and the joined materials. In terms of stitching strength, the results indicate that the <b>full</b> grain <b>leather</b> obtains higher values than the <b>full</b> grain <b>leather</b> shiny surface. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Acrylic acid (AA) and stearyl {{acrylate}} (SA) were co-polymerized with vinyl-ended polysiloxane using AIBN as the catalyst.

2500|$|When {{creating}} new work, modern hand binders often work on commission, creating bindings for specific books or collections. Books can be bound {{in many different}} materials. Some of the more common materials for covers are leather, decorative paper, and cloth (see also: buckram). Those bindings that are made with exceptionally high craftsmanship, and that are made of particularly high-quality materials (especially <b>full</b> <b>leather</b> bindings), are known as fine or extra bindings. Also, when creating a new work, modern binders may wish to select a book {{that has already been}} printed and create what is known as a 'design binding'. [...] "In a typical design binding, the binder selects an already printed book, disassembles it, and rebinds it in a style of fine binding—rounded and backed spine, laced-in boards, sewn headbands, decorative end sheets, leather cover etc." ...|$|E

A special one off Balboni was created by the Singapore distributor of Lamborghini (Eurosport) which had Superleggera seats and a full Reiter Engineering Super Trofeo Strada body derived directly from the Super Trofeo series cars. This one off Balboni was viewed as the predecessor to the Singapore Edition limited run LP550-2 (see below) which had a stripped out Superleggera interior, Superleggera side skirts, rear deck, rear diffuser and front bumper (sans Superleggera rear wing) but which critically was a 2wd car which catered to the enthusiast driver.
