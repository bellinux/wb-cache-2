25|$|Chrysotile {{has been}} used {{more than any other}} type and {{accounts}} for about 95% of the asbestos found in buildings in America. Chrysotile is more flexible than amphibole types of asbestos, and can be spun and woven into fabric. The most common use was corrugated asbestos cement roofing primarily for outbuildings, warehouses and garages. It may also be found in sheets or panels used for ceilings and sometimes for walls and floors. Chrysotile has been a component in joint compound and some plasters. Numerous other items have been made containing chrysotile including brake linings, <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> in fuseboxes, pipe insulation, floor tiles, residential shingles, and gaskets for high temperature equipment.|$|E
2500|$|A large {{wildfire}} {{burned through}} the Town of Slave Lake, Alberta, Canada {{and its surrounding}} area from Saturday, May 14, 2011 through Monday, May 16, 2011. The conflagration, which originated [...] outside of town as a forest fire, was quickly pushed past <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> {{designed to protect the}} town by [...] winds. [...] The fire forced the complete evacuation of Slave Lake's 7,000 residents—considered the largest such displacement in the province's history at the time—to the nearby towns of Athabasca and Westlock, as well as the provincial capital of Edmonton. [...] No casualties were reported amongst the town's population, but a pilot was killed when his helicopter crashed while he was battling the fires around the community.|$|E

50|$|Older {{buildings}} {{often have}} no firestops at all. In such cases, a thorough inspection can identify all {{vertical and horizontal}} <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> and their fire ratings. A thorough inspection can also identify all breaches in these barriers, which can be sealed via approved methods.|$|E
50|$|There was no {{sprinkler}} system, {{and some}} of the <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> in the ceilings had been pierced during alterations to the building. The blaze, one of the biggest seen in Manchester since the Second World War was brought under control by 160 firemen using 30 appliances.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{properties}} of glass such as heat resistance and {{an inability to}} ignite, glass {{has been used to}} create <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> in hazardous environments such as inside of racecars.

50|$|There {{are three}} main classifications of fire rated walls: fire walls, <b>fire</b> <b>barriers,</b> and fire partitions. To the layperson, the common use of {{language}} typically includes all three when referring to a firewall unless distinguishing between them becomes necessary.

5000|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> wall, or a fire partition, is a {{fire-rated wall}} {{assembly}} that provides {{lower levels of}} protection than typically provided by a fire wall. The main differences are that these fire resistant walls are not structurally self-sufficient.|$|R
5000|$|After its completion, {{the station}} {{initially}} had no overhead wires. Diesel railcars were used and exhaust gas extractors operated on the platform. There is a <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> between {{the station and}} the airport terminal that can be closed in case of emergency.|$|R
50|$|Spray {{fireproofing}} {{products have}} not been qualified {{to the thousands of}} firestop configurations, so they cannot be installed in conformance of a certification listing. Therefore, firestopping must precede fireproofing. Both need one another. If the structural steel is left without fireproofing, it can damage <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> and a building can collapse. If the barriers are not firestopped properly, fire and smoke can spread from one compartment to another.|$|E
5000|$|For {{some high}} {{challenge}} occupancies, the code requirements for an occupancy separation are more stringent than for other <b>fire</b> <b>barriers,</b> even with an identical fire resistance rating. In this case, an occupancy separation with a two-hour fire-resistance rating {{may not be}} able to [...] "de-rate" [...] its closures, such fire doors and firestops.

50|$|Sealants, despite {{not having}} great strength, convey {{a number of}} properties. They seal top {{structures}} to the substrate, and are particularly effective in waterproofing processes by keeping moisture out (or in) the components {{in which they are}} used. They can provide thermal and acoustical insulation, and may serve as <b>fire</b> <b>barriers.</b> They may have electrical properties, as well. Sealants can also be used for simple smoothing or filling. They are often called upon to perform several of these functions at once.|$|E

50|$|One {{predicted}} {{problem with}} large green roofs is that fire {{may be able}} to spread rapidly across areas of dry grasses and plants when they are dried, for instance, in summer by hot weather: Various countries are stipulating <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> areas made of, for example, wide strips of (partly decorative) gravel.|$|R
30|$|This report {{reviews the}} impact of current {{mattress}} flammability standards, examines factors affecting mattress flammability, and reviews full-scale and bench-scale test methods that are being developed for mattresses. The construction type, geometry, and size of a mattress are major factors in determining the fire threat of a mattress. The soft materials used in the mattress set, including cushioning materials, fire blocking materials, and tickings, act both individually and collectively to affect the fire performance. The performance of <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> materials {{designed to protect the}} inner cushioning material from heat and flame is largely dependent on the choice of cushioning material and ticking. When used with an incompatible combination of filling material and ticking, a <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> may fail to protect thermal degradation and subsequent burning of filling material. Some of the challenges in designing mattresses have been identified and reported here.|$|R
50|$|Firestops {{should be}} {{maintained}} {{in accordance with}} the listing, approval use, and compliance. Construction documentation sometimes includes an inventory of all firestops in a building, with drawings indicating location and the certification listings of each firestop. Using this, a building owner can meet the requirements of the fire code related to <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> during the period of building occupation. Otherwise, improper repairs may result, which would violate the fire code, and could allow a fire to travel between areas intended by code to be separated during a fire event.|$|E
50|$|Although {{low voltage}} cabling {{does not require}} {{inspection}} or training to install in some jurisdictions, {{it is still important}} for installers to be aware of specific electric code safety rules such as how to correctly penetrate building <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> and use firestop putty (intumescents) to prevent a low voltage cable from reducing building fire protection and increasing the risk of injury or death for building occupants. Access to such safety information is typically restricted and limited access by the electrical industry itself so as to only permit licensed professionals to learn the NEC rules and educate themselves.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} pictures illustrate {{an example}} of a successful fire test that led to a UL listing or a three-hour fire protection rating. The entire assembly is exposed to a fire for the specified amount of time per the objective of the test. Following this heat exposure, a hose stream is applied to the door. Fire doors and fire dampers are derated from the <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> they are in. In this case, a 3-hour rated door is acceptable for use in up to a 4-hour wall. Because it goes into a 4-hour wall, it received a 45PSI (31N/cm²) hose stream test.|$|E
30|$|Successfully {{achieving}} the desired level of fire protection requires appropriate matching of barrier materials {{to the desired}} characteristics of the soft furnishing. This selection is generally a process {{of trial and error}} due to significant measurement science gaps. Below are a few examples demonstrating the complexity that makes a priori selection of <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> materials difficult.|$|R

3000|$|... {{cost-saving}} {{approach is}} to create a composite of a PUF core encapsulated by one of these intrinsically FR foams. For example, Hashish ([Hashish et al. 2003]) evaluated a polyimide foam as a <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> for spacecraft cushion material. When tested by cone calorimetry, the application of polyimide foam layers over standard PUF increased the minimum heat flux for ignition of flammable PUF from 27 [*]kW/m 2 to 48 [*]kW/m 2. This ignition risk reduction was sufficient to enable the noncompliant PUF to pass the targeted regulations. Inclusion of polyimide foam layers also significantly reduced the PHRR, mass loss rate (MLR), and the generation of smoke and carbon monoxide. Carboxylated chloroprene foams are also commonly used to encapsulate the PUF core or as a fabric backing. Chloroprene foams are high density foams which are generally specified for public transport applications. They generally act as active <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> materials.|$|R

50|$|Fire barrier {{walls are}} {{typically}} continuous from an exterior wall to an exterior wall, {{or from a}} floor below to a floor or roof above, or from one fire barrier wall to another fire barrier wall, having a fire resistance rating {{equal to or greater}} than the required rating for the application. <b>Fire</b> <b>barriers</b> are continuous through concealed spaces (e.g., above a ceiling) to the floor deck or roof deck above the barrier. Fire partitions are not required to extend through concealed spaces if the construction assembly forming the bottom of the concealed space, such as the ceiling, has a fire resistance rating at least equal to or greater than the fire partition.|$|E
30|$|These newly {{engineered}} materials, which address environmental {{as well as}} toxicological concerns, may lower {{heat release}} in future soft furnishing fires, thereby saving lives and protecting property in case of accidental fires. In addition to developing new, sustainable and superior fire blocking materials, it is also very essential to define guidelines for quantifying the performance of <b>fire</b> blocking <b>barrier</b> fabrics. These guidelines will provide a competitive advantage for soft furnishing industry to develop <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> fabrics that comply with full-scale fire regulations for mattresses and upholstered furniture. Current research activities in our laboratories are focused towards development of standardized testing tools and methods for quantitative evaluation of barrier effectiveness.|$|R
