50|$|At {{the time}} of the crash, the captain was the chief pilot of the airline and was {{responsible}} for recruiting, selecting and training new pilots for the airline. He had 17 years experience as a pilot, but less than a year's experience as a chief pilot. His friends and family told investigators that in the weeks before the crash, he was exhibiting symptoms of extreme stress. The First Officer had been with the airline for two months and had only flown single-engine aircraft before joining Downeast. He was reported to have had problems with instrument approaches in the past, including excessive rates of <b>descent.</b> <b>Examination</b> of the crew members' bodies after the crash determined that the First Officer was likely flying at {{the time of}} the crash, as he had suffered a broken thumb.|$|E
50|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{believed the}} woman to be either of European or Native American ancestry. A further exhumation and examination of the remains, conducted in 2012, established that she was of European <b>descent.</b> An <b>examination</b> of Harris lines in the victim's bones indicated that an illness or malnutrition had briefly arrested her growth in childhood.|$|R
50|$|With the {{annexation}} of Czechoslovakia during the Third Reich, Jan {{falls in love}} with Liza, a young German Sudetenland woman who worships Adolf Hitler. She agrees to marry him only after he proves that he is of pure Aryan <b>descent</b> through medical <b>examination.</b> During the occupation, the other waiters and the hotel manager, Brandejs, express their contempt for the German occupiers by trying to be as unhelpful in their service as possible. Jan is {{the only member of the}} waitstaff not to express symbolic resistance in this manner. Brandejs dismisses Jan for this reason, and says that Jan will be blacklisted from employment in any Prague establishment. When Jan and Liza later appear as patrons, and after Jan mocks Skřivánek that serving the King of England has done him no good in life, Skřivánek pours food over Jan in protest. Eventually, Skřivánek is taken away by the occupying authorities and never seen again.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study of}} reports relating to cockpit altitude alert systems was performed. A recent {{change in the}} Federal Air Regulation permits the system to be modified so that the alerting signal approaching altitude has only a visual component; the auditory signal {{would continue to be}} heard if a deviation from an assigned altitude occurred. Failure to observe altitude alert signals and failure to reset the system were the commonest cause of altitude deviations related to this system. Cockpit crew distraction was the most frequent reason for these failures. It was noted by numerous reporters that the presence of altitude alert system made them less aware of altitude; this lack of altitude awareness is discussed. Failures of crew coordination were also noted. It is suggested that although modification of the altitude alert system may be highly desirable in short-haul aircraft, it may not be desirable for long-haul aircraft in which cockpit workloads are much lower for long periods of time. In these cockpits, the aural alert approaching altitudes is perceived as useful and helpful. If the systems are to be modified, it appears that additional emphasis on altitude awareness during recurrent training will be necessary; {{it is also possible that}} flight crew operating procedures during climb and <b>descent</b> may need <b>examination</b> with respect to monitoring responsibilities. A selection of alert bulletins and responses to them is presented...|$|R
40|$|Background: Paravaginal defects {{are often}} {{assumed to be}} the {{underlying}} anatomical abnormality in anterior compart-ment <b>descent.</b> Neither clinical <b>examination</b> nor ultrasound assessment are generally accepted diagnostic modalities. Aims: To compare clinical examination and translabial 3 D ultrasound in the detection of such defects. Methods: Fifty-nine women without previous prolapse or incontinence surgery were seen prospectively. Clinical and ultrasound assessments were carried out in blinded fashion. 3 D translabial ultrasound was undertaken after voiding and supine. Volumes were acquired at rest, on Valsalva and on levator contraction. Loss of paravaginal support (‘tenting’) in the axial plane was taken to signify paravaginal defects. Results: Paravaginal defects were reported clinically in 14 cases on the left (24 %), 19 times on the right (32 %). Two 3 D ultrasound examinations did not yield satisfactory volumes, leaving 57 for analysis. Neither midsagittal nor coronal views yielded data that correlated with clinical assessments. In the axial plane there was absence of tenting at rest in 32 / 57 (57 %) patients, but this did not correlate with clinical findings. Loss of tenting on Valsalva was observed less often (21 / 57, 37 %) and was weakly associated with clinically observed lateral defects (P = 0. 036). Conclusions: Pelvic floor ultrasound in midsagittal, axial or coronal planes does not correlate well with clinical assess-ment for paravaginal defects. This {{could be due to}} poor clinical assessment technique or limitations of the ultrasound method. On the other hand, paravaginal defects may be uncommon or clinically irrelevant. On present knowledge, the paravaginal defect has to be regarded as an unproven concept. Key words: 3 D ultrasound, incontinence, paravaginal defects, prolapse, translabial ultrasound...|$|R
