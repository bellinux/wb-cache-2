The die cast is made from alloy AlSi 9 Cu 3 (Fe) in foundry KOVOLIT, a. s. There is a problem with inner defects at this cast. Solution of this thesis is to suggest suitable actions to minimize of incidence the defects in the cast. According to analysis of the defects in the cast these defects were classified as combination of shrinkages and gas holes. According to analysis causes of the defects are high temperature of <b>die</b> <b>mould</b> and closed air in <b>die</b> <b>mould.</b> As a result suitable actions were suggested – a change of the <b>die</b> <b>mould</b> tempering and a design adjustment of the cast.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{applications}} of powder injection moulding (PIM), the metallic powders {{are the most}} popular material. In our study, three metallic powders with different compositions, particle shapes and particle sizes have been selected as the test materials to produce micro-structured parts using injection moulding process. The combination of three binders (polypropylene, paraffin waxes and stearic acid) with a constant and adapted formulation has been chosen as a binder system. The mixtures obtained by mixing the metallic powders and the binder system with solid loadings ranging from 56 to 64 vol. % have been used as the feedstocks for the next injection moulding. The viscosity of mixture increased with increasing solid loading. These feedstocks were injected using the same injection moulding conditions in the metallic mould structured with pyramidal shape manufactured using electro-erosion machining. The debinding and sintering process have been carried out at different temperatures to eliminate the binders in the injected replica and obtain the final metallic <b>die</b> <b>mould.</b> To analyse the physical properties evolution of the <b>die</b> <b>mould</b> manufactured by PIM and the influence factors (powder nuance, solid loading and sintering conditions), the shrinkage rate, density, roughness of surface, Vickers hardness and mass losses in metallic mould cavities were investigated.

40|$|Many {{developing}} countries now assemble {{most of the}} final products they use, but they still need to import most inputs. To escape this dependence, {{developing countries}} are focusing on ways to make more intermediate inputs domestically. But very expensive <b>dies,</b> <b>moulds</b> and castings patterns are required to make most rubber, glass, plastic or metallic components used as intermediate inputs. On the other hand, the machinery and equipment used together with the <b>dies,</b> <b>moulds</b> and patterns can make a wide range to products but are often underutilized. So, often only the <b>dies,</b> <b>moulds,</b> or patterns are needed to begin the production of various components. But, to protect their financial interests, multinational corporations (MNCs) often will not allow a developing country to use these key pieces of equipment without a comprehensive transfer of technology agreement. Hence, often either the developing countries remain import dependent for the components or cannot compete internationally due to their small domestic markets and {{the high cost of}} the <b>dies,</b> <b>moulds</b> and patterns, and hence high per-unit production costs. So, the costs for DMPs must be lowered to economically enable LDCs to deepen import substitution for currently imported intermediate components. These costs might be lowered by: (1) better negotiation with MNCs; (2) joint South-South purchase of DMPs; (3) aid supported guarantees to encourage firms to lend DMPs to LDCs (4) decreasing the number of makes, models, and designs for products; and, (5) improving and subsidizing the facilities to make DMPs locally. However, to implement these programmes, third world governments would need to perceive their objectives clearly and firmly confront the resistance from internal and external vested interests which benefit from the LCDs' continuing import dependenc...|$|R

These are the most promising power sources for road transportation and portable devices. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. A fuel cell stack consists of bipolar plates and membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). The bipolar plate is by weight, volume and cost one of the most significant components of a fuel cell stack. Major functions of bipolar plates are to separate oxidant and fuel gas, provide flow channels, conduct electricity and provide heat transfer. Bipolar plates can be made from various materials including graphite, metals, carbon / carbon and carbon/polymer composites. Materials for carbon–polymer composites are relatively inexpensive, less corrosive, strong and channels can be formed by means of a moulding process. Carbon– polymer composites are of two type i. e; thermosetting and thermoplastic. For thermosetting composite a bulk molding compound (BMC) was prepared by adding graphite, vinyl ester resin, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and cobalt naphthalate. The BMC was thoroughly mixed, poured into a <b>die</b> <b>mould</b> of a bipolar plate with channels and hot pressed at a specific temperature and pressure.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} investigation and modelling of the {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) performance on titanium alloy Ti- 5 Al- 2. 5 Sn. Despite enormous applications of lightweight and high-strength titanium alloy, a key problem in machining using conventional machining processes arises. The non-conventional technique, EDM, can machine difficult-to-cut materials effectively. However, in EDM, a complete and clear theory {{has not yet been}} established. The proper selection of EDM parameters for the best process performance is still a challenge. Thus, {{the purpose of the present}} work is to develop the mathematical models to predict performance characteristics (material removal rate, tool wear rate and surface roughness) along with the optimal parametric set-up of EDM on Ti- 5 Al- 2. 5 Sn titanium alloy. The peak current, pulse-on time, pulse-off time, servo-voltage, polarity (positive and negative), and electrode material (copper, copper-tungsten and graphite) are considered as process variables. The experimental work was performed based on an experiment design (central composite design). The mathematical models, using the response surface method, and the artificial neural network (ANN) model, using the multilayer perception method, were developed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been performed to verify the fit and adequacy of the developed mathematical models. A confirmation test was conducted to obtain the accuracy of the developed models. In addition, the surface topography of the workpiece was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results evidence that the developed mathematical model can predict the performance characteristics of EDM successfully. The average errors of the mathematical model in predicting material removal rate, surface roughness and tool wear rate were 4. 34 %, 4. 17 % and 4. 50 % respectively. While, the average errors were 2. 61 %, 2. 77 % and 3. 05 % for the ANN model. Thus, the ANN model is more precise than the mathematical model. The negative graphite electrode provides the highest material removal rate. However, it maximizes the tool wear rate, and causes the poorest surface finish. The positive copper-tungsten electrode becomes the best choice in respect of all performance characteristics. It was very difficult to achieve single settings of the process parameters for all the best performance characteristics. In addition, the multiple objectives were incompatible. The surface topography for negative polarity demonstrates larger craters, wider and deeper cracks and greater amounts of globules when compared to positive polarity. The obtained results lead to desirable process output, and cost-effective machining. Therefore, it becomes a precise tool, making the EDM process cost-effective and efficient in the <b>die,</b> <b>mould,</b> tool and other industries...|$|E

It is of great importance to establish life evaluation technology for remanufacturers to predict the remaining service life of <b>dies</b> and <b>moulds.</b> The main contribution of this thesis is the development of key technologies for life evaluation of <b>dies</b> and <b>moulds</b> after remanufacturing through a thorough review of remanufacture related activities within the <b>die</b> and <b>mould</b> industry. It is proposed that evaluation of remaining service life of <b>dies</b> and <b>moulds</b> after remanufacturing is carried out using finite element modelling. It involves determination of residual stresses induced by repair welding, working conditions for the future operation and life model of die material. Specifically, the thesis is firstly focused on the design of representative die geometry. The geometry is optimized based on the effect of thermal loading and the effect of residual stress due to laser welding. Secondly, fatigue life model was established by conducting thermal fatigue tests and finite element modelling as well. Induction heating based test method was adopted for its capacity of achieving similar thermal shock effects. An energy based life model was derived by taking into account test period. The laser weld characteristics were studied using a sequential experimental design combining orthogonal method and uniform design. Radial Basis Function neutral networks were used to obtain regression models of weld performances for enabling process optimization. Heat source models were also calibrated by achieving sufficient agreement between numerical and experimental weld profiles. Lastly, the effect of residual stress on the fatigue life model was identified and the life model was updated. With close agreement between corresponding coefficients from two curve fittings, the corrected model is proved to be reliable for evaluating remaining useful life of remanufactured dies/moulds...|$|R
