40|$|This study {{observes the}} {{structures}} of coordination used in Insurance Policy. The structure of coordination is the only structure in English which has more than two immediate constituents: clearly, a series has as many immediate constituents as there are items in the series. This refers to the sentences in the Insurance Policy, which are constructed in very long and complex sentences. This thesis aims at finding out the construction of structures of coordination in <b>Erection</b> <b>All</b> <b>Risks</b> Policy. Therefore, the writer analyzed the structure of coordination based on Nelson Francis' theory. A structure of coordination consists {{of two or more}} syntactically equivalent units joined in a structure which functions as a single unit. The units so joined may be any of the parts of speech or more complex structures. The joining is accomplished by coordinators and punctuation marks in written form. The coordinators could be either present or not. The other supported theories are Sidney Greebaum and Randolph Quirk in coordination (1990); Enno Klamer in the components and punctuation (1977); and John E. Warriner in punctuation (1982). The details of the theories are to be discussed in chapter 11. The writer uses qualitative approach to analyze {{the structures of}} coordination in the sentences of Insurance Policy. The approaches of this study are the kinds of structures of coordination, the components of the structures of coordination, the linkers of the structures of coordination, the syntactic functions of the structures of coordination, and to count their occurrence used in the Insurance Policy. From this study, it is found out that there are four types of' structure of coordination. They are common and syndetic, series and asyndetic (with comma); series and asyndetic (with semicolon); then series and poiysyndetic (without comma). The components of structures of coordination arc parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, and adverb), phrases (noun phrase, verb phrase, and prepositional phrase), and clauses (independent and subordination clause). The linkers of structures of coordination are coordinating conjunction anti, or, but, {{and with the help of}} punctuation marks comma and semicolon. The syntactic functions of the structures of coordination function as subject, predicate, main verb (part of predicate), direct object, objective complement, object of preposition, head, and modifier. Through this analysis, the writer expects that the results will help the readers read the Insurance Policy easily...|$|R

One of them is commerce of equipment of transportation namely the many motor vehicles imported merchant and in Indonesia. This vehicle commerce business hardly {{to the advantage of}} investor playing at in this business, in execution of commerce using transportation media to earn is just happened things/risks/event undesirable dicey by the owner of vehicles. Dicey event of that is for example vehicle theft, vehicle damage caused by accident, fire, natural disaster (earthquake, floods, mount erupts, tsunami), riot and others. One of way done by owner of motor vehicle to transfer <b>all</b> the <b>risks</b> is by the way of transferring risk to party giving security and safety guarantee or compensatory to itself vehicle. In this case, the guarantor is the side of insurance. The many emulations of effort for insurance service giver the party’s insurance races give a real guarantee promises. Insurance product which now hardly enthused by the insurance service users be releasing the extension of guarantee to <b>all</b> <b>risks</b> which possibly will befall the vehicle. The famous product by the name of insurance <b>All</b> <b>Risk,</b> is insurance giving <b>all</b> <b>risks</b> to small risk (for example breakdown mirror, destruction of body car and others) and risk that is weight (breakdown car because collision, or stolen by people) as well as responsibility to third party. Financial loss to vehicle experiencing accident, theft and responsibility to other party harmed by vehicle of itself is heavy burden for the owner, which {{might not be able to}} be shouldered self. Therefore, now the insurance service users can choose insurance company thinking it precise to insure the vehicle. Purpose of this research is to know about execution procedure of payment of insurance claim <b>All</b> <b>Risk</b> by underwriter to the insured in PT. Asuransi Jiwa Bersama Bumi Putera (AJB BP). Besides, to know protection of law what given to the insured if object insured with <b>All</b> <b>Risk</b> to experience evenemen, and law responsibility what given by underwriter if object insured by <b>All</b> <b>Risk</b> to entangle third party. Research method applied is yuridist sociologies, that is explains facts obtained from result of research in field and or through documentation and bibliography study then for pulled conclusion. Based on result of research is got result as follows. That execution of execution of agreement of insurance <b>All</b> <b>Risk</b> to motor vehicle in PT. AJB BP divided to become three steps. Firstly is field officer from insurance visits client candidate and surveys vehicle which will be insured. Second, that is field officer offers product released by company and additional guarantees and liability insurance closing type. Third is accomplishment of condition of agreement where agreement of motor vehicle insurance can happen after agreement between both parties that is underwriter and the insured. While replacement mechanism/payment insurance claims <b>All</b> <b>Risk</b> the side of insurance gives two options, that is payment of claim and rejection of claim. Then from protection side of law to the insured and third party becoming victim which caused by object insured with <b>All</b> <b>Risk.</b> Firstly, protection of law given by underwriter to clause owner the insured <b>All</b> <b>Risk</b> hence protection to the insured is the absolute existence. Second is protection of law given by the side of insurance entangling third party, hence the side of PT. AJB BP will pay attention to authenticity from policy applied and concordance in clause found on policy <b>All</b> <b>Risk.</b> Result from this research expected is able to made input and consideration especially to the side of management of insurance that will release its newest product and the side of jelly the insured have to be more read content than the policy clause...|$|R

40|$|Background: Recently, {{there have}} been a number of studies on the {{association}} between XRCC 1 polymorphisms and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<b>ALL)</b> <b>risk.</b> However, the results of previous reports are inconsistent. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the effects of XRCC 1 variants on childhood <b>ALL</b> <b>risk.</b> Methods: A meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between XRCC 1 polymorphisms (Arg 399 Gln, Arg 194 Trp, and Arg 280 His) and childhood <b>ALL</b> <b>risk.</b> We critically reviewed 7 studies with a total of 880 cases and 1311 controls for Arg 399 Gln polymorphism, 3 studies with a total of 345 cases and 554 controls for Arg 280 His polymorphism, and 6 studies with a total of 783 cases and 1180 controls for Arg 194 Trp polymorphism, respectively. Odds ratio (OR) and its 95 % confidence interval (CI) were used. Results: Significant association between XRCC 1 Arg 399 Gln polymorphism and childhood <b>ALL</b> <b>risk</b> was observed in total population analyses (OR additive model = 1. 501, 95 % CI 1. 112 – 2. 026, P OR = 0. 008; OR dominant model = 1. 316, 95 % CI = 1. 104 – 1. 569, POR = 0. 002) and Asian subgroup analyses (ORadditive model = 2. 338, 95 %CI = 1. 254 – 4. 359, POR = 0. 008; ORdominant model = 2. 108, 95 %CI = 1. 498 – 2. 967, POR = 0. 000). No association was detected in Caucasians, Metizo and mixed populations. Ethnicity was considered as a significant source of heterogeneity in the meta-regression model. For the other two XRCC 1 polymorphisms, no association with childhood <b>ALL</b> <b>risk</b> was found...|$|R
