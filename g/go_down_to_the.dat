5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators {{decided to make}} the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E
5|$|Later, Overman's corpse is discovered. Reviewing the body, Kay {{realizes that}} the shark that killed him is the first shark's mother, and that {{it must also be}} inside the park. She is able to {{convince}} Calvin about this newest development when the shark herself shows up at the window of the underwater cafe. Flushed out from her refuge inside a filtration pipe, the shark begins to wreak havoc on the park, injures a water skier, and causes a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack, <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> filtration pipe in an attempt to lure the shark back in as a trap. FitzRoyce leads the shark into the pipe, but is then attacked and killed.|$|E
5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E

5|$|The {{first book}} of Blyton's Five Find-Outers series, The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage, was {{published}} in 1943, as was the second book in the Faraway series, The Magic Faraway Tree, which in 2003 was voted 66th in the BBC's Big Read poll to find the UK's favourite book. Several of Blyton's works during this period have seaside themes; John Jolly by the Sea (1943), a picture book intended for younger readers, {{was published in}} a booklet format by Evans Brothers. Other books with a maritime theme include The Secret of Cliff Castle and Smuggler Ben, both attributed to Mary Pollock in 1943; The Island of Adventure, {{the first in the}} Adventure series of eight novels from 1944 onwards; and various novels of the Famous Five series such as Five on a Treasure Island (1942), Five on Kirrin Island Again (1947) and Five <b>Go</b> <b>Down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea (1953).|$|E
25|$|After winning another league {{title in}} 1976 and the 1977 Copa Fraternidad, the club faced their worst period, unable to win any titles and even {{being close to}} {{dropping}} from the top division, playing a relegation mini-tournament in the 1981 season – which saw Tipografía Nacional <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Division B. In 1982, Municipal struggled again, this time finishing ahead of the relegated team on goal differential.|$|E
25|$|Bhagiratha {{prayed to}} Brahma that Ganga {{come down to}} Earth. Brahma agreed and he ordered Ganga to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth {{and then on to}} the nether regions so that the souls of Bhagiratha's {{ancestors}} would {{be able to go to}} heaven. Ganga felt that this was insulting and decided to sweep the whole Earth away as she fell from the heavens. Alarmed, Bhagiratha prayed to Shiva that he break up Ganga's descent.|$|E

25|$|The Gold Coast Football Club {{scheduled}} a practice match against the reigning QAFL premiers Southport Sharks in the buildup {{to their first}} game in the TAC Cup. The Gold Coast would <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sharks 6.3 (39) to 3.5 (17) at Carrara Stadium. Marc Lock was named as the first captain of the club just days before their first round clash with the Eastern Ranges in the TAC Cup. The club lost their first round clash with the Rangers by 38 points at Carrara Stadium.|$|E
25|$|North Melbourne {{struggled}} {{in its first}} two years under Brad Scott, finishing 9th in both 2010 and 2011. In 2012, the club returned to the finals {{for the first time}} since 2008, finishing the season in 8th place, but would <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West Coast Eagles by 96 points in an elimination final. In 2012, the club began a three-year deal to play two games each year at Blundstone Arena in Hobart, Tasmania. The club finished 10th in 2013 in a season full of close losses. Nick Dal Santo signed with the club at the end of the 2013 season as a restricted free agent.|$|E
25|$|The Sant'Anna Church, {{built by}} the Armação fishing company, {{is part of the}} beach's history. It was from there that whale harpooners and crewmen confessed and {{attended}} the mass before going fishing. Next, the priest would <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beach to bless the boats that would sail out to sea. Today, the boats leave there for Ilha do Campeche, one of the most visited islands around Florianópolis. It is also in Armação that one finds {{one of the most important}} archaeological sites of the State of Santa Catarina. In the winter of 2010 a significant portion of the beach disappeared due to erosion. With financial aid from the Brazilian federal government, tons of large rocks were dumped on the beach to prevent houses from destruction.|$|E

25|$|It {{was usually}} several meters {{deep into the}} ground, in some cases, 20 meters by {{stepping}} down the stone steps. In the 13th century, excavation of wells started and in an early 18th-century document, 59 wells were recorded. Among them, Yamatsugā which was developed in 1720, was designated as an important site by the Hirara City (now Miyakojima City) education committee. It was a rich spring, and was used only by the government officials at the time. There was a guard posted at the spring. It was the duty of women to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> caves and draw water, and since the Meiji era, girls {{went down to the}} caves and draw water, as adult women had other duties. Due to the increase in population, it became a business to sell water from neighboring places.|$|E
25|$|This {{station has}} an {{elevated}} station house beneath the tracks {{at the extreme}} south end. A single staircase from each platform goes down to a waiting area/crossunder, where a turnstile bank provides entrance/exit from the station. Near these staircases, one elevator leads from each platform to the mezzanine. Outside fare control, there is a token booth; an elevator and two staircases <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwestern corner of 45th Road and 23rd Street, while two escalators within an enclosed passageway lead directly to the complex's underground mezzanine area (via a new transfer passageway), and the northbound platform's elevator (within fare control) also leads to the underground mezzanine, bypassing the street along the way. A single staircase also leads to the southwestern corner of 45th Road and 23rd Street, and is signposted as serving only the Flushing Line station (as opposed to all three stations of the complex).|$|E
25|$|During {{certain parts}} of the Amidah said on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, Ashkenazi Jews {{traditionally}} <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor upon their knees and make their upper body bowed over like an arch, similar to Muslims, though not exactly in the same manner. There are some variations in Ashkenazi customs as to how long one remains in this position. Some Jews among the Dor Daim and Talmidhe haRambam understand both the Mishneh Torah and the Talmudic source texts concerning bowing in the Shemoneh Esreh to be teaching that one must always prostrate, lying flat on the ground, not only during the High Holy Days, but throughout the year during the four bows of the Amidah. It is hard to know the percentage of those who hold by the latter view, the likelihood being that most who accept such a view usually only do so in private or when praying among like-minded people.|$|E

500|$|Violence, drug use, {{relationship}} issues, humor, and Nazism were {{prominent in}} the album's lyrics. The album opens with [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop", which is among the band's most recognized songs. Most of the album's tracks are uptempo, with many songs measuring at well over 160 beats per minute. The songs are also rather short; at two-and-a-half minutes, [...] "I Don't Wanna <b>Go</b> <b>Down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Basement" [...] is the album's longest track. Ramones contains a cover of the Chris Montez song [...] "Let's Dance".|$|E
500|$|Of course, I haven't any {{voice to}} speak of, but I {{have a great}} register, and Sullivan used to amuse himself by making me sing bass in one number of an opera and tenor in another. [...] In 'Ruddygore', Sir Arthur had engaged a man to play the servant, my menial, so to speak, who had an {{enormous}} bass voice, and who had to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower E flat. [...] Singularly enough, he could go down to G, and then he dropped out entirely, and I did the [...] below. [...] Generally the audience roared with laughter, and it absolutely brought down the house.|$|E
500|$|Sanders {{attended}} Nelson Street School but in 1894, {{when his}} family moved to Takapuna, he shifted to Takapuna School. [...] The school was close to Lake Pupuke, where he learned to sail. [...] He earned the nickname Gunner Billy for his exploits with a small cannon that a classmate brought to school. He left school at the age of 15, and due to the influence of his parents was apprenticed to a mercer in Auckland's Queen Street. He was not particularly interested in the profession and, desiring a career at sea, would <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wharfs to inspect the berthed ships and chat with their captains and crewmen.|$|E

500|$|Kehoe's {{neighbor}} Sidney J. Howell {{testified that}} after the fire began, Kehoe warned him and three boys to leave the farm, saying [...] "Boys, you are my friends, you {{better get out of}} here, you better <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school." [...] Three telephone linemen working near Bath testified that Kehoe passed them on the road toward the school, and they saw him arrive there. He swerved his truck and {{stopped in front of the}} building. In the next instant, according to the linemen, the truck blew up, and one of them was struck by shrapnel. [...] Other witnesses testified that Kehoe paused after stopping and called Superintendent Huyck over before blowing up his truck.|$|E
500|$|The album's title {{came from}} a spoonerism by Jackson, who once said, [...] "I'll <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio and dub on some more porn harts", meaning [...] "horn parts". The cover was {{designed}} by regular Charisma album artist Paul Whitehead, who was told by Hammill, [...] "no matter if you're a king, a pauper or whatever – you're a pawn" [...] {{which led to a}} design containing the earth and a curtain. The inner gatefold picture was taken by Keith Morris and featured the band playing Crowborough Tennis while appearing to give Nazi salutes to each other, though Banton later said this was simply the band attempting to look ridiculous in the vein of Monty Python.|$|E
500|$|A line {{in which}} Dwight tells Andy that Angela [...] "certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking" [...] was improvised by Wilson. Much of the {{dialogue}} between Andy and Dwight during the duel scene was also improvised. It was writer Paul Lieberstein, who served as show runner along with Celotta at the time, who suggested the idea of Andy sneaking up on Dwight with his Toyota Prius. The original script called for the entire office cast {{to come down to}} the parking lot from the Dunder Mifflin office to try to stop Dwight and Andy from fighting. However, the staging proved awkward during filming, so John Krasinski suggested that only Jim <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parking lot while the others stayed behind, and the change was eventually incorporated into the episode.|$|E
