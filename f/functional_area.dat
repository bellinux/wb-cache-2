5|$|Most {{students}} {{participate in}} the Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP). In 2009, the school held eight AMSP seminars. AMSP is intended to educate students in military arts and science, and focuses on operational art and covers a variety of subjects, including military problem solving; military theory and history, military doctrine, operational planning; battle dynamics, operational theory and practice, contemporary military operations, {{and the application of}} national elements of power. Besides classroom studies and operational exercises, students must complete a research monograph and an oral examination. After graduating, officers serve on a division, corps, or Army Service Component Command staff, or in a <b>functional</b> <b>area</b> assignment.|$|E

40|$|How are neurons {{distributed}} {{along the}} cortical surface and across <b>functional</b> <b>areas?</b> Here {{we use the}} isotropic fractionator (Herculano-Houzel and Lent, 2005) to analyze the distribution of neurons across the entire isocortex of the mouse, divided into 18 <b>functional</b> <b>areas</b> defined anatomically. We find {{that the number of}} neurons underneath a surface area (the N/A ratio) varies 4. 5 -fold across <b>functional</b> <b>areas</b> and neuronal density varies 3. 2 -fold. The face area of S 1 contains the most neurons, followed by motor cortex and the primary visual cortex. Remarkably, while the distribution of neurons across <b>functional</b> <b>areas</b> does not accompany the distribution of surface area, it mirrors closely the distribution of cortical volumes – {{with the exception of the}} visual areas, which hold more neurons than expected for their volume. Across the non-visual cortex, the volume of individual <b>functional</b> <b>areas</b> is a shared linear function of their number of neurons, while in the visual areas, neuronal densities are much higher than in all other areas. In contrast, the 18 <b>functional</b> <b>areas</b> cluster into three different zones according to the relationship between the N/A ratio and cortical thickness and neuronal density: these three clusters can be called visual, sensory, and, possibly, associative. These findings are remarkably similar to those in the human cerebral cortex (see companion paper) and suggest that, like the human cerebral cortex, the mouse cerebral cortex comprises two zones that differ in how neurons form the cortical volume, and three zones that differ in how neurons are distributed underneath the cortical surface, possibly in relation to local differences in connectivity through the white matter. Our results suggest that beyond the developmental divide into visual and non-visual cortex, <b>functional</b> <b>areas</b> initially share a common distribution of neurons along the parenchyma that become delimited into <b>functional</b> <b>areas</b> according to the pattern of connectivity established later...|$|R
25|$|A {{large number}} of variant {{annotation}} tools are available for variant annotation {{but in some cases}} the prediction by the tools does not agree since the way the rules have been defined differ slightly between each application.

25|$|Lashley also {{discovered}} that {{a portion of a}} <b>functional</b> <b>area</b> could carry out the role of the entire area, even {{when the rest of the}} area has been removed. He called this phenomenon equipotentiality. We know now that he was seeing evidence of plasticity in the brain. The brain has the spectacular ability for certain areas to take over the functions of other areas if those areas should fail or be removed.|$|E

Similarly, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council is composed of national finance ministers, and they are still one per state and the chair is held by the member coming from the presiding country.

2500|$|The Grianán of Aileach, as {{described}} in the introductory section, is encircled by three enclosures and is therefore trivallate. The actual living space of ringforts often forms less than 60% of the total monument area. [...] Contemporary law tracts described a king's principle dwelling to have been a univallate ringfort. [...] Increasing a site's defences without a corresponding increase in its <b>functional</b> <b>area</b> demonstrates either a greater need for defence or a display of status. Therefore, a ring fort with two ramparts (bivallate) acts a status symbol. The rarity of trivallate hillforts, such as that at the Grianán, shows the importance and status of its occupants rather a need for defence.|$|E

We consider several projects with contributions from several <b>functional</b> <b>areas.</b> The organization can be structured along processes like product lines (M-form) or along <b>functional</b> <b>areas</b> like marketing or production (U-form). The U-form enables cost savings due to specialization or scale economies. We show that the more effective incentives under the M-form might outweigh these savings if the functions are neither too complementary nor too substitutable. ...|$|R
