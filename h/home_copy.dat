40|$|This handbook, now {{available}} in paperback, brings together a comprehensive collection of mathematical material in one location. It also {{offers a variety of}} new results interpreted in a form that is particularly useful to engineers, scientists, and applied mathematicians. The handbook is not specific to fixed research areas, but rather it has a generic flavor that can be applied by anyone working with probabilistic and stochastic analysis and modeling. Classic results are presented in their final form without derivation or discussion, allowing for much material to be condensed into one volume. Concise compilation of disparate formulae saves time in searching different sources. Focused application has broad interest for many disciplines: engineers, computer scientists, statisticians, physicists; as well as for any researcher working in probabilistic and stochastic analysis and modeling in the natural or social sciences. The material is timeless, with intrinsic value to practicing engineers and scientists. Excerpts from reviews of the hardbound edition: This is a unique book and an invaluable reference for engineers and scientists in the fields of electrical engineering, mathematics and statistics. There is no other single reference book that covers Gaussian and Gaussian-related distributions of random variables that are encountered in research work and practice. This is a reference book that I recommend to all my graduate students working in the area of telecommunication system analysis and design. [...] John Proakis, Professor Emeritus, Northeastern University and Adjunct Professor, University of California, San Diego The reference book Probability Distributions Involving Gaussian Random Variables, authored by Dr. Marvin Simon, has become, {{in a very short time}} frame, one of the most useful aids to research in the field of digital communications that has come out in many years. It has numerous results that can save researchers in the field endless hours of work. It has replaced various other well known resources because of its concentration of relevant, timely, and easily accessible results. [...] Larry Milstein, UCSD There are a small number of reference works that have proven so invaluable that I have purchased a <b>home</b> <b>copy</b> in addition to my office copy. This handbook is one of them. [...] Dr. Norman C. Beaulieu, University of Alberta The Gaussian distribution and those derived from it are at the very core of a huge number of problems in multi-disciplinary fields of engineering, mathematics and science… The book, with its comprehensive information in analytical, tabular, and graphical form, is an invaluable tool for scientists and engineers.

40|$|The {{music and}} {{software}} industry are employing copy-protection devices in CDs and digital downloads {{to strengthen their}} weak appropriability regimes that leave ample opportunities for modern-day piracy. The effectiveness of the strategy is explained {{on the grounds that}} (a) the knowledge involved in copy protection is generally too sophisticated for consumers to circumvent, and (b) consumers are not allowed to use circumvention techniques created by knowledgeable third parties. Copy protection is controversial, because it deprives consumers from making <b>home</b> <b>copies</b> of music and software, and hence overrules copyright law that exempts the copying for private use. It is argued that the technical enforcement of copyright protection in the home domain of millions of individuals necessitates a wide consensus between business and society about the legitimacy of private and fair use...|$|R

MPT executives offered him a five-minute segment on the new, retooled show; Rukeyser declined.
