The new front and new large bumpers made what was an already odd-looking car even stranger. Now the Suzuki Fronte Hatch 55 (or 550), it received the three-cylinder 539cc LJ50 engine, which was a de-smogged L50 engine with an extra cylinder tacked on: it was also known as the T5A/T5B in other applications. The new model code was SH10. The inside remained nearly unchanged and the only differences at the rear was a new, larger bumper, and the change to a single strut for the rear gate for increased access. Power remained 25PS as per late 360 Hatches, but torque was up considerably. The lineup was again restricted to B, <b>D,</b> <b>and</b> <b>T</b> models, with the T receiving chromed rather than painted bumpers.|$|E
