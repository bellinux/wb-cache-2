5|$|In October 2008, Croatia indicted Božidar Vučurevićthe {{mayor of}} Trebinje and Bosnian Serb leader in eastern Herzegovina {{at the time}} of the offensivefor attacks against the {{civilian}} population of Dubrovnik. Jokić confirmed that he received orders from both Strugar and Vučurević. On 4 April 2011, Vučurević was arrested in Serbia and Croatia requested his extradition. He was released on bail on 17 June. In September, the <b>extradition</b> <b>request</b> was approved but Vučurević left Serbia and returned to Trebinje, avoiding extradition. In 2009, Croatian authorities filed charges against ten JNA officers, including Cokić, Ružinovski, Strugar, Jokić, Zec and Kovačević. They were charged with war crimes committed in the area of Dubrovnik prior to or after 6 December 1991, which were not covered by the ICTY indictments. The charges were made after the ICTY supplied documents collected during its investigation. In 2012, Croatia indicted the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 5th Motorized Brigade and charged him with arson for burning 90 houses, businesses and public buildings in Čilipi from 5 to 7 October 1991.|$|E

25|$|Krekar {{was arrested}} in the Netherlands at Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam in September 2002, after Iran denied him entry and sent him back to Europe. He was interviewed by FBI agents (at Krekar's request, {{in an attempt to}} clear his and his group's name); no <b>extradition</b> <b>request</b> was made. He was {{deported}} to Norway in January 2003.|$|E
25|$|Oktay Engin and {{consulate}} employee Hasan Uçar {{were arrested}} on 18 September. Engin was first charged with executing the attack, but he presented an alibi so {{the charge was}} dropped to incitement. He was detained for nine months. Three months later, he escaped to Turkey before the Greek courts sentenced him to 3.5 years. In addition, Turkey refused Greece's <b>extradition</b> <b>request.</b>|$|E

25|$|In August 1992, the Romanian general {{prosecutor}} asked for Drăghici's extradition, {{but this was}} denied in December, as {{the statute of limitations}} had expired under Hungarian law. However, Hungary's Justice Ministry specified that this was not their final word, and requested more information. In December 1992, the Romanian side renewed its <b>extradition</b> <b>request,</b> arguing that the 1989 Revolution had suspended the statute of limitations, a legally dubious move. The request was again denied.|$|E
25|$|The Peruvian Congress {{authorized}} {{charges against}} Fujimori in August 2001. Fujimori was {{alleged to be}} a co-author, along with Vladimiro Montesinos, of the death-squad killings at Barrios Altos in 1991 and La Cantuta in 1992. At the behest of Peruvian authorities, Interpol issued an arrest order for Fujimori on charges that included murder, kidnapping, and crimes against humanity. Meanwhile, the Peruvian government found that Japan was not amenable to the extradition of Fujimori; a protracted diplomatic debate ensued, when Japan showed itself unwilling to accede to the <b>extradition</b> <b>request.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Poland Prosecution Service in Gliwice {{launched}} their own investigation while assisting Canadian police visiting Poland {{as part of}} the Canadian investigation. Polish criminal code allows for the pursuit of foreign nationals suspected of committing crime against the Polish citizens abroad; which could lead to an <b>extradition</b> <b>request.</b> The Prosecution Office forwarded a request for assistance from Canada. The request for documents from the Canadian investigation was denied with the rationale that forwarding them is not {{in the best interest of}} that country. Under the circumstances, in December 2011 the Polish investigation was terminated.|$|E

50|$|After 1987, {{when the}} GAL disbanded, the French {{government}} adopted a harsher attitude towards Basque refugees, by denying political refugee status to new applicants, and facilitating <b>extraditions</b> <b>requested</b> by Spanish judges. This change weakened ETA's veterans.|$|R

25|$|In June 2005, the Italian judge Guido Salvini {{issued a}} warrant for the arrest of 13 persons said to be agents or {{operatives}} of the CIA in association with Nasr's kidnapping. In December 2005, an Italian court issued a European arrest warrant against 22 CIA agents suspected of this kidnapping (including Robert Seldon Lady, Eliana Castaldo, Lt. Col. Joseph L. Romano, III, etc.). The CIA has not commented on the case, while Berlusconi's government has denied any knowledge of a kidnapping plot. Just after the 2006 Italian general elections, Roberto Castelli (Lega Nord), outgoing Justice Minister, declared to Italian prosecutors {{that he had not}} passed the <b>extradition</b> <b>request</b> to the US.|$|E
25|$|The {{applicant}} had patently {{been informed}} of the accusation against him and of {{the progress of the}} proceedings before the Italian courts, notwithstanding {{the fact that he had}} absconded. Furthermore, the applicant, who had deliberately chosen to remain on the run after escaping from prison, had received effective assistance during the proceedings from several lawyers specially appointed by him. Hence, the Italian and subsequently the French authorities had been entitled to conclude that the applicant had unequivocally waived his right to appear and be tried in person. The French authorities had therefore taken due account of all the circumstances of the case and of the Court’s case-law in granting the <b>extradition</b> <b>request</b> made by the Italian authorities: manifestly ill-founded.|$|E
25|$|After {{revealing}} {{information to}} The Mail on Sunday in August 1997, Shayler fled the day prior to publication, first to Utrecht in the Netherlands {{and then later}} to France with his girlfriend and former colleague Annie Machon and was arrested by French police on 1 August 1998 with an extradition warrant on {{the request of the}} British government and then held in La Santé Prison for four months under the prisoner number 269151F. On 18 November 1998 the French courts determined the British government's <b>extradition</b> <b>request</b> was politically motivated and therefore not grounds for extradition. In 2000, Shayler appeared on Have I Got News for You via satellite, where he {{was the subject of a}} number of jokes.|$|E

25|$|There were mass {{rallies in}} Rome by Kurds, and {{a wave of}} sympathy for a people that many did not know of. The Italian {{government}} of Massimo D'Alema was not yet {{able to take a}} clear stance on whether to satisfy the <b>extradition</b> <b>request.</b> Italian government tried to negotiate a deal with other EU states and try to deal with Interpol's arrest demand. Finally, Öcalan was allowed to leave the country, without revealing his destination, thereby releasing the Italian government from an embarrassing situation. He was apparently sent to Saint Petersburg, Russia, then Athens, Greece. The Greek government moved him to Korfu for a while, then to the Greek Embassy in Kenya.|$|E
25|$|Tensions between Papua New Guinea and Australia worsened {{during the}} course of the Julian Moti affair, in which Somare was implicated. Moti, a close {{associate}} of Manasseh Sogavare, the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, was arrested in Port Moresby on 29 September 2006 under an Australian <b>extradition</b> <b>request</b> to face child sex charges over an alleged incident in Vanuatu in 1997. After breaking bail conditions and taking sanctuary in the Solomon Islands High Commission, he was flown to the Solomon Islands on a clandestine PNG Defence Force flight on the night of 10 October, causing outrage on the part of the Australian government. Australia then cancelled ministerial-level talks in December and banned senior Papua New Guinea ministers from entering Australia. Somare denied any involvement in authorising the flight.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{transitional}} {{provisions of the}} constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army until March 1998. He was then sworn in as a senator-for-life, a privilege granted by the 1980 constitution to former presidents with at least six years in office. His senatorship and consequent immunity from prosecution protected him from legal action. These were possible in Chile only after Pinochet was arrested in 1998 in the United Kingdom, on an <b>extradition</b> <b>request</b> issued by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón, allegations of abuses had been made numerous times before his arrest, but never acted upon. The extradition attempt was dramatised in the 2006 BBC television docudrama Pinochet in Suburbia, with Pinochet played by Derek Jacobi. Shortly before giving the power, Pinochet prohibited all forms of abortion, previously authorized in case of rape or risk {{to the life of}} the mother.|$|E
25|$|These {{were the}} first {{convictions}} {{anywhere in the world}} arising from the CIA's practice of abducting terror suspects and transferring them to third countries where torture occurred.

25|$|Although his {{sentence}} {{was not the}} death penalty, Einhorn's defense attorneys argued that Einhorn would {{face the death penalty}} if he was returned to the United States. France, like many countries that have abolished the death penalty, does not extradite defendants to jurisdictions that retain the death penalty without assurance that the death penalty will be neither sought nor applied. Pennsylvania authorities pointed out that when the murder occurred, Pennsylvania did not have the death penalty and so Einhorn could not be executed because the US and the Pennsylvania constitutions forbid ex post facto law. Einhorn's next strategy involved French law and the European Court of Human Rights, which require a new trial when the defendant was tried in absentia and unable to present his defense. On this basis, the court of appeals of Bordeaux rejected the <b>extradition</b> <b>request.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jovović {{had tried}} to assassinate Pavelić {{multiple}} times, planning it as early as 1946, when he learned Pavelić was in hiding inside the Vatican. Jovović shot Pavelić {{in the back and}} collar bone while the latter was exiting a bus in El Palomar, a Buenos Aires suburb near his home. Pavelić was transferred to the Syrian-Lebanese hospital, where his true identity was established. After Perón's fall from power, Pavelić fell out of favour with the Argentine government; Yugoslavia again requested his extradition. Pavelić refused to stay in hospital, even though a bullet was lodged in his spine. Two weeks after the shooting, as the Argentine authorities agreed to grant the Yugoslav government's <b>extradition</b> <b>request,</b> he moved to Chile. He spent four months in Santiago, and then moved to Spain. Reports circulated that Pavelić had fled to Paraguay to work for the Stroessner regime; his Spanish asylum became known only in late 1959.|$|E
25|$|Following the Tombstone shootout, Virgil Earp was maimed by hidden assailants and Morgan Earp was murdered. Unable {{to obtain}} {{justice in the}} courts, Wyatt Earp took matters into his own hands. As the {{recently}} appointed deputy U.S. marshal, Earp formally deputized Holliday, among others. As a federal posse, they pursued the outlaw Cowboys they believed were responsible. They found Frank Stilwell lying in wait as Virgil boarded a train for California and killed him. The local sheriff issued a warrant for the arrest of {{five members of the}} federal posse, including Holliday. The federal posse killed three other Cowboys during late March and early April, 1882, before they rode to the New Mexico Territory. Wyatt Earp learned of an <b>extradition</b> <b>request</b> for Holliday and arranged for Colorado Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin to deny Holliday's extradition. Holliday spent the few remaining years of his life in Colorado, and died of tuberculosis in his bed at the Glenwood Springs Hotel at age 36.|$|E
