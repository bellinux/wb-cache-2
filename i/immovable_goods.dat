It also repeats earlier injunctions not to supply items useful in war such as weaponry, iron or timber to either Muslims or non-Christians. The substance of the Bull's articles are as follows: [...] The Roman pontiff, successor of the key-bearer of the heavenly kingdom and vicar of Jesus Christ, contemplating with a father's mind all the several climes {{of the world and the}} characteristics of all the nations dwelling in them and seeking and desiring the salvation of all, wholesomely ordains and disposes upon careful deliberation those things which he sees will be agreeable to the Divine Majesty and by which he may bring the sheep entrusted to him by God into the single divine fold, and may acquire for them the reward of eternal felicity, and obtain pardon for their souls. This we believe will more certainly come to pass, through the aid of the Lord, if we bestow suitable favors and special graces on those Catholic kings and princes, who, like athletes and intrepid champions of the Christian faith, as we know by the evidence of facts, not only restrain the savage excesses of the Saracens and of other infidels, enemies of the Christian name, but also for the defense and increase of the faith vanquish them and their kingdoms and habitations, though situated in the remotest parts unknown to us, and ...the said infante ... believing that he would best perform his duty to God in this matter, if by his effort and industry that sea might become navigable as far as to the Indians who are said to worship the name of Christ, and that thus he might be able to enter into relation with them, and to incite them to aid the Christians against the Saracens ......to conserve their right and possession, said king and infante under certain most severe penalties then expressed, have prohibited and in general have ordained that none, unless with their sailors and ships and on payment of a certain tribute and with an express license previously obtained from the said king or infante, should presume to sail to the said provinces or to trade in their ports or to fish in the sea,...since we had formerly by other letters of ours granted among other things free and ample faculty to the aforesaid King Alfonso -- to invade, search out, capture, vanquish, and subdue all Saracens and pagans whatsoever, and other enemies of Christ wheresoever placed, and the kingdoms, dukedoms, principalities, dominions, possessions, and all movable and <b>immovable</b> <b>goods</b> whatsoever held and possessed by them and to reduce their persons to perpetual slavery, and to apply and appropriate to himself and his successors the kingdoms, dukedoms, counties, principalities, dominions, possessions, and goods, and to convert them to his and their use and profit -- by having secured the said faculty, the said King Alfonso, or, by his authority, the aforesaid infante, justly and lawfully has acquired and possessed, and doth possess, these islands, lands, harbors, and seas, and they do of right belong and pertain to the said King Alfonso and his successors, nor without special license from King Alfonso and his successors themselves has any other even of the faithful of Christ been entitled hitherto, nor is he by any means now entitled lawfully to meddle therewith.|$|E

40|$|The {{appropriation}} of a found good is an offense, as stipulated by Art. 216 of the Criminal Code in two normative modalities. According {{to the first}} one, the offense consists in the fact of not handing over of a lost and found good to the authorities or {{to the person who}} lost it thereof or in the fact of disposing of the respective good as of an own good. The “found” good is a good that has been lost, forgotten or wandered by another person. The lost good (wandered) can only be a movable good. <b>Immovable</b> <b>goods</b> cannot be wandered and therefore cannot be found.

Through the analysis the author tackles the problem of discrimination that is committed by the national law that regulates the matter of restitution of goods that were abusively {{taken over by the}} state, {{from the point of view}} of the theoretician, as well as the practitioner, pointing out the necessity of direct cooperation with the European courts. The negative discrimination, resulting from the art. 36 of 18 / 1991 law, can be analysed as an objective and rational justification that would allow the direct practice of the European convention of human rights concerning the litigations about "Land Act" (Law no. 18 / 1991...|$|E

40|$|In {{some of the}} {{continental}} European countries (e. g. France), there is a necessity to make {{a clear distinction between}} the legal issue of commerce fund (fonds de commerce, in French language), and the related accounting concept represented by goodwill. Fonds de commerce represents a set of movable and <b>immovable</b> <b>goods</b> with a common destination, therefore having a unique legal status. Goodwill is an intangible asset item that is placed within the Balance Sheet. It holds together all the fonds de commerce elements which finally form a subset containing the following: (i) intangible assets; (ii) not evaluated, nor separately recorded; (iii) purchased, but not internally created; (iv) which compete for the maintenance and further development of the company’s activity potential. The goodwill issue appears very often within the consolidated accounts. A commercial relationship between the parent of a group and one of its subsidiaries may appear either through {{the creation of a new}} enterprise (initiated by the group leader), or by acquisition of already existent business. In this second case, we are talking about a business combination. The acquired goodwill is mentioned in the Balance Sheet, amongst non-current intangible asset items. The internally generated goodwill is not recognised within the Balance Sheet. Goodwill may be stated as the difference between the acquisition cost and the percentage belonging to the buyer within the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identifiable acquired. In the advanced accounting systems, goodwill is no longer amortized. His useful life is undefined, but not unlimited. The fact that is no longer amortized determines an annual depreciation test. Such a depreciation test is meant to evaluate the goodwill on the basis of present cash flows...|$|E
40|$|The traders are {{assigned}} ex lege {{a number of}} acknowledged professional obligations, like the obligation of registering in the Trade Register. Besides these traditional obligations, new and complex obligations have been regulated for traders, obligations that are specific to the tradersconsumers relation. These regulations are subordinated to the Consumer Law domain, which in Romania represents a contemporary creation, {{a result of the}} process of transposing the communautaire acquis. Consumer protection is regulated by general and specific rules, the latter ones referring to the following sub domains: advertising; informing about the prices of the products offered to the consumers for sale; unfair clauses from the contracts concluded between the traders and the consumers; the contracts negotiated away from business premises; concluding and executing distant contracts related to financial services; consumer credit; packages of tourism services; protection of the contracts related to the right to use some <b>immovable</b> <b>goods</b> for a limited period- timeshare; selling of the products and warranties associated; general safety of the products; responsibility of the producers for the damages generated by the defective products; unfair commercial practices and ways to cease the unlawful practices in respect of the protection of consumers’ collective interests. New obligations for the traders are established through the content of both general and specific regulations, obligations that are effected in imperatives and especially in interdictions. The legal regime of the obligations that resulted this way transcend the regime of the traders’ traditional obligations, making up the new paradigm of the traders’ activity and it represents the theme of this paper. Our research focused on determining the obligations set-up for the traders through both categories of rules and through their legal regime. As a result of the research carried on this theme, we conclude that setting-up this new category of obligations for the traders represents an actual means of achieving the aim of ensuring the consumer protection, adding-up to other legal means set-up in this regard. traders; professional obligations; Consumer Law; unfair practices; misleading and aggressive practices; consumer credit; advertising. ...|$|E
40|$|Od procesa tzv. demokratizacije sastavljanja privatno-pravnih isprava inventari dobara prvorazredan su izvor za proučavanje materijalne kulture i raznih aspekata svakodnevnog života. Koristeći se inventarom dobara šibenskog patricija Jurja Kamenarića završenog 22. travnja 1451. godine u Šibeniku, autor daje pregled i analizu materijalnih predmeta i nekretnina u posjedu bogatog šibenskog patricija. Nadalje, proučavanjem zaloga koje pokojni Juraj Kamenarić prima od stanovnika šibenske komune dolazi do brojnih podataka o svakodnevnom životu kasnosrednjovjekovnog Šibenika. From {{the process}} of {{democratisation}} of legal documents from the twelfth century onwards, the inventories of property represent a valuable source for the research of late medieval material culture, {{as well as of}} the various aspects of material life. The inventory of property possessed by a nobleman of Šibenik, the late George Kamenarić, which was compiled by the communal notary Karatus Vitale between March and June 1451, reveals numerous aspects of everyday life and particularly the level of material culture of one member of Šibenik’s elite. This inventory is particularly interesting because it is one of the largest and wealthiest inventories that has come to us from late medieval Šibenik. The analysis of the private belongings (447 objects) of George Kamenarić provides a very detailed insight into items of everyday use (58 %), clothes (28 %), weapons (9 %), jewellery (3 %), liturgical objects (2 %) and books (less than 1 %), that he possessed at the time of his death in 1451. The inventory contains also a mention of 248 deposits of objects pawned to George Kamenarić by members of all the strata of the society of late medieval Šibenik. Since these deposits were studied with the same methodological pattern as his private belongings, the analysis of pawned objects and monetary loans provides an insight into material culture and related trends on a wider scale. Ultimately, an insight into the level of material culture may be provided also by the size and types of <b>immovable</b> <b>goods</b> (bona stabilia and imobilia) mentioned in this inventory of property, revealing in the first place the business interests of the deceased nobleman in late medieval Šibenik, but also his business interests in the Šibenik district and surrounding area. The analysis of the inventory of George Kamenarić demonstrates once more the importance of notarial records for the research of the level of material culture in the late medieval period in the Croatian littoral area, augmenting in that way the knowledge that may be acquired from the visual sources and archaeological artefacts...|$|E
