500|$|In the December {{following}} his return, Walsingham {{was appointed to}} the Privy Council of England and was made <b>joint</b> <b>principal</b> secretary (the position which later became [...] "Secretary of State") with Sir Thomas Smith. Smith retired in 1576, leaving Walsingham in effective control of the privy seal, though he was not formally invested as Lord Privy Seal. Walsingham acquired a Surrey county seat in Parliament from 1572 that he retained until his death, but he was not a major parliamentarian. He was knighted on 1 December 1577, and held the sinecure posts of Recorder of Colchester, custos rotulorum of Hampshire, and High Steward of Salisbury, Ipswich and Winchester. He was appointed Chancellor of the Order of the Garter from 22 April 1578 until succeeded by Sir Amias Paulet in June 1587, when he became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in addition to principal secretary.|$|E

2500|$|Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood concurred, {{adding that}} [...] "he general public would be {{astonished}} and appalled if in those circumstances the law attached liability {{for the death}} only to the gunman who actually fired the fatal shot." [...] He did, however, consider Gnango guilty as a principal. Lord Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony agreed that Gnango was guilty as a principal. Lord Dyson concurred with the leading judgment and would have restored [...] "the conviction {{on the basis that}} the jury must have been satisfied that the respondent aided and abetted the murder of Ms Pniewska by encouraging Bandana Man to shoot at him {{in the course of the}} planned shootout". Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore gave the only dissenting judgment. He would have dismissed the Crown's appeal on the basis that [...] "there was no occasion for the [...] to consider whether the requisite intention on the part of Gnango to found a verdict of guilty on the basis of aiding and abetting was present" [...] and that Gnango could not have been guilty as a <b>joint</b> <b>principal.</b>|$|E

500|$|By 1962, Glock {{had persuaded}} the BBC {{management}} {{to increase the}} orchestra's budget to allow for <b>joint</b> <b>principals</b> in the string sections, to attract top musicians who could play in the BBC SO without having {{to give up their}} solo or chamber careers. The following season, he was able to engage <b>joint</b> <b>principals</b> for the wind section, including as Jack Brymer and Terence MacDonagh, formerly members of Beecham's celebrated [...] "Royal Family" [...] in the RPO. The problem remained that recruiting rank-and-file string players was difficult: although the BBC offered secure employment and a pension, it did not pay as well as its London rivals. After 1964, the BBC SO {{was the only one of}} the five London symphony orchestras that was not self-governed, and some musicians felt that the BBC SO's constitution as a body of salaried employees, with no say in the management or repertory of the orchestra, attracted an unadventurous type of player. A former member of the BBC SO said in 1979, I felt I was getting too secure ... the BBC Symphony you can be a poor player, but if you're on time and never moan at the conductor … you'll have no trouble... I think the BBC Symphony lost some good young players because the management got their priorities wrong.|$|R

Most Christian institutions {{in other parts of}} the nation were denationalised later on in June 2001.

50|$|The {{most serious}} error {{of the court}} in {{answering}} the above question {{is to say that}} the so-called “Conspiracy <b>Joint</b> <b>Principal</b> Offense” theory applies to the Internet, but this inference is unreasonable in the context. Despite the absence of a thorough investigation, the prosecution is putting the responsibility of unspecified actors’ unreasonable conduct (verbal abuse and threatening phone calls) on the defendants, who consistently advocated their polite boycott notice. There is no proof that the real phone callers read the web pages which are run by the defendants. In the future, if the prosecution’s reasoning is correct, if this means that those people from legitimate social movements who make suggestions on the Internet have to take all responsibility for all possible illegal results as part of the “Conspiracy <b>Joint</b> <b>Principal</b> Offense”.|$|E
50|$|If two or {{more people}} are {{directly}} responsible for the actus reus, they can be charged as joint principals (see common purpose).

50|$|A {{standard}} {{example of}} imputation arises through {{the principle of}} joint endeavour. Where two or more people embark on a joint exercise, they are equally liable for everything that happens during the execution of their plan. For this purpose, <b>joint</b> <b>principals</b> are treated as knowing everything that happens, whether they were present or not. The requisite mens rea formed by one is imputed to the others to enable a conviction. For example, suppose that a gang conspire to rob a bank. One remains outside in the car to ensure a quick escape. If the others kill a guard inside the bank, the driver is jointly liable for the homicide.|$|R

50|$|In {{criminal}} law, corporate liability {{determines the}} extent to which a corporation as a legal person can be liable for the acts and omissions of the natural persons it employs. It is sometimes regarded as an aspect of criminal vicarious liability, as distinct from the situation in which the wording of a statutory offence specifically attaches liability to the corporation as the principal or <b>joint</b> <b>principal</b> with a human agent.|$|E
50|$|In 1920, Miss Hilda Jean Copinger {{had joined}} the school as <b>Joint</b> <b>Principal,</b> in charge of {{boarding}} arrangements and the teaching of domestic science. On Miss Tulloch’s retirement, in 1928, she took over the school, but brought in as her partner and co-principal Miss Margaret Macrae, to oversee the academic side.

2500|$|Russell had {{originally}} {{written about the}} case, arguing that Sacco and Vanzetti were innocent, but further research led him to write a 1962 book, asserting that Sacco was guilty. Russell used the Gambera revelation {{as the basis of}} a new book in 1986, in which he claims that the case is [...] "solved." [...] He presented his view that Sacco was one of the shooters, while Vanzetti was an accessory after the fact. While Russell's 1962 book was praised, even by those who disagreed with his conclusion, for being balanced and well-reasoned, his 1986 book was much more negatively received. In the latter, the [...] "accessory after the fact" [...] legal theory is incorrect: Massachusetts law, now and {{at the time of the}} crime, allowed both men to be charged as <b>joint</b> <b>principals</b> in a robbery-homicide, for which they were convicted. From a legal standpoint, it does not matter how many shots, or even if, Vanzetti fired, to establish his legal culpability for the robbery and murders.|$|R
25|$|Other local {{authority}} schools {{also began to}} introduce more practical teaching of crafts, and by the 1890s Arts and Crafts ideals were being disseminated {{by members of the}} Art Workers Guild into art schools throughout the country. Members of the Guild held influential positions: Walter Crane was director of the Manchester School of Art and subsequently the Royal College of Art; F.M. Simpson, Robert Anning Bell and C.J.Allen were respectively professor of architecture, instructor in painting and design, and instructor in sculpture at Liverpool School of Art; Robert Catterson-Smith, the headmaster of the Birmingham Art School from 1902-1920, was also an AWG member; W. R. Lethaby and George Frampton were inspectors and advisors to the London County Council's (LCC) education board and in 1896, {{largely as a result of}} their work, the LCC set up the Central School of Arts and Crafts and made them <b>joint</b> <b>principals.</b> Until the formation of the Bauhaus in Germany, the Central School was regarded as the most progressive art school in Europe. Shortly after its foundation, the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts was set up on Arts and Crafts lines by the local borough council.|$|R
