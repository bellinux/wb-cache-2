She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she suffered a mini-stroke. Regarding her retirement, Sheindlin has stated that it's up to her viewers and when they tire of watching the program, which she believes will inevitably happen one day. As of the present, however, Sheindlin has stated that fans still seem to be interested and taking something out of the court show. Sheindlin admits the court show is [...] "seductive" [...] and hard to give up. Sheindlin said, [...] "I'm not tired. I still feel engaged by what I do, and I still <b>have</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> like to watch it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{author and}} the series' {{popularity}} are often compared with J. K. Rowling and Harry Potter. Describing the fan following of the books, the Phoenix New Times wrote, [...] "Meyer's fandom {{is reminiscent of}} Harry Potter mania." [...] The Daily Telegraph described Twilight as the [...] "spiritual successor to Harry Potter". Rebekah Bradford of The Post and Courier stated that the series has a [...] "huge crossover appeal much like the Harry Potter books before them." [...] According to the Daily Telegraph, [...] "Stephenie Meyer, in particular, has achieved incredible success across all the English-speaking nations and Europe and many will say that her Twilight series has filled the hole left by Harry Potter." [...] Meyer has responded to such comparisons, saying, [...] "It's terribly flattering to be compared to her, but there's {{never going to be}} another J. K. Rowling; that's a phenomenon that's not gonna happen again", however noting that [...] "you can compare my fans to her fans more easily [...] I do think that we both <b>have</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are just really really enthusiastic, and will come miles to see you and be involved, and everybody really cares about our characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Neil Pigot, who {{did some}} {{work with the}} group, {{describes}} their style as [...] "a sort of extension of the Python tradition, but very much in an Australian context." [...] He says that DAAS were [...] "crucially important" [...] {{in the development of}} Australian comedy, directly contributing to the styles of successful comedy shows such as The D-Generation, Fast Forward and Wogs Out of Work. At the time DAAS emerged, Pigot says, comedy in Australia was dominated by joke-tellers and impersonators. [...] By contrast, DAAS were belligerent and confrontational, frequently attacking topical issues, invading people's personal space and involving the audience in their act. Mark Trevorrow, who frequently collaborated with the group, described their work as [...] "true genius." [...] "Their great shows were among the greatest evenings I've witnessed in my life and their worst shows were among the worst," [...] he said. [...] "They'd whip up an audience and appeal to people's darker side. [...] It was very Dada, what they were doing. [...] And what happens with that is you're just as often likely to <b>have</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> want to kill you as applaud you." [...] In addition, ABC comedy producer Ted Robinson says that the group {{played an important role in}} raising the profile of Australian comedy overseas, particularly in Britain where DAAS were very popular. British comedian Al Murray said of seeing the group at the Edinburgh Festival in 1988, [...] "they came onstage with the attitude of feral invaders and left it with no taboo untouched." [...] Murray described the All Stars as [...] "an insanely hot act from Oz who sang, cursed, sweated and insulted each other and their audiences with a level of commitment and polish that seemed exotically charged and almost transgressive in the late 80s." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1973, {{after her}} split from Elvis, Presley {{set up a}} joint venture with her friend and stylist Olivia Bis. Together they opened a {{clothing}} boutique in Los Angeles called Bis & Beau. Elvis was supportive of Priscilla's venture, and even contacted several friends in public relations to help with promotion for the launch. In a 1973 interview to promote the opening of the store, Priscilla said, [...] "After the separation, I had to make up my mind about what I wanted to do, and since I had worked with Olivia {{for such a long time}} on my own clothes, I decided to try it professionally. We both do the designing for the shop, and <b>have</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> sew for us."

60|$|Yet things {{quite as}} preposterous as this are said and written under the {{influence}} of that great spectacle of babyish helplessness, the economic theory of history. We <b>have</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> represent that all great historic motives were economic, and then have to howl {{at the top of their}} voices in order to induce the modern democracy to act on economic motives. The extreme Marxian politicians in England exhibit themselves as a small, heroic minority, trying vainly to induce the world to do what, according to their theory, the world always does. The truth is, of course, that there will be a social revolution the moment the thing has ceased to be purely economic. You can never have a revolution in order to establish a democracy. You must have a democracy in order to have a revolution.|$|E
