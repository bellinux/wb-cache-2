5|$|Mammals {{include the}} biggest animals on the planet, the great whales. The basic body type is a {{terrestrial}} quadruped, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>in</b> trees, underground or on two legs. The {{largest group of}} mammals, the placentals, have a placenta, which enables the feeding of the fetus during gestation.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) {{consisted}} of only 132 aircraft and 2,000 personnel, of whom only 80 were pilots and most poorly trained. The two Koreas had very small air forces of their own, with the North Koreans' 132 aircraft organized into the KPAF 1st Air Division. At the early {{phase in the}} war, these aircraft were used boldly to the North Koreans' advantage. Aware of their air superiority over the Republic of Korea Air Force and not expecting UN intervention, they anticipated light resistance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>In</b> all, the KPAF had 2,000 personnel.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of moisture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> order {{for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E

5|$|Following the charmed ring, Sophie passes into a {{scene from}} the past. She watched a young Howl take pity on a falling star—Calcifer—and give it his heart. The act bound Calcifer to Howl indefinitely; however, by losing his heart, Howl was emotionally trapped in adolescence. Sophie finds Howl in bird form, and takes him back to Calcifer. The witch returns Howl's heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, {{returning}} him to life and freeing Calcifer. Howl wakes up and Sophie embraces him. Although Calcifer is now free, he returns to his former company. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, decides to end the war. Howl, Sophie, and the others are seen high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> a new flying castle, while the bombers return from the war.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring's memoirs were {{published}} in 1953, as Soldat bis zum letzten Tag (A Soldier to the Last Day). They were reprinted in English as A Soldier's Record a year later. Although written {{while he was in}} prison, without access to his papers, the memoirs formed a valuable resource, informing military historians on topics such as the background to the invasion of the Soviet Union. When the English edition was published, Kesselring's contentions that the Luftwaffe was not defeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Britain and that Operation Sea Lion—the invasion of Britain—was thought about but never seriously planned were controversial. In 1955, he published a second book, Gedanken zum Zweiten Weltkrieg (Thoughts on the Second World War).|$|E
5|$|Strombolian eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named after the volcano Stromboli, which has been erupting continuously for centuries. Strombolian eruptions are driven by the bursting of gas bubbles within the magma. These gas bubbles within the magma accumulate and coalesce into large bubbles, called gas slugs. These grow large enough to rise through the lava column. Upon reaching the surface, the difference in air pressure causes the bubble to burst with a loud pop, throwing magma <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> a way similar to a soap bubble. Because of the high gas pressures associated with the lavas, continued activity is generally {{in the form of}} episodic explosive eruptions accompanied by the distinctive loud blasts. During eruptions, these blasts occur as often as every few minutes.|$|E

5|$|The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy {{adventure}} novel written by Norton Juster with illustrations by Jules Feiffer, published in 1961 by Random House (USA). It {{tells the story}} of a bored young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth one afternoon and, having nothing better to do, drives through it in his toy car, transporting him to the Kingdom of Wisdom, once prosperous but now troubled. There, he acquires two faithful companions and goes on a quest to restore to the kingdom its exiled princesses—named Rhyme and Reason—from the Castle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air.</b> <b>In</b> the process, he learns valuable lessons, finding a love of learning. The text is full of puns and wordplay, such as when Milo unintentionally jumps to Conclusions, an island in Wisdom, thus exploring the literal meanings of idioms.|$|E
5|$|Transmission occurs through {{inhalation}} {{of airborne}} variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person. It {{is transmitted from}} one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person, usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but can also be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects (fomites) such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains. The virus can cross the placenta, but the incidence of congenital smallpox is relatively low.|$|E
