60|$|All {{the balance}} of that long day Carthoris crawled erratically through the still air, {{the bow of the}} flier sinking lower and lower, and the list to port {{becoming}} more and more alarming, until at last, near dark, he was floating almost bowdown, his harness buckled to a heavy <b>deck</b> <b>ring</b> to keep him from being precipitated to the ground below.|$|E
60|$|Now the two vessels {{were within}} arrow flight, and the bolts from the crossbowmen pattered upon the English ship. These short thick devil's darts were {{everywhere}} humming like great wasps through the air, crashing against the bulwarks, beating upon the <b>deck,</b> <b>ringing</b> loudly on the armor of the knights, {{or with a}} soft muffled thud sinking to the socket in a victim.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is compact in size, measuring only 20 m long by 10 m wide. Its original design envisioned a foyer, guest room, stairway to the tower, and two bedrooms {{on two different}} levels within the tower. The interior of the guest room is decorated with wooden panels; {{the walls of the}} rest of the rooms are stuccoed and painted. An observation <b>deck</b> <b>rings</b> the building, providing a view of the sea, and Yalta's distant shoreline.|$|R

5000|$|Mind Over Splatter: Each {{team has}} to climb onto a rope ladder to a {{platform}} that is suspended 30 feet above water, then advance {{on a pair}} of 100-foot ropes over the water to a <b>deck,</b> and <b>ring</b> a bell. If a player falls into the water, that player can swim back to the starting line, however, a team is disqualified if they don't complete the challenge within a 10-minute time limit. The teams that make it to the <b>deck</b> and <b>ring</b> the bell in the fastest time wins, while the last-place male team goes straight to the Jungle.|$|R

6000|$|An hour having {{passed in}} this airy manner, I start upon my rounds afresh, {{with a bag}} full of {{coloured}} tickets all with pins attached, and all with legible inscriptions: [...] "Old Germany," [...] "California," [...] "True Love," [...] "Old Fogies," [...] "La Belle France," [...] "Green Erin," [...] "The Land of Cakes," [...] "Washington," [...] "Blue Jay," [...] "Robin Red-Breast"--twenty of each denomination; for {{when it comes to}} the luncheon we sit down by twenties. These are distributed with anxious tact--for, indeed, this is the most delicate part of my functions--but outwardly with reckless unconcern, amidst the gayest flutter and confusion; and are immediately after sported upon hats and bonnets, to the extreme diffusion of cordiality, total strangers hailing each other by [...] "the number of their mess"--so we humorously name it--and the <b>deck</b> <b>ringing</b> with cries of, [...] "Here, all Blue Jays to the rescue!" [...] or, [...] "I say, am I alone in this blame' ship? Ain't there no more Californians?" ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly it was night. The Barsoomian day had ended, {{and then}} the brief period of {{twilight}} that renders the transition from daylight to darkness almost as abrupt as the switching off of an electric light, and Tara of Helium had found no sanctuary. But perhaps there were no beasts to fear, or rather to avoid--Tara of Helium liked not the word fear. She would have been glad, however, had there been a cabin, even a very tiny cabin, upon her small flier; {{but there was no}} cabin. The interior of the hull was completely taken up by the buoyancy tanks. Ah, she had it! How stupid of her not to have thought of it before! She could moor the craft to the tree beneath which it rested and let it rise the length of the rope. Lashed to the <b>deck</b> <b>rings</b> she would then be safe from any roaming beast of prey that chanced along. In the morning she could drop to the ground again before the craft was discovered.|$|R
60|$|He headed {{across the}} channel, and Whitney, {{crouching}} on <b>deck,</b> seized the <b>ring</b> of corks. The punt swung round sharply with her {{bow to the}} stream {{and there was an}} angry splash against her planks. Whitney was glad to ease the strain on his arms by making fast the wet line.|$|R
5000|$|Protection for {{the main}} guns was also considerable. Barbettes were 13.5 in above the upper armored deck and 5.5 in {{from there to the}} lower armored <b>deck.</b> Turret <b>rings</b> were also armored to a {{thickness}} of 13.5 in. Turret faces were 18 in, sides 9 - 10 in, top 5 in and rear 9 in. Conning tower armor was 16 in on the front and sides, 8 in on top. Underwater protection was more subdivided longitudinally than in the Colorados but was otherwise similar, with three armored bulkheads [...]75 in thick from the lower armored deck to the ship's bottom to the armored transverse bulkheads near the ends.|$|R
60|$|Preparations {{were now}} made to take {{possession}} of the pole if they should reach it on the water. On the after-part of the <b>deck</b> a <b>ring</b> about three feet in diameter was marked, and it was arranged that when they had ascertained, by the most accurate observations and calculations, the exact position of the pole, they would so guide their vessel that this ring should be as nearly as possible directly over it. Then one of the party should step inside of the ring and {{take possession of}} the pole. After this the buoy would be anchored, and their intended scientific observations and explorations would proceed.|$|R

60|$|The {{young girl}} glanced over the vast expanse before her with {{sparkling}} {{eyes and a}} suddenly awakened fancy that checked her embarrassed smile, and fixed her pretty, parted lips with wonder. The level rays of the rising sun striking the white crests of the lifted waves had suffused the whole ocean with a pinkish opal color: the darker parts of each wave seemed broken into facets instead of curves, and glittered sharply. The sea seemed to have lost its fluidity, and become vitreous; so much so, {{that it was difficult}} to believe that the waves which splintered across the Excelsior's bow did not fall upon her <b>deck</b> with the <b>ring</b> of shattered glass.|$|R
50|$|At 0650 on 17 August 1917, the Greek {{steamship}} Pontoporos—bound from Tyne Dock to Spezia with a {{cargo of}} 4,600 tons of coal and 2,000 tons of coke — {{was hit by}} a torpedo on the starboard beam. It exploded eight feet (2.4 m) below the waterline, abreast the engine room, and tore up the <b>decking</b> topside. Vedette <b>rang</b> up full speed ahead and stood about, hunting for the submarine. Unable to make contact with the enemy, the yacht picked up 27 men from a lifeboat, including the master of Pontoporos, a Captain Panas, at 0715. Two more men were transferred from a French fishing boat five minutes later. Vedette soon cast the lifeboat adrift at 0725 and circled the sinking ship; at 0740, Pontoporos sank from sight. After Vedette reached Port Heliguen later that morning, she turned the 29 survivors over to French authorities. Vedette continued the same routine of operations — interspersed with periods of upkeep, maintenance, and provisioning — through the remainder of the summer and autumn of 1917 and into 1918. On 20 January 1918, Lieutenant Commander Hand was relieved as commanding officer by Lieutenant Charles Alan Pownall (1887-1975), a future rear admiral who would command aircraft carrier task force during World War II and later serve as governor of Guam.|$|R
60|$|The way {{of paying}} for one's passage on board these boats was very {{different}} from that adopted in America. There was no colored waiter to go about the <b>decks</b> and saloons <b>ringing</b> a bell, and calling out, in a loud and authoritative voice, Passengers who haven't settled their fare will please call at the captain's office and settle. Instead of this, the clerk of the boat came himself, after each landing, to the new passengers that had come on board at that landing, and, touching his hat to them, in the most polite manner, asked them to what place they wished to go. He had a little slate in his hand, with the names of all the towns where the steamer was to touch marked upon it. As the several passengers to whom he applied gave him the name of the place of their destination, he made a mark opposite to the name of the place on his slate. When he had in this way applied to all the new comers, he went to the office and provided himself with the proper number of tickets for each place, and then went round again to distribute them. In going around thus a second time, to distribute the tickets, he took a cash box with him to make change. This cash box was slung before him by means of a strap about the neck.|$|R
