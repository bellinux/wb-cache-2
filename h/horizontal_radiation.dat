In this article, we focus on the {{estimation of}} yearly mean daily <b>horizontal</b> global solar <b>radiation</b> by using an approach that utilizes fuzzy regression functions with support vector machine (FRF-SVM). This approach is not seriously affected by outlier observations and does not suffer from the over-fitting problem. To demonstrate the utility of the FRF-SVM approach in the estimation of <b>horizontal</b> global solar <b>radiation,</b> we conduct an empirical study over a dataset collected in Turkey and applied the FRF-SVM approach with several kernel functions. Then, we compare the estimation accuracy of the FRF-SVM approach to an adaptive neuro-fuzzy system and a coplot supported-genetic programming approach. We observe that the FRF-SVM approach with a Gaussian kernel function is not affected by both outliers and over-fitting problem and gives the most accurate estimates of <b>horizontal</b> global solar <b>radiation</b> among the applied approaches. Consequently, the use of hybrid fuzzy functions and support vector machine approaches is found beneficial in long-term forecasting of <b>horizontal</b> global solar <b>radiation</b> over a region with complex climatic and terrestrial characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{considerable}} decrease in energy resources and increasing energy demand, solar energy is an appealing field of investment and research. There are various modelling strategies and particular {{models for the}} estimation {{of the amount of}} solar radiation reaching at a particular point over the Earth. In this article, global solar radiation estimation models are taken into account. To emphasize severity of multicollinearity problem in solar radiation estimation models, some of the models developed for Turkey are revisited. It is observed that these models have been identified as accurate under certain multicollinearity structures, and when the multicollinearity is eliminated, the accuracy of these models is controversial. Thus, a reliable model that does not suffer from multicollinearity and gives precise estimates of global solar radiation for the whole region of Turkey is necessary. A new nonlinear model for the estimation of average daily <b>horizontal</b> solar <b>radiation</b> is proposed making use of the genetic programming technique. There is no multicollinearity problem in the new model, and its estimation accuracy is better than the revisited models in terms of numerous statistical performance measures. According to the proposed model, temperature, precipitation, altitude, longitude, and monthly average daily extraterrestrial <b>horizontal</b> solar <b>radiation</b> have significant effect on the average daily global <b>horizontal</b> solar <b>radiation.</b> Relative humidity and soil temperature are not included in the model due to their high correlation with precipitation and temperature, respectively.

Detailed radiative transfer simulations in 3 -D coniferous forest environments are presented to document the typical distances that photons may travel in such media, and to quantify the impact that the resulting net horizontal fluxes may have with respect to the local and domain-averaged canopy reflectance. Based on these simulations it is possible to identify a fine spatial resolution limit beyond which pixel-based interpretations of remote sensing data over tall forested areas should be avoided because the <b>horizontal</b> <b>radiation</b> transport at the surface may contribute to 10 % or more of the measured reflectance signature of the target pixel.

40|$|AbstractMeteorological phenomena, such as {{fast moving}} clouds, cause rapid {{changes in the}} {{terrestrial}} direct beam radiation. This introduces transients in both the temporal and spatial measurements of global <b>horizontal</b> <b>radiation.</b> These transients in radiation affect the performance of solar energy conversion systems (PV, CPV systems and solar thermal applications) and cause their output power to vary widely. Thus, to properly understand the dynamic fluctuations observed in the output energies of large solar farms and PV arrays, it becomes necessary to perform a high-resolution temporal and spatial measurement of solar radiation. It turns out that performing such high-resolution measurements is often cost-prohibitive. Studies were conducted to understand and quantify the temporal and the spatial variations of direct beam, diffused and global <b>horizontal</b> <b>radiation.</b> These studies {{were based on the}} radiation data collected at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore at a time interval of 1 s. It was inferred from these studies that the temporal variations in the instantaneous diffuse radiation are minimum and there was little spatial variations seen across distances of 500 m. The transients observed in global <b>horizontal</b> <b>radiation</b> are predominantly restricted to the changes occurring in the direct beam component of the solar radiation. Based on these inferences, a simple and costeffective method is proposed that would permit accurate large scale localised high-resolution measurements of individual components of the solar radiation...|$|E
