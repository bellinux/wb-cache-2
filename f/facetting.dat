However, this idea is not well explored for general web search in an open-domain setting, even though it holds great potential for assisting multi-faceted queries and exploratory search. The goal of this work is to explore this potential by extending <b>faceted</b> search into the open-domain web setting, which we call <b>Faceted</b> Web Search. We address three fundamental issues in <b>Faceted</b> Web Search, namely: how to automatically generate <b>facets</b> (<b>facet</b> generation); how to re-organize search results with users 2 ̆ 7 selections on <b>facets</b> (<b>facet</b> feedback); and how to evaluate generated <b>facets</b> and entire <b>Faceted</b> Web Search systems. In conventional <b>faceted</b> search, <b>facets</b> are generated in advance for an entire corpus either manually or semi-automatically, and then recommended for particular queries {{in most of the}} previous work. However, this approach is difficult to extend to the entire web due to the web 2 ̆ 7 s large and heterogeneous nature. We instead propose a query-dependent approach, which extracts <b>facets</b> for queries from their web search results. We further improve our <b>facet</b> generation model under a more practical scenario, where users care more about precision of presented <b>facets</b> than recall. The dominant <b>facet</b> feedback method in conventional <b>faceted</b> search is Boolean filtering, which filters search results by users 2 ̆ 7 selections on <b>facets.</b> However, our investigation shows Boolean filtering is too strict when extended to the open-domain setting. Thus, we propose soft ranking models for <b>Faceted</b> Web Search, which expand original queries with users 2 ̆ 7 selections on <b>facets</b> to re-rank search results. Our experiments show that the soft ranking models are more effective than Boolean filtering models for <b>Faceted</b> Web Search. To evaluate <b>Faceted</b> Web Search, we propose both intrinsic evaluation, which evaluates <b>facet</b> generation on its own, and extrinsic evaluation, which evaluates an entire <b>Faceted</b> Web Search system by its utility in assisting search clarification. We also design a method for building reusable test collections for such evaluations. Our experiments show that using the <b>Faceted</b> Web Search interface can significantly improve the original ranking if allowed sufficient time for user feedback on <b>facets...</b>|$|R
