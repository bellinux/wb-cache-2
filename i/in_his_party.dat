5|$|Born in 1860, Bryan grew up {{in rural}} Illinois and in 1887 moved to Nebraska, where he practiced law and entered politics. He won {{election}} to the House of Representatives in 1890, and was re-elected in 1892, before mounting an unsuccessful US Senate run. He {{set his sights on}} higher office, believing he could be elected president in 1896 even though he remained a relatively minor figure in the Democratic Party. In anticipation of a presidential campaign, he spent much of 1895 and early 1896 making speeches across the United States; his compelling oratory increased his popularity <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1962, two-time former {{governor}} and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler {{had already begun}} his campaign for a third term as governor. The anti-Chandler faction became concerned that, {{if they did not}} name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience. Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler faction to back Breathitt, and Ward never became a candidate.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{was sworn}} into the 113th U.S. Congress on January 3, 2013, and was {{assigned}} to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Science, Space and Technology. He praised the technology committee assignment as an opportunity to secure federal funding, including National Science Foundation and Small Business Innovation Research grants, for life sciences companies in his district. As a freshman <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> he was unable to secure a seat on the Education Committee which he had sought.|$|E
50|$|Vega Ramos is {{currently}} active <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> electoral campaign.|$|R
50|$|Republican {{incumbent}} Michael Burgess ran unopposed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> primary to seek re-election.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> 2015 {{leadership}} election, John Pugh supported Tim Farron in {{preference to}} Norman Lamb.|$|R
5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party {{had been out}} of power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E
5|$|September saw Maine and Vermont go heavily Republican {{in their}} state elections, meaning the Northeast was likely safe for McKinley. Early in that month, {{dissident}} Democrats, who favored the gold standard and President Cleveland's policies, formed the National Democratic Party, or Gold Democrats, meeting in Indianapolis. The nomination of Illinois Senator John M. Palmer for president and former Kentucky governor Simon Bolivar Buckner for vice president meant Bryan would have to overcome an electoral split <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b> Hanna applauded the selection, and predicted it would get large numbers of votes. There was no chance Palmer would win the election, and Hanna {{saw to it that}} the Gold Democrats were aided with quietly-provided funds.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 Democratic {{convention}} {{opened at}} the Chicago Coliseum on July 7, 1896. Much activity took place {{in advance of the}} formal opening as the silver and (vastly outnumbered) gold forces prepared their strategies. Silver forces were supported by the Democratic National Bimetallic Committee, the umbrella group formed in 1895 to support silver Democrats in their insurgency against Cleveland. Gold Democrats looked to the President for leadership, but Cleveland, trusting few <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> did not involve himself further in the gold efforts, but spent the week of the convention fishing off the New Jersey coast.|$|E
50|$|On August 5, 2011, the Party's leader, Andrzej Lepper, {{was found}} dead <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> office <b>in</b> Warsaw. <b>His</b> death was ruled a suicide by hanging.|$|R
50|$|O'Bannon was unchallenged <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> primary, {{winning the}} Democratic {{nomination}} unanimously. He chose South Bend Mayor Joe Kernan {{to be his}} running mate.|$|R
50|$|Incumbent Mark Ritchie won {{endorsement}} at the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) convention. He faced only token opposition <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> primary from perennial candidate Dick Franson, {{and easily}} won <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> nomination <b>in</b> the August 10, 2010 primary.|$|R
5|$|Thorbjørn Jagland (born 5 November 1950) has sat on and {{chaired the}} {{committee}} since 2009. He is a Labour Party politician from Lier {{and sat in}} parliament representing Buskerud from 1993 to 2009. Jagland is former party leader (1992–2002), Prime Minister (1996–97), Minister of Foreign Affairs (2000–01) and President of the Parliament (2005–09). Since 2006, Jagland has chaired the Oslo Center and since 2009 been Secretary General of the Council of Europe. He holds a master's degree in economics and has never held full-time employment outside politics or <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
5|$|When the 38th Congress {{convened in}} December 1863, the Civil War was {{approaching}} its end. Randall was a War Democrat, sometimes siding with his Republican colleagues to support measures {{in pursuit of}} victory over the Confederates. When a bill was proposed to allow President Abraham Lincoln to promote Ulysses S. Grant to lieutenant general, Randall voted in favor, unlike most <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b> He voted {{with the majority of}} Democrats, however, to oppose allowing black men to serve in the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Cooper {{helped lead}} the {{opposition}} to the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), putting him at odds with many <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> including President Nixon. Cooper had long been an opponent of ABMs, which he believed could intensify a worldwide nuclear arms race. On August 6, 1969, a vote to suspend funding of the development of ABMs failed in the Senate by a vote of 50–51; Vice-President Spiro Agnew cast the tie-breaking vote. After this defeat, Cooper and Michigan Senator Philip Hart co-sponsored the Cooper–Hart Amendment that would have allowed funding for research and development of ABMs, but banned deployment of a U.S. ABM system. The measure failed by three votes but increased congressional scrutiny of the Defense Department budget, leading to a reduction in funding and hastening Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviets. Cooper served as an advisor to President Nixon during the events leading up to the talks.|$|E
25|$|Stere's {{position}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> leadership prevented it {{from entering}} a close {{union with the}} Transylvania-based Romanian National Party (PNR) in 1924, as the PNR's leaders resented his anti-Entente past.|$|R
5000|$|Three presidents, Alain Poher, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and Nicolas Sarkozy, were {{defeated}} in the second round. Sarkozy aimed to be a candidate again in 2016, but was defeated <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> primary.|$|R
5000|$|He was the 1987 Republican gubernatorial nominee. He {{defeated}} Douglas Hammond [...] "Doug" [...] Lemon (born March 3, 1942) of Florence <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> {{primary election}} but then lost {{the general election}} to Democrat Ray Mabus.|$|R
5|$|Murray Robson {{replaced}} Treatt as Leader of the Opposition in August 1954. Like {{other senior}} members of the Liberals, after having no conservative government since Alexander Mair in 1941, Robson had no experience in government, he had little interest in policy except for Cold War anti-communism, ignored majority views of his party and fellow parliamentary colleagues and Robson's attempts to forge a closer alliance with Bruxner and the Country Party, failed dismally and alienated him from many <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b> Robson was replaced by Pat Morton as leader in September 1955. Bruxner, now aged 70 and having fallen ill several times, led the Country Party one last time at the March 1956 election, which resulted in another labour victory and Country Party regained the seat of Armidale, but overall the government's majority fell from twenty to six. Bruxner retained Tenterfield unopposed.|$|E
5|$|Upon the resignation, Spooner was {{touted as}} Stevens' {{possible}} successor until Bruxner, {{who had always}} detested Spooner, refused to form a coalition government with him. At a UAP party meeting on 5 August, Spooner chose not to nominate and Steven's favoured candidate, Alexander Mair, defeated Athol Richardson 18 votes to 6, becoming Leader of the United Australia Party and {{was sworn in as}} Premier by Lord Wakehurst on the same day. Mair, who had got on well with Bruxner, ensured the survival of the coalition government. Mair attempted to shore up unity <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> to save the government. In the last months of government Bruxner was preoccupied with preparation for Australia's entry into the Second World War. He equipped railway workshops with modern machine tools and established National Emergency Services to deal with air raids.|$|E
5|$|While Pierce {{was popular}} and outgoing, his family {{life was a}} grim affair, with his wife Jane {{suffering}} from illness and depression for much of her life. All of their children died young, their last son being gruesomely killed in a train accident while the family was traveling shortly before Pierce's inauguration. As president, Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also satisfying the diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage, an effort which largely failed and turned many <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> against him. Pierce was a Young America expansionist who signed the Gadsden Purchase of land from Mexico and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain. He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan, while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability, but these successes were overshadowed by political strife during his presidency.|$|E
50|$|After the October 2009 elections, {{although}} {{he was the only}} New Democracy prefect in Attica, he abstained from taking part <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> bid for ENAE, issuing later a statement <b>in</b> defence of <b>his</b> non-participation decision pleading his commitment to principles.|$|R
50|$|While in Peshawar, Shams {{continued}} to publish <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> newspaper 'Afghan Mellat' which published articles that produced nationalistic sentiments {{and called for}} democratic development in the war-ravaged Afghanistan. Besides writing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> journal, shams also contributed scholarly articles and essays to other newspapers and journals. A unique feature <b>in</b> <b>his</b> writings was that he described facts regardless of its outcome.|$|R
50|$|Although Runciman holds {{strongly}} conservative {{views on}} {{matters such as}} criminal justice, he was not {{regarded as one of}} the more ideological members of <b>his</b> caucus. <b>In</b> recent years, he has played a significant role <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> leadership transitions.|$|R
25|$|In June 2012, Rep. Howard McKeon, Republican {{chair of}} the House Armed Services Committee, said he {{considered}} the repeal of DADT a settled issue and if Romney became president would not advocate its reinstatement, though others <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> might.|$|E
25|$|Boman {{was elected}} to {{leadership}} positions <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b> In 2005 he was Vice Chair of the Libertarian Party of Michigan. The following year, in 2006, he {{was elected to}} be Chair of the Libertarian Party of Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Medici {{attempted}} {{to promote the}} candidacy of others <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> but none could gain wide support. Wolsey received eight votes, but his young age deterred other cardinals from supporting him (the English ambassador tried to convince the College he was over fifty). Medici addressed the conclave on January 9 and suggested they {{turn their attention to}} candidates not present in the conclave, expressing his willingness to elect Adrian of Utrecht. In the following scrutiny Adrian received fifteen votes, including all those controlled by Medici. Colonna, the main opponent of Medici and those <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> then declared his support for Adrian, netting him thirteen more votes by accessus, exactly two-thirds. As Adrian was not present, his candidacy did not require two-thirds plus one.|$|E
50|$|The incumbent, Republican Pete Olson, {{represented}} the district since 2009. Democrats Mark Gibson, who lost <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> primary <b>in</b> 2014, and A. R. Hassan ran for their party's nomination; Gibson won with {{this time with}} 76.16% of the vote.|$|R
50|$|In August 2011, {{in a rare}} circumstance, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{offered a}} state funeral for his {{political}} adversary and Leader of the Opposition, Jack Layton. Layton died of cancer three months after <b>his</b> New Democratic <b>Party</b> became the official opposition, {{for the first time}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> history.|$|R
50|$|Fisas {{was elected}} to the European Parliament after being put in the 23rd {{position}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> list. During <b>his</b> first term from 2009 to 2014, he served on the Committee on Culture and Education. In 2014, he joined the Committee on International Trade.|$|R
25|$|In 1864, Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Drew of the 1st Oregon Cavalry passed {{just south}} of the Catlow Valley while on a {{long-range}} reconnaissance patrol for the United States Army. Drew named Beatys Butte in honor of Sergeant A. M. Beaty, one of the noncommissioned officers <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
25|$|On June 28, {{one month}} before García was sworn <b>in,</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> gave 25 of the 79 votes (almost {{one third of the}} votes) that {{ratified}} the agreement in the Peruvian Congress, one month prior to the new legislature that included the Union for Peru congressmen, who opposed to the agreement with the USA. The US Congress ratified the agreement by December 4, 2007 and it was put into effect February 1, 2009.|$|E
25|$|As a legislator, Austin {{spoke out}} against an early attempt to {{increase}} legislators' salaries and later {{was one of only}} two legislators (193-2) to vote against increasing legislators' travel allowance from 15-17 cents per mile. He sponsored legislation for strict reporting requirements for lobbyists; criticized the leadership of his own party for the hiring practices of former legislators; and provided Governor Thornburgh with the deciding vote which defined the authority of the state's first elected Attorney General over the objections of the leadership <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chris Bell, {{a former}} Congressman from Houston, filed an ethics {{complaint}} against former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay as {{a lame duck}} who had been defeated <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> primary after the controversial mid-decade redistricting in the state. Bell announced <b>his</b> run <b>in</b> July 2005.|$|R
50|$|Edina {{attorney}} and psychologist Chris Barden earned {{the endorsement of}} the Republican Party of Minnesota at its state convention. He was challenged <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> primary by Sharon Anderson, a perennial candidate who won her party's endorsement for Attorney General in 1994. In the August 10 primary, Barden earned 54% of the vote to defeat Anderson and earn <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> nomination.|$|R
50|$|Shams-ul-Huda Shams (شمس الهدا شمس) was the {{president}} of the Afghan Millat Party (Afghan Social Democratic Party) from 1987 until his death on October 9, 2005. He was also a journalist, publishing articles <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> newspaper called 'Afghan Millat'. Shams had recently returned to his homeland after twenty-seven years in exile and had opened an office for <b>his</b> <b>party</b> <b>in</b> Jalalabad.|$|R
