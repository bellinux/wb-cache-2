25|$|T-72B obr.1989g: T-72B {{equipped}} with advanced Kontakt-5 <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour,</b> composite armour in sides of turret as well. Often called T-72BM or T-72B(M) {{but this is}} not correct. NATO code: SMT M1990.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{armoured}} plates can {{be installed}} on the vehicle to increase protection. Active protection methods can also be used, such as <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour.</b> These can be added over the existing armour of the vehicle. To increase protection, periscopes are installed instead of windscreens and vision blocks.|$|E
25|$|Various armour {{technologies}} and associated subsystems from composite armour and <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> to Radios (Combat Net Radio with frequency hopping and encryption) and Battle Management systems. Fire-control systems {{are currently in}} production at BEL for the Arjun tanks. The first batch in production have a hybrid Sagem-DRDO system, with Sagem sights and local fire control computer.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a second}} generation, semi-automatic, antitank, tube launched, {{optically}} tracked, wire guided and aero-dynamically controlled missile.It is designed to destroy moving and stationary armoured targets with <b>Explosives</b> <b>Reactive</b> <b>Armours</b> at a range of 75 to 4000 meters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reactive</b> <b>armour</b> {{consists}} of small explosive-filled metal boxes that detonate when {{hit by the}} metallic jet projected by an exploding HEAT warhead, causing their metal plates to disrupt it. Tandem warheads defeat <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> by causing the armour to detonate prematurely. Modern <b>Reactive</b> <b>armour</b> protects itself from Tandem warheads by having a thicker front metal plate to prevent the precursor charge from detonating the <b>explosive</b> in the <b>reactive</b> <b>armour.</b> <b>Reactive</b> <b>armours</b> can also reduce the penetrative abilities of kinetic energy penetrators by deforming the penetrator with the metal plates on the <b>Reactive</b> <b>armour,</b> thereby reducing its effectiveness against the main armour of the tank.|$|R
50|$|Tandem {{charges are}} {{effective}} against <b>reactive</b> <b>armour,</b> {{which is designed}} to protect an armoured vehicle (mostly tanks) against anti-tank munitions. The first stage of the weapon is typically a weak charge that either pierces the <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> of the target without detonating it leaving a channel through the <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> so that the second warhead may pass unimpeded, or simply detonating the armourplate causing the timing of the counter-explosion to fail. The second detonation from the same projectile (which defines it as a tandem charge) attacks the same location as the first detonation where the <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> has been compromised. Since the regular armour plating is often the only defence remaining, the main charge (second detonation) has an increased likelihood of penetrating the armour.|$|R
25|$|Arjun tank {{hull and}} turret has been {{modified}} {{to achieve the}} target weight of about 55 tons from 59-64 tons. Elbit is helping to enhance its firepower and battlefield survivability and Israel Military Industries is helping to augment Arjun Mk II’s mobility, redesign its turret and hull and improve its production-line processes. Protection was improved by using improved Kanchan armour, along with the locally developed <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> modules in the turret.|$|E
25|$|Arjun Mark II has a {{total of}} 93 upgrades, {{including}} 13 major improvements. The major upgrades are missile-firing capability against long-range targets, panoramic sight with night vision to engage targets effectively at night, containerisation of the ammunition, enhanced main weapon penetration; additional ammunition types, <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour,</b> an advanced air-defence gun to engage helicopters; a mine plough, an advanced land navigation system and a warning system which can fire smoke grenades to confuse laser guidance. Other upgrades are an enhanced Auxiliary power unit providing 8.5 KW (from 4.5 KW) and an improved gun barrel, changes in the commander's panoramic sight with eye safe LRF, night vision capability including for driver, digital control harness, new final drive, track and sprocket. The Arjun Mk.2 has an advanced hydropneumatic suspension system which provides very good comfort to the crew, This tank is also fitted with auxiliary power unit which powers all systems when the main engine is turned off and It can be also fitted with a mine plough.|$|E
25|$|T-55AGM - Ukrainian T-54/T-55 modernization. It {{brings up}} the T-54/T-55 tanks to T-80 standard. It can also be applied to Chinese made Type 59 and Soviet T-62. It is fitted with 5TDFM, {{two-stroke}} liquid-cooled multi-fuel supercharged diesel engine with boxing pistons which develops 850hp (634kW), improved running gear, automated movement control system with a steering handlebar control, additional passive protection, built-in <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour,</b> countermeasures system, new fire suppression system with over-ride facilities at the commander's station, automatic loader which holds 18 rounds and anti-aircraft machine gun that can be aimed and fired from within the turret under a complete armour protection. The anti-aircraft machine gun is installed on the commander's cupola and {{is intended to be}} fired at air and ground targets. The buyer can choose between two main armament options: 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun or 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun. Both of them with use of enhanced performance conventional ammunition and barrel-launched ATGM can defeat modern tanks form distance of 2000–3000 m and up to 5,000 m using the ATGM. The tank can carry at least 30 rounds. The 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun weighs 2,5 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (48 calibers) and can fire APFSDS, HEAT and HE-FRAG rounds while 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun weighs 2,63 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (50 calibers) and can fire all types of ammunition that meet the requirements of NATO standards and Ukrainian-made ATGM. Both guns have normal recoil length of 26–30cm and maximum recoil length of 31cm. The tank can be armed with either the KT-7.62 or the PKT-7.62 coaxial machine gun and can carry 3,000 rounds for it. The tank can also be armed with either KT-12.7 or NSVT-12.7 heavy machine gun for AA protection and can carry 450 rounds for it. The approximate successful range is 2km during day and 800 m during night. The AA HMG can be elevated between -5 to +70 degrees. The remote control for anti-aircraft machine gun is stabilized in the vertical axis during automatic mode (by using the TKN-5 sight) and is using the PZU-7 sight for semi-automatic mode.|$|E

500|$|In the nineties, a <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> package, named BRENUS or Brennus, was {{developed}} for the AMX-30B2, but was issued only to two tank regiments, which in peacetime were combined into the 1er/ 2e Chasseurs, {{that were part of}} France's rapid reaction force; the other two regiments using the AMX-30, the 2e/5e Dragons, only had their tanks adapted for a possible relatively quick upgrade, in case of an emergency. The BRENUS system used 112 GIAT BS (Brique de Surblindage) G2 <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> boxes with a total weight of , offering a protection equivalent to [...] of steel at 60°. Recently, the AMX-30 has also been used as a testbed for several stealth technologies, including air cooling of hull surfaces and the use of visual camouflage. This prototype is known as the Démonstrateur Furtif à Chenille. Its hull and turret are fully covered by a superstructure built of angled plates made of radar absorbent material.|$|R
500|$|The {{large number}} of Russia's {{casualties}} during the First Chechen War prompted Russia to consider {{the development of a}} new active protection system. During the Battle of Grozny, for example, the Russian Army lost between 200 and 250 armoured fighting vehicles to Chechen rebels. [...] Vehicles which were knocked-out included main battle tanks such as the T-72 and T-80, and lighter armoured vehicles such as the BMP-2. [...] The majority of tanks deployed to Chechnya were not issued with <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour,</b> due to the [...] "lack of time and funds", while some of those [...] that were issued with reactive armour did not have the explosive charge to start the reaction. [...] Some of the most dangerous threats to Russian armour were rocket-propelled grenades [...] fired from buildings in Grozny. [...] As a result of these vulnerabilities, Kolomenskoye developed the Arena active protection system, with the goal of providing Russian armour more reliable protection against these threats.|$|E
500|$|Stunt car {{coordinator}} Rémy Julienne {{described the}} car chase between the Aston Martin DB5 and the Ferrari F355 as between [...] "a perfectly shaped, old and vulnerable vehicle and a racecar." [...] The stunt {{had to be}} meticulously planned as the cars are vastly different. Nails had to {{be attached to the}} F355 tyres to make it skid, and during one take of the sliding vehicles, the two cars collided. The largest stunt sequence in the film was the tank chase, which took around six weeks to film, partly on location in St. Petersburg and partly at Leavesden. A Russian T-54/55 tank, on loan from the East England Military Museum, was modified with the addition of fake <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> panels. To avoid destroying the pavement on the city streets of St. Petersburg, the steel off-road tracks of the T-54/55 were replaced with the rubber-shoed tracks from a British Chieftain tank. The T-55 Tank used in the film is now on permanent display at Old Buckenham Airport where the East England Military Museum is based.|$|E

2500|$|T-55MV (Ob'yekt 155MV)/T-55AMV (Ob'yekt 155AMV) [...] - [...] "V" [...] for vzryvnoj ('explosive') {{designated}} tanks, which carried [...] "Kontakt-1" [...] <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> (ERA) {{instead of}} the passive BDD armour. The ERA bricks (EDZ or elementi dinamicheskoj zashchity) are normally mounted on the turret front, hull front and the hull sides. This variant was adopted by Soviet Naval Infantry first, and by the Russian Army {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union. The T-55MV is a modernized T-55M and the T-55AMV is a modernized T-55AM.|$|E
2500|$|At {{least two}} {{distinct}} sets of <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> kit are currently available, giving the BMP-3 protection from less advanced rocket propelled grenades. One {{of them is}} the Kaktus ERA kit, which has a unique design that creates minimal acoustic and kinetic backlash to the armour behind it upon detonation, thus ensuring that the occupants will not be harmed by shockwaves from the ERA block. The ERA blocks will completely disintegrate after detonation. According to Kurganmashzavod, the BMP-3 may also be fitted with additional side armor tiles, which can resist [...]50 caliber armour-piercing ammunition perpendicularly at close ranges. They give the BMP-3 added side protection from autocannon fire as well.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979 Dynamite Nobel AG {{received}} a development order, the first troop test began in 1986, and in 1992 Panzerfaust 3 was officially introduced. The improved PzF 3-T replaced the original {{model in the}} late 1990s, introducing a dual hollow charge [...] "tandem" [...] warhead to defeat <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour.</b> This means that the spike projecting from the warhead itself also contains an explosive charge to set off reactive armour and free {{the path to the}} main armour for the secondary warhead. The latest incarnation of the Panzerfaust 3, the PzF 3-IT-600, can be fired from ranges up to 600 metres thanks to an advanced computer-assisted sighting and targeting mechanism.|$|E

2500|$|T-72 Wilk: {{beginning}} in 1986, the Polish T-72 Wilk project was instituted to allow tank repair plants to upgrade T-72 tanks {{within their own}} facilities. In particular, it was proposed that the Soviet-made Volna fire control system {{be replaced by the}} Czechoslovak-made Kladivo FCS or by the Polish SKO-1 Mérida, which was originally designed for T-55AM [...] "Merida". Besides the new FCS, the Radomka passive night vision devices were installed in the driver's compartment, as was the Liswarta night sight, Obra laser illumination warning system, Tellur anti-laser smoke grenade launchers, solid or modular metal side skirts and the Polish-developed Erawa-1 or Erawa-2 <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> was also fitted. This program was further developed and led to the PT-91.|$|E
2500|$|BMP-3M – KBP and Kurganmashzavod have {{upgraded}} {{the vehicle}} {{with a new}} turret and engines. The upgraded vehicle is called the BMP-3M and the new turret includes a new automatic fire control system with ballistic computer, new SOZH gunner's sight with laser rangefinder and an ATGM guidance channel, thermal imager, TKN-AI commander's vision device with laser illuminator and new ammunition loading system for ATGM. The BMP-3M is also able to fire various ammunition types, including new 100mm laser-guided projectiles, new 100mm HE-FRAG (high explosive fragmentation) rounds and new 30mm APDS (armour piercing discarding sabot) rounds. Additional passive armour protection is effective against 12.7mm armour-piercing rounds {{from a range of}} 50m. <b>Explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> is available as an option. The new uprated engine is the UTD-32, which is rated at 660hp. There are actually several different M models, some fitted with additional armour, [...] "Arena-E" [...] or [...] "Shtora-1" [...] protection system, air conditioner etc.|$|E
2500|$|T-55MV - The former Soviet Army tank repair plants number 7 in Kiev {{and number}} 17 in Lviv in the Ukraine have been {{promoting}} the T-55MV {{on the world}} market for several years. The turret, hull front section and side skirts of this version are protected by the Kontakt-5 <b>explosive</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> capable of withstanding hits from the American M829 120mm armour-piercing depleted uranium ammunition. The main armament of the T-55MV was improved by employing the 9M117 [...] "Bastion" [...] (AT-10 Stabber) ATGM which can be launched through the barrel of the standard T-54/55 rifled gun. With an effective range of 4,000 m, the 9M117 [...] "Bastion" [...] (AT-10 Stabber) ATGM is capable of penetrating armour equivalent to 550mm of steel plate. If the missile is equipped with a tandem warhead, its armour penetration capability increases. The Volna fire control system with its digital ballistic computer was also fitted. Syria was the first country to order 200 of its T-55s upgraded into the T-55MV.|$|E
