Medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with this as well as lower temperature. Measures such as putting a cool <b>damp</b> <b>cloth</b> on the forehead and having a slightly warm bath are not useful and may simply make a person more uncomfortable. Children younger than three months require medical attention, as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms.

25|$|Screening the fibre {{involves}} using a mesh {{made from}} non-corroding and inert material, such as aluminium, which is stretched {{in a wooden}} frame {{similar to that of}} a window. The size of the paper is governed {{by the size of the}} frame. This tool is then completely submerged in the solution vertically and drawn out horizontally to ensure a uniform coating of the wire mesh. Excess water is then removed and the wet mat of fibre laid on top of a <b>damp</b> <b>cloth.</b> The process is repeated for the required number of sheets. This stack of wet mats is then pressed in a hydraulic press very gently to ensure the fibre does not squeeze out. The fairly damp fibre is then dried using a variety of methods, such as vacuum drying or simply air drying. Sometimes, the individual sheet is rolled to flatten, harden, and refine the surface. Finally, the paper is then cut to the desired shape or the standard shape (A4, letter, legal, etc.) and packed.|$|E

40|$|There are 17 {{species of}} snakes in Minnesota. Of these, 15 are non-poinsonous. The two {{poisonous}} snakes are very rare anywhere near urban areas. Several non-poinsonous snakes, including garter snakes, adapt especially {{well to the}} suburbs. These snakes are beneficial to humans because they feed {{a wide variety of}} pests and rodents Snakes hibernate in groups, usually in holes in the ground or in the foundations of buildings. During the first warm days of spring, snakes leave their dens to sun them-selves. Later, they return to their dens for the night. Once soil temperatures rise above 50 degrees snakes leave their hibernation holes for the summer. After that, only a few snakes will remain in the immediate area. Snakes sometimes get into homes.

2500|$|The {{difference}} {{was in the}} manner in which the detainees' breathing was obstructed. At the SERE school and in the DoJ opinion, the subject's airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a <b>damp</b> <b>cloth</b> over the air passages; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contrast, the Agency interrogator ... applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee's mouth and nose. One of the psychiatrist / interrogators acknowledged that the Agency's use of the technique is different from that used in SERE training because it is 'for real' and is more poignant and convincing.|$|E
2500|$|Absorption is {{the process}} of being drawn into a (usually larger) body or substrate, and {{adsorption}} {{is the process}} of deposition upon a surface. This can be used to remove both particulate and gaseous hazards. [...] Although some form of reaction may take place, it is not necessary; the method may work by attractive charges. For example, if the target particles are positively charged, a negatively charged substrate may be used. Examples of substrates include activated carbon, and zeolites. This effect can be very simple and highly effective, for example using a <b>damp</b> <b>cloth</b> to cover the mouth and nose while escaping a fire. [...] While this method can be effective at trapping particulates produced by combustion, it does not filter out harmful gasses which may be toxic or which displace the oxygen required for survival.|$|E
2500|$|It {{quickly became}} {{evident that the}} men who stayed in their places {{suffered}} less than those who ran away, as any movement worsened {{the effects of the}} gas, and that those who stood up on the fire step suffered less—indeed they often escaped any serious effects—than those who lay down or sat {{at the bottom of a}} trench. Men who stood on the parapet suffered least, as the gas was denser near the ground. The worst sufferers were the wounded lying on the ground, or on stretchers, and the men who moved back with the cloud. Chlorine was less effective as a weapon than the Germans had hoped, particularly as soon as simple countermeasures were introduced. The gas produced a visible greenish cloud and strong odour, making it easy to detect. It was water-soluble, so the simple expedient of covering the mouth and nose with a <b>damp</b> <b>cloth</b> was somewhat effective at reducing the effect of the gas. It was thought to be even more effective to use [...] urine rather than water, as it was known at the time that chlorine reacted readily with urea (present in urine) to form dichloro urea.|$|E

50|$|In the clavichord, strings run {{transversely}} {{from the}} hitchpin rail at the left-hand end to tuning pegs on the right. Towards the right end they pass over a curved wooden bridge. The action is simple, with the keys being levers {{with a small}} brass tangent, {{a small piece of}} metal similar in shape and size to the head of a flat-bladed screwdriver, at the far end. The strings, which are usually of brass, or else a combination of brass and iron, are usually arranged in pairs, like a lute or mandolin. When the key is pressed, the tangent strikes the strings above, causing them to sound in a similar fashion to the hammering technique on a guitar. Unlike in a piano action, the tangent does not rebound from the string; rather, it stays in contact with the string as long as the key is held, acting as both the nut and as the initiator of sound.

60|$|He shed an {{official}} glance upon the situation, {{and then began}} to give orders. Two women-servants came out with pails and brooms and brushes, and gave the sidewalk a thorough scrubbing; meanwhile two others scrubbed the four marble steps which led up to the door; beyond these we could see some men-servants taking up the carpet of the grand staircase. This carpet was carried away and the last grain of dust beaten and banged and swept out of it; then brought back and put down again. The brass stair-rods received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to their places. Now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming plants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the base of the staircase. Other servants adorned all the balconies of the various stories with flowers and banners; others ascended to the roof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there. Now came some more chamber-maids and retouched the sidewalk, and afterward wiped the marble steps with <b>damp</b> <b>cloths</b> and finished by dusting them off with feather brushes. Now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the marble steps and out across the sidewalk to the curbstone. The PORTIER cast his eye along it, and found it was not absolutely straight; he commanded it to be straightened; the servants made the effort--made several efforts, in fact--but the PORTIER was not satisfied. He finally had it taken up, and then he put it down himself and got it right.|$|R

Methods:This is an exploratory, analytical and cross-sectional study, conducted with undergraduate nursing course teachers from two private universities {{in the city of}} São Paulo, named A and B. The sample consisted of 42 teachers/nurses, being 22 from University A and 20 from University B, who supervised the internship at Hospital Vila Nova Cachoeir-inha. With the aim to collect data, a structured questionnaire consisting of 10 questions (checklist) was used; each question in the checklist had correct and wrong answers. The teachers had to indicate with &# 8220;x" the correct answer. The questionnaire was delivered to teachers/nurses on a predetermined day. Data collection was carried out on August 2006. Results:The majority of study participants know that stoma demarcation must be performed preoperatively, and {{that it is important to}} educate the patient about surgery, care for the stoma and on the collecting device, as well as to perform a sensitivity test for the equipment. The hygiene should be performed with mild soap and water and with a piece of clean, soft, <b>damp</b> cotton <b>cloth</b> without rubbing, and the skin must be kept dry. The hair removal should be done with curved tip scissors, cutting close to the abdominal wall. Conclusion:The results showed that, although most of the participants have a basic knowledge about stomized patients care, updating and improvement are needed...|$|R
40|$|Physics-based {{computer}} animation {{is an area}} of Computer Graphics with important applications ranging from visual effects in movies and computer games to simulation-based modeling and design. This dissertation introduces the use of fractional calculus for achieving new physics-based models in the areas of cloth and fluid simulation. Three main contributions are proposed. First, an underwater cloth deformation approach is introduced based on a half-derivative <b>damping</b> model. The <b>cloth</b> is represented by a system of particles connected by elastic elements with fractional damping terms that are able to well represent the history forces that happen underwater. As a result, underwater behavior is achieved without simulating the volumetric fluid around the cloth. Second, a new viscosity model employing fractional terms is proposed to better represent the behavior of colliding flows in simulations of Newtonian fluids based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The fractional terms are integrated into the SPH equations in order to better capture the history-based exchanges that happen in regions of colliding flows. Finally, a model is introduced for simulating shear thickening fluids, which are a special type of non-Newtonian fluids that have not been simulated before in {{computer animation}}. The proposed model combines SPH forces with dynamic elastic forces that are modeled with history-based fractional stiffness terms. The model can successfully simulate both the solid and liquid-like behavior of a shear thickening fluid as well as the history-based phase transitions between the solid and liquid phases. The achieved model is able to produce results that are very similar to real-life experiments. This dissertation illustrates the potential of fractional calculus for modeling physics-based behavior and several numerical and visual experiments are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed models...|$|R

An iron that stood the ordinary test of a wet finger was too cold for Joe and Martin, and such test was useless. They went wholly by holding the irons close to their cheeks, gauging the heat by some secret mental process that Martin admired but could not understand. When the fresh irons proved too hot, they hooked them on iron rods and dipped them into cold water. This again required a precise and subtle judgment. A {{fraction of a second}} too long in the water and the fine and silken edge of the proper heat was lost, and Martin found time to marvel at the accuracy he developed--an automatic accuracy, founded upon criteria that were machine-like and unerring.|$|E

60|$|First. My Gray's Inn friend, on a time, hurt {{one of his}} legs, and {{it became}} seriously inflamed. Not knowing of his indisposition, I {{was on my way}} to visit him as usual, one summer evening, when I was much {{surprised}} by meeting a lively leech in Field-court, Gray's Inn, seemingly on his way to the West End of London. As the leech was alone, and was of course unable to explain his position, even if he had been inclined to do so (which he had not the appearance of being), I passed him and went on. Turning the corner of Gray's Inn-square, I was beyond expression amazed by meeting another leech--also entirely alone, and also proceeding in a westerly direction, though with less decision of purpose. Ruminating on this extraordinary circumstance, and endeavouring to remember whether I had ever read, in the Philosophical Transactions or any work on Natural History, of a migration of Leeches, I ascended to the top set, past the dreary series of closed outer doors of offices and an empty set or two, which intervened between that lofty region and the surface. Entering my friend's rooms, I found him stretched upon his back, like Prometheus Bound, with a perfectly demented ticket-porter in attendance on him instead of the Vulture: which helpless individual, who was feeble and frightened, and had (my friend explained to me, in great choler) been endeavouring for some hours to apply leeches to his leg, and as yet had only got on two out of twenty. To this Unfortunate's distraction between a <b>damp</b> <b>cloth</b> on which he had placed the leeches to freshen them, and the wrathful adjurations of my friend to 'Stick 'em on, sir!' I referred the phenomenon I had encountered: the rather as two fine specimens were at that moment going out at the door, while a general insurrection of the rest was in progress on the table. After a while our united efforts prevailed, and, when the leeches came off and had recovered their spirits, we carefully tied them up in a decanter. But I never heard more of them than that they were all gone next morning, and that the Out- of-door young man of Bickle, Bush and Bodger, on the ground floor, had been bitten and blooded by some creature not identified. They never 'took' on Mrs. Miggot, the laundress; but, I have always preserved fresh, the belief that she unconsciously carried several about her, until they gradually found openings in life.|$|E
