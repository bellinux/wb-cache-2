5|$|Besides Majungasaurus, fossil taxa {{recovered}} from the Maevarano include fish, frogs, lizards, snakes, seven distinct species of crocodylomorphs, <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> species of mammals, Vorona and several other birds, the possibly flighted dromaeosaurid Rahonavis, the noasaurid Masiakasaurus and two titanosaurian sauropods, including Rapetosaurus.

5|$|Fieldfares often nest {{in small}} colonies, {{possibly}} {{for protection from}} predators. The nest is built in a tree where <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> eggs are laid.

50|$|The game starts {{by laying}} cards from the stock {{one at a}} time into a wastepile in search for <b>fives</b> <b>or</b> <b>sixes.</b> Once any of these cards are found, it becomes a {{foundation}} and can be placed on a circle surrounding the area where queens are placed; it can be built upon immediately. The foundations' places in this circle are irrelevant.|$|R

5|$|The Senate still {{controlled}} North Africa, {{an important}} regional producer of grain, {{as well as}} Illyria and Macedonia, two martially strategic regions with several legions.

5|$|A {{study showed}} that high levels of {{nutrients}} used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> extra or even no limbs.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular surfaces of the vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the vertebral bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along the neck and bridge multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior the neck to <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.|$|E
50|$|Spoil Five is a {{respected}} {{member of one}} of the most prolific families of card games based on this pattern: each player receives <b>five</b> cards, <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> nine, and another is turned up to fix the trump suit.

5|$|By 1890 {{official}} {{slum clearance}} programmes had begun. One {{was the creation}} of the world's first council housing, the LCC Boundary Estate, which replaced the neglected and crowded streets of Friars Mount, better known as The Old Nichol Street Rookery. Between 1918 and 1939 the LCC continued replacing East End housing with <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> storey flats, despite residents preferring houses with gardens and opposition from shopkeepers who were forced to relocate to new, more expensive premises. The Second World War brought an end to further slum clearance.|$|E
