50|$|In The Big Book of Pain, Donnelly and Diehl {{present an}} ingeniously {{designed}} boot {{that is very}} technologically sophisticated. The carefully contoured instrument is patterned after a comfortable open-backed clog - except that its toe box offers not soft leather but a layer of iron spikes, burrs, and teeth carefully designed to attack the toes from every direction. The naked foot rests upon an iron skate that is slowly driven forward by a stout <b>heel</b> <b>plate</b> operated by a large crank handle. Steadily increasing pressure forces the toes and metatarsals against the metal protrusions, shredding {{the flesh of the}} toes and pulverizing their bones. Continued tightening of the screw at the heel could generate enough pressure to shatter the bones of the instep.|$|E
5000|$|A {{species of}} lizard, Anolis achilles, which has widened <b>heel</b> <b>plates,</b> {{is named for}} Achilles.|$|R
50|$|Some Axis pedals, called longboards, are {{unusual in}} having {{straight}} flat foot <b>plates</b> with no <b>heel</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|X Specification {{includes}} eight unique duo-tone paint {{treatments and}} carbon-fibre door mirrors and <b>heel</b> <b>plates,</b> titanium exhaust, carbon-fibre finish {{to the interior}} side panels and carbon-fibre engine cover, a gloss black finish to the 21-inch forged wheels.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to producing drums, Pearl has also produced hardware for its drum and percussion instruments {{as well as}} pedals. One of Pearl's major improvements was {{the introduction of the}} Uni-Lock tilter on their tom mounts and cymbal stands. Introduced in 1982, the Uni-Lock tilter uses a frictionless, gearless tilter, allowing the player to make more precise angle adjustments to their toms and cymbals. This was further improved with the introduction of the Gyro-Lock tilters which rotate a full 360 degrees. Most of Pearl's pedals come equipped with PowerShifter <b>heel</b> <b>plates,</b> which allow the player to adjust the pedal's feel by sliding the plate either forwards or backwards.|$|R

50|$|Soldiers {{were issued}} {{two pairs of}} boots, both made with a brown finish {{that had to be}} {{polished}} black. There was a brief period (1908 to 1914) where they were issued one pair that was hand-polished in black for parade and drill and one pair finished in raw brown hide for fatigue duty and field service. World War I forced the reversion to brown leather boots for Other Ranks but polished black boots were still worn by some individuals or units out of habit. Officers, who purchased their own uniforms, were still required to wear polished brown boots and matching leather Sam Browne belt with their field service uniform, marking them apart from their men. Officers' boots had <b>heel</b> <b>plates,</b> but lacked the sole studs and toe plates because they could afford to have the soles replaced. The later Boots, General Service adopted in 1927 were issued from the factory in black leather.|$|R
25|$|Tap shoes have metal plates {{mounted to}} {{the bottoms of}} the toe and <b>heel.</b> The metal <b>plates,</b> which are known as taps, make a loud sound when struck against a hard {{performance}} surface. Tap shoes, which are used in tap dancing, may be made from any style of shoe to which taps can be attached.|$|R
5000|$|For solid body {{electric}} guitars, harder {{access to}} top frets, especially if screw plate is used and visible. Slick <b>heel</b> with hidden <b>plate</b> (such as depicted one) makes playing the top frets {{more comfortable and}} special neck joint techniques, such as the Ibanez AANJ (All Access Neck Joint), Music Man Silhouette and Stephen's Extended Cutaway mitigate this problem.|$|R
5000|$|These in turn were {{replaced}} by ammunition boots, which were used {{in a variety of}} similar design patterns from the late 1880s until the late 1960s. The [...] "George Boots" [...] worn with the Officers' dress uniform and mess dress are similar, but they lack the leather counter (heel cap), the toe case (toe-cap) and omit the hobnails, and the steel <b>heel</b> and toe <b>plates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} inning, Versalles led {{off with a}} double. But with two men on, Versalles was caught {{stealing}} home {{on the front end}} of an attempted double steal. In the fourth, Johnny Roseboro put the Dodgers on the board with a two-run single. The play cost the Dodgers dearly, Jim Lefebvre bruising his <b>heel</b> crossing the <b>plate</b> with the second of the two runs. The Dodgers, already short on hitting (Lefebvre was batting [...]400 at the time), went with Dick Tracewski (.118 for the Series) at second base the rest of the way. The Twins received a scare of their own in the seventh inning. Catcher Earl Battey, chasing a popup, collided full speed with the railing used to cover sub-field level [...] "dugout seats" [...] next to the Twins dugout. Battey crumpled in a heap holding his neck and was replaced by Jerry Zimmerman. Los Angeles continued to score runs on a Willie Davis single and a Lou Johnson double in the fifth, then a Wills double in the sixth.|$|R
