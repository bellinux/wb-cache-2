5000|$|A {{volumetric}} flask (measuring flask or <b>graduated</b> <b>flask)</b> {{is a piece}} of laboratory glassware, a type of laboratory flask, calibrated to contain a precise volume at a particular temperature. Volumetric flasks are used for precise dilutions and preparation of standard solutions. These flasks are usually pear-shaped, with a flat bottom, and made of glass or plastic. The flask's mouth is either furnished with a plastic snap/screw cap or fitted with a joint to accommodate a PTFE or glass stopper. The neck of the {{volumetric flask}}s is elongated and narrow with an etched ring graduation marking. The marking indicates the volume of liquid contained when filled up to that point. The marking is typically calibrated [...] "to contain" [...] (marked [...] "TC" [...] or [...] "IN") at 20 °C and indicated correspondingly on a label. The flask's label also indicates the nominal volume, tolerance, precision class, relevant manufacturing standard and the manufacturer’s logo. The volumetric flasks are of various sizes, containing from 1 to 20 000 mL of liquid.|$|E
30|$|To {{research}} {{the influence of}} sample preparation, a d-optimal response surface design was used. The sample volume was varied at levels of 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200  mL. The receiver volume (volume of <b>graduated</b> <b>flask)</b> was set at either exactly the same volume as the sample volume, or at the double volume (for example, 25  mL of sample were either distilled into 25 or 50  mL). Finally as third factor, volumetric glass pipettes or graduated flasks were used to transfer the sample volume into the Kjeldatherm tube.|$|E
30|$|A weighed {{amount of}} Fe(III) {{chloride}} (0.0226  g) was dissolved in 1 Litre of distilled water (pH 2.5) in a <b>graduated</b> <b>flask.</b> 50.0  mL {{of the solution}} {{was placed in a}} 100  mL separatory funnel, followed by addition of 10  mL of a 1 % oxime solution in chloroform. It was shaken for 1  min. The dark red colored chloroform has the Fe(III) 8 -hydroxyquinolone complex. Fe(III) (50 – 200  µg) can be extracted from aqueous solution with 1 % solution of 8 -hydroxyquinoline in chloroform by double extraction when the pH of the aqueous solution is between 2 and 10. At a pH of 2 – 2.5 nickel, cobalt, cerium(III), and aluminium do not interfere.|$|E
30|$|The {{tissue samples}} were {{defrosted}} at room temperature, and 0.5 g of each sample was mixed with 5 ml concentrated nitric acid (65 %) in a quartz vessel. This vessel {{was put into}} a Teflon® capsule, which was prepared with 5 ml bidistilled water and 2 ml hydrogen peroxide. Afterwards, a wet-chemical digestion was performed in a microwave (MLS GmbH, Leutkirch, Germany), where the Teflon® capsule {{was placed in a}} pressure vessel. The acid digestion lasted for 1 h, and maximum temperatures of 200 °C were reached. After cooling, the samples were pipetted into <b>graduated</b> <b>flasks</b> that were provided with bidistilled water. The <b>graduated</b> <b>flasks</b> were filled up with bidistilled water to a total volume of 50 ml before the further measurement of the elements.|$|R

40|$|El objetivo de este trabajo fue conocer el efecto de elevadas concentraciones de sales totales (ST) y sulfatos (Sulf) en agua de bebida sobre la degradabilidad ruminal de agropiro alargado (Thinopyrum ponticum). Se realizaron 6 ensayos repetidos en el tiempo utilizando licor ruminal de un novillo, cuya dieta consistió en heno de alfalfa (dieta A) o heno de alfalfa y pastura de gramíneas (dieta B). El agua de bebida se obtuvo de una aguada situada en el mismo potrero que el agropiro. El licor ruminal y el agropiro se incubaron a 39 °C en saliva {{artificial}} preparada con agua de bebida. Se evaluaron 6 tratamientos en balones con jeringas graduadas acopladas. Los balones contenían 60 mi de inoculo ruminal y 1 g de agropiro excepto en el tratamiento TI. Los tratamientos fueron TI: sin forraje; T 2 : control; T 3 : ST (3. 000 mg/ 1); T 4 : ST (7. 000 mg/ 1); T 5 : Sulf (1. 500 mg/ 1) y T 6 : Sulf (7. 000 mg/ 1). Las sales utilizadas fueron: sulfatos y cloruros de sodio, potasio, calcio y magnesio. Para estimar la degradabilidad ruminal del agropiro se evaluó la producción de gas en función del tiempo de incubación, midiéndose el gas que se acumulaba en las jeringas durante 50 h. También se registró el pH de los incubados de cada tratamiento al inicio y al final de los ensayos. Los datos fueron analizados mediante ANVA y comparados por test de Dunnett. Hubo efectos de bloque, tratamiento, hora, e interacciones hora x bloque y hora x tratamiento sobre la producción de gas (p The {{objective of}} this study was to find out the effect of high concentrations of total salts (ST) and sulphates (Sulf) in drinking water on the degradability of tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum). Six trials repeated at different moments using rumen fluid from a steer fed on either alfalfa hay (diet A) or alfalfa hay plus grass pasture (diet B) were performed. Drinking water was obtained from a watering place located in the same paddock of the pasture. Rumen fluid and tall wheatgrass were incubated at 39 °C in artificial saliva prepared with drinking water. Six treatments were evaluated in <b>flasks</b> fitted with <b>graduated</b> syringes. The <b>flasks</b> contained 60 ml of ruminal inoculum and 1 g of tall wheatgrass except in treatment 1 (Tl). Treatments were Tl: without forage; T 2 : control; T 3 : ST (3, 000 mg/ 1); T 4 : ST (7, 000 mg/ 1); T 5 : Sulf (1, 500 mg/ 1) y T 6 : Sulf (7, 000 mg/ 1). Salts used were: sulphates and chlorides of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. To estimate the ruminal degradability of tall wheatgrass, gas production as a function of incubation time was evaluated by measuring the gas accumulated in the syringes during 50 h. The pH of the incubates of each treatment at the beginning and at the end of the trials was also recorded. Data were analysed using AN OVA and means were compared using Dunnett's test. Effects of block (diet), treatment, hour, and interactions of hour x block and hour x treatment on gas production were detected (P < 0. 05). In both diets, A and B, ST 7. 000 was the treatment that most affected the degradative activity of rumen microorganisms, followed in diet A by Sulf 7. 000 and in diet B by ST 1. 500. Some significant differences of pH were found between treatments, and between initial and final values. It was concluded that high concentrations of salts, particularly of ST, decrease the degradative activity of rumen microbes after 50 h of digestio...|$|R
30|$|The sample {{preparation}} was conducted as previously described (Lachenmeier et al. 2006). In short, {{the sample was}} temperated in a water bath at 20  °C. Following this, the sample was pipetted into a 250  mL Kjeldatherm digestion tube. Rests of the sample sticking {{to the edge of}} the tube were rinsed down with distilled water. Subsequently the tube was clamped in the distillation device. After placing a <b>graduated</b> <b>flask</b> filled with 3  mL of distilled water under the distillate outlet tubing, the program was started, and the distillation was automatically performed while occasionally shaking the receiver flask. After termination, the receiver and the tube were replaced and the hoses were rinsed with distilled water to be ready for the next sample. The <b>graduated</b> <b>flask</b> with the distillate was shaken, temperated in a water bath at 20  °C and filled up to the calibration mark with water (20  °C) and again shaken. The shaking steps of the flask are absolutely essential because a considerably inhomogeneity of the solution has been observed following distillation, which may lead to errors up to 5  % vol if the solution is not carefully homogenized. An aliquot of the distillate (about 20  mL) was filled into glass vials placed into the autosampler and the alcoholic strength was automatically determined with the oscillation-type density meter. As alternative to pipetting, samples (temperated at 20  °C) may be filled in graduated flasks, followed by filling the content of the flask into the Kjeldatherm digestion tube. The residues in the flask then need to be carefully rinsed 3 times with distilled water into the Kjeldatherm digestion tube.|$|E
