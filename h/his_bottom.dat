5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean <b>his</b> <b>bottom</b> with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean <b>his</b> <b>bottom</b> with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E
5|$|He then struck 114 as {{his state}} {{defeated}} the tourists by an innings, {{and he made}} 40 and a duck as the Australians took the series lead in the Second Test. He made 70 and 71 in the Third Test loss in Sydney, {{one of the few}} players able to combat Lance Gibbs effectively, top-scoring in the first innings and second top-scoring in the second innings. He then made 65 in the second innings in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, where Australia held on by one wicket for a draw. He contributed 48 in the second innings of the Fifth Test as Australia appeared headed for a series victory. However, a late collapse ensued, and Australia scraped home by two wickets to take the series 2–1. O'Neill ended the series with 522 runs at 52.20. O'Neill gained attention during the summer for frequently losing his wicket by impulsively sweeping. This was attributed to the dominance of <b>his</b> <b>bottom</b> hand, which saw his bat swinging across the line of flight of the ball. Despite the criticism, he was {{at the peak of his}} international career, having made 1398 runs at 58.35 in his first 18 Tests.|$|E

25|$|Barks {{initially}} {{worked as}} an inbetweener. This involved being teamed and supervised {{by one of the}} head animators who did the key poses of character action (often known as extremes) for which the inbetweeners did the drawings between the extremes to create the illusion of movement. While an inbetweener, Barks submitted gag ideas for cartoon story lines being developed and showed such a knack for creating comical situations that by 1937 he was transferred to the story department. His first story sale was the climax of Modern Inventions, for a sequence where a robot barber chair gives Donald Duck a haircut on <b>his</b> <b>bottom.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smith is a {{right-handed}} batsman with {{a technique}} that has attracted attention for its unorthodoxy. He moves around frequently in the crease, controls the bat with <b>his</b> <b>bottom</b> hand (that is, the hand closest to the blade of the bat), and is capable of playing unconventional cricket shots like the reverse sweep. Playing in a club match in January 2010, right-handed Smith took guard left-handed and hit a six. Due to his unorthodox style, Smith was initially labelled as a limited-overs batsman who might struggle in the longer form of the game, especially {{early in his career}} when he was vulnerable outside off stump.|$|E
500|$|The Parents Television Council, a {{conservative}} media watchdog group and frequent critic of MacFarlane-produced programs, {{called on the}} Federal Communications Commission to investigate Family Guy after the episode aired, citing the scenes where Brian is talked into eating Stewie's feces and vomit. PTC president Tim Winter said that, [...] "Given the patently offensive depictions of one character eating excrement out of a diaper, then eating vomit, and finally licking the remaining excrement from a baby’s bottom – while the baby expresses physical gratification from having <b>his</b> <b>bottom</b> licked – {{we believe that the}} broadcast decency law has been broken. It seems as though Family Guy creator, Seth MacFarlane, carefully reviewed the legal definition of broadcast indecency and set out to violate it as literally as he could." [...] The Parents Television Council went on to name the episode as its [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week", ending the week of May 7, 2010, citing the extreme indecency of the episode.|$|E

500|$|Blunt's third studio album titled Some Kind of Trouble, was {{released}} on 8 November 2010. The album debuted at number four in the UK with over 100,000 copies sold in the first week. The album's first single [...] "Stay the Night" [...] {{was released}} on 27 October 2010. The single did much better in Europe than the UK, sitting at number two on the European Airplay Chart for five consecutive weeks, but only charting at number 37 in the UK top 40. The second single from the album, [...] "So Far Gone" [...] was released in the UK on 3 January 2011. The third single from the album, [...] "If Time Is All I Have" [...] was released in the UK on 4 April 2011. Overall critical reception has been mixed, with Allmusic saying, in a positive review, that [...] "Some Kind of Trouble {{is a step in}} the right direction for Blunt, a move toward love songs free of pretension" [...] whilst BBC Music felt [...] "When all's said, Some Kind of Trouble is not a terrible record by any means, but there's little sense that Blunt has advanced, and equally little sense that it'll make any difference to <b>his</b> <b>bottom</b> line." ...|$|E
500|$|Meteor Studios {{produced}} the roller-coaster and subway crashes, and Digital Dimension handled the individual post-premonition death scenes. The death of Ian McKinley, who is bisected by a cherry picker, was especially challenging. A clean plate of the bucket falling was originally {{shot with a}} plate of Lemche acting crushed and falling to the ground, with <b>his</b> <b>bottom</b> half in a partial green-screen suit. After setting those plates, Wong said that [...] "he wanted more of a gruesome punch for the shot". A standard CGI body of Lemche's height was used; several animation simulations of crushing the body with a CGI object were filmed, and the director picked the version he liked the most. A new plate was then filmed, with Lemche imitating the chosen animation and positioning his body at the end. The scene in which Ashley and Ashlyn are killed in tanning beds was handled by Soho VFX instead of Digital Dimension. It consisted of about 35 shots of CG skin, glass, fire and smoke mixed with live fire and smoke. For the subway crash in the film's epilogue, a CG environment reproducing the main volumes of the set was generated. The film was edited by Chris G. Willingham, the Emmy-winning editor of 24 (2001–2010).|$|E

Jews of Rome were required to swear yearly loyalty to the Pope at the Arch of Titus, which celebrates the Roman sack of Jerusalem of 70 CE. Each year, on the Campidoglio, the Rabbi had {{to pay homage to}} the chief of the city councillors ("Caporione"), receiving by him in exchange for it a kick to <b>his</b> <b>bottom.</b> This [...] "ceremony" [...] meant that the Jewish community had been allowed to stay one more year in Rome.|$|E

2500|$|Foreman's title {{challenge}} against Moorer {{took place}} on November 5 in Las Vegas, Nevada, with Foreman wearing the same red trunks he had worn in his title loss to Ali 20 years earlier. This time, however, Foreman was a substantial underdog. For nine rounds, Moorer easily outboxed him, hitting and moving away, while Foreman chugged forward, seemingly unable to [...] "pull the trigger" [...] on his punches. Entering the tenth round, Foreman was trailing on all scorecards. However, Foreman launched a comeback in the tenth round and hit Moorer {{with a number of}} punches. Then a short right hand caught Moorer on the tip of his chin, gashing open <b>his</b> <b>bottom</b> lip and he collapsed to the canvas. He lay flat on the canvas as the referee counted him out.|$|E
2500|$|Coloured Balls' second album, Heavy Metal Kid {{spawned the}} Top40 hit, [...] "Love You Babe" [...] in June 1974. Along with Thorpe, Madder Lake, Buster Brown and Chain, they were {{supported}} by suburban-based sharpie gangs. Coloured Balls had fully adopted the Melbourne 1970s sharpies' culture which included wearing chisel toed shoes, jeans, tight-fitting cardigans (expensive hand-made designs by Conti or Stag), crew-cut hair style with 'rats' tails' and most sported tattoos with a spider's web on the neck being popular. Their music was influenced by U.S. bands, MC5 and The Flamin' Groovies. Pubs and town halls became battlegrounds between rival sharpie gangs. Available venues became rare and media reports accused Loyde of encouraging the violence of some sharpies. Nick Ellenford, {{a member of the}} Heidelberg sharps, recalled [...] " [...] played with a cigarette stuck permanently to <b>his</b> <b>bottom</b> lip and always appeared to be drunk or stoned ... he casually walked behind a speaker midsong, threw up, then returned {{to the front of the}} stage without missing a beat". Coloured Balls disbanded at the end of 1974 and Loyde returned to solo work.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stories of}} their {{encounters}} with other celebrities also became fodder for the press; for example, in May 1997, at The Prince's Trust 21st anniversary concert, Mel B and Geri Halliwell breached royal protocol when they planted kisses on Prince Charles's cheeks, leaving it covered with lipstick, and later, Halliwell told him [...] "you're very sexy" [...] and also pinched <b>his</b> <b>bottom.</b> In November, the British Royal Family were considered {{fans of the}} Spice Girls, including The Prince of Wales and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry. That month, South African President Nelson Mandela said: [...] "These are my heroes. This {{is one of the}} greatest moments in my life" [...] in an encounter organised by Prince Charles, who said, [...] "It is the second greatest moment in my life, the first time I met them was the greatest". Prince Charles would later send Halliwell a personal letter [...] "with lots of love" [...] when he heard that she had quit the Spice Girls. In 1998 the video game magazine Nintendo Power created The More Annoying Than the Spice Girls Award, adding: [...] "What could possibly have been more annoying in 1997 than the Spice Girls, you ask?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{time after}} {{getting up and}} being {{attended}} to again by the aforementioned personnel, TV cameras showed a lingering shot of Foley smiling through his profusely bleeding mouth and lips, with a loose tooth hanging beneath his nose; the tooth having been knocked out due to being struck by the chair which had fallen through the cage and landed on his face, dislocating his jaw. Foley was actually trying to show a hole in <b>his</b> <b>bottom</b> lip by sticking his tongue through it, but {{it could not be}} seen clearly through his beard. The match continued for a while longer, ending with Foley receiving the Tombstone Piledriver after being slammed by The Undertaker onto hundreds of thumbtacks, which Foley himself had strewn onto the ring canvas. Although Foley lost, both wrestlers received a standing ovation for the match, and the event is often said to have jump-started Foley's main event career (Foley has said that although this match grew in legend, the reality was that his career remained [...] "somewhat sluggish" [...] for sometime afterwards until Foley further developed the Mankind character, and fans began to catch on). Many future matches attempted to replicate some of the spots from this match. In his autobiography Have a Nice Day! A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks, Foley wrote that he could not remember much of what happened, and he had to watch a tape of the match to write about it. The match was voted Pro Wrestling Illustrateds Match of the Year for 1998. Although many fans regard the match as a classic, it has generated controversy as well. Critics charge that the falls in the match were so extreme and they set the bar for further bumps so high that the inevitable attempts to equal or surpass them would be very dangerous for any wrestlers involved.|$|E
2500|$|Later that month, the Spice Girls won two Brit Awards for Best British Video, [...] "Say You'll Be There" [...] and Best British Single for [...] "Wannabe". The group {{performed}} [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] to {{open the}} 1997 Brit Awards, with Geri Halliwell wearing a Union Jack mini-dress that became one of pop history's most famed outfits. In March 1997, a double A-side of [...] "Mama"/"Who Do You Think You Are" [...] was released in Europe, the last from Spice, which once again saw them at number one, making the Spice Girls the first group in history since the Jackson 5 to have four consecutive number one hits. Girl Power!, The Spice Girls' first book and manifesto was launched later that month at the Virgin Megastore. It sold out its initial print run of 200,000 copies within a day, and was eventually translated into more than 20 languages. In April, Spicethe Official VideoVol. 1 was released; it sold 500,000 copies in the UK between April and June to become the best-selling pop video ever. In May, Spice World was announced by the Spice Girls at the Cannes Film Festival. The group also performed their first live British show, for the Royalty of Great Britain. At the show, they breached royal protocol when Mel B and then Geri Halliwell planted kisses on Prince Charles' cheeks and pinched <b>his</b> <b>bottom,</b> causing controversy. At the Ivor Novello Awards, the group won International Hit of the Year and Best-Selling British Single awards for [...] "Wannabe". In June 1997, Spice World began filming and wrapped in August. In September, the Spice Girls performed [...] "Say You'll Be There" [...] at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and won Best Dance Video for [...] "Wannabe". At the 1997 Billboard Music Awards the group won four awards; New Artist of the Year, Hot 100 Singles Group of the Year, Album Group of the Year, and Album of the Year for Spice.|$|E
