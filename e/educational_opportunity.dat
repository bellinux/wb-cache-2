5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second Intifada and the resulting decrease in tourism also affected the Christian minority, since they are the owners of many Bethlehem hotels and services that cater to foreign tourists. A statistical analysis of the Christian exodus cited lack of economic and <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity,</b> especially due to the Christians' middle-class status and higher education. Since the Second Intifada, 10% of the Christian population have left the city.|$|E
40|$|<b>Educational</b> <b>opportunities</b> {{determine}} the intergenerational mobility of human capital and {{are affected by}} institutional features of schooling systems. The aim {{of this paper is}} twofold. It intends to show how strongly student performance depends on student background as well as to explain cross-country differences in <b>educational</b> <b>opportunities</b> by decisive features of educational systems. For the latter, a two-step approach is combined with a difference-in-differences estimation in order to control for country-specific effects. The results show that <b>educational</b> <b>opportunities</b> decrease with student age in most countries. However, the attitude of parents seems to become more important while social origin becomes less important. Institutions are linked to <b>educational</b> <b>opportunities.</b> It can be shown that the institutional features of the schooling system as indicated by streaming and private schools, instruction time and school autonomy are related to different dimensions of <b>educational</b> <b>opportunities.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|The Boston Public Schools enroll 57,000 {{students}} attending 145 schools, including the renowned Boston Latin Academy, John D. O'Bryant School of Math & Science, and Boston Latin School. The Boston Latin School {{was established in}} 1635 and is the oldest public {{high school in the}} US. Boston also operates the United States' second-oldest public high school and its oldest public elementary school. The system's students are 40% Hispanic or Latino, 35% Black or African American, 13% White, and 9% Asian. There are private, parochial, and charter schools as well, and approximately 3,300 minority students attend participating suburban schools through the Metropolitan <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Council.|$|E
5|$|The 1902 Education Act {{also made}} it a legal {{requirement}} for the County Council to provide an equal <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity</b> for girls. A conference was held in October 1903 to discuss the founding of a girls' school, and by January 1905 Wisbech High School for Girls was established in Harecroft House on the North Brink. The house had been donated on a long-term lease for the purpose by the Peckover family. Harecroft House had been built in 1844 by Algernon Peckover, and his descendants {{lived in the house}} until the death of Susannah Peckover in 1903, after which it was left vacant. The first headmistress was Beatrice Sparks, who was the first woman to complete the Oxford Tripos in mathematics. New schoolrooms were added to the High School in 1906, 1913, 1922 and 1936, when a mixed-use gymnasium and hall was constructed. This hall was, until recently, used as the school dining room and will from 2017 be the school's library. Originally, the High School was also able to take boarders, which continued until after World War II.|$|E

During World War 2 labour {{recruiting}} efforts targeted youths from Taiwan (Formosa), then a Japanese territory, with promises of <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Though the target of 25,000 recruits was never reached, over 8,400 Taiwanese youths aged 12 to 14 relocated to Japan to help manufacture the Mitsubishi J2M Raiden aircraft.|$|E

25|$|There {{had already}} been some church {{activity}} in the area. A ten-month-old girl's 1831 burial is the oldest in the cemetery plots. Attendance books from that era kept by the Somers Historical Society suggest that Sunday school, {{an important part of}} Methodist ministry, had been held in West Somers starting as early as that year. For many local children it would be their only <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity,</b> as all other schools that existed at the time were too far away.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the rest}} of the 19th century the church was a {{cornerstone}} of the West Somers community, with itinerant ministers leading services {{in the absence of a}} pastor (according to the United Methodist Church, successor to the Methodist Episcopal Church, the church was never a recognized congregation within the larger denomination). Its Sunday school classes were for a long time the only <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity</b> available to area children. Members continued to be buried in the cemetery; more than half lived to be over 70, an unusually high number for that region and era.|$|E

25|$|Stracke was {{a figure}} in the Chicago School of Television, a style of early TV shows in the 1950s {{characterized}} by improvisational dialog and a variety show-like atmosphere. Along with Studs Terkel, Stracke was a cast member on Studs' Place. He played {{on one of the}} first sitcoms, Hawkins Falls, and gained national fame as Uncle Win on his children's program Animal Playtime (on NBC) and Time For Uncle Win. It was notable {{as one of the first}} children's programs that treated children's programming as an <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity</b> and not merely entertainment. This program also toured local schools.|$|E
25|$|Kean’s {{inclusive}} {{practice of}} government remains {{central to his}} legacy. This legacy found expression in his urban policies and outreach to traditional Democratic constituencies, his aggressive divestment of public retirement funds from South Africa, embrace of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day {{as an opportunity to}} raise awareness of race on a statewide basis, and his successful primary sponsorship of the bill that established the <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Fund. This fund appropriated $2 million for direct student aid and support programs for low-income students who demonstrated academic capability but lack sufficient preparation for college. It continues to serve disadvantaged New Jersey students nearly 50 years later. The fund’s longevity is indicative of Kean’s long-term outlook and the overall strength of his legislation.|$|E
25|$|The {{curtailment}} of busing in Milliken v. Bradley is one {{of several}} reasons that have been cited to explain why equalized <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity</b> in the United States has fallen short of completion. In the view of various liberal scholars, the election of Richard Nixon in 1968 meant that the executive branch was no longer behind the Court's constitutional commitments. Also, the Court itself decided in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez (1973) that the Equal Protection Clause allows — but does not require — a state to provide equal educational funding to all students within the state. Moreover, the Court’s decision in Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925) allowed families to opt out of public schools, despite “inequality in economic resources that made the option of private schools available to some and not to others”, as Martha Minow has put it.|$|E

500|$|The primary {{impetus for}} <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{came with the}} {{establishment}} of the American Ceylon Mission in Jaffna District, which started with the arrival in 1813 of missionaries sponsored by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. [...] The critical period of the missionaries' impact was from the 1820s to the early 20th century. During this time, they created Tamil translations of English texts, engaged in printing and publishing, established primary, secondary, and college-level schools, and provided health care for residents of the Jaffna Peninsula. American activities in Jaffna also had unintended consequences. The concentration of efficient Protestant mission schools in Jaffna produced a revival movement among local Hindus led by Arumuga Navalar, who responded by building many more schools within the Jaffna peninsula. Local Catholics also started their own schools in reaction, and the state had its share of primary and secondary schools. Tamil literacy greatly increased {{as a result of these}} changes. This prompted the British colonial government to hire Tamils as government servants in British-held Ceylon, India, Malaysia, and Singapore.|$|E
