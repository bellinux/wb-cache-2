40|$|The {{rare earth}} element (REE) {{geochemistry}} of cold, high pCO 2 <b>groundwaters</b> was studied in springs and boreholes in the Primorye region of the Russian Far East. The gas phase in these waters is dominated by mantle-derived CO 2 (up to 2. 6 atm.), being introduced to shallow <b>groundwaters</b> along major fault systems. The aggressive nature of these moderately acidic <b>groundwaters</b> has led to unusual trace element characteristics with high concentrations of relatively immobile elements such as Al, Be, heavy REEs and Zr. They are also marked by extremely high concentrations of Fe and Mn, up to 80 mg 1 − 1 and 4 mg 1 − 1, respectively. The REE patterns generally show enrichment in the middle to heavy REEs and low concentrations of the light REEs (La-Nd). Most <b>groundwaters</b> show relatively flat shale-normalised middle to heavy REE profiles, {{with the exception of}} Eu, which may form positive or negative anomalies depending on local mineralogy. A characteristic of many of the <b>groundwaters</b> is the presence of positive Sm-Eu anomalies. A range of potential ligands is present in the <b>groundwaters</b> and model calculations show that the dominant species are Ln 3 +, carbonate complexes (i. e., predominantly LnCO 3 +), and LnF 2 +. Concentrations of Cl− and SO 42 − are very low in most waters and nitrate and phosphate are below detection limit. The role of organic completing is not known due to lack of data, but such complexes may be important since limited TOC data show that organic contents may be high. The middle to heavy REE enrichment found in the <b>groundwaters</b> is consistent with dissolution of Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and release of adsorbed REE. Positive Eu anomalies in some <b>groundwaters</b> correlate with high Ca and Sr, pointing to control by plagioclase dissolution. High Y/Ho ratios and positive Y spikes on REY plots in high-F− waters suggest an important control by F− completing, which is confirmed by speciation calculations. Extreme enrichments in the heavy REEs are found in two groups of mineral waters with Yb/La ratios up to 9. 8. The extreme enrichments in heavy/light REEs present in these areas are too high to be simply controlled by speciation fractionation and it is suggested that a weathering phase with heavy REE enrichment is responsible. The source is suggested to be zircon, which typically displays such heavy REE enrichments. Although zircon is generally stable during low-temperature weathering, it is know to break down in acidic carbonated solutions. This is supported by high Zr concentrations (as well as high U, Be) in these <b>groundwaters</b> and a correlation between Zr and heavy REE enrichment...|$|R

The {{results show that the}} <b>groundwaters</b> from the oxidizing aquifer with high dissolved oxygen concentration (O 2) and oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) are enriched in U. The high U concentration of <b>groundwaters</b> {{may be due to the}} interaction between these oxidizing <b>groundwaters</b> and U ore bodies, which would result in U that is not in secular equilibrium. Uranium is re-precipitated as uraninite on weathered surfaces and organic material, forming localized ore bodies in the sandstone-hosted aquifer.

The 234 U/ 238 U AR generally increases with decreasing U concentrations in the <b>groundwaters,</b> suggesting that mixing of two water sources may occur in the aquifer.

Arsenic concentrations are low in the shallowest <b>groundwaters,</b> but increase at greater depths (40 – 70 m below ground level in Obuasi and 20 – 40 m in Bolgatanga). At depths greater than this, total As concentrations are relatively low. The lateral and vertical variations in dissolved As concentrations are controlled by ambient pH and redox conditions and by the relative influences of sulphide oxidation and sorption. In the weathered regolith and lateritic soils, oxidation has been extensive. Shallow <b>groundwaters</b> are oxidizing and acidic. Under these conditions, As is readily oxidized to As(V) and may precipitate as ferric arsenate or be sorbed onto ferric hydroxide surfaces. At greater depth, <b>groundwaters</b> have longer contact times with the aquifer minerals and pH values are therefore higher (> 6. 0 in Obuasi and > 6. 5 in Bolgatanga). The oxidation of sulphide minerals may proceed, but dissolved O is consumed during the process and mildly reducing conditions (Eh 200 – 300 mV) result. Sorption of As onto ferric hydroxide minerals is less favoured under such pH and redox conditions and the element is relatively mobile. At the greatest abstraction depths, <b>groundwaters</b> are more reducing (Eh ≤ 200 mV; dissolved O < 0. 1 mg 1 − 1) and few electron acceptors {{are available in the}} system to drive sulphide oxidation. Dissolved As concentrations therefore remain relatively low.
