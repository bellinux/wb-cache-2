The detailed analysis of the laws of the Russian Federation in conservation activity is presented; contradictions and shortcomings arerevealed. Ways of overcoming of theexisting formalcharacter of maintaining environmental safety in the Russian regions are offered. In particular, extension of insurance covering in the current law «On compulsory insurance of the civil liability of an owner of <b>dangerous</b> <b>installation</b> on the infliction of harm as a result of accident on dangerous installation» at the expense of inclusion in number of insurance risks of risk of environmental harm. The special attention in the article is paid to insurance of public liability of owners of chemical objects as the most dangerous to the environment. The methodology of actuarial expectation is added with a risk assessment of expert services {{with the use of a}} scoring method allowing evaluating real danger to the population and the environment by the chemicals, which are especially acting in small doses. Furthermore, the added calculation methodology of insurance tariffs allows using preventive function of insurance, not so popular in Russian practices. That gives a new source of financing of nature-conservative measures in the regio...|$|E

40|$|Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) is {{a complex}} task {{performed}} to quantify and minimize the hazards associated with the operation of potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>installations.</b> The QRA procedure can be subdivided into four main phases: 1) hazards identification; 2) frequency estimation; 3) accident consequence evaluation; 4) individual and societal risk calculation. This paper focuses {{on the first two}} phases. Hazard identification represents a fundamental activity: not identified hazards will remain hidden until the occurrence of the related accidents. Among the various available methodologies, HazOp is considered in this work. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is then applied to probabilistically quantify the hazardous states frequency to support decisions making on risk reduction. Unfortunately, FTA is a time consuming task, because of the general difficulty of extracting the necessary information from HazOp modules. To make FTA less expensive, the Recursive Operability Analysis (ROA) was defined. ROA is based on a procedure which allows collecting plant perturbations data in a structured way. At the end of the HazOp study, it is possible to systematically (automatically) construct all fault trees of interest. Following a critical study of ROA, some aspects have been improved, whereas for others alternative solutions have been defined. A new procedure, called ROA-CCD (Recursive Operability Analysis-Cause Consequence Diagrams), has been set up. The description of the ROA-CCD procedure, together with an example of application, makes up the content of this pape...|$|R

40|$|Reduction of doses around nuclear {{installations}} After 50 {{years since}} {{the foundation of the}} Nuclear Research Institute, Poland once more stands before the perspective of nuclear power plant (NPP) construction, this time with reactors of the 3 rd generation, provided with effective safety systems. But during the past half century many questions have been asked, and they must be answered if the society is to agree to nuclear power development. The basic question is: Are small radiation doses, typical for operation of NPPs and nuclear fuel cycle <b>installations,</b> <b>dangerous</b> for human beings? Until the middle of XX century it had been believed that radiation doses below a certain threshold do not involve health hazards, but on the contrary – enhance human health. However, in 1959 the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) adopted the hypothesis that any dose of radiation, however small, can result in cell damages and eventually lead to cancer. This approach helped to stop nuclear weapon testing, and was reflected in the principle that radiation doses should be reduced to the values as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). An example of the effects of thi...|$|R

Za prezentaciju se predlaže druga razvojana mijena, kojom je 1537. nadograđen treći kat. Kritički se analiziraju dosadašnji prijedlozi namjene i idejni projekti, posebno posljednji, kojim se predlaže neprimjerena reprezentativna namjena za potrebe Državnog protokola. Na kraju se predalaže onaj novi sadržaj koji će u najvećoj mogućoj mjeri poštovati najstarije građevinske strukture. The {{castle and}} great hall of Veliki Tabor are an {{important}} part of the Renaissance arhcitectural heritage of Continental Croatia. In 1502 King Ivan Corvinus granted land in Croatian Zagorje to his general Pavle Ratkaj, in gratitude for important services. The estate was divided between Pavle and his brother Benedict (castellan of the royal castle of Višegrad in 1511), who built Veliki Tabor which historical sources first mentioned in 1513. The castle was built on the elongated top of a gently slanting hill 333 metres high. In its centre is a pentagonal great hall built between 1502 and 1507, surrounded by a thick wall reinforced with four strong asymmetrically distributed towers, which were built shortly after the great hall. This was a time of great danger because of constant Turkish incursions and their conquest of much of Continental Croatia. For this reason the entire elongated top of the hill was surrounded with an outer curtain wall, and the lowest position which accesses the castle centre was reinforced with a pentagonal bastion. The author reports about the results of research into the pentagonal great hall. Originally it had three levels. Red and gray squares were painted on the edges of the facades, the cornice had painted red and gray triangles, and the corners on the outer side of the bay window had painted red, gray and white rhombi. The vaulted ground floor had an economic use while the first and second floor were residential. Privies were discovered on the first and second floor in the thickness of the north-western wall. The position of the original staircase was discovered, and a window with stone bars which was built up very early for reasons of static safety. The parts of stone frames of two more original windows, later reconstructed, were discovered in the north wall, traces of original paving, corner kitchen fireplaces, openings between the dining hall and kitchen, and so on. The top story was added in 1537, which is confirmed by the year painted on the facade beside the large semicircular opening built for a granary. This is indicated by the size of the opening and its positio at floor level, other characteristics of its original parts, and the discovery of large amounts of grains in the cracks between the outer wall and inside partitions. ln 1550 the large opening for grain was reconstructed, which is confirmed by a ceramic floor tile with the Renaissance portrait of a woman and the carved year. Somewhat later a Renaissance two-light window was built into the second floor. When immediate danger from the Turks stopped the third floor was reconstructed into a residential area, and three rows a close-set pillars were painted on the facades. In recent years there were ideas about transforming Veliki Tabor and turning it into something completely unsuited to its importance as a cultural monument. Two projects were made before conservationist research. The first project subjected everything to the arrangement of two two-room and eight one-room suites. The second planned for the castle, and some other premises to be used for the needs of state protocol. Both projects are dangerous because they call for considerable internal reconstruction, making new openings, a boiler house, and building in various kinds of installations. There are proposals to place old Zagorje wooden peasant houses intended for rural tourism on the as yet untouched hill slopes - which are at the foot of the monument and make up its composite part. The realization of these projects should certainly be prevented, and a solution found that will maximally protect the original structure and area of Veliki Tabor. Research gave sufficient data to reconstruct the second, best preserved and most important stage in the development of the great hall. Therefore the presentation of the second developmental stage is suggested, and the arrangement of a museum in the renewed and partly reconstructed areas. The museum in the great hall would display how and where people lived in the 16 " 2 ̆ 7 century. One of the difficulties is the lack of original furniture and furnishings, and it has been suggested to exhibit high-quality copies of furniture from that period that is kept in central-European museums, which would be clearly indicated in writing beside the exhibits. Similarly 16 century stoves found in other Croatian castles could be reconstructed and used for heating the rooms (with wood) to avoid introducing <b>dangerous</b> central heating <b>installations.</b> In general all modern installations should be avoided in the great hall. In the rest of Veliki Tabor, the walls and towers that have not yet been researched, should be turned into a museum showing visitors how Croatia was definded trom the Turks in the decisive 16 century...|$|R
