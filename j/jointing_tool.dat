40|$|Abstract. A 4 inch {{drill pipe}} {{assembly}} {{has been developed}} {{that can be used}} for drilling 6 inch diameter holes. Normally, 6 inch diameter holes are drilled with 3 - 1 / 2 inch pipe with 4 - 3 / 4 inch OD <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> because the <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> for 4 inch pipe are too large. In most cases, the pipe size is based on the strength balance between the pipe and <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> and 5 inch or 5 - 1 / 4 inch OD <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> are usually welded to 4 inch pipe. A 5 inch OD <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> is too large for an overshot in a 6 inch diameter hole. A 4 inch drill pipe assembly with a 4 - 3 / 4 inch OD <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> has been developed that can be used in 6 inch diameter holes. Four inch pipe has a number of advantages over 3 - 1 / 2 inch pipe such as more torsional and tensile strength and improved hydraulics. Less pump flow is required for the same annular velocity and there is a lower pressure loss in the pipe. This paper will discuss:! The pipe development program. !

40|$|Drill-pipe <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> in {{extended}} reach wells often {{suffer a}} shear failure. In view of this, an ultra-high torque double-shoulder pipe joint was designed {{according to the}} deformation compatibility relation of the drill-pipe <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> under torque. It is structurally characterized by long primary and secondary shoulders, small thread taper and large fillet radius of bottom tooth. First, a 3 D numerical simulation model was established {{for this type of}} joint, named the XSJ joint here, based on the principle of virtual work, the Von Mises yield criterion and the nonlinear contact theory. Second, orthogonal optimization was performed on its key structural parameters by means of the orthogonal optimization method. The optimal combination of key structural parameters of the XSJ joint is taper 1 : 16, thread pitch 6. 55  mm, guiding surface angle 29 °, bearing surface angle 28 °, and tooth height 3. 755  mm. Finally, the bearing performance and fatigue performance of this <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> and the API <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> were calculated and compared using the Simulia Abaqus fe-safe software. Compared with the API <b>tool</b> <b>joint,</b> the XSJ joint is better, and its tensile strength, torsion strength, bending strength and compression strength increase by 10. 65 %, 62. 5 %, 2. 75 % and 52 %, respectively. Its tension compression fatigue life, bending fatigue life, torsion fatigue life and composite fatigue life increase by 1. 19 times, 1. 74 times, 550 times and 28. 79 %, respectively. It is concluded that the designed XSJ joint is significantly improved in term of torsion capacity while its tension strength, bending strength and compression strength are not decreased, so it can better meet the drilling conditions of extended reach wells.

40|$|AbstractA long drillstring {{consists}} of numerous of diameter changes, {{where the most}} frequent is the change due to <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> for every pipe length. In the upper wellbore sections, were the annular clearance are wide, are the small diameter changes due to <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> most likely negligible. When drilling the lower wellbore sections and in slim hole drilling, the annular clearance is decreased, thus the geometric changes could affect the hydraulic pressure loss. For the purpose of maintaining wellbore pressure control, the ability to accurately estimate hydraulic pressure loss along the wellbore is essential. By investigating the different segments affecting the fluid flow downstream the mud pump, separately and in combination, {{it is possible to}} gain a greater knowledge of hydraulic pressure loss. Increased wellbore control ensures a safer operation, but also a more effective operation, with regard to controlled equivalent circulation density and thus rate of penetration. The main goal in this thesis was to investigate and quantify the contribution to pressure of sequenced <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> in the string. By building a small scaled lab, experiments were conducted {{in order to determine the}} relative difference with and without <b>tool</b> <b>joints,</b> verify existing models and suggest alternative approaches for calculation of the additional pressure drop. Additionally the thesis focus on the impact of on-set of turbulence and its effect on pressure loss, hence the calculation and prediction. Contraction and enlargement in a borehole causes fluid acceleration, deceleration and kinetic energy loss in the mud. Once an obstacle in the well changes the velocity gradients in the mud, the boundary layer is affected, eddies are formed and local or fully turbulent flow regime can occur. By introducing the gradual contraction and enlargement due to <b>tool</b> <b>joints,</b> the velocity gradient in the mud is altered and an additional pressure drop is introduced. The different experiments were carried out with the same base-fluid, applying different concentration of polymers for the purpose of increasing the viscosity. In total four different combinations of the inner steel pipe were planned tested, utilizing one Newtonian fluid and three non-Newtonian fluids. Based on the experiments conducted some findings can be highlighted:?	In all tests the presence of <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> increased the hydraulic pressure loss, also in the laminar region. The highest enhanced pressure loss registered due to <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> was 90 %?	Once <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> are included in the string the on-set of turbulence is strongly shifted towards lower flow rates, which none of the tested models are able to account for. ?	The presence of <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> in the string introduces a pressure loss equivalent to a rough obstruction in the annular clearance. ?	Both modification and the alternative suggested approach, yields more accurate results in the estimation of hydraulic pressure loss with <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> than the exiting model. The investigation of the previously suggested models and approaches, showed various results in estimation of the additional pressure drop due to <b>tool</b> <b>joints.</b> Only when applying the lowest viscosity, one of the model suggested by Enfis et al. (2011) showed satisfying results for <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> correction. Increasing the viscosity of the mud, none of the existing models comprehended with the measured values, due to overestimation of the pressure in the laminar region and estimation of on-set of turbulence. Three alternative methods have been suggested, of which two have been investigated in depth. The first one presents a modification of the model suggested by Enfis et al (2011). Applying the new suggested modification of the model, the discrepancy between the measured and the calculated pressure drop were decreased in the turbulent regime, but still with overestimated values in the laminar regime. In the second suggested approach, a regression factor representing increased friction, was presented. By calculating an the frictional enhancement as a function of Reynolds number it was possible to predict a more accurate pressure loss in the higher viscosity range. The regression factor was based on the same principle as Blasius, Moore and Moody in their estimation of pressure loss in pipes with varying surface roughness. The downside of applying a regression approach is the need for continuous experimental investigation in order to create a database based on geometry, annular clearance and fluid rheology. </p...|$|R
