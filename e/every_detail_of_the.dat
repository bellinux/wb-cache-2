5|$|As a mother, Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically a mother to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies. This was particularly evident in June 1880 when shortly {{after the birth of}} their first child Sybil, Rosebery wished to visit Germany for three months, to take a cure at a German spa (he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown). His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly aware of his wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured <b>every</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she never complained at the forced separation.|$|E

Ceremonies concerning the birth and the rites of passage of the child was performed within the walls of the Inner Court. The birth of a royal child was first announced by a succession of women who proclaimed the news along the Inner Court's streets. There were two waiting orchestras, one on the inside made of women and one on the outside of men, who would then carry out the official proclamation with conch shell fanfares. If the child was a prince the Gong of Victory was to be struck three times. The children would live with their respective mothers and be educated in special schools within the court.|$|E
5|$|RPGs {{can suffer}} {{in the area}} of exploration. Traditional RPGs {{encourage}} exploration of <b>every</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game world, and provide for a more organic experience in which NPCs are distributed according to the internal logic of the game world or plot. Action games reward players for quick movement from location to location, and tend to ensure that no obstacles occur along the way. Games such as Mass Effect streamline the player's movements across the game world by indicating which NPCs can be interacted with, and by making it easier for players to find locations and shopkeepers who can exchange items for money or goods. Some of the best characteristics of RPGs can be lost when these road blocks are eliminated in the name of streamlining the player's experience.|$|E

Several press conferences were held {{in the days following}} Earnhardt's death. After driver Sterling Marlin and his relatives received hate mail and death threats from angry fans, Waltrip and Earnhardt Jr. absolved him of any responsibility. Richard Childress made a public pledge that the number 3 would never again adorn the side of a black race car with a GM Goodwrench sponsorship.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, proposals to begin regulation of the whale hunt began to reach the Faroese legislature. On 4 June 1907, the Danish Governor (in Faroese: amtmaður), as well as the sysselmann (sheriff), sent the first draft for whaling regulations to the Office of the Exchequer in Copenhagen. In the following years, a number of drafts were debated, and finally in 1932 the first Faroese whaling regulations were introduced. As a part of the home rule act of 1948, fishing and hunting (such as whaling) laws and regulations are now governed by the Faroese Parliament. Since then, <b>every</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pilot whale hunt has been carefully defined in the regulations. This means that the institution of the pilot whale hunt, which had previously largely been based on tradition, became an integrated part of society’s legal structure.

500|$|At {{the heart}} of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill {{conceived}} this as a job for women only.

At first Hill believed, [...] "Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers." [...] Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce. Her system required a large staff. Rent was collected on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Rent accounts were balanced in the afternoons and arrangements were made with contractors for repairs. On Thursdays and Fridays arrears were pursued, contractors' invoices paid, new tenancy lettings and tenants' moves organised.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Briskin had gained a {{reputation}} of being a very thrifty producer. However, he was also known for putting {{the quality of the}} product over saving money. Joseph Walker, the cinematographer for the 1931 film Dirigible, directed by Frank Capra, explained why the film had not used stock footage of blimps, which would have been much less expensive: , the studio's general manager, who personally supervised the making of the picture, and who is perhaps more keenly exacting in the matter of getting a full dollar's worth of production for every dollar spent than any other executive in the business, was wise enough to see that an otherwise superlative production would fall flat if such scenes were made [...] "merely adequate".

500|$|Kurtzman {{recruited}} his long-time collaborator Will Elder {{to work on}} the strip's illustrations. He {{suggested to}} Elder an [...] "outlineless", painted style, then thought the strip would be better suited by an India inked, outlined comic book style with flat color behind it. Hefner, whose opinion prevailed, preferred the more difficult, fully painted, outlineless look. Kurtzman's suggestions for the feature's name included The Perils of Zelda, The Perils of Irma, and Little Mary Mixup; he settled on Little Annie Fanny, its title and logo a parody of Harold Gray's Little Orphan Annie. The cartoonist began submitting story ideas for the multi-page comic strip to Hefner for approval. Over the twenty-six years he wrote the character, he was allowed (with Playboy substantial budget) to travel for research, photography, and sketching. He followed this with a preliminary script for Hefner, who revised it. Kurtzman then worked out the story's composition, pacing, and action in thumbnail drawings and pencil roughs of each page of the comic, followed by larger, more-detailed layouts on translucent vellum specifying lighting, color, and speech balloon placement. These also required Hefner's approval—a typical two- to seven-page episode would take as many as nine pages of layout. Kurtzman then discussed the layout with Elder, who drove from his home in New Jersey to Kurtzman's in New York. Kurtzman acted out <b>every</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strip; according to Elder, [...] "He would change his voice and take on the characteristics of each role... We'd crack each other up and fall down laughing." [...] This gave Elder what he needed to create the penciling, including [...] "eye pops" [...] (background gags worked into blank areas of Kurtzman's layout; Hefner rejected many, so Elder created as many as possible) and the final rendering. Elder painted in oil, tempera, and watercolor, never using ink. Beginning with a white illustration board, Elder explained he would [...] "pile on" [...] his oil paint, light colors over dark, then apply tempera, then layer several watercolor washes to give Annie luminous tones. [...] "The colors were like gems to me," [...] he said. [...] "I worked very hard to give them iridescence." [...] The work was labor-intensive and deadlines were often difficult to meet, so other artists, including Russ Heath, Arnold Roth, Jack Davis, Al Jaffee, Frank Frazetta, and Paul Coker, were occasionally enlisted to help finish the art. Jaffee, a childhood friend of Elder, said about the experience: [...] "Little Annie Fannie was the most unique, lavishly produced cartoon cum illustration feature ever. Each panel was a miniature masterpiece that Willie glazed and re-glazed in brilliant watercolor until he reached the level of 3-D-like translucence that he wanted. I know from first-hand experience what went into this project." [...] Letterers inked the dialog balloons before Kurtzman cleaned and submitted the finished work. Little Annie Fanny, [...] first comic strip, was the first multi-page comics feature in a major American magazine.|$|E
