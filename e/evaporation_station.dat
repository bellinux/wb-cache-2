The considered network {{is composed of}} dynamic neurons, which contain inner feedbacks. This network {{can be used as}} a part of fault diagnosis system to generate residuals. Classical optimisation techniques, based on back propagation idea, suffer from many well–known drawbacks. Two stochastic algorithms are tested as training algorithms to overcome these difficulties. Efficiency of proposed learning methods is checked on two examples: modelling of an unknown linear dynamic system basing on simulated data and modelling of the actuator behaviour in the first section of the <b>evaporation</b> <b>station</b> in the Sugar Factory, Lublin using real data measurements. In these two significant examples, the stochastic learning algorithms are extensively compared from many different perspectives...|$|E

There are several {{studies that have}} analysed the changing pattern of climatic variables at a global scale as well as regional scale in Australia. It is suggested from the recent studies that trend analysis of climatic variables should be performed at the catchment scale rather than at a global or regional scale as the trends and their effects may vary from one location to another.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} on pan evaporation rates were studied at the Davis County Experimental Watershed near Farmington, Utah, by operating a network of 12 class A <b>evaporation</b> <b>stations</b> on the watershed {{during the summer months}} of 1962 through 1966. Standard Weather Bureau observations on a daily basis were obtained from a total of 17 different sites representing widely idverse topography with a vertical range of 4, 630 feet. Deviations from mean relations with elevation on monthly values of observed meteorological factors were found {{to be related to the}} type of exposure. Dewpoint observations on different slopes were found to be related not only to the differences in station exposure but also to the stability of the air and direction of the upper air flow. Two commonly-used methods for estimating monthly pan evaporation were found to be within 3 and 6 percent ofobserved values from the mountain area. Estimates of daily pan evaporation using the mass transfer equations derived from the Lake Hefner and Lake Mean water-loss investigations were found to over-estimate and under-estimate for different types of exposures. The errors in the daily estimates were related to the type of exposure and stability indices. Revised mass transfer equestions were found to correlate well with daily and 2 -hourly pan evaporation rates when type of exposure was considered. Further improvement was obtained in the reliability of the mass transfer equestions when the daily data were segregated on the basis of the diretion and speed of the 700 -millibar lelvel wind. Pan evaporation for the network stations for open locatiosn on top of major ridges and along their southern slopes and on sites subject to strong night time drainage winds were found to have no discernable variation with elevation. For protected sites and those on northern slopes, pan evaporation showed a small decrease with increasin gelevation. The effect of elevation (atmosphere pressure) independently on evaporation rates was investigated through the use of data from stations where the other meteorological factors involved, other than pressure, were the same.

40|$|The {{conversion}} coefficients of free water surface evaporation were investigated. Comparisons were made between numerous evaporation tanks (pans) and a 20 m(2) evaporation tank. Based on 6 years of evaporation data collected at Nansihu Lake <b>Evaporation</b> <b>Station</b> in Shandong Province, China, the following {{results have been}} obtained. First, {{conversion coefficients}} varied according to the evaporator type. The average yearly conversion coefficient was only 0. 60 for phi 20 evaporator (an evaporation pan with a diameter of 20 cm), whereas it was about 1. 07 for the E 601 's pan, whose rim was about 7. 5 cm above ground. Second, the conversion coefficient changes within a year had the same pattern among the evaporators evaluated. The monthly conversion coefficients had the minimum values in March or April, then increased with time, and reached their maximum values in August or September. After September, the conversion coefficients varied in different directions with time. Third, the conversion coefficients changed from year to year, but their variations between maximum and minimum values were between 0. 06 and 0. 16. Fourth, the installation modes, structures, and composition of the evaporators affected the evaporation amount. Fifth, the conversion coefficients at Nansihu and Yucheng stations for the same evaporator did not show a distinct difference. The E 601 evaporator has almost the same conversion coefficients at six of seven stations spanning almost 20 degrees in latitude from northern to southern China. Sixth, the yearly evaporation from a 100 m(2) evaporation tank was almost {{the same as that}} from the 20 m(2) evaporation tanks; however, the differences still existed in any given month.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{suitability}} of using a hydrological model to predict the impact of future catchment changes on the surface water resources of tropical West African catchments, {{as a basis for}} sustainable watershed management strategies. The economically-important but data-poor Densu Basin (2100 km 2) in Ghana is used as a case study. Prior to the identification of an appropriate model, a range of model selection criteria to achieve the research objectives were developed, which included minimum data requirements. Following a review of available models, the ACRU hydrological model was chosen using these selection criteria. As this is the first use of the ACRU model in the Tropics, a sensitivity analysis was performed {{to gain a better understanding}} of the correspondence between the data and the physical processes being modelled and to inform future data collection priorities. The most sensitive parameters identified were rainfall; soil water content at field capacity and monthly crop coefficients. The sensitive parameters were different from those previously identified for semi arid regions, thereby improving the wider understanding of the behaviour of the ACRU model in a new climatic region of Africa for future studies. Although the ACRU model performed well during calibration (e. g. Nash and Sutcliff Efficiency > 0. 8), it performed poorly during the validation period (e. g. NSE < 0. 5). Aggregation of the daily output to monthly averages improved the performance appraisal statistics to a level where the model is appropriate for longer term water management issues such as irrigation planning and water supply planning. However, the prediction of the hydrological consequences of future catchment changes using the model could not be performed due to the variable model performance. A detailed analysis of input data quality and model performance identified a number of contributory reasons which included the poor distribution of available data from rain gauges and <b>evaporation</b> <b>stations,</b> poor data management and problems with groundwater processes within ACRU. Recommendations to the Densu River Basin Management Board to address the main problem area of data quality include ensuring that all data (new as well as existing) is subject to QC/QA procedures, the development of data archiving / back-up systems, making historical data available to the wider hydrological community; and guidance on deriving model inputs from available data for future modellers. Finally recommendations on which areas need further study during future research using the ACRU model are given. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{world is}} {{undergoing}} rapid {{changes and the}} future is uncertain. The changes are related to modification of the landscape due to human activities, such as large and small scale irrigation, afforestation and changes to the climate system. Understanding and predicting hydrologic change {{is one of the}} challenges facing hydrologists today. Part of this understanding can be developed from observed data, however, there often too few observations and those that are available are frequently affected by uncertainties. Hydrological models have become essential tools for understanding historical variations of catchment hydrology and for predicting future possible trends. However, most developing countries are faced with poor spatial distributions of rainfall and <b>evaporation</b> <b>stations</b> that provide the data used to force models, as well as stream flow gauging stations to provide the data for establishing models and for evaluating their success. Hydrological models are faced with a number of challenges which include poor input data (data quality and poorly quantified human activities on observed stream flow data), uncertainties associated with model complexity and structure, the methods used to quantify model parameters, together with the difficulties of understanding hydrological processes at the catchment or subbasin. Within hydrological modelling, there is currently a trend of dealing with equifinality through the evaluation of parameter identifiability and the quantification of uncertainty bands associated with the predictions of the model. Hydrological models should not only focus on reproducing the past behaviour of a basin, but also on evaluating the representativeness of the surface and subsurface model components and their ability to simulate reality for the correct reasons. Part of this modelling process therefore involves quantifying and including all the possible sources of uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis has become the standard approach to most hydrological modelling studies, but has yet to be effectively used in practical water resources assessment. This study applied a hydrological modelling approach for understanding the hydrology of a large Tanzanian drainage basin, the Great Ruaha River that has many areas that are ungauged and where the available data (climate, stream flow and existing water use) are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. The Great Ruaha River (GRR) is an upstream tributary of the Rufiji River Basin within Tanzania and covers an area of 86 000 km 2. The basin is drained by four main tributaries; the Upper Great Ruaha, the Kisigo, the Little Ruaha and the Lukosi. The majority of the runoff is generated from the Chunya escarpment, the Kipengere ranges and the Poroto Mountains. The runoff generated feeds the alluvial and seasonally flooded Usangu plains (including the Ihefu perennial swamp). The majority of the irrigation water use in the basin is located where headwater sub‐basins drain towards the Usangu plains. The overall objective was to establish uncertain but behavioural hydrological models that could be useful for future water resources assessments that are likely to include issues of land use change, changes in patterns of abstraction and water use, as well the possibility of change in future climates...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (DScAgric) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2010. The {{focus of}} the {{research}} is on investigations of various methods for obtaining sensible heat flux (H) for estimating evaporation. The key for this approach is {{the application of the}} shortened energy balance equation, {{and in the case of}} methods based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), such as surface-layer scintillometrv and temperature variance with adjusted for stability using air temperature skewness, and surface renewal (SR), die iterative procedures. The application of the shortened energy balance requires that errors associated with measurement of net irradiance (Rnet) and soil heat flux (S) are kept to a minimum To this end. methodology for the calibration of net radiometers for both the infrared and short wave irradiances receive attention. A field study attempts to quantify the error in soil heat flux measurement for a mesic grassland. A standard, convenient and accurate method for calibrating net radiometers would assist in unravelling reasons for the perplexing lack of surface energy balance closure when employing the eddy covariance (EC) flux estimation method as well as improve on the accuracy of the energy balance residual method for estimating evaporation. A relatively inexpensive, accurate and quick laboratory method, based on physical theory, for non-steady radiative conditions above a large water-heated or water-cooled radiator containing circulated water, with surface-embedded thermocouples is used to obtain reproducible net radiometer calibration factor's for the infrared waveband for a wide range in net irradiance. When applied, the method would reduce error m the most important term of the shortened energy balance and assist in energy balance closure aspects of EC measurements. The SLS method, reliant on MOST, is used for estimating a really-averaged H for a mesic grassland for a 30 -month period. Comparisons with EC measurements feature prominently in this unique study. These comparisons include using different MOST procedures and the influence of the Bowen ratio on SLS measurement: of if is investigated. Furthermore, since there are reports in the literature that the EC method may underestimate H and or latent energy flux (LE), resulting in the shortened energy balance not being closed, effort is devoted to this aspect. Other methods used for comparison purposes are the traditional Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB), SR, TV and ETo (grass reference) methods. The TV and SLS and/or EC measurements of H are compared above three contrasting canopy surfaces. It is shown that other high frequency air temperature-based methods, for example, for the first time the TV method with adjustment for skewness, may pave the way for <b>evaporation</b> <b>stations</b> from which real-time and sub-hourly estimates may be obtained relatively inexpensively. Another area of research that receives attention is the placement height of EC instruments above short-canopy surfaces and a spectral analysis of the vertical wind speed and some temperature measurement: for close-canopv placement heights. The SR method is used to estimate, for the first time, open-water evaporation. The ideal SR method applied above canopies is the most inexpensive micrometeorological method for estimating H, but the SR weighting factor a needs to be determined using EC and for this reason, the TV method with adjustment for skewness was investigated. Finally, a unique implementation of SR uses an iterative method for calculating H. A similar iterative procedure is applied for MOST and ETo calculations...|$|R

The reservoir simulation model storage amounts were calculated for 1998 - 2008 using measured values of rainfall and <b>evaporation</b> (reservoir <b>station</b> no. 61), reservoir inflow, release, seepage, spill, and Muda reservoir inflow. The developed reservoir simulation model results simulated well with the mean monthly observed long-term storage amounts (1998 - 2008), except for a few months where the model storages are found relatively higher than the observed storage amounts. A stage-storage curve is plotted using the monthly observed values of storage and water level from 1998 - 2008 to covert water level into storage and vice versa. The first order Markov model with periodicity and Log-Pearson Type III distribution are considered to generate storage amounts to compare with the mean monthly observed storages, and hence to forecast future storage with reliability. The first order Markov model generated and observed mean storage amounts were compared for each month. The comparison results imply that the monthly statistical parameters of the historic record, except the lag 1 serial correlation between December and January months (i. e., over-year monthly correlations), are preserved satisfactorily. The storage amounts are forecasted for year 2009 - 2015 to be used in future reservoir operation, using first order Markov model.

However, the Priestley–Taylor model was only able to yield a fair estimation of the reference evapotranspiration during some periods of the growing season even though the soil moisture effect is integrated into the Priestley–Taylor parameter (Li et al. 2011). Meanwhile, care should be taken when applying the Priestley–Taylor equation in the semiarid climate in north China. Temporally, {{it can be used}} in July and August and at daily time scale in these 2  months, but unsatisfactorily in other months and at yearly time scale (Xiaoying and Erda 2005). Furthermore, Ye et al. (2009) showed that the Priestley–Taylor method was more suitable for Tibetan Plateau {{in the absence of the}} parameters necessary for the calculation of the FPM. In the other research, Rojas and Sheffield (2013) showed that the radiation-based equations tended to underestimate by as much as 10  %, whereas the temperature-based Hargreaves model overestimated by 8  % during the growing season.|$|R
