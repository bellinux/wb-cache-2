5|$|Boyars {{could no}} longer be {{executed}} without the knowledge and approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, if convicted for treason, their fortunes {{could no longer}} be confiscated. Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said in a conversation with the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 2011, Ian Thorpe {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> {{to qualify for}} the 2012 Olympics in London. Thorpe's major focus was the 100m and 200m freestyle at 2012's trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. He would not swim the 400m, claiming he would not have enough time to build up endurance for that event. This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps.|$|E

5|$|After the Olympics, Zersenay {{returned}} to Eritrea and trained {{for one month}} {{to prepare for the}} 2008 World Half Marathon Championships in Rio de Janeiro. He won his third consecutive title over the half marathon distance with ease, taking the lead early on and beating the second-placed Patrick Makau Musyoki by almost two minutes. His success caused much celebration in his home country, {{so much so that the}} President of Eritrea greeted him at the airport upon his return. With a strong history in the half marathon, Zersenay announced <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> the full marathon distance the following season.|$|E
5|$|Before the season, Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri {{remarked that}} Del Piero would have {{as good a}} season, or an even better one, than the {{previous}} term. In August 2008, Del Piero announced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> to keep playing professional football with Juventus until he turned 40. Juventus were drawn into the same Champions League group as Real Madrid, and UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg. Del Piero marked Juventus's return to the competition with a match-winning free kick to seal a home win against Zenit. On 21 October, Del Piero netted a notable goal as Juventus defeated Real Madrid 2–1 in Turin, scoring with a first-time, curling strike from distance, in the fifth minute of play.|$|E
5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Ebbo, [...] "he {{meant to}} intercede for Wildschloss--it might be <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>tried</b> his power. No, for {{that he is}} too generous. How looked Wildschloss, mother?" ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the season}} Mike Hamar was introduced, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> often <b>try</b> to help Red around the lodge, but with humorously {{disastrous}} results due to mis-communications or Mike trying to imitate Red's corner cutting shortcuts.|$|R
5|$|Freed, Desha left Kentucky, {{traveling}} {{down the}} Ohio and Mississippi rivers. According to legend, {{he attempted to}} rob a flatboat skipper near Vicksburg, Mississippi. It happened the skipper was a longtime acquaintance of Desha, named G. W. Crawford. Crawford recognized Desha and asked why <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> to rob him. Desha confessed {{that he had been}} living as an outlaw since his father's pardon. Crawford urged Desha to abandon his illegal activities and offered to give him free passage to New Orleans, Louisiana. Desha accepted, telling Crawford that he planned to travel on to a distant place, assume a new name, and seek a fresh start.|$|E
5|$|In October 1980, he {{interacted with}} a {{delegation}} of Solidarity members that included Lech Wałęsa, future President of the Third Republic of Poland. When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> to give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981. That month, the government declared that the poor economy was forcing it {{to cut back on}} its promise of ensuring that Polish workers did not have to work on Saturdays, and that it would offer a number of Saturdays as work-free instead.|$|E
5|$|On a dare, Antonucci {{then decided}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> {{producing}} a children's animated series of his own. While designing a commercial, {{he ended up}} drawing three characters that he felt particularly pleased with. Growing excited over their potential, he named them Ed, Edd, and Eddy and spent the following months developing a show around them. He faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both studios quickly responded, Cartoon Network in only 20 minutes, and were enthusiastic and wanted to see more; they each demanded creative control, however, and Antonucci refused. After Cartoon Network agreed to let Antonucci have control of the show, conversations between Antonucci and the studio continued.|$|E

5|$|The result kept Burton in {{the lead}} of the Drivers' Championship with 5,763 points, ahead of Kenseth on 5,718. Harvick moved into third with 5,674, {{thirteen}} points ahead of Martin who fell to fourth. Earnhardt moved in front of Hamlin for fifth, and Johnson, Kahne and Kyle Busch filled positions seven to nine. After the race, Jeff Gordon (who fell to tenth) said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> and win races to return to contention for the championship. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet maintained the lead with 237 points. Dodge remained in second with 189, six points ahead of Ford. The race took three hours, forty-seven minutes and twenty-nine seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 1.624 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed {{had decided}} to {{construct}} a fortress {{in what is now}} Elbasan which would provide a perennial base for future Ottoman assaults on Skanderbeg's domains. The fortress especially worried Venice since Elbasan was constructed {{on the banks of the}} Shkumbin River which would allow the Ottomans to send ships into the Adriatic and threaten Venetian colonies. Seeing that his situation had become unfavorable, Skanderbeg made a trip to Italy where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> to convince Pope Paul II and Ferdinand I of Naples to give him aid for his war. Despite many promises from the pope, Skanderbeg received little due to the fear of a Neapolitan war with Rome and infighting in the Roman Curia. Ferdinand and the Republic of Venice likewise deferred Skanderbeg's requests to the pope. By the time he left Italy, the League of Lezhë had been weakened and needed his intervention.|$|E
5|$|Washington again {{proposed}} to assault Boston in October, but his officers {{thought it best}} {{to wait until the}} harbor had frozen over. In February, when the water had frozen between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> an assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. He had not yet learned how completely he could trust in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E

50|$|For a time {{it seemed}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be <b>tried</b> for perjury. The accusations had a devastating effect on his {{political}} career, leading eventually {{to the loss of}} his parliamentary seat (Chelsea) in the 1886 UK general election.|$|R
60|$|Stannard hesitated. He had {{not used}} his {{daughter}} for an innocent accomplice, and had she married Jimmy <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>tried</b> {{to free the}} lad from his entanglements. Now, if she loved Frank, he must not embarrass her.|$|R
5|$|To placate the Yankees' {{concerns}} about his durability, Rivera followed a {{strength and conditioning}} program in the offseason, instead of throwing. Torre said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> to reduce Rivera's workload during the 2003 season to minimize the injury risk to his closer. However, Rivera suffered a groin injury before the season began, causing him to miss the first month. After returning on April 30, he pitched well in the season's first half, saving 16games in 17opportunities. His save on June 12 against the St. Louis Cardinals secured the 300th career win for starter Roger Clemens. Rivera slumped {{early in the second}} half; over one stretch, he blew five of eleven save opportunities, but he rebounded to convert his final 15 of the season. He finished the 2003 regular season with a new career best in ERA (1.66), along with 40saves in 46opportunities. In the 2003 AL Championship Series against the arch-rival Boston Red Sox, Rivera had {{one of the most memorable}} postseason performances of his career; in the decisive Game 7, he entered in the ninth inning with the score tied 5–5 and pitched three scoreless innings, his longest outing since 1996. He became the winning pitcher after Aaron Boone hit an eleventh-inning walk-off home run that clinched the Yankees' series victory and advanced them to the 2003 World Series. Rivera celebrated by running to the pitcher's mound and collapsing in joy to thank God, as Boone rounded the bases and was met by his teammates at home plate. Rivera was named the AL Championship Series MVP for recording two saves and a win in the series. The Yankees lost the World Series to the Florida Marlins; Rivera saved five games and allowed only one earned run in 16innings pitched that postseason.|$|E

25|$|As the {{election}} produced a hung parliament, a multi-party agreement {{was expected to}} be required. Mariano Rajoy said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> to form an administration, but Pedro Sánchez called for a change in government, while recognising the PP's right to try and form a government first. Two possible coalitions, the PP with C's and PSOE with Podemos, would both come up short of a majority by themselves.|$|E

25|$|Lord Hawke {{had been}} invited to take the 1894-95 team to the West Indies but had had to withdraw, the team being captained instead by R. Slade Lucas. It was {{understood}} however that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> to take a side out in 1896-97 and following an invitation he set about organising a tour. But his telegram accepting the invitation was never received and another group of tourists under A.A. Priestley having accepted an invitation from Jamaica were organising their own tour.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Samuel A. Levine was at {{his office}} when Delano telephoned Brigham Hospital on Saturday morning. Levine said the {{senior members of the}} Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission, Dr. Lovett and Dr. Peabody, were out of town, but <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> to answer Delano's questions. After {{reviewing}} the messages Delano had received from Campobello, Levine thought Roosevelt was suffering from acute poliomyelitis. He urged that a lumbar puncture be done, with the goal of making a diagnosis, but mainly because Levine believed there could be acute benefit from the procedure.|$|E
