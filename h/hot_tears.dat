40|$|Abstract. <b>Hot</b> <b>tearing</b> {{is the one}} of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} when casting aluminium alloys. Although there has been much research work in this field, it is still not clear what causes <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> and how it propagates. Furthermore, the effect of solidified structure on the <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> has not been clear. Therefore, this study has been carried out to correlate the solidified structure and <b>hot</b> <b>tearing.</b> Al- 2. 0 wt % Cu alloy was used for test alloy. To change the solidified structure, some amount of refiner was added to the molten alloy. A permanent mould, which has been developed by us, can form <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> intentionally in the center region of a solidified shell. The cross section of a solidified shell was metallographically investigated and solidified structure and <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> were characterized. The length of <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> decreased with increasing the amount of refiner. This may indicate that it is difficult for <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> with fine equiaxed grains to propagate. In addition to this, the residual liquid around the <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> was moved to the cracking due to negative pressure and <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> was partially healed...|$|R

However, a modified RDG model for cellular equiaxed grains suggested that reducing the grain size should also decrease the permeability of the mush consequently increasing the <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> susceptibility.

40|$|An {{automotive}} {{company has}} recently adopted procedures {{to control the}} melt hydrogen content of their cast aluminum air-intake manifolds.

The improvement was attributed to the TiB 2 particles promoted the grain refinement. The <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> susceptibility of TiB 2 -reinforced Al– 5 Cu matrix composite decreased first and then increased with the increase of TiB 2 content. The 2 TiB 2 /Al– 5 Cu composite had the smallest <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> susceptibility value.

Nevertheless, the 4 TiB 2 /Al– 5 Cu and 6 TiB 2 /Al– 5 Cu composites had more severe <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> susceptibility than others.

40|$|Using {{modifications}} to the Rappaz-Drezet-Gremaud <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> model, and using empirical equations developed for grain size and dendrite arm spacing (DAS) on the addition of grain refiner {{for a range of}} cooling rates, the effect of grain refinement and cooling rate on <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> susceptibility has been analysed. It was found that grain refinement decreased the grain size and made the grain morphology more globular. Therefore refining the grain size of an equiaxed dendritic grain decreased the <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> susceptibility. However, when the alloy was grain refined such that globular grain morphologies where obtained, further grain refinement increased the <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> susceptibility. Increasing the cooling decreased the grain size and made the grain morphology more dendritic and therefore increased the likelihood of <b>hot</b> <b>tearing.</b> The effect was particularly strong for equiaxed dendritic grain morphologies; hence grain refinement is increasingly important at high cooling rates to obtain more globular grain morphologies to reduce the <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>tearing</b> {{continues}} to be a major problem in both Direct Chill (DC) and shape casting of aluminium alloys. It can limit productivity and influence the viability of casting some alloy compositions. While the underlying cause of <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> is understood i. e. the inability of liquid to feed imposed strain on the mushy material (two-phase region where developing solid and liquid coexist), work continues on improving the understanding of the mechanisms at play. There have been numerous <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> experiments developed using different configurations and various levels of complexity. There have also been many models developed to predict <b>hot</b> <b>tearing.</b> Some are empirical in nature or based upon the solidification characteristics of a given alloy while others are more detailed and take into consideration parameters such as solidification shrinkage, thermal contraction and permeability. The objective of this thesis was to develop {{a better understanding of the}} <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> process and to determine the fundamental mechanisms that lead to this phenomenon. <b>Hot</b> <b>tear</b> experiments were conducted using the CAST <b>Hot</b> <b>Tear</b> experimental rig at the University of Queensland on a range of Al-Cu and Al-Zn alloys. <b>Hot</b> <b>tear</b> severity was quantified and compared with published work. Data from the experiments was also used to validate some established models. The experimental rig was also modified to allow visual observation of <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> initiation and propagation. Hot tensile testing was also carried out on selected Al-Cu alloys to assess the suitability of using the reheating method to study <b>hot</b> <b>tearing.</b> However, comparison of results with <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> testing was difficult as the slow reheating rate in the hot tensile tests allowed solid-state diffusion to occur. With <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> testing of both Al-Cu and Al-Zn alloys, it was found that as the solute content increased, tensile coherency (fraction solid at which load development began) occurred at lower fraction solids. In the Al-Cu alloys, it was found that the type of tearing varied with solute content. At low solute levels there was generally a single large primary tear in both grain refined and non-grain refined alloys. As the solute level increased, the large primary tear gradually diminished and was replaced by smaller secondary tears distributed over a wider area. In the grain refined alloys, the smaller secondary tears transitioned into distributed porosity as the solute content increased further. <b>Hot</b> <b>tear</b> susceptibility results from the Al-Cu alloys correlated well with other published studies, particularly with data from an experimental rig with a similar configuration (where feeding is provided to the central hot spot). The results also correlated well with established <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> models. In the Al-Zn alloys, <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> susceptibility results did not correlate with previous studies. This variation was attributed to differences in the design of the experimental rig. The CAST <b>Hot</b> <b>Tear</b> rig provides liquid feeding to the central hot spot while the experimental rigs used in previous studies did not. However, susceptibility results correlated well with <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> models that were based on permeability of the mushy material. Visual observation of <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> showed that intergranular tears first appeared at very low loads in the centre of the cast bar and later linked with interdendritic tears through a sidewall grain. With a given test geometry and cooling conditions, it is argued that <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> susceptibility is determined by the tensile coherency point and the permeability of the mushy material at that point. Therefore, it is proposed that there are two mechanisms that can lead to <b>hot</b> <b>tearing.</b> The first occurs when feeding becomes insufficient due to low permeability before tensile coherency occurs. This leaves a void between opposing solidification fronts and is characterised by the presence of just one primary tear. Alternatively, the classic tear mechanism occurs when feeding becomes insufficient after tensile coherency. The extent and localisation of tearing is dependant upon how early tensile coherency occurs and how long afterwards feeding becomes insufficient. In addition, a <b>hot</b> <b>tear</b> susceptibility map has been developed to visually represent the combined influence of tensile coherency and permeability on <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> susceptibility...|$|R

Susceptibility to <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> was found to increase gradually with iron content when the conditions were favorable {{to the formation of}} the β(FeCu) phase. Additions of silicon with a Fe/Si mass ratio ≤ 1 and high cooling rates, which together promote the α(MnFe) phase {{at the expense of the}} β(FeCu) phase, were found beneficial to the <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> resistance. <b>Hot</b> <b>tearing</b> sensitivity (HTS) of the alloys was evaluated with a new index defined to reflect the compliance of the torn specimens.

The deleterious effect of iron on <b>hot</b> <b>tearing</b> was demonstrated on alloys having a coarse grain microstructure having Ti contents below or equal to 0. 01. wt%.
