2500|$|In most {{international}} {{versions of}} the game show Duel, if two contestants do not cover the correct answer to a regular question when the duel is in process, the duel goes to a sudden death question called a [...] "Shootout". For this sudden death question, the contestants who are participating get 4 new chips each, {{and there are no}} accelerators or presses available. If only one contestant answers correctly, the contestant who has the answer wins. If both contestants <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> correct, the contestant who covered fewer choices wins, but if both contestants do not cover the correct answer to the shootout question, they are both eliminated (that happens automatically if both contestants are wrong during the duel in international versions that do not have sudden death). In a situation in which both contestants covered the same number of choices during sudden death, both contestants win the duel, and one of the contestants, picked at random, must leave the show. [...] In some instances, if a winner cannot be determined on the question (regardless if both contestants tie or would be eliminated), multiple Shootouts may occur until a winner is determined. [...] In that case, the tie-breakers that do not determine a winner may be edited out of the final broadcast.|$|E

There should be nothing underhand about her correspondence: all the Greshamsbury world should know of it--that world of which she had spoken in her letter--if that world so pleased. Having put her penny label on it, she handed it, with an open brow and an unembarrassed face, to the baker's wife, who was Her Majesty's postmistress at Greshamsbury; and, having so finished her work, she returned to see the table prepared for her uncle's dinner.

Now, Mr. Durgin--what a name! I can see it makes you creep--is no more like one of us than a--bear is--and his attitude toward us is that of a bear who's gone so much with human beings that he thinks he's a human being. He's delightful, that way. And, do you know, he's intellectual! He actually brings me books, and wants to read passages to me out of them! He has brought me the plans of the new hotel he's going to build. It's to be very aesthetic, and it's going to be called The Lion's Head Inn. There's to be a little theatre, for amateur dramatics, which I could conduct, and for all sorts of professional amusements.

'Ah, Sandy, Sandy, man, when your lum reeks as lang as ours, it will, may be, need sweeping too.'[J] Now, I do not deny that we need sweeping; every body knows that I have been singing out about sweeping for the last five years. Let me tell my good friends in Edinburgh, and in the country, that the sooner you sweep the better; for the chimney may catch fire, and reduce your noble fabric to ashes.|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 65). E-learning {{is the use of}} technologies to deliver lessons. It is an interactive instructional experience in which the student and the teacher are in separate physical locations. We have generated an E-learning engine or template for the teachers to enable the students to learn the lessons through incremental thinking questions chosen by the teachers in their absence. By using our software tool, interfaces will be generated automatically lesson by lesson after getting all required information from the teachers. Each question will be case (background text) based, so that the students can be able to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> right without being taught the topics by the teachers. <b>The</b> students will <b>get</b> feedback immediately through hints and guide to right answers. If they are unable to give <b>the</b> right <b>answers,</b> then they can get to know how to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> right through guide to right answers. If they give <b>the</b> wrong <b>answers,</b> then <b>the</b> system will give them the hints through messages for making them able to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> right. <b>The</b> students will be able to evaluate themselves through this tool after knowing their scores. They will also get to know how much they are prepared or how much they should be. Parvez AhmadTania IslamB. Computer Science and Engineerin...|$|R
