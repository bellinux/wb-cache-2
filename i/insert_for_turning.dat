Due to the outstanding properties of coatings based on Al 2 O 3 for cutting operations, they have been deposited on indexable carbide <b>inserts</b> <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> and milling operations for several years now with the aid of CVD processes.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{understand}} how the wear and deformation mechanisms of hardmetalinserts change when the cobalt binder phase is replaced with a dierent metal or analloy. The focus is on <b>inserts</b> <b>for</b> steel <b>turning.</b> The work presented in this licentiate thesisconsists of the rst steps. Cobalt is the most common binder phase in hardmetal tools based on tungsten carbide asthe hard phase. Metallic cobalt powder, present during the manufacturing, has been associatedwith lung diseases and an increased risk for lung cancer if inhaled. Therefore it is importantto investigate alternative binders as one possible solution. This work studies binder phase alloys from the iron-nickel-cobalt system. These alloyscan be either austenitic, martensitic or a mixture of the two phases. By changing the binderphase composition to change the crystal structure it is possible to tailor the macroscopic mechanicalproperties of the material. It is also possible to tailor the composition in such a waythat the binder is transformation toughening, forming martensite as a response to mechanicaldeformation. The majority of <b>inserts</b> <b>for</b> steel <b>turning</b> are coated, and it is important to investigate if thehardmetals with alternative binder can be coated and if the coating adhesion is sucient forsteel turning. Four dierent alternative binder alloys and one reference with cobalt binder coated bychemical vapour deposition were investigated by scratch testing to determine the adhesion. The scratch test adhesion was sucient on all samples, but signicant variations in coatingadhesion were found. One alternative binder with 86 wt%Ni and 14 wt%Fe and a reference with cobalt binder manufacturedto mimic state of the art turning inserts were tested in steel turning. The alternativebinder grades had a lower resistance to plastic deformation and this was attributed to earlyaking of the coating due to a lower coating adhesion. Focused ion beam and scanning electronmicroscopy were used to study the deformation of the hard metal in the used cuttinginserts...|$|R
40|$|Engineering process {{preparation}} requires proper {{preparation of}} cutting tools. It influences {{not only the}} performance of the tools but also the quality of workpiece surface machining. One of the promising environmentally friendly trends of mechanical treatment is grinding without using lubricating cooling liquid. This method can considerably influence the quality of cutting tools grinding. Smoothing skiving turning is an effective treatment method providing high efficiency and workpiece quality. Proper preparation of cutting edges is especially important in this process. For that purpose we have carried out a research in grinding changeable carbide <b>inserts</b> <b>for</b> skiving <b>turning</b> by means of grinding wheels with different grain size. The influence of different combinations of wheels on roughness of the inserts front and rear surfaces and quality of cutting edge was studied with the help of laser confocal microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{the field}} of hard coating and {{microsystem}} technology have been the basis for the realization of smart machine tools for the cutting industry. The novel tools enable on-line control of cutting conditions measured directly at the cutting edges of <b>inserts</b> used <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> processes of steel and other materials. To achieve this, special thin film sensors for temperature, wear and tool breakage measurement were integrated into the hard coating system of cutting inserts. The electrical power supply of the sensors and the transfer of the signals were performed by use of telemtric MST techniques. Due to the very fast response time of the nano sensor layers and the direct control of the critical wear zone, novel steering methods for tomorrows's cutting processes will possibly be feasible in future...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{manufacturing}} companies have {{had to deal with}} an increasing demand for feature-rich products at low costs. The pressures exerted on their existing manufacturing processes have lead manufacturers to investigate internet-based solutions, in order to cope with growing competition. The decentralisation phenomenon also came up as a reason to implement networked-application, which has been the starting point for internet/intranet–based systems. Today, the availability of powerful and low cost 3 D tools, database backend systems, along with web-based technologies, provides interesting opportunities to the manufacturing community, with solutions directly implementable at the core of their businesses and organisations. In this paper a web-based engineering approach is presented to developing a design support system using case-based reasoning (CBR) technology for helping in the decision-making process when choosing cutting tools. The system aims to provide on-line intelligent support for determining the most suitable configuration <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> operations, based on initial parameters and requirements for the cutting operation. The system also features a user-driven 3 D turning simulator which allows testing the chosen <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> several <b>turning</b> operations.

40|$|Abstract. Non-oxide {{covalent}} ceramics such as TiC and TiN display hardness {{and thermal}} stability that favor their use as cermet <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> high speed <b>turning</b> operations. The {{objective of this}} work {{was to assess the}} properties of the TiC combined with W-Mo as binding matrix. The cermet sintering was carried out inside a toroidal anvil type of high pressure device up to 1. 0 GPa of pressure and temperatures up to 1800 o C. It was found that at 1400 o C the Mo reacts with TiC forming Mo 2 C while at 1800 o C the reaction with W forms WC. Moreover, the cermets density reaches 98 % of the theoretically calculated value with strength of 942 MPa and Rockwell A hardness of 94. Efficient turning parameters are reported for machining operation using these cermets as tools insert...|$|R

40|$|AbstractParticle {{reinforced}} aluminium matrix composites (AMCs) are high-strength {{lightweight materials}} {{consisting of a}} comparatively soft aluminium alloy and hard embedded ceramic particles. The high hardness of the particles results in excellent abrasion resistance. However, this property lends poor machinability involving high tool wear and surface imperfections on the workpieces. For this reason, CVD diamond tipped indexable <b>inserts</b> were used <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> AA 2124 with 25 % volume proportion of SiC particles. The surface integrity {{is influenced by the}} tool geometry, which affects the stress condition in the shear zone. In the research described the influence of modified corner geometries and the width of flank wear land were investigated.

40|$|Tool wear {{monitoring}} is {{of great}} concern in machining industry, as it affects the surface qualities, dimensional accuracy and production costs of the machined components. The orthodox methods of measuring tool wear are time consuming and limited in accuracy and application. In this study, machine vision system based on digital image processing was developed for measurement of tool wear. The basic components of the system are: a charge coupled device (CCD) camera, PC, Microsoft Windows Video Maker, frame grabber, Video to USB cable, digital image processing software (Photoshop and digital image processing toolbox <b>for</b> MATLAB), multi-directional <b>insert</b> fixture, and light source. Tool wear images were captured and ten different wear features: length, width, area, equivalent diameter, centroid, major axis length, minor axis length, solidity, eccentricity and orientation were extracted from the images. The pixels dimension of the system {{was found to be}} Px = 0. 03306 and Py = 0. 03333. The accuracy of the system compared to SANDVIK Coromant hand-held microscopic lens was found to have an absolute error less than 3. 13 %. The system has been applied in the analysis tool wear of uncoated cemented carbide <b>inserts</b> used <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> of NST 37. 2 steel. A tool wear index (TWI) was proposed as a potential indicator for tool wear monitoring. A graphical user interface (GUI) was designed for easy application of system...|$|R
40|$|The {{machining}} {{industries are}} {{focused primarily on}} the attainment of high quality, excellent surface finish, high production rate, economy of machining. Surface Roughness (SR) of a product is very essential in determining the quality and Material Removal Rate (MRR) is an important to increase the making rate.

5000|$|Fuselage era Chryslers all {{featured}} a full width loop style chrome front bumper. Quad headlamps and grille were recessed inside the loop, with differing grille <b>inserts</b> <b>for</b> each series. <b>Turn</b> signal and parking lamps were recessed into the bumper below the head lamps. Body sides were simple and smooth with a subtle character line originating {{at the front}} bumper, descending slightly {{for the length of}} the car, and ending at the wrap-around rear bumper. On Town and Country wagons, this character line was also the location of the lower molding surrounding the standard wood grain side paneling, simulated cherry for 1969. The fuselage profile extended the length of a full sized “long roof” made for a rather striking looking wagon. At the trailing edge of the long roof, body sides, D pillars, and a unique roof top air foil formed one continuous arch over the tailgate opening. The airfoil directed airflow from the roof downward and over the tail gate window, intended to keep the glass clear of dirt accumulation.|$|R

Heider AG, 2006) differ and results are not {{in accordance with the}} Ph.Eur. specifications. Our new two-strip TLC method, combining two separations on the same type of support with two different solvent mixtures, {{has been found to be}} adequate for the determination of the RCP of 99 mTc-MAG 3 (Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2003). The RCP obtained by TLC does not deviate significantly from the reference RCP determined by HPLC and PC following the Ph.Eur. method (European Pharmacopoeia Edition 7.0, 2008). The limit value for the total RCP is identic. This was not the case in former proposed methods where some impurities have been excluded and declared as insignificant (Seetharaman et al., 2006; Chen et al., 1993; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2003; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> ROTOP-MAG- 3 Kit. Heider AG, 2006; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3.

The specificity and accuracy of our method have been confirmed and results of total RCP are in very good agreement with the Ph.Eur. reference method. The limit of detection meets the limit test criteria necessary to identify the total amount of impurities in a TLC QC method. Its precision and robustness have been successfully validated. Results of the intermediate fidelity show a good correlation with the Ph.Eur. reference values, both for the TLC-scanner and the dose calibrator measurements. This two-strip TLC method could therefore be established for routine quality control of 99 mTc-MAG 3 kits by introducing it into the SPC of the products (Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3.

40|$|AbstractHeat treated Ductile Iron with {{austenitic-ferritic}} matrix (ADI) has a {{high potential}} for the substitution of forged steel and conventional Ductile Iron. Advantages of ADI compared to steel are good castability and lower density. In comparison to conventional Ductile Iron, the increased ratio of tensile strength/ductility with higher resistance against abrasive wear and durability are of advantage. In the industrial applications, the material sided advantages are counterbalanced by the higher costs of the demanding machining, especially in rough turning operations. In this presentation, the development of cutting <b>inserts</b> <b>for</b> high performance <b>turning</b> operations, which are adapted on the specific requirements of the machining of ADI 900, are described. In the first step, the particular machinability, which {{can be traced back}} to the metallic matrix, was specified. The characteristic, discontinuous chip formation in combination with the strong tendency of hardening of the austenitic− ferritic matrix was identified as a major wear mechanism, resulting in extreme peaks of cutting forces and high specific mechanical load on the <b>insert</b> edge. <b>For</b> an enhanced evaluation of chip formation and the resultant thermomechanical tool load, a 3 D FEM simulation model was developed. By using this 3 D simulation model of the longitudinal external turning process, the maximum cutting forces were specified in addition to the influence of the chip segment formation frequency. The obtained results from the simulation have been used to develop an optimised insert geometry. By using the optimised tool, an increased tool life of 70 % could be observed.
