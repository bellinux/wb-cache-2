40|$|Many mud diapirs {{have been}} {{identified}} in the southern Okinawa Trough from a seismic survey using R/V KEXUE I in 2001. The movement and accumulation of free gas related to mud diapirs are discussed in detail by an analysis of fluid potential which is based upon velocity data. It can be found that free gas moves from the higher fluid potential strata to the lower ones and the gas hydrate comes into being during free gas movement meeting the proper criteria of temperature and pressure. In fact, gas hydrates have been found in the upper layers above the mud diapirs and in host rocks exhibiting other geophysical characteristics. As the result of the formation of the gas hydrate, the free <b>gas</b> bearing <b>strata</b> are enclosed by the <b>gas</b> hydrate bearing <b>strata.</b> Due to the high pressure anomalies of the free <b>gas</b> bearing <b>strata</b> the fluid potential increases noticeably. It can then be concluded that the high fluid potential anomaly on the low fluid potential background may be caused by the presence of the free gas below the <b>gas</b> hydrate bearing <b>strata...</b>|$|R
40|$|To further {{understand}} methane {{flow characteristics}} on a longwall face, this study {{focuses on the}} investigation of methane flow behaviour under six different operating and mining conditions, namely, the impact of ventilation {{in terms of both}} flow rate and the ventilation scheme, coal seam gas content, adjacent <b>gas</b> bearing <b>strata,</b> drum sprays and the maingate (MG) curtain. Modelling results obtained from the parametric studies were compared with the corresponding base model results, through which the impact of single parameter on the methane distribution characteristics along the longwall face was investigated. Modelling results indicate that: 1) flow rate has major impact on the methane concentration around the shearer and at the inner tailgate (TG) corner while the impact is minor at the upper TG corner; 2) methane emission from adjacent <b>gas</b> bearing <b>strata</b> significantly affects the methane distribution at the immediate goaf and at the upper TG corner of the face; 3) the use of a TG cut through behind the face is very effective in diluting the methane accumulated at the upper TG corner; 4) methane levels in the vicinity of drums and downstream is reduced greatly with the operation of drum sprays...|$|R

40|$|WO 2003021079 A UPAB: 20030416 NOVELTY - A fluid {{is carried}} {{down from the}} land- or water surface, {{introducing}} it into the deposit (3). This de-stabilizes the gas hydrate, releasing gas, which is returned to the surface (5) through a riser (1). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for extraction equipment. Preferred Features: The gas and/or gas hydrate reaching the surface is intercepted in a vessel (4), separating gas from the water. Further separation of entrained solids takes place. Substances of lower density than water, especially oils, are separated in addition. The fluid is sea water, surface water, ground water, melted ice or snow. Before entering the downcomer (2), the fluid is heated, using recovered gas to supplement the heating. The gas and/or gas hydrate are extracted from <b>gas</b> hydrate <b>strata</b> lying on and in the sea bed. They are recovered from sediment and/or ground deposits. The downcomer and/or riser are pipes. Before transport of gases and/or gas hydrates, a cavern is formed in the <b>gas</b> hydrate <b>strata.</b> This is produced by reduced pressure, heat or mining excavation, using chemical additives. USE - Used to extract gas and/or gas hydrates from subterranean-, sea bed- or subsea deposits, transporting them {{to the surface and}} separating byproducts. ADVANTAGE - Efficient, reliable, simple, controlled, technically-sound recovery is achieved. Methane is produced especially. The method is ecologically- acceptable. A newer source of fossil fuel, available in enormous quantities, is exploited. Less CO 2 (a greenhouse gas) results from its combustion, than from other fossil fuels. Oil and coal are conserved. High thermodynamic efficiencies exceeding 50 % can be achieved, firing this fuel in power stations. The process improves on earlier processes depending largely on energy injection for recovery...|$|R
40|$|The Domanic {{deposits}} of the Volga-Ural {{oil and gas}} basin are a high-carbon thin-bedded formation capable of both producing hydrocarbons with its own oil and <b>gas</b> bearing <b>strata</b> and concentrating them in separate reservoirs and zones (Stoupakova et al., 2015). Formation of the Domanic deposits occurred in a relatively deep basin, during the filling of which a variety of sedimentation environments arose from relatively deep sea to shallow-marine. The peculiarity of the formation conditions of high-carbon strata is the increased content of organic matter, carbonate material and free silica, the source {{of which could be}} hydrotherms or volcanogenic products, creating a special gas regime of the Earth’s atmosphere in the late Devonian. Evaluation of the generation potential of the Domanic formation showed that siliceous-carbonate and carbonate-siliceous rocks enriched with marine algal organic matter have a high potential. The greatest prospects of oil bearing are the deflections formed {{on the site of the}} avlakogen and their slopes, where deposits, rich in organic matter, were formed practically throughout the late Devonian-Tournaisian. High prospects have slopes of uplifts or sides of reef bodies. Such incisions are distributed on the sides of troughs of uncompensated immersion and the lower parts of uplift slopes adjacent to them.

Through an overall review on the progress in shale gas exploration and development in the Sichuan Basin, we obtained the following findings: (1) the Sichuan Basin has experienced the marine and terrestrial depositional evolution, resulting in the deposition of three types of organic-matter-rich shales (i. e. marine, transitional, and terrestrial), and the occurrence of six sets of favorable shale <b>gas</b> enrichment <b>strata</b> (i. e. the Sinian Doushantuo Fm, the Cambrian Qiongzhusi Fm, the Ordovician Wufeng–Silurian Longmaxi Fm, the Permian Longtan Fm, the Triassic Xujiahe Fm, and the Jurassic Zhiliujing Fm); (2) the five key elements for shale gas accumulation in the Wufeng-Longmaxi Fm are deep-water shelf facies, greater thickness of organic-rich shales, moderate thermal evolution, abundant structural fractures, reservoir overpressure; and (3) the exploration and development of shale gas in this basin still confronts two major challenges, namely, uncertain sweet spots and potential prospect of shale gas, and the immature technologies in the development of shale gas resources at a depth of more than 3500  m. In conclusion, shale gas has been discovered in the Jurassic, Triassic and Cambrian, and preliminary industrial-scale gas has been produced in the Ordovician-Silurian Fm in the Sichuan Basin, indicating a promising prospect there; commercial shale gas can be produced there with an estimated annual gas output of 30 – 60  billion m 3; and shale gas exploration and production experiences in this basin will provide valuable theoretical and technical support for commercial shale gas development in China...|$|R

50|$|The {{thermosphere}} is {{the layer}} of the Earth's atmosphere directly above the mesosphere. The exosphere is above that but is a minor layer of the atmosphere. Within this layer of the atmosphere, ultraviolet radiation causes photoionization/photodissociation of molecules, creating ions in the ionosphere. Taking {{its name from the}} Greek θερμός (pronounced thermos) meaning heat, the thermosphere begins about 85 km above the Earth. At these high altitudes, the residual atmospheric <b>gases</b> sort into <b>strata</b> according to molecular mass (see turbosphere). Thermospheric temperatures increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic solar radiation. Temperatures are highly dependent on solar activity, and can rise to 2000 C. Radiation causes the atmosphere particles in this layer to become electrically charged (see ionosphere), enabling radio waves to be refracted and thus be received beyond the horizon. In the exosphere, beginning at 500 to 1000 km above the Earth's surface, the atmosphere turns into space, although by the criteria set for the definition of the Kármán line, the thermosphere itself is part of space.|$|R

30|$|Producing <b>gas</b> from shale <b>strata</b> {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} important factor to secure energy over recent years for the considerable volume of natural gas stored. Unlike conventional gas reservoirs, gas transport in shale reservoirs is a complex process. In the organic nano pores, slippage effect, gas diffusion along the wall, viscous flow due to pressure gradient, and desorption from Kerogen coexist; while in the micro fractures, there exist viscous flow and slippage. Hydraulic fracturing is commonly used to enhance the recovery from these ultra-tight gas reservoirs. It is important to clearly understand the effect of known mechanisms on shale gas reservoir performance. This article presents the pressure transient analysis (PTA) and rate decline analysis (RDA) on the hydraulic fractured vertical wells with finite conductivity in shale gas reservoirs considering multiple flow mechanisms including desorption, diffusive flow, Darcy flow and stress sensitivity. The PTA and RDA models were established firstly. Then, the source function, Laplace transform, and the numerical discrete methods were employed to solve the mathematical model. At last the type curves were plotted and different flow regimes were identified. The sensitivity of adsorption coefficient, storage capacity ratio, inter-porosity flow coefficient, fracture conductivity, fracture skin factor, and stress sensitivity were analyzed.

The face cleat strikes at N 6920 W 21220 and the systematic rock joint in the surface bedrock strikes N 6720 W 21220 This suggests that a directional stress oriented N 7020 W produced the folds and influenced the directions of coal cleat and systematic joint sets.

The contents of methane range 97. 22 %– 98. 41 %, with a little amount of ethane and propane, an average wetness of 0. 74 %, and little amount of non-hydrocarbons such as CO 2, N 2, H 2, however, there's no H 2 S.

40|$|The {{geologic}} {{setting of}} the formerly glaciated mid-Norwegian continental margin exerts specific controls on {{the formation of a}} bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) and the inferred distribution of gas hydrates. On the continental slope the lithology of glacigenic debris flow deposits and pre-glacial basin deposits of the Kai Formation prevent gas-hydrate formation, because of reduced pore size, reduced water content and fine-grained sediment composition. Towards the continental shelf, the shoaling and pinch-out of the gas-hydrate stability zone terminates the area of gas-hydrate growth. These geological controls confine the occurrence of gas hydrates and ensuing formation of a BSR to a small zone along the northern flank of the Storegga submarine slide and the slide area itself. A BSR inside the slide area indicates a dynamically adjusting gas-hydrate system to post-slide pressure^temperature equilibrium conditions. These observations, together with widespread evidence for fluid flow and deep-seated hydrocarbon reservoirs, suggest that the formation of BSR and gas hydrates on the mid-Norwegian continental margin is dominated by an advection of <b>gas</b> from the <b>strata</b> distinctly beneath the gas-hydrate stability zone.

Conventionally the whole thickness of accreted ice is divided into two strata: lake ice 1 and lake ice 2. Lake ice 1 (3537 – 3618 m), formed in the sallow strait 50 kmupstream of Vostok, is characterized by presence of disseminated mineral inclusions of Lake Vostok sediments, as well as of «water pockets» that represent frozen water inclusions trapped during the ice accretion. The latter constitute less than 1 % of the total ice volume, their mean size is about 0. 5 cm. Gases trapped by «water pockets» during ice formation transform into crystalline inclusions of mixed gas hydrates. Accretion of lake ice 2 (3618 – 3769 m) proceeds in the deep part of the lake at a very small rate that does not assume trapping of liquid water inclusions and <b>gases.</b> Both <b>strata</b> of accreted ice are formed by orthotropic crystal growth from pure water. The main tendency in the evolution of accreted ice texture is growth of the mean crystal size with depth as the lake ice becomes younger towards the ice-water interface. The high-amplitude variations of crystal size and orientation observed around this general trend are shown to be linked with temporal and spatial variability of the supercooled melt-water flux from {{the northern part of the}} lake towards the ice formation site. The presence of supercooled water at the crystallization front supports persistent preferable growth of ice crystals with sub-horizontally oriented c-axes. The lack of supercooled water in turn support persistent growth of ice crystals with vertical or inclined with respect to the crystallization front c-axis orientation. It means that each of these preferred fabric orientations could serve as an indicator of intensity of melt water flux towards the ice formation site.

The formation of the gas emission zone and the potential amount of gas-in-place (GIP) that might be available for migration into a mine are factors of local geology and rock properties that usually show spatial variability in continuity and may also show geometric anisotropy. Geostatistical methods are used here for modeling and prediction of gas amounts and for assessing their associated uncertainty in gas emission zones of longwall mines for methane control. This study used core data obtained from 276 vertical exploration boreholes drilled from the surface to the bottom of the Pittsburgh coal seam in a mining district in the Northern Appalachian basin. After identifying important coal and non-coal layers for the gas emission zone, univariate statistical and semivariogram analyses were conducted for data from different formations to define the distribution and continuity of various attributes. Sequential simulations performed stochastic assessment of these attributes, such as <b>gas</b> content, <b>strata</b> thickness, and strata displacement. These analyses were followed by calculations of gas-in-place and their uncertainties in the Pittsburgh seam caved zone and fractured zone of longwall mines in this mining district. Grid blanking was used to isolate the volume over the actual panels from the entire modeled district and to calculate gas amounts that were directly related to the emissions in longwall mines. Results indicated that gas-in-place in the Pittsburgh seam, in the caved zone and in the fractured zone, as well as displacements in major rock units, showed spatial correlations that could be modeled and estimated using geostatistical methods. This study showed that GIP volumes may change up to 3 MMscf per acre and, in a multi-panel district, may total 9 Bcf of methane within the gas emission zone. Therefore, ventilation and gas capture systems should be designed accordingly. In addition, rock displacements within the gas emission zone are spatially distributed. From an engineering and practical point of view, spatial distributions of GIP and distributions of rock displacements should be correlated with in-mine emissions and gob gas venthole productions.

40|$|Analyses of 471 near-surface soil-gas {{samples for}} light hydrocarbons, C 1 -C 4, C 2 L, C 3 L, and H 2 from the Lost River gas field in Hardy County, West Virginia, reveal sites or {{clusters}} of sites containing anomalously {{high concentrations of}} light hydrocarbon gases, which occur directly over the faulted, eastern limb of the Whip Cove anticline. Compositional changes in the soil-gases data clearly define {{major changes in the}} maturity and locations of potential source beds. Grids placed on botanically defined anomalies confirm a possible correlation between these two independent indicators. Statistical analysis shows that samples from 45 sites contain anomalously large concentrations of light hydrocarbons in the soil-gas constituents. Large concentrations, coupled with high saturate-to-olefin ratios, further confirms that this active seepage is near macroseep levels. Variations in soil-gas compositional trends separate the soil-gas data into two domains, with oilier compositions to the west and gassier compositions to the east. Although the composition of the shallow soil gases above the Lost River gas field are oilier than the reservoir gases, they occur directly over the eastern, faulted limb of the producing anticlinal structure, suggesting that the dry gases from the Oriskany reservoir are probably mixed with oilier <b>gases</b> from organic-rich <b>strata</b> among Devonian shales. The eastern anomalies are much gassier and are very similar to the Oriskany gases produced by the Lost River gas field. The eastern anomalies directly overlie near-vertical beds of Devonian and older age formations that are likely conduits for deeper, mature thermal gases. Copyright © 2006.

40|$|The {{continuing}} {{and effective}} management of gas within the sandstones overlying the Bulli seam mines of BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal {{is required to}} ensure safe and productive mining operations. Recent surface exploration has also detected the presence of oil accumulations in these sandstones which {{have the potential to}} impact on future mining operations. Some of these hydrocarbons are located within the longwall relaxation zone of the overlying strata and, as a result, can migrate to the goaf and active workings subsequent to extraction. A number of new exploration techniques, which are in common use by the petroleum industry, have been adopted by Illawarra Coal in order to more accurately locate these zones and determine the potential impact on future mining. These techniques include: • Advanced analysis of downhole geophysics to determine the location and extent of <b>strata</b> <b>gas</b> horizons. • Specialist interpretation of 2 D and 3 D seismic to detect gas zones. • Modeling of multiple data-sets to determine controls on gas distribution and composition. • Detailed geological and chemical analysis of the oil-bearing horizons {{to gain a better understanding}} of the petroleum system and the controls to its distribution. • Geotechnical studies of the overlying strata to determine the extent and nature of post-mining strata relaxation in comparison with the location of the hydrocarbon zones.

40|$|In This Chapter [Geologic {{features}} {{associated with}} anomalous methane emissions Gas outbursts and blowers Methane drainage strategies for mitigating anomalous methane emissions and General considerations for a methane drainage program] This chapter summarizes how certain geologic features {{may be associated}} with unexpected increases in gas emissions during coal mining. These unexpected emissions have the potential to create explosive conditions in the underground workplace. Also discussed are the generally used practices to alleviate potential hazards caused by gas emissions associated with these geologic features. INTRODUCTION Unforeseen mine gas emissions in quantities sufficient to create hazardous conditions have been attributed to sources outside the mined coalbed since the first documentation of methane explosions in coal mines [Payman and Statham 1930]. Geologic features such as faults have long been recognized as conduits for <b>gas</b> flow from <b>strata</b> adjacent to mined coalbeds [Moss 1927; Payman and Statham 1930]. Other features such as sandstone paleochannels, clay veins, and localized folding have also been recognized for their impact on gas emissions into mine work-ings [Darton 1915; Price and Headlee 1943; McCulloch et al. 1975; Ulery and Molinda 1984]. The fact that strata adjacent to mined coalbeds can emit large quantities of methane gas into mine workings is not surprising from a theoretical perspective. Many researchers have recognized that during the burial and diagenesis of the organic matter forming today 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s minable coalbeds, similar dispersed organic matter in adjacent strata has produced methane in quantities far exceeding the storage capacity of the coal and surrounding rock [Juntgen and Klein 1975]. It is not surprising then that large quantities of methane can remain trapped in these strata. A potential hazard occurs when mining of a nearby coalbed causes pressure differentials and mining-induced fractures conducive to gas flow into the mine workings from these <b>strata.</b> This <b>gas</b> flow may be facilitated or temporarily impeded by the presence of geologic structures or anomalies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{intermittent}} {{production of}} the renewable energy imposes the necessity to temporarily store it. Large amount of exceeding electricity {{can be stored in}} geological strata in the form of hydrogen. The conversion of hydrogen to electricity and vice versa can be performed in electrolysers and fuel elements by chemical methods. The nowday thecnical solution accepted by the European industry consists of injecting small amounts of hydrogen in the existing storages of natural gas. The progressive development of this technology will finally lead to the creation of underground storage of pure hydrogen. The main problem encountered in the case of storage of hydrogen mixtures with other <b>gases</b> in geological <b>strata</b> consists of the chemical reactivity induced by various classes of bacteria that consume hydrogen for their methabolism. One of the products of such reactions is methane, having higher energy potential than hydrogen, and produced from Sbatiers's reaction between H 2 and CO 2. The fundamental problem thus consists of intensifying the useful biotic reaction of methanogenesis and suppressing other hydrogenotrophic reactions caused by other colonies (sulphate-reducing, iron-reducing, acetogen bacteria). The kinetics of all these reactions represents the key element of all the theory. Multiple experimental data reveal important memory effects reflecting the non-instantaneous reaction of bacteria to sharp variation of the environment. Such memory effects give rise to the phenomena of self-organization and qualitatively change the behaviour of the system. We developed the new memory model of bacterail kinetics and biotic reactions, which is characterized by: the long memory; the presence of several types of nutrients; different types of the metabolism as respiration and biomass production; the concurrence between various colonies for nutrients. The kernel of the integral operator has been obtained by solving the inverse problem and fitting experimental data. Such a model has been integrated in the numerical simulator of the compositional multiphase flow based on the DuMux software (the open source, developed by Stuttgart university). The obtained DuMux-Biotic version has been used to model the evolution of a hypothetical underground storage of hydrogen. We have revealed the appearance of non-attenuating oscillatory regimes and chaotic behaviour caused by the memory effects, the different rates of bacterial growth and gas injection, and by the competition between various colonies for nutrients. The additional injection of CO 2 was analysed with the objective to intensify the Sabatier's reaction. The research was performed {{within the framework of the}} German project H 2 STORE...|$|R
40|$|This report details a {{regional}} {{analysis of the}} source rock quality and potential of Palaeozoic rocks of the UK Central North Sea for the 21 CXRM Palaeozoic project. The objective was to undertake {{a regional}} screening of all intervals to identify source rocks using new and legacy datasets of all Carboniferous and Devonian samples. In addition, a literature review (Appendix 1) summarises source and kerogen typing information from legacy reports. The background and stratigraphic nomenclature are given in Monaghan et al. (2016), details on individual well interpretations and stratigraphy are given in Kearsey et al. (2015). Geological context {{on the results of}} this work are included in basin modelling (Vincent, 2015) and were synthesised into a petroleum systems analysis in Monaghan et al. (2015). New and legacy Carboniferous and Devonian source rock geochemical data were examined per well using industry standard criteria to give an overview of the source rock quality, type (oil or gas prone) and maturity. The aims of this study were to classify the source rock quality of 33 wells, to examine if intervals were ‘gas-prone’ or ‘oil-prone’, and to ascertain the hydrocarbon generation stage of each well based on Rock-Eval pyrolysis, vitrinite reflectance (VR, where available) and total organic carbon (TOC) data. The term ‘gas prone’ was used to describe source rocks that have or could generate gas; ‘oil prone’ for source intervals that have or could generate oil. This study was a rapid screening exercise to identify intervals or areas of interest, and as such the data and inferences must be used concomitantly with other geological data to fully assess the source rock potential within the studied wells. It {{should be noted that the}} wells studied penetrate different parts of the geological succession and in many cases only small sections of the Devonian and Carboniferous interval. An initial sift through the wells with available geochemical data indicated that 33 wells had enough data to be usefully evaluated. Subsequently it was found that 8 of the 33 wells had incomplete, unreliable or otherwise poor source rock quality data sets and therefore were not analysed further; the reasons are detailed in this report. The remaining 25 wells selected for analysis were: 43 / 28 - 2, 26 / 07 - 1, 26 / 08 - 1, 36 / 13 - 1, 36 / 23 - 1, 38 / 16 - 1, 38 / 18 - 1, 39 / 07 - 1, 41 / 08 - 1, 42 / 10 a- 1, 42 / 10 b- 2 ST, 42 / 09 - 1, 41 / 10 - 1, 42 / 10 b- 2, 41 / 15 - 1, 43 / 21 - 2, 41 / 01 - 1, 41 / 20 - 1, 41 / 14 - 1, 43 / 02 - 1, 43 / 17 - 2, 43 / 20 b- 2, 43 / 28 - 1, 43 / 28 - 2, 44 / 13 - 1, 44 / 16 - 1. Samples analysed from the majority of these wells were interpreted to be gas prone in the Carboniferous succession (Figure 1). 1. 41 / 10 - 1, 41 / 14 - 1 and 41 / 20 - 1 contained source rocks that were both gas window mature (e. g. VR > 1. 3) and can be regarded as excellent <b>gas</b> source. <b>Strata</b> in 43 / 17 - 2, 44 / 16 - 1 and 43 / 28 - 1 were also gas mature in all or parts of the section of interest, but with variable source rock quality. The six wells all had low S 2 peaks: this may be due to either prior hydrocarbon generation and depletion or the initial presence of low amounts of non-inert kerogen. 2. 41 / 15 - 1, 42 / 10 b- 2 and 43 / 21 - 2 were also identified as possessing good gas-prone source rocks with elevated S 2 values and also a high maturity attained by the source rocks. 41 / 01 - 1 was identified as a good for gas generation in the deeper section. 3. 26 / 07 - 1, 26 / 08 - 1, 36 / 13 - 1, 38 / 16 - 1, 39 / 07 - 1, 41 / 08 - 1, 42 / 10 a- 1, 42 / 10 b- 2 ST, 42 / 09 - 1, 43 / 02 - 1, 43 / 20 b- 2, 43 / 28 - 2 and 44 / 13 - 1, contain good to excellent quality source rocks, but have not matured sufficiently to generate significant amount of gas, so these can be regarded as poor gas sources based on their current maturity. If present, in deeper basins some of these intervals will have generated significant quantities of gas...|$|R
