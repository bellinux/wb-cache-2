5000|$|A {{retrospective}} at the Jewish Museum in 1973 {{featured the}} range of Kaish's work across the previous two decades. In the exhibition catalog, Avram Kampf noted, [...] "Freed from its fixed collective symbolism, these sculptures represent an <b>inward</b> <b>voyage</b> into the hidden recesses of the artist's self, following its delicate and secret movements [...] [...] [...] It is the voyage of a mystic, a restless life-long pilgrimage, passionate, exhilarating and 'unselfing,' exploring untold regions and stages of an internal universe. These new abstract works which supersede her early more expressive or romantic ones and ultimately derive from her deep mystical inclinations place her work {{in the mainstream of}} contemporary art." ...|$|E
50|$|Having been honourably {{discharged}} from the army, he joined the merchant fleet for a year long training as a radio officer. With the war by now drawing to a close, he went to sea {{in a variety of}} ships. Shortly after, with his first class Marconi certificate, he was sailing to the far east as Chief Radio Officer in the Blue Funnel liner Titan. However, without any prospect for further promotion, his career was stalled when he resigned to take up employment in the Union Castle Line as an ordinary seaman sailing aboard their cargo liner Dromore Castle, mostly between the USA and South Africa till he was promoted Bosun. Subsequently he sat his certificates as a Watch Officer and then as Master whilst sailing with Glasgow tramp ships and then with liners of the Ellerman City Line. Whilst berthing in London's West India Docks, MacKenzie, as 2nd Officer of the City of Valencia on an <b>inward</b> <b>voyage</b> from South Africa, saw the wooden sailing ship Discovery. Inquiring of the docking pilot, his enthusiasm was fired; immediately he went aboard, seeking employment for her forthcoming voyage of scientific research and exploration in Antarctica. Shortly after, he was appointed as the ship's Chief Officer when the City Line granted him 'leave of absence with full promotion'.|$|E
40|$|The {{words like}} “Expatriate ” and “Diaspora ” need no {{introduction}} in postcolonial literary scenario. Indian diaspora, today, has emerged with the “multiplicity of histories, variety of culture, tradition, {{and a deep}} instinct for survival. ” Indian Diaspora, though counting more than 20 million members world–wide, survives in between “home of origin” and “world of adoption. ” The process of survival of the diasporic individual / community in between the “home of origin ” and the “world of adoption ” is the voyage undertaken in the whole process from “alienation ” to final “assimilation. ” Bharati Mukherjee, an Indian born Canadian / American novelist, has made a deep impression on the literary canvass. Her novels, honestly, depict the issues of her own cultural location in West Bengal in India, her displacement (alienation) from her land of origin to Canada where she was “simultaneously invisible ” {{as a writer and}} “overexposed ” as a racial minority and her final re-location (assimilation) to USA as a naturalised citizen. For the writer in The Tiger’s Daughter and Wife, the dilemma of belongingness in these two novels is a matter of flux and agony, which explores the problem of nationality, location, identity and historical memory in Canada. The “cultural diaspora-isation ” what Stuart Mall calls marks the beginning of the desire for the survival in the community of adoption. The paper aims to explore her sense of alienation in Canada where life as an immigrant was unbearable, that forced her to make an effort towards the process of economic, social and cultural adjustment. Further, the paper will explore her desire for cultural fusion in the new dwellings, which in fact, is her own <b>inward</b> <b>voyage</b> in The Middleman and Other Stories and Jasmine. Finally, she visualised “assimilation ” as on “end-product ” which implies in totality “conforming to a national culture ” of a “nationalist way of life. ...|$|E
