5|$|As traders sailed farther east, the voyages became {{longer and}} more expensivea Smaller {{enterprises}} were merged into larger ones. During the 1780s, Grigory Shelikhov began to stand out {{as one of the}} most important traders through the Shelikhov-Golikov Company. In 1784, Shelikhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in North America, at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island. Shelikhov envisioned a continual extension of the Russian maritime fur trade, with trading posts being set up farther and <b>farther</b> <b>along</b> the coast all the way to California. He sought exclusive control of the trade, and in 1788 Empress CatherineII decided to grant his company a monopoly only over the area it already occupied. Other traders were free to compete elsewhere. Catherine's decision was issued as the imperial ukase (proclamation) of September 28, 1788.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{used the}} M-13 {{designation}} for a highway {{at the end}} of 1932 that connected M-78 and M-21 through Lennon. By the middle of 1936, the highway had been extended northward to end at a junction with M-46 in Saginaw. The entire trunkline was paved in the middle of 1939. Later the next year, the section in Saginaw was extended a bit <b>farther</b> <b>along</b> Washington Avenue to end at a junction with US10 and US23. A section of the then-M-78 freeway (now I-69) opened between 1958 and 1960; when this freeway opened, M-13 was truncated northwards slightly in the Lennon area to end at the new highway. The first section of the US23 freeway around Bay City opened in late 1960 or early 1961. When it opened, MSHD extended M-13 along the former route of US23 from the northside of Saginaw into Bay City {{to the end of the}} freeway at Kawkawlin. The I-75/US23 freeway north of the Kawkawlin area to Standish opened in 1967, and M-13 is shown on maps following US23's former route through Linwood and Pinconning after the change. The routing of M-13 has stayed the same since.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaur {{evolution}} {{after the}} Triassic follows changes in vegetation {{and the location}} of continents. In the late Triassic and early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea, and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores. Gymnosperm plants (particularly conifers), a potential food source, radiated in the late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food <b>farther</b> <b>along</b> the digestive tract. The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians, spinosauroids, and carnosaurians, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like Mamenchisaurus. Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential cheek-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.|$|E

5|$|The Queens Boulevard Line was {{originally}} planned to extend <b>farther</b> <b>along</b> Hillside Avenue into eastern Queens. The line {{would have gone}} {{at least to the}} intersection of Hillside, Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (the latter two both formerly part of Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans to go as far as Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The extension to Springfield Boulevard, which on contract drawings was referred to as Route 108-Section 13, would have been a two track extension of the D3 and D4 express tracks, with five stations, at 187th Street, 197th Street, Cross Island Boulevard (today's Francis Lewis Boulevard), 214th Street, and the terminal at Springfield Boulevard. All of these stations, with the exception of Springfield Boulevard, would have had two side platforms. Hillside Avenue was widened in the 1930s between 218th Street and 229th Street, in order to accommodate construction of the proposed Springfield Boulevard station. As part of the extension of the line to 179th Street in 1950, provisions were made to extend this line farther east via Hillside Avenue. East of the 179th Street there are two four track levels both used as train storage. The upper level was intended to be extended eastward, while the lower level was always intended to be used to relay and store trains. The tracks on the upper level are longer than the lower level tracks and the upper level tracks have a wooden partition at the bumper blocks. The tracks continue until 184th Street.|$|E

25|$|A muster roll from September 10, 1775 {{showed that}} Thayer's company {{consisted}} of two lieutenants, four sergeants, four corporals, a fifer, and 79 privates. That month his company was selected to join Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec. On the morning of December 31, 1775 the Americans opened the Battle of Quebec by attacking the city. The main column under Colonel Benedict Arnold and Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Greene was led by Captain Daniel Morgan's company. Morgan's advance guard {{was followed by the}} companies of Captains John Lamb, Henry Dearborn, John Topham, and Thayer. Seven more companies formed the center and rear of the attack column. In the approach march, the column suffered some casualties from enemy fire. Since a snow storm was raging, the head of the column became disoriented and lost its direction before Thayer, who knew the way, led the soldiers on. Presently, they arrived before a barrier armed with two cannons which fired, causing further losses. As the guns were withdrawn to reload, Thayer and Morgan climbed through the gunports, followed by their men, and captured 60 of the defenders. Continuing up the street, the Americans surprised a group of Quebec militia and made them prisoners, making a total of 130. Since their own firearms were wet from the snow, the Americans appropriated the dry weapons of the Canadians. A second barrier <b>farther</b> <b>along</b> repelled all their attempts to seize it, partly because so many muskets misfired in the blizzard. After four hours of fighting, the Americans found themselves trapped and they surrendered when the British promised to grant them quarter.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of <b>Farther</b> <b>Along,</b> the Byrds {{continued}} to tour throughout 1972, but no new album or single release was forthcoming. [...] In July of that year, Gene Parsons was fired from the group {{for a number of}} reasons, including McGuinn's growing dissatisfaction with his drumming, disagreements that he and McGuinn were having over band members' pay, and his own discontent over the band's lack of morale during this period. [...] Parsons was quickly replaced with L.A. session drummer John Guerin, who remained with the Byrds until January 1973, when he decided to return to studio work. [...] Although Guerin participated in recording sessions with the band and appeared on stage with them from September 1972, he was never an official member of the Byrds and instead received a standard session musician's wage, while continuing to undertake work for other artists as an in-demand studio player. [...] Three officially released Byrds recordings exist of the McGuinn–White–Battin–Guerin line-up: live versions of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] and [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] that were recorded for the soundtrack of the Earl Scruggs' film Banjoman, and a studio recording of [...] "Bag Full of Money" [...] that was included as a bonus track on the remastered reissue of <b>Farther</b> <b>Along</b> in 2000.|$|E

500|$|On November 17, 1971, {{less than}} {{five months after the}} release of Byrdmaniax, the Byrds issued their {{eleventh}} studio album, <b>Farther</b> <b>Along.</b> [...] The album was met with slightly more enthusiastic reviews than its predecessor but nevertheless, only managed to climb to number 152 on the Billboard Top LPs chart, while failing to reach the charts in the United Kingdom altogether. [...] Musically, the album found the Byrds beginning to move away from their country rock sound—although at least half the album still bore a strong country influence—and instead, embrace a style indebted to 1950s rock 'n' roll music. [...] The Skip Battin and Kim Fowley penned song [...] "America's Great National Pastime" [...] was taken from the album and released as a single in late November, but it failed to chart {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. [...] Johnny Rogan has concluded that, ultimately, the rapidity with which the Byrds planned and recorded <b>Farther</b> <b>Along</b> resulted in an album that was just as flawed as Byrdmaniax and as a result, it failed to rehabilitate the band's ailing commercial fortunes or increase their declining audience. [...] The album's title track, sung by White with the rest of the group harmonizing, would later become a poignant and prophetic epitaph for the guitarist when it was sung by ex-Byrd Gram Parsons and the Eagles' Bernie Leadon at White's funeral in July 1973.|$|E
500|$|The five {{original}} {{members of}} the Byrds reunited briefly during late 1972, while McGuinn was still undertaking selected concerts with the Columbia Records version of the group.

[...] Plans for a reunion accelerated in mid-1972, however, when the founder of Asylum Records, David Geffen, offered each of the original band members a sizable amount of money to reform and record an album for his label. [...] The reunion actually took place in early October 1972, beginning with a rehearsal at McGuinn's house, where the group began selecting suitable material for a new album. [...] The five original Byrds booked into Wally Heider Studios in Los Angeles from October 16 until November 15, 1972, recording their first album together in seven years.|$|E
