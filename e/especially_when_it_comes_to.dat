25|$|Russian {{culture has}} a long history. Russia can claim a long {{tradition}} of dividend in many aspects of the arts, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> literature and philosophy, classical music and ballet, architecture and painting, cinema and animation and politics, which all had considerable influence on world culture. The country also has a flavorful material culture and a tradition in technology.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} {{examples}} of China's influence over the region is the Chinese Lunar New Year, {{commonly referred to as}} “Chinese New Year”. It is celebrated and is an official public holiday in many countries of the Nanyang region (Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines). Another prominent example is the original roots {{of the people in the}} region; a significant portion of the population of the Nanyang region originated in China, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Machen's strong {{opposition}} to a materialistic viewpoint is obvious in many of his works, marking him as part of neo-romanticism. He was deeply suspicious of science, materialism, commerce, and Puritanism, {{all of which were}} anathema to Machen's conservative, bohemian, mystical, and ritualistic temperament. Machen's virulent satirical streak against things he disliked has been regarded as a weakness in his work, and rather dating, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> the fore in works such as Dr Stiggins. Similarly, some of his propagandistic First World War stories also have little appeal to a modern audience.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the theatre}} began to evolve from outdoor to indoor, {{the style of}} theatre was also transformed.

25|$|Several {{reports have}} been {{published}} since the 1990s on the genetic makeup of the Siberian tiger {{and its relationship to}} other subspecies. One of the most important outcomes has been the discovery of low genetic variability in the wild population, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> maternal or mitochondrial DNA lineages. It seems that a single mtDNA haplotype almost completely dominates the maternal lineages of wild Siberian tigers. On the other hand, captive tigers appear to show higher mtDNA diversity. This may suggest that the subspecies has experienced a very recent genetic bottleneck caused by human pressure, with the founders of the captive population being captured when genetic variability was higher in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The {{roots of}} the problem go deeper, though, than the current recession. Brazil’s long-standing import {{substitution}} policy has protected locally produced goods from foreign competition, discouraging local businesses from investing heavily in research and development, as they are only competing with similar non-innovative companies operating within the same protectionist system. The consequence of this policy has been a gradual decline in Brazil’s share of global trade in recent decades, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> exports of industrial goods. The trend has even accelerated {{in the past few}} years. Between 2004 and 2013, the share of exports dropped from 14.6% to 10.8% of GDP, despite the commodities boom, a trend that cannot be explained solely by the unfavourable exchange rate’, asserts the report.|$|E
25|$|Miami International Airport (MIA) {{is one of}} {{the busiest}} {{airports}} in the United States in terms of total passenger traffic and cargo traffic, but <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> international traffic. It is considered to be the largest economic engine in Miami-Dade County, and has a large employee base. It was connected to the Metrorail system in 2012 via the only significant extension to the system in its history, the AirportLink that created the Orange Line, which most significantly led to higher service frequency in the southern portion of the existing Green Line. The connection is made at the Miami Airport Station through the MIA Mover people mover, and the station only sees about 1,500 passengers a day, much lower than many of the system's other stations. With headways cut in half, ridership rose much more on double-lined portion of the system from Earlington Heights to Dadeland South stations than the Airport Station itself. MIA has seen record growth in the 2010s, with the addition of many major international flights and carriers, though many are connecting flights, similar to Hartsfield Jackson, with Miami being a layover not a final destination.|$|E

500|$|There is no {{doctrine}} {{laid out}} in 3 John, which is strictly a personal letter, but the overall theme {{is the importance of}} hospitality, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> men who were working to spread the gospel. [...] Third John is the shortest book of the Bible by word count, though 2 John has fewer verses. It is the only New Testament book which does not contain the names [...] "Jesus" [...] or [...] "Christ".|$|E
500|$|There {{is a poor}} {{representation}} {{of women in the}} Indian workforce. [...] Females have a ten percent higher drop-out rate than males from middle and primary schools, as well as lower levels of literacy than men. [...] Since unemployment is also high in India, it is easy for employers to manipulate the law, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> women, because it is part of Indian culture for women not to argue with men. [...] Additionally, labour unions are insensitive to women's needs. [...] Women also have to settle for jobs that comply with their obligations as wives, mothers, and homemakers.|$|E
500|$|The more {{negative}} reviews include those from Nintendo Power, who criticized {{the game for}} its [...] "fixed and unforgiving" [...] camera, which they felt made the platforming experience [...] "frustrating". GameSpy also criticized the game for its camera along with its unsteady framerate, but praised the game's attractive graphics and offline co-op mode. IGN described the game as [...] "a good idea wrapped in a mediocre game", dismissing the game's music as [...] "forgettable", and hoping that the jacking concept would be refined for a possible sequel. Eurogamer was also critical of Crash of the Titans, deriding its graphics as [...] "designed primarily with the PS2 and Wii in mind, with a fairly lazy high-def makeover late in development". The PSP version received less praise than its console counterparts, with IGN remarking that it [...] "loses out to the consoles {{in a number of}} areas; <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> multiplayer".|$|E

500|$|Among {{the most}} {{critical}} voices were Sam Jordison and Michael Hann, both of The Guardian. Jordison detailed his misgivings about A Game of Thrones in a 2009 review and summarized [...] "It's daft. It's unsophisticated. It's cartoonish. And yet, I couldn't stop reading.... Archaic absurdity aside, Martin's writing is excellent. His dialogue is snappy and frequently funny. His descriptive prose is immediate and atmospheric, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> building a sense of deliciously dark foreboding [...]" [...] Hann did not consider the novels to {{stand out from the}} general fantasy genre, despite Martin's alterations to fantasy convention, although he rediscovered his childhood's views:That when things are, on the whole, pretty crappy , it's a deep joy to dive headfirst into something so completely immersive, something from which {{there is no need to}} surface from hours at a time. And if that immersion involves dragons, magic, wraiths from beyond death, shapeshifting wolves and banished princes, so be it.|$|E
500|$|In August 1823, in {{an issue}} of The Album, he {{published}} an article saying that more attention should {{be paid to the}} time period of Shakespeare's plays, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> costumes. [...] In the same year, a casual conversation led to one of Planché's more lasting effects on British theatre. He observed to Charles Kemble, the manager of Covent Garden, that [...] "while a thousand pounds were frequently lavished upon a Christmas pantomime or an Easter spectacle, the plays of Shakespeare were put upon the stage with makeshift scenery, and, at the best, a new dress or two for the principal characters". Kemble [...] "saw the possible advantage of correct appliances catching the taste of the town", and agreed to give Planché control of the costuming for the upcoming production of King John, if he would carry out the research, design the costumes and superintend the production. Planché had little experience in this area and sought the help of antiquaries such as Francis Douce and Sir Samuel Meyrick. The research involved sparked Planché's latent antiquarian interests; these came to occupy an increasing amount of his time later in life.|$|E
500|$|Identified by Ayn Bernos of Thought Catalog as [...] "the {{epitome of}} a ... control freak", Refinery29's Kelsey Miller {{summarized}} Monica's personality as funny, uptight, loving, and competitive. A very organized character with a signature Type A personality who enjoys being in charge, Monica {{is known for}} being a [...] "neat freak" [...] obsessed with cleanliness – <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> maintaining the impeccable condition of her apartment – neurotic, extremely obsessive-compulsive, and competitive in nature, personality traits that are exaggerated for humor and comic relief; the writers did not begin to take full comedic advantage of Monica's neuroses until the show's first Thanksgiving episode. The character is also the loudest of her friends. In her book Writing With Emotion, Tension, and Conflict: Techniques for Crafting an Expressive and Compelling Novel, author Cheryl St. John wrote that Monica exhibits qualities commonly associated with perfectionism and bossiness. James Tison of Bustle wrote that Monica's cleanliness and bossiness often relinquishes her to being [...] "the lame one" [...] among her friends, although [...] "she proved that sometimes rules and responsibility were important". However, the Los Angeles Timess Steve Weinstein observed that Monica's actions often tend to contradict her [...] "Miss Perfect" [...] image and reputation, explaining that the character frequently [...] "makes a fool of herself" [...] {{in addition to being}} [...] "so compulsively neat that just her facial expressions of discomfort at one of her friends' messing things up in her apartment is enough to provoke genuine chuckles." [...] Although several of Monica's personality traits and mannerisms make the character a strong candidate for obsessive-compulsive disorder, they are treated as [...] "quirky and amusing" [...] as opposed to a disability or disease; her friends either ignore or find humor in her peculiarities.|$|E

500|$|The episode has {{received}} largely positive reviews from television critics. Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his fourth favorite {{episode of the}} first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files. Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave [...] "Small Potatoes" [...] an A, saying that it [...] "isn’t the very best X-Files episode (though it’s certainly up there), but it’s perhaps the easiest episode to call your “favorite,” the most approachable episode, if you will" [...] and that while Gilligan penned better X-Files installments later, [...] "he’s never written one as effortlessly playful and inventive as this one. VanDerWerff later called the episode one of the [...] "10 must-see episodes" [...] and named it [...] "Gilligan’s finest comedic achievement". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it a 9 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode was a wonderful respite from the dark material of the season's character arcs, taking a humorous look at Mulder and his complete lack of a life. Gilligan channels Darin Morgan in many scenes, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> making scathing observations about Mulder through the soft stick of humor." [...] Furthermore, he praised Duchovny, saying that his [...] "nuanced performance" [...] was [...] "easily one of his best." [...] Topless Robot named [...] "Small Potatoes" [...] the eighth funniest episode of the series. Starpulse listed it as the eighth best episode of the series. The episode is popular with fans, specifically for the scene where Eddie, who has changed into Mulder, tries to seduce Scully in her apartment. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five and wrote that [...] "this is what Vince Gilligan has been working towards all season." [...] The two praised Gilligan's writing, applauding his decision to critically examine Mulder rather than merely tell jokes. Furthermore, the two commended the acting of Morgan, calling his casting [...] "apt". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a rave review and awarded it a rare four stars out of four. She {{described it as a}} [...] "four course meal of comic riches" [...] and praised the writing style of Giligan, calling him [...] "the believer who writes from inside the characters' heads".|$|E
2500|$|The pier and {{promenade}} {{are popular}} destinations, {{but do not}} allow dogs, bicycles or skateboards. [...] These areas are very busy during the warmer summer months, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> line-ups for gelato or fish and chips.|$|E
