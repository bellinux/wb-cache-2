25|$|An RFU {{debenture}} confers on the <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> {{the right}} to purchase, at face value, one ticket for Rugby Union events at Twickenham Stadium for a given period, currently 10 years (with {{the exception of a}} small number of business debentures in the South Stand which confer ticket rights for 15 years). A debenture is fully repayable, currently after 75 years, but bears no interest.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} Receiver concluded {{his report}} stating that ‘the Receiver for the <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> is continuing {{the business in}} the hopes of disposing of it as a going concern, but he states that having regard to the specialised and somewhat ancient type of plant he doubts whether the assets will realise sufficient to discharge the debenture liability, particularly bearing in mind the somewhat heavy claims of the preferential creditors.’ Nevertheless, Sanders Phillips and Co. Ltd took over the company in the same year. Nine months later the Parker Street premises were destroyed by fire during an air raid, but the company, operating from London offices in Norfolk Street, Strand, son established Government contracts for reproducing maps for Bomber Command, plans for M.I.8, and, after ‘D’ Day, ‘communication maps’ which were collected by the R.A.F. and flown direct to France.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{example of}} {{debenture}} holders having rights to seats at venues was the Royal Albert Hall in London, where about 1,200 of the hall's 5,500 seats were provided on 999-year leases {{when it opened}} in 1871 to help finance its construction costs, allowing access to most of its music, sporting and other events, subject to an annual service charge. [...] The debentures can be passed on or sold, and the tickets to individual events can be resold if the <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> does not wish to attend.|$|E
25|$|The organisers of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, The All England Club, issue their <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> {{a ticket}} for {{each day of the}} tournament. Furthermore, only <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> are {{permitted}} to sell their tickets to third parties, either privately or through vendors such as WimbledonDebentureHolders.com.|$|R

2500|$|In sport, a {{debenture}} {{is defined}} as a certificate of agreement of loans which is given under the company's stamp and carries an undertaking that the <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> will get a fixed return (fixed on the basis of interest rates) and the principal amount whenever the debenture matures. The terms may also include ancillary benefits such as an option to buy tickets at a favourable price, as well as or instead of interest. [...] The term stems from the financial concept of a debenture.|$|E
50|$|The <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> then contested {{that those}} sums were {{caught by the}} debenture, and should {{be paid to the}} <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> in {{preference}} to the general body of creditors.|$|E
50|$|After the Company's {{failure in}} 1895 {{it was sold}} to its <b>debenture</b> <b>holder,</b> John Brightling, who {{continued}} to operate the line until its sale to the Christchurch Tramway Board in 1906.|$|E
2500|$|The {{company was}} placed in {{receivership}} on the application of its <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> in 1912, despite the business being [...] "much more promising than for some time past". The cause of this was a proposal to issue prior lien debentures {{to the value of}} £50,000, a move which would dilute the position of existing <b>debenture</b> <b>holders.</b> It was reported that the company might be restructured in order to resolve this issue.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposed}} share issuance {{was heavily}} under subscribed, and in September of 1953 the <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> appointed receivers. The proposed scheme was formally abandoned by {{a resolution of}} the board of directors in January 1954. The <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> issued a summons for directions as to whether the subscription monies which were received formed part of the assets of the company or were held on trust for the persons who subscribed for shares.|$|R
5000|$|Peter Johnson, {{author of}} {{numerous}} WHR books, notes that [...] "The debentures were not actually secured and, in 1923, the local authorities made the WHR agree to be party to a mortgage deed defining the terms of interest and principal repayment." [...] This placed the <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> in a strong position. Following council boundary changes, the main <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> were the Department of Transport (some 42%), Carnarvonshire County Council (later Gwynedd CC) 17.7%, Merioneth District Council 3.5%, Dwyfor District Council 13%, McAlpines 11.8%, Branch Nominees Ltd 11.7% with 0.1% thought untraceable through a Mrs Conbran/Sir John Stewart.|$|R
5000|$|Brightlife Ltd had {{a charge}} over book debts {{in favour of}} Norandex, its bank. The charge {{said it was a}} [...] "first {{specific}} charge" [...] and did not allow Brightlife to sell, factor or discount debts without written consent. A <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> gave the company a notice converting the floating charge into a fixed charge a week before a voluntary winding up resolution was passed. Counsel argued public policy required restriction on crystallising events, one reason being that an automatic crystallisation clause could take effect without knowledge of company or <b>debenture</b> <b>holder.</b> It could be prejudicial to a third party, because it does not get registered. Counsel referred to the Canadian case R v Consolidated Churchill Copper Corp Ltd, where Berger J rejected the concept of a [...] "self generating crystallisation".|$|E
50|$|Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corp Ltd 1992 UKPC 34 is a New Zealand {{insolvency}} law case {{decided by the}} Judicial Committee of the Privy Council concerning {{the nature and extent}} of the liability of a mortgagee, or a receiver and manager, to a mortgagor or a subsequent <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> for his actions.|$|E
50|$|Debentures are {{generally}} freely transferable by the <b>debenture</b> <b>holder.</b> Debenture holders have no rights {{to vote in}} the company's general meetings of shareholders, but they may have separate meetings or votes e.g. on changes to the rights attached to the debentures. The interest paid to them is a charge against profit in the company's financial statements.|$|E
5000|$|A {{scheme of}} {{arrangement}} (or a [...] "scheme of reconstruction") is a court-approved agreement between {{a company and}} its shareholders or creditors (e.g. lenders or <b>debenture</b> <b>holders).</b> It may affect mergers and amalgamations and may alter shareholder or creditor rights.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the company}} {{liquidator}} {{argued that the}} accountants should only be paid after preferential creditors and <b>debenture</b> <b>holders.</b> In this case, {{there was no money}} left. The judge at first instance, Sir Owen Temple Morris QC, held that the accountants had priority. The liquidator appealed.|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, Southern {{granted a}} {{floating}} charge over all its assets as {{security for the}} debenture issued to the public to the trustee of the <b>debenture</b> <b>holders,</b> MLC Nominee. The prospectuses for the debentures offered explicitly stated that the Hotel Terrigal was owned by Southern.|$|R
5000|$|The case {{related to}} an appeal by a <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> against an order of Malins VC. The appeal came before Sir G.M. Giffard LJ. The issue centred upon the company's ability to assign all of its [...] "{{undertaking}}" [...] to a mortgagee, and whether undertaking included the proceeds of sale of vessels belonging to the company.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{rejection}} by WHLR (1964) Ltd of the FR plan {{to act as}} landlord, the FR realised {{that the only way}} to prevent the sale of the trackbed to GCC, was to challenge the application to the High Court by the OR, to sell the trackbed to GCC. However, the FR was not a share or <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> in the old WHLR company and thus it had no standing to be part of the High Court hearing.|$|E
25|$|The {{company would}} have {{probably}} survived the trade depression of the late 1870s {{were it not for}} the untimely intervention of one of the old Llynvi company's <b>Debenture</b> <b>Holders,</b> probably George Moffatt, former chairman of the Llynvi Coal and Iron Co Ltd. Moffatt decided to withdraw his large debenture holding in December 1877, a move which would have resulted in bankruptcy proceedings with disastrous consequences for the <b>debenture</b> <b>holders.</b> As a result, the holders opted for the lesser evil of voluntary liquidation. The merger of 1871–2 proved to be disastrous for the Brogdens as they forfeited effective control over their Welsh enterprises, and expanded their exposure to iron, at a time when the south Wales wrought iron trade was about to enter a period of terminal decline.|$|R
50|$|In December 2009 Hanover Group <b>debenture</b> <b>holders,</b> note holders {{and bond}} holders voted {{in favour of}} {{swapping}} their debentures, notes and bonds for shares in Allied Farmers Limited (NZX: ALF).

5000|$|Fearing a poor outcome, First City then offered Downsview Nominees all moneys owing {{under the}} first {{debenture}} (so it would be redeemed and First City could take charge), or alternatively to sell its second debenture to Downsview on similar terms, but this offer was declined. Glen Eden issued a third debenture to Downsview and Russell carried on the business, losing a further $500,000. First City claimed that Russell (as receiver) and Downsview Nominees (as prior <b>debenture</b> <b>holder)</b> had violated their duties to First City to: ...|$|E

60|$|It is {{scarcely}} {{too much to}} say that a very large proportion of our modern great properties, tramway systems, railways, gas-works, bread companies, have been created for their present owners the <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> and mortgagers, the great capitalists, by the unintentional altruism of that voluntary martyr, the Saving Small Man.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to being a <b>debenture</b> <b>holder,</b> GCC claimed it had run up costs maintaining the railway's structures since the railway closed. Consequently, a deal began to emerge whereby the money GCC was owed by the WHLR, would be offset against the perceived value of the trackbed and thus GCC would acquire the trackbed for only a nominal sum. As this would mean the OR would no longer be selling to the highest bidder, he would need to get a court ruling, which would over-rule any objections from other debenture holders and authorise him to go through with the sale.|$|E
50|$|Mactrac Ltd was {{a company}} {{carrying}} {{on the business}} of builders and civil engineers. Mactrac Ltd was the beneficial owner of 100% of the issued share capital in C&K (Construction) Ltd. On 3 March 1962 a receiver was appointed withg respect to Mactrac Ltd by a <b>debenture</b> <b>holder.</b> Accounts would later show {{that at this time}} the company had a deficiency of assets against liabilities in the total sum of £389,977. On 21 May 1962 a petition of the compulsory winding-up of Mactrac Ltd was presented, and an order to that effect was made on 4 June 1962.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Templeman {{was also}} renowned for his {{colourful}} language. In Borden (UK) Ltd v Scottish Timber Products Ltd 1979 3 WLR 672 at 686 he remarked:"At some distant date, {{when the court}} has unearthed the unearthable, traced the untraceable and calculated the incalculable, there will emerge the sum which it is said belongs to the plaintiffs in equity, a sum which is immune from the claims of Crown and mortgagee, <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> and creditor, a sum secured to the plaintiffs by a simple retention of title clause, which referred only to resin but was pregnant with all the consequences alleged in the statement of claim and hidden from the gaze of all other persons who dealt with the defendants." ...|$|E
25|$|There was a {{restructuring}} of the company on 27 July 1925, a scheme of arrangement being made with shareholders and <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> such that the capital was reduced from £330,000 to £198,192. The following year saw the company take on the drawings and patterns of John Musgrave & Sons following the closure of that business.|$|R
40|$|India has {{the dubious}} {{distinction}} of being among the countries where it takes the longest time to go through bankruptcy in the world (10 years on average). Consequently, recovery rates are also very low. With {{the introduction of new}} company’s act 2013 opened a new hope to companies facing a tough time. Incorporation of NCLT and NCLAT in new act and removal of multiple regulators like BIFR and intervention of High court are good initiative. It also broadened the scope of different types of companies coming under this law. Further chapter 7 and 11 type of codes are required to speed up the re organisation and liquidation process. On rights of <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> still things needed to be addressed. SURFAESI act and provisions of DRT’s can be further extended to <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> in the line of Banks and Financial institutions for recovery of debts...|$|R
50|$|Vaughan Williams J held, reluctantly, {{that money}} {{recovered}} during liquidation from in proceedings under section 10 of the Companies (Winding-up) Act 1890 and by calls on contributories, belong to <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> charging all the undertaking and {{property of the}} company, when total assets are not enough. Costs for such proceedings must be paid first out of money recovered in those proceedings.|$|R
