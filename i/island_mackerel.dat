50|$|The <b>island</b> <b>{{mackerel}}</b> (Rastrelliger faughni) is {{a species}} of true mackerel in the scombrid family (Scombridae) from the Indo-Pacific. Their maximum reported length is 20 cm, and the maximum reported weight is 0.75 kg.|$|E
50|$|Scombrids {{have two}} dorsal fins {{and a series}} of finlets behind the rear dorsal fin and anal fin. The caudal fin is {{strongly}} divided and rigid, with a slender, ridged base. The first (spiny) dorsal fin and the pelvic fins are normally retracted into body grooves. Species lengths vary from the 20 cm of the <b>island</b> <b>mackerel</b> to the 4.58 m recorded for the immense Atlantic bluefin tuna.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} the largest {{of a group of}} ten <b>islands</b> called the <b>Mackerel</b> <b>Islands.</b> Only two islands in the group, Thevenard and Direction Islands, have {{accommodation}} for tourists. The <b>Mackerel</b> <b>Islands</b> airstrip, complete with a 1000 m paved runway, is found on Thevenard.|$|R
50|$|Mackerel scad usually live in {{subtropical}} seas at depths up to 400 m. They prefer clear water, and {{are frequently}} found around <b>islands.</b> Although <b>mackerel</b> scad {{have been found}} at the surface, they are usually caught at depths between 40 and 200 meters. They feed mainly on zooplankton.|$|R

The western distinct population segment (WDPS) of Steller sea lion is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, and the species population in the Aleutian Islands is declining. Atka mackerel and Pacific cod are principal prey species for Steller sea lions in the Aleutian Islands. This proposed action would revise management of the Atka mackerel and Pacific cod fisheries to ensure the effects of these fisheries are not likely to result in jeopardy of extinction or adverse modification or destruction of critical habitat for the WDPS of Steller sea lions.

5|$|A {{group of}} 17people, {{initially}} considered missing, rode {{out the storm}} on the offshore <b>Mackerel</b> <b>Island.</b> Onshore, officials closed a portion of Highway 1 {{as well as other}} roads in the area. Ahead of the storm, hundreds of residents in older structures and mobile homes, as well as an aborigine village near Onslow, were ordered to evacuate to safer locations. Five iron mines were closed during the storm's passage, forcing the 1,500workers to return home. The disruptions from the cyclone affected about 340,000tonnes of lost production. About 800,000barrels of lost oil production resulted from closed offshore platforms. Oil fields reopened by 14April.|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} the chub {{mackerel}} Scomber japonicus (Houttuyn, 1782) off the Canary Islands was determined by length-frequency analysis. The total length was measured in 3858 individuals captured south-west of Gran Canaria (Canary lslands) from March 1988 to July 1990. The length range was wide (13 - 48 cm total length) and the frequencies were very variable. The class modes, identified by using the method of Bhattacharya (1967), corresponded to the age-groups 0 - 5 years. The value of the theoretical maximum length obtained {{by means of the}} method of Wetherall, Polovina and Ralston (1987) was 47. 3 cm. The values of the parameters of the seasonally oscillating Von Bertalanffy growth equation, determined by the method of Pauly and David (I 981), were L∞= 49. 50 cm, k = 0. 23 year˄- 1, C = 0. 650 and WP = 0. 800. The length frequency analysis provided very satisfactory results for the Canary <b>Islands</b> chub <b>mackerel.</b> These results were very similar to those obtained by reading otoliths. Se determinó el crecimiento de la caballa Scomber japonicus (Houttuyn, 1782) de las islas Canarias a través del análisis de las frecuencias de tallas. La longitud total fue medida en 3858 ejemplares capturados al suroeste de Gran Canaria (islas Canarias) entre los meses de marzo de 1988 y julio de 1990. El rango de tallas fue amplio (13 - 48 cm de longitud total) y su abundancia relativa variable. Las tallas modales discriminadas mediante el método de Bhattacharya (1967) correspondieron a los grupos de edad de 0 a 5 años. El valor de la longitud máxima teórica, obtenida por aplicación del método de Wetherall, Polovina y Ralston (1987), fue 47, 3 cm. Los valores de los parámetros de la ecuación de crecimiento estacional oscilatorio de Von Bertalanffy, obtenidos por el método de Pauly y David (1981), fueron L∞= 49, 50 cm, k = 0, 23 año˄- 1, C = 0, 650 y W = 0, 800. Los métodos de análisis de frecuencia de tallas ofrecieron resultados muy satisfactorios para la caballa de las islas Canarias.

50|$|In the North Pacific, small {{schooling}} {{fish and}} krill are major food items. They feed exclusively on Pacific herring {{in the northern}} Okhotsk Sea and only on Alaska pollock east of Sakhalin <b>Island.</b> Japanese <b>mackerel</b> (found in 61 per cent of sampled stomachs) and Pacific saury (18%) are consumed east of the southern Kuril Islands, with only the former species being found in whales sampled in September and the latter species likewise only being found in whales taken in October. Euphausiids make up {{nearly two-thirds of the}} diet (62%) around the western Aleutian Islands, with unidentified fish (19%) constituting most of the rest. On the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido they mainly feed on euphausiids (55%), but also take sardine (24%) and sand lance (13%); on the Pacific side of Hokkaido, they feed almost exclusively on sardine (99%). In Sanriku, sardine makes up the bulk of the diet (54%), but euphausiids also play an important part (32%) - only a small percentage (9%) fed on sand lance. Euphausiids were a major food item on the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido and off Sanriku in the spring (71, 72 and 62% from April-June in the former area, and 83% in April in the latter area), while sardine dominated the diet in the summer in both areas (71% in September for the former region, and 70, 92, and 93% from May-July in the latter region). More recent data from Japanese scientific catches in the western North Pacific shows Japanese anchovy to be a major component of the diet in two of the three sub-areas (60 per cent by weight in sub-area 7 and 37.4% in sub-area 8), while Pacific saury was the major food item in sub-area 9 (64.6%) and played {{an important part of the}} diet in sub-area 8 (36.4%). Euphausiids (9.2% in all areas combined), Alaska pollock (7.8% in sub-area 7), minimal armhook squid (4.9% in sub-area 9), and mackerel were also consumed. They are thought to feed on juvenile herring and probably sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) around the San Juan Islands, while in the Monterey Bay region they have been observed feeding on baitfish - probably northern anchovy, which is abundant there.|$|R
