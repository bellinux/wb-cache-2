5|$|Jolie's {{public image}} is {{strongly}} tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal. Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of other celebrity women.|$|E
5|$|Abovian was <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of {{his time}} and {{virtually}} none of his works was published during his lifetime. Only after {{the establishment of the}} Armenian SSR was Abovian accorded the recognition and stature he merited. Abovian is {{regarded as one of the}} foremost figures not just in Armenian literature but Armenian history at large. Abovian's influence on Western Armenian literature was not as strong as it was on Eastern Armenian, particularly in its formative years.|$|E

5|$|Entering the race, {{the only}} two drivers still in {{contention}} for the IndyCar Championship were Ganassi's Franchitti and Penske's Power. Franchitti was 18 points ahead of Power, retaking the championship points lead from him with a second-place finish at the 2011 Kentucky Indy 300 two weeks prior. Power was still mathematically in the points race despite an awful finish at Kentucky, but needed to finish <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of Franchitti {{in order to win}} the championship title.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{anatomical}} drawings {{include many}} {{studies of the}} human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it {{in a manner that}} prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus in utero. The drawings and notation are <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.|$|E
5|$|Brooks then {{won gold}} {{as part of}} the winning 4100m {{freestyle}} relay, anchoring the team of Fasala, Delany and Graeme Brewer to a victory by almost three seconds, putting in a split of 50.56s. The shaven-headed quartet was dubbed the Mean Machine. He collected another gold in the medley relay, combining with David Orbell, Evans and Jon Sieben, this time completing his freestyle anchor leg in 50.44s. Canada had finished the race <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of the Australians, but were disqualified for an early changeover. After the games, Brooks completed the American college season before returning to Australia. He was named as Western Australia's Sportsman of the Year.|$|E

5|$|By 23:30 on her own, Moltke {{encountered}} four British dreadnoughts, {{from the}} rear division of the 2nd Battle Squadron. Moltkes commander Kapitän von Karpf ordered the ship to swing away, hoping {{he had not been}} detected. The British ships in fact had seen Moltke, but had decided to not open fire in order to not reveal their location to the entire German fleet. At 23:55, and again at 00:20, Kapitän von Karpf tried to find a path through the British fleet, but both times was unable to do so. It was not until 01:00, after having steamed <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of the Grand Fleet, that Moltke was able to make good her escape.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{commentators}} consider Staunton's {{understanding of}} positional play {{to have been}} <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of his contemporaries'. Although not an all-out attacking player, he attacked when his preparations were complete. His chess articles and books were widely read and encouraged the development of chess in the United Kingdom, and his Chess-Player's Handbook (1847) was a reference for decades. The chess openings the English Opening and Staunton Gambit were named for his advocacy of them. Staunton has been a controversial figure since his own time, and his chess writings could be spiteful. On the other hand, he maintained good working relationships with several strong players and influential chess enthusiasts, and demonstrated excellent management skills.|$|E
5|$|Reception {{towards the}} {{introduction}} of Takedowns was highly positive. Reviewers admired the impact that Takedowns had in transforming the boost mechanic and shifting the game's focus to a more aggressive style of driving. GamesTM {{pointed out that the}} hostile behaviour of AI rivals supplemented the system by presenting more opportunities to perform Takedowns, culminating in an intense and dramatic racing experience. Lopez explained that Burnout 3 had intelligently integrated elements of vehicular combat games by introducing Takedowns. Gerstmann commended the game's use of Impact Time and Aftertouch mechanics, which he believed made crashing an entertaining aspect of the game unlike other racers. IGN's Fran Mirabella III was amazed by the crash system; he considered it to be <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of anything that had been done before.|$|E

5|$|This {{pattern was}} {{repeated}} in the final. Fraser and Crapp were <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of the field, finishing in 1 minute 2.0 seconds and 1 minute 2.3 seconds, respectively. Leech overtook the United States' Joan Rosazza in the final 25 metres to take bronze in 1 minute 5.1 seconds. The race for third place had been tight, with just 0.7 of a second separating Leech and the final finisher. The youngest swimmer in the field, Leech had come through to claim the last podium position. Leech {{said that it was}} an emotional occasion, having seen the Australian men take a trifecta in the corresponding event on the previous night of racing.|$|E
5|$|Alfa Romeo {{dominated}} {{the rest of}} the Grand Prix season. Nuvolari and Campari drove the newly introduced Alfa Romeo P3 at the Italian Grand Prix, while Borzacchini and Caracciola drove much heavier 8Cs. Caracciola was forced to retired when his car broke down, but he took over Borzacchini's car when the Italian was hit by a stone, and came third, behind Nuvolari and Fagioli. In the French Grand Prix, Caracciola, now driving a P3, battled Nuvolari for the lead early on. Alfa Romeo's dominance was so great and their cars so <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> the team could choose the top three finishing positions, thus Nuvolari won from Borzacchini and Caracciola, with the two Italians ahead of the German. The order was different at the 1932 German Grand Prix, where Caracciola won from Nuvolari and Borzacchini.|$|E
5|$|All the same, between 1853 and the 1930s, fiscal {{instability}} was a transitory phenomenon. The depressions of 1873–77 and 1890–91 {{played a}} crucial role in fostering the rise of industry: timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s, industry grew with each crisis in response to the need of a damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import-substitution. By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in commercial activities. In 1913, the country's income per head was on a par with that of France and Germany, and <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of Italy's or Spain's. At the end of 1913, Argentina had a gold stock of £59 million, or 3.7% of the world's monetary gold, while representing 1.2% of the world's economic output.|$|E
50|$|If agreed, {{there was}} the {{possibility}} of playing at a handicap, e.g. Black two games out of three, if one player went <b>far</b> enough <b>ahead.</b> This could be reinforced to one player always taking Black, a handicap equivalent to two professional ranks, in extreme cases. For details see professional go handicaps. An uchikomi jūbango was one in which 'beating down' applied.|$|R
50|$|In many cases, the {{commander}} may act upon a force-oriented route reconnaissance {{by which the}} enemy could influence movement along that route. For the reconnaissance platoons, or squads, stealth and speed—in conjunction with detailed intelligence-reporting—are most important and crucial. The reconnaissance platoon must remain <b>far</b> enough <b>ahead</b> of the maneuver force to assist in early warning and to prevent the force from becoming surprised.|$|R
25|$|Räikkönen {{went on to}} {{take his}} 16th pole {{position}} in France, which was the 200th pole for Scuderia Ferrari. Räikkönen dominated the race as he set the fastest lap and had a six-second lead until a bank exhaust failure some halfway through the race reduced his engine's power. He gave up the lead to his teammate Massa, but was <b>far</b> enough <b>ahead</b> of Toyota's Jarno Trulli, to secure second place and eight points.|$|R
5|$|As a {{commander}} Marlborough preferred battle over slow moving siege warfare. Aided by an expert staff (particularly his carefully selected aides-de-camp such as Cadogan), {{as well as}} enjoying a close personal relationship with the talented Imperial commander, Prince Eugene, Marlborough proved far-sighted, often <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of his contemporaries in his conceptions, and was a master at assessing his enemy's characteristics in battle. Marlborough {{was more likely to}} manoeuvre than his opponents, and was better at maintaining operational tempo at critical times, yet the Duke qualifies more as a great practitioner within the constraints of early 18th century warfare, rather than as a great innovator who radically redefined military theory. Nevertheless, his predilection for fire, movement, and co-ordinated all-arms attacks, lay at the root of his great battlefield successes.|$|E
5|$|Despite her 50 guns, Centurions {{armament}} {{left her}} vulnerable as most were carronades, short-range heavy cannon that were useless {{in the face}} of the long-range gunnery from Marengo. Centurion consequently suffered severe damage and by 13:15 had been holed, with her rigging wrecked and her anchor cable shot through, which caused her to slowly drift away from the shore, out of control. Seeing that his opponent was disabled, Linois decided not to press the attack and issued orders for his squadron, accompanied by their prize, to sail away. Lind gradually regained control of his ship and even managed to raise some sail in pursuit, but the French were too <b>far</b> <b>ahead.</b> After some final parting shots, Centurion anchored as her crew set about repairing the damage. Linois remained within sight for the rest of the day, but showed no sign of renewing the action; he disappeared on the north-east horizon at dusk.|$|E
5|$|During June–September 1917, Bellerophon {{served as}} the junior {{flagship}} of the 4th BS while the regular flagship was being refitted. The Grand Fleet sortied {{on the afternoon of}} 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of the British, and no shots were fired. In October, Superb and Temeraire were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet and Superb became the fleet flagship. The ship led an Allied squadron that entered the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, on 13 November, following the Armistice of Mudros. Bellerophon was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the German fleet surrendered on 21 November and she became a gunnery training ship in March 1919 at the Nore as the class was obsolescent.|$|E

5|$|Evans was {{a visionary}} who {{produced}} designs and ideas <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of their time. He {{was the first}} to describe vapor-compression refrigeration and propose a design for the first refrigerator in 1805, but it would be three decades until his colleague Jacob Perkins would be able to construct a working example. Similarly, he drew up designs for a solar boiler, machine gun, steam-carriage gearshift, dough-kneading machine, perpetual baking oven, marine salvage process, quadruple-effect evaporator, and a scheme for urban gas lighting, ideas and designs which would not be made reality until some time after his death. Evans had influential backers and political allies, but lacked social graces and was disliked by many of his peers. Disappointed and then angry at the perceived lack of recognition for his contributions, Evans became combative and bitter in later years, which damaged his reputation and left him isolated. Despite the importance of his work, his contributions were frequently overlooked (or attributed to others after his death) so he never became a household name alongside the other steam pioneers of his era.|$|E
5|$|On hearing Donnelly's report, Duncan {{immediately}} despatched a small squadron to {{the mouth}} of the Texel to wait for the arrival of the Batavian squadron. Command of this squadron was given to Captain Lawrence Halstead in the 36gun frigate HMS Phoenix, accompanied by Pegasus, Sylph and the 50gun fourth rate HMS Leopard. The squadron detached at 05:00 and almost immediately the Batavian squadron was sighted to the southeast, heading for the entrance to the Texel, tacking against the northwest wind. Halstead's force was not unified, with Pegasus and Sylph <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of Phoenix and Leopard, and the British commander decided to deliberately detach his forces, the faster Pegasus and Sylph pursuing the brigs under Donnelly's command and Halstead's rear force attacking the frigate Argo. Duncan's main fleet, some distance behind Halstead, also sighted the Batavian squadron and joined the chase.|$|E
5|$|On {{the opening}} day of the Second Battle of El Alamein, Kippenberger led his brigade, which had spent much of the {{previous}} weeks in defensive lines, in an attack on Miteirya Ridge during which it achieved all of its objectives. In contrast to three months earlier at Ruweisat Ridge, he took care to establish his headquarters as far forward as possible prior to the commencement of the battle to minimise communication difficulties with the units of the brigade. Despite this, he still lost contact with the leading 23rd Battalion which quickly overwhelmed its opposition. In fact, the battalion had advanced so quickly that it arrived at its final objective so <b>far</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule that it believed it had only reached its first objective and so advanced even further. The battalion's commander blamed his unit's eagerness for a rapid advance on Kippenberger's inspirational pre-battle speech which particularly enthused his men.|$|E

25|$|Instead of slowing, George {{kept the}} pace, and Cummings {{struggled}} to keep up. Halfway through the final lap, Cummings gave up and started to walk, and since winning was the main concern today, George slowed to a walk when he was <b>far</b> enough <b>ahead.</b> Cummings, urged by his boosters, started to run again, which caused George to start to run again. He beat Cummings by some 65 yards {{in a time of}} 4:20, remarkably fast given his leisurely last lap.|$|R
