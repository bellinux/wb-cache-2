25|$|On an {{absolute}} scale, the lowest incomes saw the greatest gains in percentage terms {{and the highest}} incomes actually declined. Half {{of those in the}} bottom 20% in 1996 saw their income at least double during these years, and the median income of the top 1996 top 1% declined by 25.8%. The reason that the results are so inconsistent with household income statistics is that household statistics <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>track</b> the same people over time; it is important to specify how many of the households in the top 1% in a given year were still there when looking at that category years later and gauging income gains.|$|E
500|$|In the United States, nativity figurines are {{sometimes}} stolen from outdoor {{public and private}} displays during the Christmas season in an act that is generally called Baby Jesus theft. [...] The thefts are usually pranks with figurines recovered {{within a few hours}} or days of their disappearances. [...] Some have been damaged beyond repair or defaced with profanity, antisemitic epithets, or Satanic symbols. It is unclear if Baby Jesus theft is on the rise as United States federal law enforcement officials <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>track</b> such theft. Some communities protect outdoor nativity scenes with surveillance cameras or GPS devices concealed within the figurines.|$|E

Critics pointed out that a new patent Google was granted in April 2011, for greatly enhanced user tracking through web advertising, will provide much more detailed information on user behavior and that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>track</b> would hurt Google's ability to exploit this.

2500|$|The Electrostatic Model {{developed}} by Dougherty and coworkers describes trends in binding energy based on differences in electrostatic attraction. It {{was found that}} interaction energies of cation-π pairs correlate well with electrostatic potential above the π face of arenes: for eleven Na+-aromatic adducts, the variation in binding energy between the different adducts could be completely rationalized by electrostatic differences. Practically, this allows trends to be predicted qualitatively based on visual representations of [...] {{for a series of}} arenes. It should be noted that electrostatic attraction is not the only component of cation-π bonding. For example, 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene interacts with cations despite having a negligible quadrupole moment. While non-electrostatic forces are present, these components remain similar over a wide variety of arenes, making the electrostatic model a useful tool in predicting relative binding energies. The other “effects” contributing to binding are not well understood. Polarization, [...] and charge-transfer interactions have been implicated; however, energetic trends <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>track</b> well with the ability of arenes and cations to take advantage of these effects. For example, if induced dipole was a controlling effect, aliphatic compounds such as cyclohexane should be good cation-π partners (but are not).|$|E

50|$|In mid-2010, Mayer {{and another}} Stanford {{researcher}} Arvind Narayanan argued for <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> in HTTP headers.

5000|$|Among {{the major}} Internet browsers and search engines, the <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> {{policy has been}} quite controversial. For instance, Google’s {{contentious}} privacy settings, effective earlier this year, raised questions of how companies would interpret and implement the <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> policy. Microsoft has recently implemented a <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> option into its Internet Explorer 10 browser as its default setting, which has instigated a number of public comments and critique from major companies. Sarah Downey, from Abine, commented on Fox Business Network {{that even if you}} opt-in on the <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> option, advertisers can still collect your data and track your behavior. Abine created a <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> Plus add-on that claims to completely block tracking. Downey continues to state that the in-browser <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> option is a more of a [...] "voluntary message" [...] or a [...] "request, not an obligation" [...] to the advertisers not to track you.|$|E

5000|$|On September 7, 2012, Roy Fielding, {{an author}} of the <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> standard, {{submitted}} a change to the source code of the Apache HTTP Server, which would make the server explicitly ignore any use of the <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> header by users of Internet Explorer 10. Fielding asserted that Microsoft's decision [...] "deliberately violates" [...] the <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> specification because it [...] "does not protect anyone's privacy unless the recipients believe it was set by a real human being, with a real preference for privacy over personalization." [...] The <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> specification did not explicitly mandate {{that the use of}} <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> actually be a choice until after the feature was implemented in Internet Explorer 10. Fielding pointed out that Microsoft knew its false signals claiming that users had chosen <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> would be ignored, and that its goal was to effectively give an illusion of privacy while still catering to their own interests. On October 9, 2012, Fielding's patch was commented out, restoring the previous behavior.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> (DNT) header is the {{proposed}} HTTP header field [...] that requests that a web application disable either its tracking or cross-site user tracking (the ambiguity remains unresolved) {{of an individual}} user. The <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> header was originally proposed in 2009 by researchers Christopher Soghoian, Sid Stamm, and Dan Kaminsky. Efforts to standardize <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> by the W3C in the Tracking Preference Expression (DNT) Working Group are currently advanced at Candidate Recommendation status (as of 20 August 2015).|$|E
5000|$|When {{using the}} [...] "Express" [...] {{settings}} upon installation, a <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> option is enabled by default for Internet Explorer 10 and Windows 8. Microsoft faced criticism for {{its decision to}} enable <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> by default from advertising companies, who say that use of the <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> header should be a choice made by the user and must not be automatically enabled. The companies also said that this decision would violate the Digital Advertising Alliance's agreement with the U.S. government to honor a <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Track</b> system, because the coalition said it would only honor such a system {{if it were not}} enabled by default by web browsers. A Microsoft spokesperson defended its decision however, stating that users would prefer a web browser that automatically respected their privacy.|$|E
