25|$|In photography, {{dynamic range}} is {{measured}} in exposure value (EV) differences (known as stops). An increase of one EV, or 'one stop', represents a doubling {{of the amount of}} light. Conversely, a decrease of one EV represents a halving of the amount of light. Therefore, revealing detail in the darkest of shadows requires high exposures, while preserving detail in very bright situations requires very low exposures. Most cameras cannot provide this range of <b>exposure</b> <b>values</b> within a single exposure, due to their low dynamic range.|$|E
500|$|In photography, <b>exposure</b> <b>values</b> are {{measured}} in terms of the binary logarithm of the amount of light reaching the film or sensor, in accordance with the Weber–Fechner law describing a logarithmic response of the human visual system to light. A single stop of exposure is one unit on a base- logarithmic scale. More precisely, the exposure value of a photograph is defined as ...|$|E
500|$|Thus, [...] {{is related}} to the number of decimal digits of a {{positive}} integer x: the number of digits is the smallest integer strictly bigger than log10x. For example, [...] is approximately 3.15. The next integer is 4, which is the number of digits of 1430. Both the natural logarithm and the logarithm to base two are used in information theory, corresponding to the use of nats or bits as the fundamental units of information, respectively. Binary logarithms are also used in computer science, where the binary system is ubiquitous, in music theory, where a pitch ratio of two (the octave) is ubiquitous and the cent is the binary logarithm (scaled by 1200) of the ratio between two adjacent equally-tempered pitches, and in photography to measure <b>exposure</b> <b>values.</b>|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{combinations}} of shutter speed and f-number {{can give the}} same <b>exposure</b> <b>value</b> (E.V.). According to <b>exposure</b> <b>value</b> formula, doubling the exposure time doubles the amount of light (subtracts 1 EV). Reducing the aperture size at multiples of one over the square root of two lets half as much light into the camera, usually at a predefined scale of f/1, f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, f/22, and so on. For example, f/8 lets 4 times more light into the camera as f/16 does. A shutter speed of 1/50 s with an 4.0 aperture gives the same <b>exposure</b> <b>value</b> as a 1/100 s shutter speed with an 2.8 aperture, and also the same <b>exposure</b> <b>value</b> as a 1/200 s shutter speed with an 2.0 aperture, or 1/25th second at f/5.6.|$|R

50|$|In photography, <b>exposure</b> <b>value</b> (EV) is {{a number}} that {{represents}} {{a combination of a}} camera's shutter speed and f-number, such that all combinations that yield the same exposure have the same EV (for any fixed scene luminance). <b>Exposure</b> <b>value</b> is also used to indicate an interval on the photographic exposure scale, with a difference of 1 EV corresponding to a standard power-of-2 exposure step, commonly referred to as a stop.|$|R

5000|$|Starting 1954, the {{so-called}} <b>Exposure</b> <b>Value</b> Scale (EVS), originally known as Light Value Scale (LVS), {{was adopted by}} Rollei, Hasselblad, Voigtländer, Braun, Kodak, Seikosha, Aires, Konica, Olympus, Ricoh and others, introducing lenses with coupled shutters and apertures, such that, after setting the <b>exposure</b> <b>value,</b> adjusting either the shutter speed or aperture made a corresponding adjustment in the other to maintain a constant exposure. On some models, the coupling of shutter speed and aperture setting was optional, so that photographers could choose their preferred method of working depending on the situation.

50|$|In this case, i.e. {{with the}} same {{luminous}} flux within the lens, the illuminance quadracially decreases and the luminous intensity quadratically increases with the image size.
