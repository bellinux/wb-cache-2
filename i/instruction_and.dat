5|$|Education in Malta is {{compulsory}} through age {{sixteen and}} is offered through three different providers: the state, the church, {{and the private}} sector. The state is responsible for promoting education and <b>instruction</b> <b>and</b> ensuring universal access to education for all Maltese citizens {{the existence of a}} system of schools and institutions accessible to all Maltese citizens. The objectives of education in Malta include intellectual and moral development and the preparation of every citizen to contribute productively to the national economy. Although Maltese citizens had access to education during the Arab occupation of 870 to 1090, the arrival of a number of religious orders in the following four centuries brought religious-based education to the island for wealthy families. The arrival of the Knights Hospitaller saw the establishment of the University of Malta, around which a number of primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions were established. Education in Malta has been universally available at the primary level since the ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French in 1798, when state-funded elementary schooling was established. In 1878, English replaced Italian as the primary language of <b>instruction,</b> <b>and</b> education was made compulsory in 1946 in response to a number of children not attending school due to poverty between World Wars One and Two. The age at which education became compulsory was lowered to five years in 1988.|$|E

5|$|On 29 June, Hitler, {{through the}} Commander-in-Chief of the German Army Walther von Brauchitsch, {{instructed}} {{the commander of}} Army Group Center Fedor von Bock to halt the advance of his panzers until the infantry formations liquidating the pockets catch up.

He also personally conducted an aerial inspection of the Minsk-Białystok pocket on 30 June and concluded that his panzer group was not needed to contain it, since Hermann Hoth's 3rd Panzer Group was already involved in the Minsk pocket. On the same day, some of the infantry corps of the 9th and 4th Armies, having sufficiently liquidated the Białystok pocket, resumed their march eastward {{to catch up with the}} panzer groups. On 1 July, Fedor von Bock ordered the panzer groups to resume their full offensive eastward on the morning of 3 July. But Brauchitsch, upholding Hitler's <b>instruction,</b> <b>and</b> Halder, unwillingly going along with it, opposed Bock's order. However, Bock insisted on the order by stating that it would be irresponsible to reverse orders already issued. The panzer groups, however, resumed their offensive on 2 July before the infantry formations had sufficiently caught up.|$|E

5|$|The humanists {{believed}} {{that it is important}} to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation. This ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral <b>instruction</b> <b>and</b> an intensive understanding of human behavior.|$|E

5|$|Bird entered {{politics}} in 1981. Three {{years later he}} was elected to the House of Representatives and became Minister of Aviation, Public Information and Public Utilities. As minister, Bird conducted a purchase deal for Dominican water before being made Minister of Public Works and Communications on 1 January 1987. In this role, he oversaw the reconstruction of V. C. Bird International Airport, which was the subject of controversy after it was discovered that he had granted a contract for the construction of a new runway to a company in which he was a shareholder. This led to conflict within the ALP, but Bird remained a minister. He was later fired after a scandal in which Israeli weapons, sold to Antigua and Barbuda, were found in the hands of the Medellín Cartel of Colombian drug smugglers – it was discovered that the weapons had been transferred at Bird's <b>instruction,</b> <b>and</b> a report by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper recommended that he be prohibited from holding public office again.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Rossier's {{views of}} Switzerland {{are held in}} several {{institutions}} and private collections in that country.

He complained at times of the adverse effects of the climate on his photographic chemicals {{and some of his}} negatives may have been damaged en route to London from Asia. Though his surviving images are scarce, his importance to the early history of photography in Asia is great. Before his arrival in Japan in 1859, Japanese students of photography had struggled to produce satisfactory images, but Rossier's experience, <b>instruction,</b> <b>and</b> contacts with suppliers of photographic materials were extremely helpful in the development of an autonomous photographic tradition in Japan.|$|E

As time passed, however, the popularity of both the medical <b>instruction</b> <b>and</b> the basic sciences taught at the school drew undergraduates and training physicians alike.

The variables manipulated {{in the study}} were delayed <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> reinforcement for play with selected toys, and specific versus general instructions; the correspondence between the adult's <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> reinforcement to the children's play was assessed. The data indicated that the children's free play was significantly differentially affected by the combination of verbal <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> reinforcement even when free play occurred 21 hours later. The comthination of <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> reinforcement was effective, however, only when the selected toy was specified which suggests that the discriminative properties of the adult's instructions were a critical variable influencing children's free play. The results also suggest that not only should instructions be specific, but any changes in instructions should be specific too. (KS...|$|R

5|$|From {{the advent}} of very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than {{the length of the}} word. For example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry <b>instruction</b> <b>and</b> the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, No.1 FTS {{started running}} two courses each year, the first commencing in January {{and the second}} in July; it also ceased graduating non-commissioned {{officers}} as pilots, and thus took on a character resembling the other armed services' cadet colleges, the Royal Australian Naval College and the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The roughly 1,200 applications for each flying course competed for around twelve places. Wing Commander Hippolyte DeLa Rue became commanding officer in early 1933. The following year, No.1 FTS commenced regular courses in signals, photography, air observation, and aircraft maintenance. In April 1936, the school took delivery of its first Avro Cadets, procured as an intermediate trainer {{to bridge the gap}} between the Gipsy Moth employed for elementary flying <b>instruction</b> <b>and</b> the Wapiti used for advanced training. De La Rue was succeeded by Wing Commander Frank Lukis in January 1938. By this time the school was training up to 96 new pilots per year, a small percentage of whom were slated for secondment to the RAF on short-service commissions. Link Trainer simulators were introduced in March 1939.|$|E
