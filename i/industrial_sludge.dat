Therefore, in the present study, genotoxic assessment of P. florida (Pleurotus florida) cultivated on these <b>industrial</b> <b>sludges</b> and their combination with wheat straw was done by Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. Interestingly, P. florida carpophores, cultivated on wheat straw did not show either frameshift or basepair mutagenicity as revealed by mutagenicity ratio (< 2) and mean number of revertants which was found to be 81. 3 and 93. 4 revertants per plate in the absence of S 9 mix. However, this number was found to be increased to 112. 1 and 226. 3 revertants with S 9 mix. P. florida cultivated on waste and its combination showed increase in number of revertants (123. 4 - 170. 1 revertants with TA 100 and 79. 5 - 84. 1 revertants with TA 98) in the absence of S 9 mix over control. Further, increase in number of revertants (229. 0 - 247. 3 with TA 100 and 100. 3 - 129. 1 with TA 98) was observed on adding S 9 mix with both strains S. typhymurium but still mutagenicity ratio was found to be below 2.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{two types}} of sludge were being used, while the first was with urban dominance, the second was with {{industrial}} dominance. The effects of sewage sludge had been studied in a Brassica Napus field. The mineralogical, chemical and microscopic study of the sludge showed that <b>industrial</b> <b>sludge</b> had very high levels of Cr, Pb and Cd. These metals existed mainly under the form of daubreelita Cr 2 FeS 4, brezininaite Cr 3 S 4, wattersite Hg 5 CrO 6, crocoite PbC 2 O 4, pheonicochroite Pb 2 O(CrO 4) and Pb-oxalate PbC 2 O 4. The results showed that sludge significantly improves {{the growth of the}} underground part of the plant (root) and the upper part (stem, leaves etc [...] .). This improvement is more important for urban sludge. However, this beneficial effect was accompanied by a change in the composition of the plant some trace element metals. An abnormal accumulation of Cr was found in the roots, stem, leaves, and siliques when the <b>industrial</b> <b>sludge</b> was brought which reflected the richness of the latest. The dose-effect sewage sludge was very clear at the levels of Pb in the roots especially for <b>industrial</b> <b>sludge</b> which exceeded the threshold values of toxicity starting from the dose of 25 t/ha of <b>industrial</b> <b>sludge.</b> Cd levels only increased with the addition of 100 t/ha of <b>industrial</b> <b>sludge.</b> For Ni, Cu, Co and Zn, especially at roots level, the increase depends on mud's dose and especially on its type. On the contrary, levels of iron, and to a less extent manganese levels, had been reduced due to sludge despite their richness with these elements. That was probably due to antagonism with one or more particular elements especially Zn...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{chemical}} and ecotoxicological characteristics of fresh and stabilized <b>industrial</b> organic <b>sludge</b> leachates {{were compared to}} obtain information regarding how the stabilization process can influence the ecotoxic potential of this industrial waste, {{which could be used}} for the amendment of degraded soil. Physicochemical analysis of the sludge leachates, as well as a battery of eco(geno) toxicity tests on bacteria, algae, daphnids, and higher plants (including Vicia faba genotoxicity test) and the determination of hydrolytic enzyme activity, was performed according to standard methods. The chemical comparison of the two types of leachate showed that the samples obtained from stabilized sludge had a lower organic content and higher metal content than leachates of the fresh sludge. The eco(geno) toxicological results obtained with aquatic organisms showed that the stabilized sludge leachate was more toxic than the fresh sludge leachate, both originating from the same <b>industrial</b> organic <b>sludge</b> sample. Nevertheless, phytotoxicity tests carried out with a reference peat soil irrigated with stabilized sludge leachate showed the same toxicity as the fresh sludge leachate.

In addition, the solubility of individual elements was evaluated {{based on a}} smaller data set. As a result two different groups were distinguished based on char ash content and ash yield. Virgin terrestrial and aquatic biomass, such as different types of wood and algae, in addition to herbaceous and agricultural biomass, bark, brewer’s spent grain, compost and faecal waste showed lower char ash content than municipal solid wastes, anaerobic digestion residues and municipal and <b>industrial</b> <b>sludge.</b> Lower char ash content also correlated with lower ash yield indicating differences in chemical composition and ash solubility. Further evaluation of available data showed that ash in <b>industrial</b> <b>sludge</b> mainly contained anthropogenic Al, Fe and P or Ca and Si with low solubility during hydrothermal treatment.

40|$|AbstractSolid waste {{management}} is a worldwide problem {{and it is}} becoming more and more complicated day by day due to rise in population, industrialization and changes in our life style. Transformation of <b>industrial</b> <b>sludges</b> into vermicompost is of double interest: on the one hand, a waste is converted into value added product, and, on the other, it controls a pollutant that is a consequence of increasing industrialization. Garden waste, kitchen waste and cow dung were subjected to recycle through vermicomposting by using the epigeic earthworm Eisenia fetida under field conditions. The pH, moisture content, total organic carbon, humus, nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium in vermicompost was analysed. It was found that moisture content, total organic carbon, humus, nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium was high in cow dung, followed by kitchen waste and garden waste.

40|$|The nickel update from {{different}} soils and Ni-bondings {{has been compared}} with chemical soil extraction. NiCl_ 2 proved to be most available, followed by an artificially Ni-enriched sludge. The Ni-uptake from <b>industrial</b> <b>sludges</b> and filter dust, {{as well as from}} geogeneously Ni-containing soils, was very low. Wheat, barley, rapeseed and mustard absorbed little Ni and did not exhibit toxicity symptoms. Spinach, lettuce carrots, kohlrabi and oats accumulated higher Ni-amounts and reacted with yield depressions. Bush beans, radish and corn salad showed especially high Ni-concentrations and were visibly damaged. Rye gras took up equally much Ni but did not suffer from its toxicity. Regarding the natural Ni of many soils, the present limit value of 50 mg/kg is unnecessarily low, but nonetheless can not be increased due to the toxicity of anthropogeneous Ni-contamination. Extractants with pronounced dissolution capacity reflect the Ni-availability as poorly as the total Ni-contents do. The same also applies for buffered solutions because of their changing the pH-status during the extraction. Only salt solutions are able to indicate the actual plant availability, although even there the extraction values have to be corrected to some exent. (orig.)

40|$|The use {{of calcium}} {{aluminate}} cements to efficiently encapsulate hazardous wastes was reported. Specifically, the quick {{formation of a}} matrix of low porosity and high stability was intended. The reaction between phosphate groups and calcium aluminate cement was extremely important in this case. This work presents an acid-base reaction between phosphates present in the sludges from the automotive industry and calcium aluminate cement that yielded very inert and stable monolithic blocks of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP). Two <b>industrial</b> <b>sludges</b> of different compositions were characterized and loaded in different ratios (from 10 to 50 wt. %). Setting times and compressive strengths were recorded to establish the feasibility of this method to achieve a good handling and a safe landfilling of these samples.

Retentions over 99. 9 % for Zn and Mn were observed even for loadings as high as 50 wt. % of the wastes. The formation of ACP phase of low porosity and high stability accounted for the effective immobilization of the hazardous components of the wastes, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and SEM-EDAX studies.
