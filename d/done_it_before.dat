500|$|Writer Steven Moffat {{described}} the premise as the traditional 'Doctor Who' thing of taking something omnipresent {{in your life}} and making it sinister, if something did get in the Wi-Fi, we'd be kind of screwed. Nobody had really <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> so I thought, 'It's time to get kids frightened of Wi-Fi!' [...] However, he denied that his intention was to give a warning about technology, but rather tell an adventure story about a [...] "new way [...] to invade" [...] based on something viewers were familiar with. Producer Marus Wilson suggested that the episode be an [...] "urban thriller", as the story would already be set in contemporary London to introduce Clara and the Wi-Fi monsters. Moffat compared the style to James Bond and The Bourne Identity. Moffat said that the episode was [...] "an action roller coaster" [...] rather than a story intended to be scary.|$|E
500|$|... "Chair Model" [...] was {{the third}} episode of the series {{directed}} by Jeffrey Blitz. Blitz had previously directed [...] "The Convict" [...] and [...] "The Negotiation". The episode was written by B. J. Novak, who plays temporary worker turned corporate manager Ryan Howard. Novak was originally going to name the episode [...] "Michael Dating", but the title could have potentially been a spoiler because fans with DVRs would have seen it before [...] "Dinner Party" [...] aired and deduced that Michael and Jan's relationship had completely fallen apart. For a while, [...] "Parking" [...] {{was going to be}} the title, but even that was decided against because that refers to the subplot, and also because it was generic and boring even by the show's no-frills-titles standard. Eventually, someone suggested [...] "Chair Model", which was eventually kept as the name. Originally, Novak wrote Jim putting Dwight through a [...] "phony management training", but NBC pointed out that it felt like the writers had <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> even though they had not. As a group, the writers tried to think of a new idea for the plot; they considered having Pam move in with Jim, but they thought that first the two should be engaged.|$|E

500|$|When {{war with}} Mexico seemed imminent, {{topographic}} engineers {{were sent to}} the border to assist with the army's preparations. Raynolds served in Winfield Scott's Mexican-American War campaign which marched overland to Mexico City from the Gulf of Mexico seaport at Veracruz. After the war, the American army occupied Mexico City and the surrounding region. During the occupation, Raynolds and others set out to map and explore nearby mountains. Raynolds's party is credited with being the first confirmed to climb to the summit of Pico de Orizaba (...) which at [...] is the tallest mountain in Mexico and third tallest in North America. Over a period of several months, Raynolds and other officers from both the army and navy mapped the best approach route to Pico de Orizaba. To assist them in their climb, the party planned on taking grapnels attached to long ropes and primitive crampons in the form of shoes with projecting points to help ensure they could safely climb up cliffs and across glaciers. Told by local villagers that any attempt to reach the summit would be fruitless because no one had ever <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> the Americans became even more determined to show the Mexicans it could be climbed.|$|E
500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E

[...] He cited that the Liz and Jack characters on opposing sides [...] "was not {{as much fun as}} seeing them working together", and that Jenna and Tracy's antics throughout the series have been [...] "funny most of the time", though [...] "very little clicked in this episode." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that the Tracy and Jenna team [...] "often seems too far out of the realm of reality... to enjoy them." [...] Sepinwall was positive about Cheyenne Jackson's debut, noting he [...] "fit in well his first time out." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste magazine called the episode the [...] "best so far in the season" [...] but admitted he was [...] "disappointed in it" [...] for not coming [...] "close to greatness and we all know [...] <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> and can do it again." [...] Gandert, who has not been a fan of Liz's [...] "Dealbreakers" [...] storyline, commented her plot here was [...] "somewhat annoying, generally not that interesting", and concluded [...] "it's hard to really care" [...] that Liz get her talk show.|$|E

2500|$|Investigators then {{focused on}} why the pilots decided to fly the plane direct to point Barru instead to point Siwa. Investigators {{considered}} the Situational Awareness {{and the process of}} the decision making to fly direct to Barru. It was revealed that one of the crew had done the same step before, and during the previous flight, no incident occurred. This might have caused one of the crew to trust the one that had <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> in the past to cut the route and make a direct flight to Barru. During its flight to point Barru, neither the pilot or the co-pilot discussed on the environmental condition ahead. The absence of discussion in regard to the conditions ahead, meant that the pilots had not properly considered the operational implications of flying the direct route, leading to a loss of situational awareness.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{difficulties}} with sampling, {{the band and}} production team eventually became comfortable with it, even sampling Mullen's drumming, the Edge's guitar riffs, Clayton's bass lines, and Bono's vocalisations. Howie B sampled almost anything he could {{in order to find}} interesting sounds. He created sequenced patterns of the Edge's guitar playing, which the guitarist, having never <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> found very interesting. Howie B explained, [...] "Sometimes I would sample, say, a guitar, but it wouldn't come back sounding like a guitar; it might sound more like a pneumatic drill, because I would take the raw sound and filter it, really destroy the guitar sound, and rebuild it into something completely different." [...] Although sequencing was used, mostly on keyboards, guitar loops, and some percussion, it was used sparingly out of fear of becoming overreliant on it.|$|E

2500|$|Behind Godfrey's on-air warmth was a {{volatile}} and controlling personality. [...] He insisted that his [...] "Little Godfreys" [...] attend dance and singing classes, believing all should be versatile performers {{regardless of whether}} they possessed the aptitude for those disciplines. In meetings with the cast and his staff, he could be abusive and intimidating. CBS historian Robert Metz, in CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye, quoted Godfrey as having once told cast and staffers, [...] "Remember that many of you are here over the bodies I have personally slain. I have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> and I can do it again." [...] He also demanded, though there was no contractual requirement, that his cast members refrain from hiring personal managers or booking agents. [...] He insisted his staff could handle all that. [...] Given the rise of the [...] "Little Godfreys" [...] from total obscurity due to their exposure on Godfrey's programs, no one was inclined to challenge him. [...] Despite his ability to bring in profits, CBS executives who respected Godfrey professionally disliked him personally, since he often baited them on and off the air, occasionally by name. This included CBS chairman William S. Paley.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's stripped-back closing track, [...] "You Were Good", Jim Adkins stated: [...] "A {{fair amount}} of the ideas for Damage started out as {{acoustic}} songs, like really rough acoustic songs. 'You Were Good' started out in a pretty acoustic-based world and {{when we tried to}} take it out of that world, we realized that without the acoustic guitar in there as a bed, it didn't feel the same without it being there. With 'You Were Good', we experimented around a little bit with fleshing it out and building the dynamics of it in a full band sense, {{but at the end of}} the day we all looked at each other and agreed it sounded better with just me and a guitar and the weirdo, Indian drone thing on there." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton elaborated: [...] "It was just [...] with an acoustic guitar and his vocals, and there was never a point where he stopped and started over. He just played it from the beginning to the end live. Then I overdubbed an organ part and Alain [...] played the guitar part. That was really fun to do, and I don't think we had ever <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> especially with vocals." ...|$|E
2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus {{that a lot of}} these folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also wanted to make sure that as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television with my parents, and we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E
