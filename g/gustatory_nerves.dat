60|$|The {{manner in}} which the mind affects the vasomotor system may be {{conceived}} in the following manner. When we actually taste sour fruit, an impression is sent through the <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves</b> to a certain part of the sensorium; this transmits nerve-force to the vasomotor centre, which consequently allows the muscular coats of the small arteries that permeate the salivary glands to relax. Hence more blood flows into these glands, and they secrete a copious supply of saliva. Now it does not seem an improbable assumption, that, when we reflect intently on a sensation, the same part of the sensorium, or a closely connected part of it, is brought into a state of activity, {{in the same manner as}} when we actually perceive the sensation. If so, the same cells in the brain will be excited, though, perhaps, in a less degree, by vividly thinking about a sour taste, as by perceiving it; and they will transmit in the one case, as in the other, nerve-force to the vaso-motor centre with the same results.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{sense of}} taste informs the body {{about the quality of}} {{ingested}} foods. Tastant-mediated signals are generated by a rise in free intracellular calcium levels ([Ca(2 +) ]i) in the taste bud cells and then are transferred to the gustatory area of brain via connections between the <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves</b> (chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves) and the nucleus of solitary tract in the brain stem. We have recently shown that lingual CD 36 contributes to fat preference and early digestive secretions in the mouse. We show here that 1) the induction of an increase in [Ca(2 +) ]i by linoleic acid is CD 36 -dependent in taste receptor cells, 2) the spontaneous preference for or conversely conditioned aversion to linoleic acid requires intact <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves,</b> and 3) the activation of gustatory neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract elicited by a linoleic acid deposition on the tongue in wild-type mice cannot be reproduced in CD 36 -null animals. We conclude that the CD 36 -mediated perception of long-chain fatty acids involves the gustatory pathway, suggesting that the mouse may have a "taste" for fatty foods. This system would constitute a potential physiological advantage under conditions of food scarcity by leading the mouse to select and absorb fatty foods. However, it might also lead to a risk of obesity and associated diseases in a context of constantly abundant food...|$|E

Electrical stimulation of the glossopharyngeal nerve {{at a rate of}} 100 Hz for 10 s and at supramaximal intensity slightly depressed the integrated glossopharyngeal nerve responses to quinine and to mechanical taps to the tongue. The same antidromic stimuli resulted in a 30 - 40 % reduction in the responses to salt, acid, water, and warmed saline, but depressed> 80 % of the afferent impulses firing spontaneously. The magnitude of responses to quinine and NaCl and the number of spontaneous discharges decreased gradually with an increase in either the frequency or the duration of antidromic stimuli. Similar results were obtained with intensities above the threshold for exciting gustatory and slowly adapting mechanosensitive fibers. The time required to recover from termination of the antidromic stimuli to two-thirds ofthe maximal amount ofdepression ranged between 6 and 7 min, with no significant differences among the depressions.

40|$|The greater {{superficial}} petrosal nerve (GSP), innervating {{taste buds}} in the palate, {{is known to}} be exceptionally responsive to sucrose, especially compared with the responsiveness of the chorda tympani nerve (CT). However, whereas transection of the CT (CTX) alone has little or no effect on unconditioned licking responses to many ‘‘sweet’ ’ stimuli, the impact of GSP transection (GSPX) alone is equivocal. To further examine the role of the GSP on licking responses to putatively sweet-tasting substances, brief-access taste tests were conducted in nondeprived rats before and after sham surgery (SHAM) or CTX or GSPX. A range of concentrations of sucrose, L-alanine, glycine, and L-serine, with and without 1. 0 mM inosine monophosphate (IMP) added, were used. All groups showed significant concentration-dependent increases in licking to all stimuli presurgically and postsurgically. CTX decreased licking responses relative to SHAM rats in the first sucrose test. There was also a group · concentration interaction for L-alanine, but post hoc tests did not reveal its basis. Other than this, {{there were no significant differences}} among the surgical groups. Interestingly, rats with GSPX tended to initiate fewer trials than SHAM rats. Overall, after GSPX, the remaining <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves</b> are apparently sufficient to maintain concentration-dependent licking responses to all stimuli tested here. The disparity between our results and others in the literature where GSPX reduced licking responses to sucrose is possibly related to differences in surgical technique or test trial duration.

40|$|The P 2 X ionotropic purinergic receptors, P 2 X 2 and P 2 X 3, are {{essential}} for transmission of taste information from taste buds to the <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves.</b> Mice lacking both P 2 X 2 and P 2 X 3 purinergic receptors (P 2 X 2 /P 2 X 3 Dbl−/−) exhibit no taste-evoked activity in the chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves when stimulated with taste stimuli {{from any of the}} 5 classical taste quality groups (salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami) nor do the mice show taste preferences for sweet or umami, or avoidance of bitter substances (Finger et al. 2005. ATP signaling is crucial for communication from taste buds to <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves.</b> Science. 310 [5753]: 1495 – 1499). Here, we compare the ability of P 2 X 2 /P 2 X 3 Dbl−/− mice and P 2 X 2 /P 2 X 3 Dbl+/+ wild-type (WT) mice to detect NaCl in brief-access tests and conditioned aversion paradigms. Brief-access testing with NaCl revealed that whereas WT mice decrease licking at 300 mM and above, the P 2 X 2 /P 2 X 3 Dbl−/− mice do not show any change in lick rates. In conditioned aversion tests, P 2 X 2 /P 2 X 3 Dbl−/− mice did not develop a learned aversion to NaCl or the artificial sweetener SC 45647, both of which are easily avoided by conditioned WT mice. The inability of P 2 X 2 /P 2 X 3 Dbl−/− mice to show avoidance of these taste stimuli was not due to an inability to learn the task because both WT and P 2 X 2 /P 2 X 3 Dbl−/− mice learned to avoid a combination of SC 45647 and amyl acetate (an odor cue). These data suggest that P 2 X 2 /P 2 X 3 Dbl−/− mice are unable to respond to NaCl or SC 45647 as taste stimuli, mirroring the lack of gustatory nerve responses to these substances...|$|E
40|$|Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a gut hormone {{released}} from enteroendocrine cells. CCK functions as an anorexigenic factor by acting on CCK receptors expressed on the vagal afferent nerve and hypothalamus with a synergistic interaction between leptin. In the gut, tastants such as amino acids and bitter compounds stimulate CCK release from enteroendocrine cells via activation of taste transduction pathways. CCK is also expressed in taste buds, suggesting potential roles of CCK in taste signaling in the peripheral taste organ. In the present study, {{we focused on}} the function of CCK in the initial responses to taste stimulation. CCK was coexpressed with type II taste cell markers such as Gα-gustducin, phospholipase Cβ 2, and transient receptor potential channel M 5. Furthermore, a small subset (~ 30 %) of CCK-expressing taste cells expressed a sweet/umami taste receptor component, taste receptor type 1 member 3, in taste buds. Because type II taste cells are sweet, umami or bitter taste cells, the majority of CCK-expressing taste cells may be bitter taste cells. CCK-A and -B receptors were expressed in both taste cells and gustatory neurons. CCK receptor knockout mice showed reduced neural responses to bitter compounds compared with wild-type mice. Consistently, intravenous injection of CCK-Ar antagonist lorglumide selectively suppressed <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve</b> responses to bitter compounds. Intravenous injection of CCK- 8 transiently increased <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve</b> activities in a dose-dependent manner whereas administration of CCK- 8 did not affect activities of bitter-sensitive taste cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Glutamate {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a transmitter in the peripheral taste system {{in addition to its}} well-documented role as an umami taste stimulus. Evidence for a role as a transmitter includes the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptors in nerve fibers and taste cells, as well as the expression of the glutamate transporter GLAST in Type I taste cells. However, the source and targets of glutamate in lingual tissue are unclear. In the present study, we used molecular, physiological and immunohistochemical methods to investigate the origin of glutamate as well as the targeted receptors in taste buds. Results Using molecular and immunohistochemical techniques, we show that the vesicular transporters for glutamate, VGLUT 1 and 2, but not VGLUT 3, are expressed in the nerve fibers surrounding taste buds but likely not in taste cells themselves. Further, we show that P 2 X 2, a specific marker for gustatory but not trigeminal fibers, co-localizes with VGLUT 2, suggesting the VGLUT-expressing nerve fibers are of gustatory origin. Calcium imaging indicates that GAD 67 -GFP Type III taste cells, but not T 1 R 3 -GFP Type II cells, respond to glutamate at concentrations expected for a glutamate transmitter, and further, that these responses are partially blocked by NBQX, a specific AMPA/Kainate receptor antagonist. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry confirm the presence of the Kainate receptor GluR 7 in Type III taste cells, suggesting it may be a target of glutamate released from <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers. Conclusions Taken together, the results suggest that glutamate may be released from <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers using a vesicular mechanism to modulate Type III taste cells via GluR 7. </p...|$|R

It is clear that there are some seemingly permanent anatomical consequences of CT regeneration including reductions in taste bud number and volume, decreases in the number of myelinated axons, decrease in the density of terminal projections, and a decline in the volume of the terminal field in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) (Shuler et al., 2004; for review, see Spector, 2003).

Possible peripheral sites of damage are confined primarily to the two major <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves,</b> the chorda tympani and the glossopharyngeal nerve.

In contrast, the IXth nerve innervating the posterior part of the tongue has almost exclusively the AI type. This relative abundance of the AS and AI types of fibers was not altered by cross-regeneration of the two <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves</b> into the reverse tongue regions.

However, major changes in <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve</b> responses to NaCl take place during development. In sheep and rat, the peripheral nerve responses to NaCl are of low magnitude during early development. Progressively, the taste system acquires an increasing proportion of fibers that respond maximally to NaCl.

40|$|Abstract Background Taste bud cells {{transmit}} {{information regarding}} the contents of food from taste receptors embedded in apical microvilli to <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers innervating basolateral membranes. In particular, taste cells depolarize, activate voltage-gated sodium channels, and fire action potentials in response to tastants. Initial cell depolarization is attributable to sodium influx through TRPM 5 in sweet, bitter, and umami cells and an undetermined cation influx through an ion channel in sour cells expressing PKD 2 L 1, a candidate sour taste receptor. The molecular identity of the voltage-gated sodium channels that sense depolarizing signals and subsequently initiate action potentials coding taste information to <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers is unknown. Results We describe the molecular and histological expression profiles of cation channels involved in electrical signal transmission from apical to basolateral membrane domains. TRPM 5 was positioned immediately beneath tight junctions to receive calcium signals originating from sweet, bitter, and umami receptor activation, while PKD 2 L 1 was positioned at the taste pore. Using mouse taste bud and lingual epithelial cells collected by laser capture microdissection, SCN 2 A, SCN 3 A, and SCN 9 A voltage-gated sodium channel transcripts were expressed in taste tissue. SCN 2 A, SCN 3 A, and SCN 9 A were expressed beneath tight junctions in subsets of taste cells. SCN 3 A and SCN 9 A were expressed in TRPM 5 cells, while SCN 2 A was expressed in TRPM 5 and PKD 2 L 1 cells. HCN 4, a gene previously implicated in sour taste, was expressed in PKD 2 L 1 cells and localized to cell processes beneath the taste pore. Conclusion SCN 2 A, SCN 3 A and SCN 9 A voltage-gated sodium channels are positioned to sense initial depolarizing signals stemming from taste receptor activation and initiate taste cell action potentials. SCN 2 A, SCN 3 A and SCN 9 A gene products likely account for the tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents in taste receptor cells. </p...|$|R

The tarsus of the front legs (olfactory nerves) and the fourth palpal segment (<b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves)</b> of unfed Amblyomma americanum males and females were excised. A neuronal tracer, dextran tetramethylrhodamine, was used for filling of the sensory neurons. The synganglion preparations were examined using a confocal microscope. Neuronal arborizations from the Haller&# 8217;s organ were confined to the olfactory lobes and the first pedal ganglion. The estimated number of olfactory glomeruli ranged from 16 to 22 per olfactory lobe in the females. The number of glomeruli was not counted in males because they were densely packed. Sensory neurons associated with sensilla at the distal end of the palpal organ projected into the palpal ganglion in the synganglion through the palpal nerve. Gustatory sensory neurons associated with palpal sensilla projected into a commissure with several bulges, which are confined in the palpal ganglion.

They were characterised by the presence of numerous dense-cored granules in the cytoplasm ranging from 80 to 120 nm in diameter, and of microvilli protruding from the cell surface. For 4 mo after sensory denervation by cutting the <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves,</b> all cell types of the taste bud were well preserved and maintained their fine structure. Even at 4 mo after denervation, the basal cells exhibited a strong immunoreaction with serotonin antiserum. To investigate the function of serotonin in the basal cells in taste bud function, serotonin deficiency was induced by administration of p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase, and of p-chloroamphetamine (PCA), a depletor of serotonin. After administration of these agents to normal and denervated frogs for 2 wk, a marked decrease, or complete absence, of immunoreactivity for serotonin was observed in the basal cells. Ultrastructurally, degenerative changes were observed in both types of frog; numerous lysosome-like myelin bodies were found in all cell types of the taste buds. The number of dense-cored granules in the basal cells also was greatly decreased by treatment with these drugs.

40|$|Abstract: Inbred mouse strains display marked {{differences}} in avidity for sweet solutions {{due in part}} to genetic differences among strains. Using several techniques, we have located a number of regions throughout the genome that influence sweetener acceptance. One promi-nent locus regulating {{differences in}} sweetener preferences among mouse strains is the sac-charin preference (Sac) locus on distal chromosome 4. Afferent responses of <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves</b> to sweeteners also vary as a function of allelic differences in the Sac locus, suggesting that this gene may encode a sweet taste receptor. Using a positional cloning approach, we identi-fied a gene (Tas 1 r 3) encoding the third member of the T 1 R family of putative taste receptors, T 1 R 3. Introgression by serial back-crossing of a chromosomal fragment containing the Tas 1 r 3 allele from the high sweetener-preferring strain onto the genetic background of the low sweetener-preferring strain rescued its low sweetener-preference phenotype. Tas 1 r 3 has two common haplotypes, one found in mouse strains with elevated sweetener preference and the other in strains relatively indifferent to sweeteners. This study, in conjunction with com-plimentary recent studies from other laboratories, provides compelling evidence that Tas 1 r 3 is equivalent to the Sac locus and that the T 1 R 3 receptor (when co-expressed with taste receptor T 1 R 2) responds to sweeteners. However, other sweetness receptors may remain to be identified...|$|E

40|$|Ordinary {{gustatory}} experiences, {{which are}} usually evoked by taste mixtures, are determined by multiple interactions between different taste stimuli. The most studied model for these gustatory interactions is {{the suppression of the}} responses to sweeteners by the prototype bitter compound quinine. Here we report that TRPM 5, a cation channel involved in sweet taste transduction, is inhibited by quinine (EC 50 = 50 microM at - 50 mV) owing to a decrease in the maximal whole-cell TRPM 5 conductance and an acceleration of channel closure. Notably, quinine inhibits the gustatory responses of sweet-sensitive <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves</b> in wild-type (EC 50 = approximately 1. 6 mM) but not in Trpm 5 knockout mice. Quinine induces a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of TRPM 5 -dependent responses of single sweet-sensitive fibers to sucrose, according to the restricted diffusion of the drug into the taste tissue. Quinidine, the stereoisomer of quinine, has similar effects on TRPM 5 currents and on sweet-induced gustatory responses. In contrast, the chemically unrelated bitter compound denatonium benzoate has an approximately 100 -fold weaker effect on TRPM 5 currents and, accordingly, at 10 mM it does not alter gustatory responses to sucrose. The inhibition of TRPM 5 by bitter compounds constitutes the molecular basis of a novel mechanism of taste interactions, whereby the bitter tastant inhibits directly the sweet transduction pathway. -Talavera, K., Yasumatsu, K., Yoshida, R., Margolskee, R.

40|$|Coding of {{gustatory}} {{information is}} complex and unique among sensory systems; information is received by multiple receptor populations located throughout the oral cavity and carried to a single central relay by four separate nerves. The geniculate ganglion is {{the location of the}} somata of two of these nerves, the greater superficial petrosal (GSP) and the chorda tympani (CT). The GSP innervates taste buds on the palate and the CT innervates taste buds on the anterior tongue. To obtain requisite taste response profiles of GSP neurones, we recorded neurophysiological responses to taste stimuli of individual geniculate ganglion neurones in vivo in the rat and compared them to those from the CT. GSP neurones had a distinct pattern of responding compared to CT neurones. For example, a small subset of GSP neurones had high response frequencies to sucrose stimulation, whereas no CT neurones had high response frequencies to sucrose. In contrast, NaCl elicited high response frequencies in a small subset of CT neurones and elicited moderate response frequencies in a relatively large proportion of GSP neurones. The robust whole-nerve response to sucrose in the GSP may be attributable to relatively few, narrowly tuned neurones, whereas the response to NaCl in the GSP may relate to proportionately more, widely tuned neurones. These results demonstrate the diversity in the initial stages of sensory coding for two separate <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves</b> involved in the ingestion or rejection of taste solutions, and may have implications for central coding of gustatory quality and concentration as well as coding of information used in controlling energy, fluid and electrolyte homeostasis...|$|E

To determine differences in taste preference between rats in different life stages, we examined the consumption of taste solutions and water using a two-bottle test. Male Sprague-Dawley rats of different ages were used: juvenile (3 - 6 weeks), young adult (8 - 11 weeks), adult (17 - 20 weeks), middle-aged (34 - 37 weeks), and old-aged (69 - 72 weeks). The intakes of the high and low concentration solutions presented simultaneously were measured. We observed that the old-aged group had lower preference ratios for 0. 3 M sucrose and 0. 1 M MSG in comparison with other groups. The preference ratio for 0. 03 mM QHCl was higher in the middle-aged group than in the three younger groups and higher in the old-aged group than the juvenile group. The taste preferences for HCl and NaCl did not significantly differ among the age groups. The old-aged group tended to prefer high concentrations of sucrose, QHCl, NaCl, and MSG to low concentrations, indicating age-related decline in taste sensitivity. We also aimed to investigate differences between life stages in the electrophysiological responses of the chorda tympani nerve, one of the peripheral <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves,</b> to taste stimuli. The electrophysiological recordings showed that aging did not alter the function of the chorda tympani nerve. This study showed that aging induced alterations in taste preference.

40|$|The lingual artery of the {{bullfrog}} was perfused {{with artificial}} solution {{and the effects}} of Ca 2 +, Ca-channel blockers (MnCl 2 and verapamil), cGMP, and cAMP added to the perfusing solution of the <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve</b> responses were examined. The responses to chemical stimuli of group 1 (CaCl 2, NaCl, distilled water, D-galactose, and L- threonine) applied to the tongue surface were greatly decreased by a decrease in Ca 2 + concentration in the perfusing solution, suppressed by the Ca-channel blockers, enhanced by cGMP, and suppressed by cAMP. The responses to chemical stimuli of group 2 (quinine hydrochloride, theophylline, ethanol, and HCl) were practically not affected by a decrease in Ca 2 + concentration, the Ca-channel blockers, cGMP, and cAMP. The responses to the stimuli of group 1 seem to be induced by Ca influx into a taste cell that is triggered by depolarization and modulated by the cyclic nucleotides in a taste cell. The responses to group 2 seem to be induced without accompanying Ca influx...|$|R
40|$|Individual {{differences}} in taste perception have been explained {{in part by}} variations in peripheral innervation associated with the genetic ability to taste the bitter substances PTC and PROP. In the present study we report evidence of another source of indi-vidual differences that is independent of taste stimulus, taste quality, or <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve.</b> Individuals who perceived taste from thermal stimulation alone (thermal taste) gave significantly higher taste ratings to chemical stimuli—often by a factor of> 2 : 1 —than did individuals who perceived no taste from thermal stimulation. This was true for all taste stimuli tested (sucrose, saccharin, sodium chloride, citric acid, quinine sulfate, MSG and PROP), for all three gustatory areas of the mouth (anterior tongue, posterior tongue and soft palate) and for whole-mouth stimulation. Moreover, the same individuals reported stronger sensations from the olfactory stimulus vanillin, particularly when it was sensed retronasally. The generality of the thermal-taster advantage and its extension to an olfactory stimulus suggests that it arises from individual {{differences in}} CNS processes {{that are involved in}} perception of both taste and flavor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Anatomical tracing {{of neural}} {{circuits}} originating from specific subsets of taste receptor cells may {{shed light on}} interactions between taste cells within the taste bud and taste cell-to nerve interactions. It is unclear for example, if activation of type II cells leads to direct activation of the <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves,</b> or whether the information is relayed through type III cells. To determine how WGA produced in T 1 r 3 -expressing taste cells is transported into gustatory neurons, transgenic mice expressing WGA-IRES-GFP driven by the T 1 r 3 promoter were generated. Results Immunohistochemistry showed co-expression of WGA, GFP and endogenous T 1 r 3 in the taste bud cells of transgenic mice: the only taste cells immunoreactive for WGA were the T 1 r 3 -expressing cells. The WGA antibody also stained intragemmal nerves. WGA, but not GFP immunoreactivity {{was found in the}} geniculate and petrosal ganglia of transgenic mice, indicating that WGA was transported across synapses. WGA immunoreactivity was also found in the trigeminal ganglion, suggesting that T 1 r 3 -expressing cells make synapses with trigeminal neurons. In the medulla, WGA was detected in the nucleus of the solitary tract but also in the nucleus ambiguus, the vestibular nucleus, the trigeminal nucleus and in the gigantocellular reticular nucleus. WGA was not detected in the parabrachial nucleus, or the gustatory cortex. Conclusion These results show the usefulness of genetically encoded WGA as a tracer for the first and second order neurons that innervate a subset of taste cells, but not for higher order neurons, and demonstrate that the main route of output from type II taste cells is the gustatory neuron, not the type III cells. </p...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of our studies of variation in voluntary glutamate consumption in mice. In 2 -bottle preference tests, mice from the C 57 BL/ 6 ByJ (B 6) strain consume more monosodium l-glutamate (MSG) than do mice from the 129 P 3 /J (129) strain. We used these mice to study physiologic and genetic mechanisms that underlie the strain differences in glutamate intake. Our genetic analyses showed that differences between B 6 mice and 129 mice in MSG consumption are unrelated to strain variation in consumption of sodium or sweeteners and therefore are attributed to mechanisms specific for glutamate. These strain differences could be due to variation in responses to either taste or postingestive effects of glutamate. To examine the role of taste responsiveness, we measured MSG-evoked activity in <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerves</b> and showed that it is similar in B 6 and 129 mice. On the other hand, strain-specific postingestive effects of glutamate were evident from our finding that exposure to MSG increases its consumption in B 6 mice and decreases its consumption in 129 mice. We therefore examined whether B 6 mice and 129 mice differ in postingestive metabolism of glutamate. We showed that, after intragastric administration of MSG, the MSG is preferentially metabolized through gluconeogenesis in B 6 mice, whereas thermogenesis is the predominant process for 129 mice. We hypothesize that a process related to gluconeogenesis of the ingested glutamate generates the rewarding stimulus, which probably occurs in the liver before glucose enters the general circulation, and that the glutamate-induced postingestive thermogenesis generates an aversive stimulus. Our animal model studies raise the question of whether humans also vary in glutamate metabolism in a manner that influences their glutamate preference, consumption, and postingestive processing...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTaste {{receptor}} {{cells in}} taste buds detect chemical compounds in foods and drinks and transmit these signals through <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers {{to the central}} nervous system. Sensory signals of taste are essential for animal feeding behavior; animals prefer sweet taste and avoid bitter and sour tastes. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} the sensitivity of taste receptor cells to tastants is not constant but is subject to regulation by hormones and bioactive substances, such as leptin and endocannabinoids. Leptin selectively suppresses sweet taste sensitivity. In contrast, endocannabinoids selectively enhance sweet taste sensitivity. Both types of signaling molecules act at their respective receptors in sweet-sensitive taste cells. In addition, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), glucagon, oxytocin, insulin, cholecystokinin, neuropeptide Y, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) have been implicated in the regulation of peripheral taste sensitivity. In this review, the hormones and bioactive substances that affect peripheral taste sensitivity are summarized. Regulation of peripheral taste sensitivity by hormones and bioactive substances may {{play an important role in}} the control of feeding behavior and maintenance of energy, ion, and amino acid homeostasis in animals...|$|R
40|$|Taste stimuli are transduced by {{taste buds}} and {{transmitted}} to the brain via afferent gustatory fibers. Renewal of taste receptor cells from actively dividing progenitors is finely tuned to maintain taste sensitivity throughout life. We show that conditional β-catenin deletion in mouse taste progenitors leads to rapid depletion of progenitors and Shh+ precursors, which in turn causes taste bud loss, followed by loss of <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers. In addition, our data suggest LEF 1, TCF 7 and Wnt 3 {{are involved in a}} Wnt pathway regulatory feedback loop that controls taste cell renewal in the circumvallate papilla epithelium. Unexpectedly, taste bud decline is greater in the anterior tongue and palate than in the posterior tongue. Mutant mice with this regional pattern of taste bud loss were unable to discern sweet at any concentration, but could distinguish bitter stimuli, albeit with reduced sensitivity. Our findings are consistent with published reports wherein anterior taste buds have higher sweet sensitivity while posterior taste buds are better tuned to bitter, and suggest β-catenin plays a greater role in renewal of anterior versus posterior taste buds...|$|R
40|$|Trpm 5 is a calcium-activated cation channel {{expressed}} selectively in taste receptor cells. A {{previous study}} reported that mice with an internal deletion of Trpm 5, lacking exons 15 – 19 encoding transmembrane segments 1 – 5, showed no taste-mediated responses to bitter, sweet, and umami compounds. We independently generated knockout mice null for Trpm 5 protein expres-sion due to deletion of Trpm 5 #s promoter region and exons 1 – 4 (including the translation start site). We examined the taste-mediated responses of Trpm 5 null mice and wild-type (WT) mice using three procedures: <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve</b> recording [chorda tympani (CT) and glossopharyngeal (NG) nerves], initial lick responses, and 24 -h two-bottle preference tests. With bitter com-pounds, the Trpm 5 null mice showed reduced, but not abolished, avoidance (as indicated by licking responses and preference ratios {{higher than those of}} WT), a normal CT response, and a greatly diminished NG response. With sweet compounds, Trpm 5 null mice showed no licking response, a diminished preference ratio, and absent or greatly reduced nerve responses. With umami compounds, Trpm 5 null mice showed no licking response, a diminished preference ratio, a normal NG response, and a greatl...|$|R
40|$|Humans have 5 basic taste sensations: sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and umami (taste of 1 -amino acids). Among 33 genes {{related to}} {{transient}} receptor potential (TRP) channels, 3 —including TRP-melastatin 5 (TRPM 5), polycystic kidney disease- 1 -like 3 (PKD 1 L 3), and polycystic kidney disease- 2 -like 1 (PKD 2 L 1) —are specifically and abundantly expressed in taste receptor cells. TRP-melastatin 5 is co-expressed with taste receptors T 1 Rs and T 2 Rs, and {{functions as a}} common downstream component in sweet, bitter, and umami taste signal transduction. In contrast, polycystic kidney disease- 1 -like 3 and polycystic kidney disease- 2 -like 1 are co-expressed in distinct subsets of taste receptor cells not expressing TRP-melastatin 5. In the heterologous expression system, cells expressing both polycystic kidney disease- 1 -like 3 and polycystic kidney disease- 2 -like 1 responded to sour stimuli, showing a unique “off-response” property. Genetic ablation of polycystic kidney disease- 2 -like 1 -expressing cells resulted in elimination of <b>gustatory</b> <b>nerve</b> response to sour stimuli, indicating that cells expressing polycystic kidney disease- 2 -like 1 function as sour taste detectors. These results suggest that polycystic kidney disease- 1 -like 3 /polycystic kidney disease- 2 -like 1 may play a significant role, possibly as taste receptors, in sour taste sensation...|$|R
