The article {{considers}} {{the problem of}} cracks formation in cast-iron molds during the casting <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> <b>blocks.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> casting technology for manufacturing of cast-iron molds is performed. Changes {{of the construction of}} cast-iron molds is implemented to ensure the directional solidification. The analysis of thermal cycles of cast-iron molds during its operation is performed. It is established that the most dangerous moment of crack formation {{is the beginning of the}} pouring <b>of</b> molten <b>zinc</b> in the cold cast-iron mold.

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that central administration <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> in minute amounts induces a significant antidipsogenic action in dehydrated rats {{as well as in}} rats under central cholinergic and angiotensinergic stimulation. Here we show that acute third ventricle injections <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> also <b>block</b> water intake induced by central ß-adrenergic stimulation in Wistar rats (190 - 250 g). Central inhibition of opioid pathways by naloxone reverses the zinc-induced antidipsogenic effect in dehydrated rats. After 120 min, rats receiving third ventricle injections of isoproterenol (160 nmol/rat) exhibited a significant increase in water intake (5. 78 ± 0. 54 ml/ 100 g body weight) compared to saline-treated controls (0. 15 ± 0. 07 ml/ 100 g body weight). Pretreatment with zinc (3. 0, 30. 0 and 300. 0 pmol/rat, 45 min before isoproterenol injection) blocked water intake in a dose-dependent way. At the highest dose employed a complete blockade was demonstrable (0. 54 ± 0. 2 ml/ 100 g body weight). After 120 min, control (NaAc-treated) dehydrated rats, as expected, exhibited a high water intake (7. 36 ± 0. 39 ml/ 100 g body weight). Central administration <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> <b>blocked</b> this response (2. 5 ± 0. 77 ml/ 100 g body weight). Naloxone pretreatment (82. 5 nmol/rat, 30 min before zinc administration) reverted the water intake to the high levels observed in zinc-free dehydrated animals (7. 04 ± 0. 56 ml/ 100 g body weight). These data indicate that zinc is able to block water intake induced by central ß-adrenergic stimulation and that zinc-induced blockade of water intake in dehydrated rats may be, at least in part, due to stimulation of central opioid peptides...|$|R
40|$|Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) {{is highly}} {{effective}} for treating colon cancer patients postdiagnosis; however, {{the mechanisms of}} action of aspirin in colon cancer are not well defined. Aspirin and its major metabolite sodium salicylate induced apoptosis and decreased colon cancer cell growth and the sodium salt of aspirin also inhibited tumor growth in an athymic nude mouse xenograft model. Colon cancer cell growth inhibition was accompanied by downregulation of Sp 1, Sp 3 and Sp 4 proteins and decreased expression of Sp-regulated gene products including bcl- 2, survivin, VEGF, VEGFR 1, cyclin D 1, c-MET and p 65 (NFkB). Moreover, we also showed by RNA interference that b-catenin, an important target of aspirin in some studies, is an Sp-regulated gene. Aspirin induced nuclear caspase-dependent cleavage of Sp 1, Sp 3 and Sp 4 proteins and this response was related to sequestration <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> ions since addition <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> sulfate <b>blocked</b> aspirin-mediated apoptosis and repression of Sp proteins. The results demonstrate an important underlying mechanism of action of aspirin as an anticancer agent and, based on the rapid metabolism of aspirin to salicylate in humans and the high salicylate/aspirin ratios in serum, {{it is likely that}} the anticancer activity of aspirin is also due to the salicylate metabolite...|$|R

2500|$|Three {{navigation}} {{cameras were}} {{on board the}} rover: Two black and white 0.3-megapixel cameras were located on the front (768 horizontal pixels × 484 vertical pixels configured in 4×4+100 pixel blocks), coupled with five laser stripe projectors, which enabled stereoscopic images to be taken along with measurements for hazard detection on the rover's path. A third camera with the same resolution but taking color images was located on the back, near the APXS, and rotated by 90°. It provided images of the APXS's target area and the rover's tracks on the ground. The pixels of this colour camera were arranged in such a way, {{that out of the}} 16 pixel of a 4×4 pixel block, 12 pixel were sensitive to green, 2 pixel to red and 2 pixel were sensitive to infrared as well as blue.

40|$|Background {{potassium}} channels {{control the}} resting membrane potential of neurones and regulate their excitability. Two-pore-domain potassium (2 -PK) channels {{have been shown}} to underlie a number of such neuronal background currents. Currents through human TASK- 1, TASK- 2 and TASK- 3 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes were inhibited by extracellular acidification. For TASK- 3, mutation of histidine 98 to aspartate or alanine considerably reduced this effect <b>of</b> pH. <b>Zinc</b> was found to be a selective blocker of TASK- 3 with virtually no effect on TASK- 1 or TASK- 2. Zinc had an IC 50 of 19. 8 μm for TASK- 3, at + 80 mV, with little voltage dependence associated with this inhibition. TASK- 3 H 98 A had a much reduced sensitivity to zinc suggesting this site is important for <b>zinc</b> <b>block.</b> Surprisingly, TASK- 1 also has histidine in position 98 but is insensitive to <b>zinc</b> <b>block.</b> TASK- 3 and TASK- 1 differ at position 70 with glutamate for TASK- 3 and lysine for TASK- 1. TASK- 3 E 70 K also had a much reduced sensitivity to zinc while the corresponding reverse mutation in TASK- 1, K 70 E, induced zinc sensitivity. A TASK- 3 –TASK- 1 concatamer channel was comparatively zinc insensitive. For TASK- 3, it is concluded that positions E 70 and H 98 are both critical for <b>zinc</b> <b>block.</b> The native cerebellar granule neurone (CGN) leak current, IKSO, is sensitive to <b>block</b> by <b>zinc,</b> with current reduced to 0. 58 of control values in the presence <b>of</b> 100 μm <b>zinc.</b> This suggests that TASK- 3 channels underlie a major component of IKSO. It has recently been suggested that zinc is released from inhibitory synapses onto CGNs. Therefore it is possible that inhibition of IKSO in cerebellar granule cells by synaptically released zinc may have important physiological consequences...|$|R

Foi utilizado o delineamento de blocos casualizados, em esquema fatorial 3 x 2 x 5, com quatro repetições. Os tratamentos envolveram a combinação de três safras de cultivo (inverno, águas e seca), duas fontes de zinco (sulfato e cloreto de zinco) e cinco doses de zinco (0, 100, 200, 400 e 800 g ha- 1), aplicadas via foliar, aos 25 e 35 dias após emergência da cultura. Na safra de inverno, foram obtidos os maiores rendimentos de grãos e de seus componentes (número de vagens por planta e número de grãos por vagem) e teor foliar de zinco, comparativamente, às safras das águas e seca. Não houve efeito da interação entre épocas desemeadura, doses e fontes de zinco.
