5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would <b>just</b> <b>stay</b> in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E
500|$|Deeper {{reflection}} {{is expressed}} in an aria, marked [...] "Aria Violini unisoni e Alto" [...] (Aria Violins in unison and Alto). The singer requests Jesus to stay: (Ah, <b>just</b> <b>stay,</b> my dearest Life). The music {{is based on a}} movement from the lost wedding cantata , BWV Anh. 196, written in 1725 on a libretto by Johann Christoph Gottsched.|$|E
500|$|At 08:24:38, Atta {{tried to}} make an {{announcement}} to the passengers, but pressed the wrong button and sent the message to Boston ARTCC. Air traffic controllers heard Atta announce, [...] "We have some planes. <b>Just</b> <b>stay</b> quiet and you'll be O.K. We are returning to the airport." [...] At 08:24:56, he announced [...] "Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If {{you try to make}} any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. <b>Just</b> <b>stay</b> quiet." [...] As before, Atta thought he was speaking to only the passengers, but his voice was picked up and recorded by air traffic controllers. After the transmissions by Atta and the inability to contact the airliner, air traffic controllers at Boston ARTCC realized the flight had been hijacked. At 08:26, the plane turned south. At 08:32, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, notified FAA headquarters.|$|E

It was directly responsible for getting me to quit all those jobs and <b>just</b> <b>stay</b> acting." ...|$|E

In 1992, Till-Mobley {{had the opportunity to}} listen while Bryant was interviewed about his involvement in Till's murder. With Bryant unaware that Till-Mobley was listening, he asserted that Till had ruined his life, expressed no remorse, and said, [...] "Emmett Till is dead.

500|$|Many reviews {{criticized the}} Andy-Erin plot.

And then something drives him to fight up, and that moment when he comes up and grasps for breath, he is reborn again, which I found weirdly reflective of the scene where Dany is held aloft at the end of season three." ...|$|E
500|$|After a year, {{the coach}} was so {{impressed}} with Nowitzki's progress that he advised him: [...] "You must now decide whether you want to play against {{the best in the world}} or <b>just</b> <b>stay</b> a local hero in Germany. If you choose the latter, we will stop training immediately, because nobody can prevent that anymore. But if you want to play against the best, we have to train on a daily basis." [...] After pondering this lifetime decision for two days, Nowitzki agreed to enter the full-time training schedule, choosing the path to his eventual international career. Geschwindner let him train seven days a week with DJK Würzburg players and future German internationals Robert Garrett, Marvin Willoughby, and Demond Greene, and in the summer of 1994, then 16-year-old Nowitzki made the DJK squad.|$|E

However, the official poster of the tour with the name written on it was leaked on the ticket's website Live Nation prior to the official announcement.

If him and Greg and I can <b>just</b> <b>stay</b> together, and make sure we either all avoid or either all get in the same wrecks, then we'll probably be all right." [...] Earnhardt said he aimed to achieve his sixth victory at Talladega Superspeedway (where he had {{a large amount of}} fan support) in an effort to move ahead in the championship standings. Gordon, who had not won so far during 2008, felt that he could win the race, and employed a strategy where he would attempt to avoid being caught up in a multi-car collision. Johnson felt the AMP Energy 500 would be [...] "interesting" [...] and [...] "a turning point in the chase".|$|E
500|$|The {{family first}} {{appeared}} on screen on 3 June 2003. Later on in the year Indian chef Madhur Jaffrey was cast in EastEnders as Dan's estranged wife, Pushpa. Jaffrey commented, [...] "I {{really wanted to do}} the role because Indian women are usually portrayed as so proper and withdrawn – the kind of women who <b>just</b> <b>stay</b> at home cooking and cleaning. I thought, 'How wonderful of EastEnders to write a character that is realistic.' What my character has done happens all the time in India; {{there are all kinds of}} stories of people running away and marrying their lovers. This is what commonly happens in those places, but somehow the image of Indian womanhood is different." [...] Pushpa was a guest character only appearing for the duration of a storyline that revealed Dan had been lying about her death and had actually left him for another man, Pradeep (Kaleem Janjua) Dan's best friend.|$|E
500|$|Batman's Batmobile was {{an aspect}} of the {{character}} that Rocksteady had wanted to include in its other Arkham games, but were limited by technical constraints. The designers, who worked in conjunction with DC, chose to look at their earlier design from Arkham Asylum, instead of models from the history of Batman comics and media, and evolve that to meet the necessary gameplay requirements. The vehicle was designed to integrate with Batman's on-foot traversal without being a burden; Hill stated, [...] "We didn't want it to be like, 'Okay, the Batmobile is so good I'll <b>just</b> <b>stay</b> in that all the time.' or 'Batman is so powerful gliding around I won't be using the Batmobile.' There's a definite need to use both of those." [...] The world's challenges were set out on the vertical and horizontal plane of the map to discourage players from using only one form of movement, with the Batmobile providing a faster method for moving large distances over gliding. Unlike Arkham Origins, Arkham Knight does not feature a fast travel system as the designers considered traversal {{to be part of the}} game, and allowing players to skip that would detract from the experience. Buildings hit by the vehicle suffer cosmetic damage without slowing the car, as it was considered that being impeded by a collision while turning a corner would diminish the fantasy of driving the Batmobile.|$|E

500|$|Mars co-wrote [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine of The Smeezingtons. The three co-produced {{the song}} with Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, and Emile Haynie. It {{was written in}} the key of D minor, with Mars's vocals range from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Levine {{aforementioned}} that some parts in the song are not instruments as Mars said they needed [...] "a dep-dep-dep-dep sound". Later, Levine told Mars to [...] "sing it into the microphone", where he chopped it up, and despite sounding like an instrument, the sounds are really Mars' voice. The song's composition relies mainly on a [...] "guitar-worthy groove guitar, a soaring sing-along chorus and sexual innuendo galore". It finds Mars singing a confession of a relationship that is so good that he repeats to his love [...] "Your sex takes me to paradise", a verse inspired by Halle Berry [...] "You make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven for too long/ Can I <b>just</b> <b>stay</b> here, {{spend the rest of my}} days here?" [...] he sings. During his Google Hangout on the day of the song's release, Mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from the track. Mars picked the phrase [...] "But swimming in your water is something spiritual," [...] and said that the single's exploration of feeling and being in love fits into the [...] "sensual, sensual and sensual" [...] theme of the album.|$|E
500|$|Portman and Kunis started {{training}} {{six months}} before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers. Portman worked out for five hours a day, doing ballet, cross-training, and swimming. A few months closer to filming, she began choreography training. Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates, [...] "train seven days a week, five hours, for five, six months total, and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1,200 calories a day." [...] She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds, and reported that Portman [...] "became smaller than I did." [...] Kunis said, [...] "I did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet. You wear a tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl. But this is very different because you can't fake it. You can't <b>just</b> <b>stay</b> in there and like pretend you know what you're doing. Your whole body has to be structured differently." [...] Georgina Parkinson, a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), coached the actors in ballet. ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria Riccetto served as [...] "dance doubles" [...] for Portman and Kunis respectively. Dancer Kimberly Prosa also served as a double for Portman. She stated: [...] "Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her. Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the fouettés, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, so I did the rest of whatever dance shots they needed." ...|$|E

Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, {{lack of access to}} the cockpit, and passenger injuries.
