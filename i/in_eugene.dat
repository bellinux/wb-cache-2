5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919.

Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E
5|$|Markov {{processes}} and Markov chains are named after Andrey Markov who studied Markov chains {{in the early}} 20th century. Markov was interested in studying an extension of independent random sequences. In his first paper on Markov chains, published in 1906, Markov showed that under certain conditions the average outcomes of the Markov chain would converge to a fixed vector of values, so proving a weak law of large numbers without the independence assumption, which had been commonly regarded as a requirement for such mathematical laws to hold. Markov later used Markov chains to study the distribution of vowels <b>in</b> <b>Eugene</b> Onegin, written by Alexander Pushkin, and proved a central limit theorem for such chains.|$|E
