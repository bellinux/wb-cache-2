25|$|The Babylonians {{may have}} known the general rules for {{measuring}} areas and volumes. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth {{the square of the}} circumference, which would be correct if π is estimated as 3. The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the base and the height, however, the volume of the <b>frustum</b> of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases. The Pythagorean theorem was also known to the Babylonians. Also, there was a recent discovery in which a tablet used π as 3 and 1/8. The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about seven miles today. This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time. There have been recent discoveries showing that ancient Babylonians may have discovered astronomical geometry nearly 1400 years before Europeans did.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Visibility culling of a {{scene is}} a crucial stage for {{interactive}} graphics applications, particularly for scenes with thousands of objects. The culling time must be small {{for it to be}} effective. A hierarchical representation of the scene is used for efficient culling tests. However, when there are multiple view <b>frustums</b> (as in a tiled display wall), visibility culling time becomes substantial and cannot be hidden by pipelining it with other stages of rendering. In this paper, we address the problem of culling an object to a hierarchically organized set of <b>frustums,</b> such as those found in tiled displays and shadow volume computation. We present an adaptive algorithm to unfold the twin hierarchies at every stage in the culling procedure. Our algorithm computes from-point visibility and is conservative. The precomputation required is minimal, allowing our approach to be applied for dynamic scenes as well. We show performance of our technique over different variants of culling a scene to multiple <b>frustums.</b> We also show results for dynamic scenes. ...|$|R

500|$|In {{the broad}} field of mathematics, Shen Kuo {{mastered}} many practical mathematical problems, including many complex formulas for geometry, circle packing, and chords and arcs problems employing trigonometry. Shen addressed problems of writing out very large numbers, {{as large as}} 1043.

In his formula [...] "technique of intersecting circles", he created an approximation of the {{arc of a circle}} s given the diameter d, sagitta v, and length of the chord c subtending the arc, the length of which he approximated as s = c + 2v2/d. Restivo writes that Shen's work in the lengths of arcs of circles provided the basis for spherical trigonometry developed in the 13th century by Guo Shoujing (1231–1316).

2500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{beginnings of}} geometry {{can be traced}} to early peoples, who discovered obtuse triangles in the ancient Indus Valley (see Harappan Mathematics), and ancient Babylonia (see Babylonian mathematics) from around 3000 BC. Early geometry was a collection of empirically discovered principles concerning lengths, angles, areas, and volumes, which were developed to meet some practical need in surveying, construction, astronomy, and various crafts. Among these were some surprisingly sophisticated principles, and a modern mathematician might be hard put to derive some of them without the use of calculus. For example, both the Egyptians and the Babylonians were aware of versions of the Pythagorean theorem about 1500 years before Pythagoras and the Indian Sulba Sutras around 800 B.C. contained the first statements of the theorem; the Egyptians had a correct formula for the volume of a <b>frustum</b> of a square pyramid; ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{secondary}} {{assembly device}} contained the lithium deuteride fusion fuel in a stainless-steel canister. Running {{down to the}} center of the secondary was a ~1.3cm thick hollow cylindrical rod of plutonium, nested in the steel canister. This was the sparkplug, a tritium-boosted fission device, which had an aperture of about 0.5cm at its center. The sparkplug was charged with about 4 grams of tritium and, imploding together with the secondary's compression, was timed to detonate by the first generations of neutrons that arrived from the primary. Timing was defined by the geometric characteristics of the sparkplug (its uncompressed annular radius), which detonated when its criticality, or k, transcended 1. Its purpose was to compress the fusion material around it from its inside, equally applying pressure with the tamper. The compression factor of the fusion fuel and its adiabatic compression energy determined the minimal energy required for the sparkplug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel and the tamper's momentum. The sparkplug weighed about 18kg, and its initial firing yielded [...] Then it would be completely fissioned by the fusion neutrons, contributing about [...] to the total yield. The energy required by the sparkplug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel was lower than the primary's yield because coupling of the primary’s energy in the hohlraum is accompanied by losses due to the difference between the X-ray fireball and the hohlraum temperatures. The neutrons entered the assembly by a small hole through the ~28cm thick U blast-heat shield. It was positioned in front of the secondary assembly facing the primary. Similar to the tamper-fusion capsule assembly, the shield was shaped as a circular <b>frustum,</b> with its small diameter facing the primary's side, and with its large diameter locked by a type of mortise and tenon joint to the rest of the secondary assembly. The shield-tamper ensemble can be visualized as a circular bifrustum. All parts of the tamper were similarly locked together to provide structural support and rigidity to the secondary assembly. Surrounding the fusion-fuel–spark-plug assembly was the uranium tamper with a standoff air-gap about 0.9cm wide that was to increase the tamper's momentum, a levitation technique used as early as Operation Sandstone and famously quoted by Ted Taylor as hammer-on-the-nail-impact. Since there were also technical concerns that high-Z tamper material would mix rapidly with the relatively low-density fusion fuel, leading to unacceptably large radiation losses the stand-off gap also acted as a buffer to hinder to some extent the unavoidable and undesirable Taylor mixing.|$|E
