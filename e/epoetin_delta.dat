40|$|Background. <b>Epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> is an epoetin that, unlike {{existing}} agents, {{is produced}} in a human cell line. The present study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of intravenous (i. v.) <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> compared with i. v. epoetin alfa. Methods. This was a 6 -month, multicentre, random-ized, double-blind trial in haemodialysis patients previously receiving epoetin alfa. Haematological parameters were assessed, and adverse events mon-itored. Equivalent efficacy {{was defined as a}} difference in mean haemoglobin between the two agents over weeks 12 – 24 of 1 g/dl with a 90 % confidence interval (CI) within the range – 1 to 1 g/dl. Results. In total, 560 patients received <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> while 192 received epoetin alfa, and 76. 8 % and 79. 7 % of patients, respectively, completed the study. Both agents showed similar efficacy in controlling anaemia: the point estimate for the difference in mean haemo-globin over weeks 12 – 24 was 0. 01 g/dl (90 % CI, – 0. 13, 0. 15 g/dl), confirming equivalence. Adverse events were those expected in dialysis patients. Events possibly related to treatment occurred in 9. 2 % of patients receiving <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> and 8. 4 % receiving epoetin alfa. Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 33. 0 % and 26. 7 % of patients in the <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> and epoetin alfa groups, respectively. Six patients in the <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> group experienced an SAE considered possibly related to treatment (mostly access-related clotting), compared with no patient in the <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> group. None of these SAEs were life threatening. Conclusions. <b>Epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> was shown to have an equivalent efficacy and safety profile to epoetin alfa in this 6 -month study...|$|E
40|$|Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) {{are used}} to treat anemia {{associated}} with renal failure. It is now known that these agents also show {{a broad range of}} cell- and tissue-protective effects. In the current study, we explored whether an ESA, <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta,</b> affects vascular pathology linked to diabetes mellitus (DM). In a rat model of streptozotocin-induced DM, we investigated, by pre-embedding electron-immunocytochemistry, whether <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> affects DM-induced structural changes in cerebrovascular endothelium of the rat basilar artery and influences the subcellular distribution of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Epoe-tin delta treatment influenced DM-induced changes to the distribution of eNOS in, and the structure of, the endothelial cell. This may indicate potential beneficial effects of <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> on cerebrovascular endothelium and suggests eNOS as a possible target molecule of <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> in DM...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Anaemia {{is common}} in {{patients}} with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and can be managed by therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). <b>Epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> (DYNEPO ®, Shire plc) is the only epoetin produced in a human cell line. The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneously administered <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> for the management of anaemia in CKD patients (predialysis, peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis) Methods This was a 1 -year, multicentre, open-label study. Patients had previously received epoetin subcutaneously and were switched to <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> at an identical dose to their previous therapy. Dose was titrated to maintain haemoglobin at 10. 0 – 12. 0 g/dL. The primary endpoint was mean haemoglobin over Weeks 12 – 24. Secondary analyses included long-term haemoglobin, haematocrit and dosing levels. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events, laboratory parameters and physical examinations. Results In total 478 patients received <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta,</b> forming the safety-evaluable population. Efficacy analyses were performed on data from 411 of these patients. Mean ± SD haemoglobin over Weeks 12 – 24 was 11. 3 ± 1. 1 g/dL. Mean ± SD weekly dose over Weeks 12 – 24 was 84. 4 ± 72. 7 IU/kg. Haemoglobin levels were maintained for the duration of the study. <b>Epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> was well tolerated, with adverse events occurring at rates expected for a CKD patient population; no patient developed anti-erythropoietin antibodies. Conclusion Subcutaneously administered <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> is an effective and well-tolerated agent for the management of anaemia in CKD patients, irrespective of dialysis status.

40|$|Abstract Background Anaemia is {{a common}} {{complication}} of chronic kidney disease and prevalence increases with declining renal function. Renal anaemia has significant implications for the well-being {{and quality of life}} of patients and impacts on morbidity and mortality. Anaemia can be well managed by therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Previous clinical trials have shown that the only human cell-line-derived ESA, <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta,</b> is well tolerated and effective in maintaining haemoglobin levels in anaemic patients with chronic kidney disease. The half-life of <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> suggests that administration of this agent is feasible once weekly and once every two weeks. We report on the design and rationale of a trial to compare once weekly vs. twice weekly, and once weekly vs. once every two weeks dosing of <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta.</b> Design and methods This is a randomized, open-label, multicentre trial. Patients aged 18 years or above with chronic kidney disease (Stages 3 – 5) are eligible to enter this trial. Two groups of patients form the trial population, those naïve to ESA therapy and those previously stable on ESA therapy. There are two primary objectives of this trial: 1) to demonstrate non-inferiority between twice weekly and once weekly dosing of <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> in previously naïve patients (assessed by haemoglobin at Week 24); 2) to demonstrate non-inferiority between once weekly and once every two weeks dosing in previously stable patients (assessed by average haemoglobin over Weeks 16 – 24). Among the secondary analyses will be assessments of haematocrit, number(%) of patients meeting predefined targets for haemoglobin and haematocrit levels, and comparisons of average dose. All patients will receive study medication for 24 weeks and dose will be adjusted according to a predefined algorithm to achieve and maintain haemoglobin ≥ 11 g/dL. All patients completing this trial are eligible to enter a 2 -year follow-up study to enable monitoring of emergent adverse events, anti-erythropoietin antibody responses, maintenance of efficacy and changes in diabetic retinopathy status. Discussion To our knowledge, this trial is the first to randomize ESA-naïve patients to different dosing regimens of the same ESA. Data generated will help in guiding the most appropriate dosing frequency for <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta,</b> particularly in those patients new to <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> therapy.

40|$|Background: Erythropoiesis {{stimulating}} agents (ESAs) {{are widely}} used to treat anaemia but concerns exist about their potential to promote pathological angiogenesis in some clinical scenarios. In the current study we have assessed the angiogenic potential of three ESAs; <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta,</b> darbepoetin alfa and epoetin beta using in vitro and in vivo models. Methodology/Principal Findings: The epoetins induced angiogenesis in human microvascular endothelial cells at high doses, although darbepoetin alfa was pro-angiogenic at low-doses (1 – 20 IU/ml). ESA-induced angiogenesis was VEGFmediated. In a mouse model of ischaemia-induced retinopathy, all ESAs induced generation of reticulocytes but only epoetin beta exacerbated pathological (pre-retinal) neovascularisation in comparison to controls (p, 0. 05). Only <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> induced a significant revascularisation response which enhanced normality of the vasculature (p, 0. 05). This was associated with mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells and their localisation to the retinal vasculature. Darbepoetin alfa also {{increased the number of}} active microglia in the ischaemic retina relative to other ESAs (p, 0. 05). Darbepoetin alfa induced retinal TNFa and VEGF mRNA expression which were up to 4 fold higher than with <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta</b> (p, 0. 001). Conclusions: This study has implications for treatment of patients as there are clear differences in the angiogenic potentia...|$|E
40|$|The {{recombinant}} human erythropoietins and allied proteins (epoetin alfa, attempted copies and biosimilar variants of epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, <b>epoetin</b> <b>delta,</b> epoetin zeta, epoetin theta, epoetin omega, darbepoetin alfa, and methoxy-polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) {{are among the}} most successful and earliest examples of biotechnologically manufactured products to be used in clinical medicine. This article charts a brief history of their use in clinical medicine, mainly dealing with chronic kidney disease, paying special attention to how these agents were introduced into clinical medicine and what has happened subsequently; in 2009, there were several developments that could be regarded as a “perfect storm ” in terms of the long-term use of these compounds in chronic kidney disease and oncology and, likely, elsewhere. We are now very much at a “crossroads, ” where mature reflection is required, because with the latest trials and meta-analyses, these therapies seem not only expensive but also very much a clinical tradeoff (increased risk of adverse effects versus a small gain in fatigue scores). How we arrived at this crossroads is a useful illustration of how easy it is, without properly designed randomized, controlled trials, to assume that clinical benefit must follow therapeutic interventions.
