50|$|These rifles, {{along with}} their G41(M) counterparts, {{suffered}} from gas system fouling defects. These problems seemed to stem from the overly complex muzzle trap system becoming <b>excessively</b> <b>corroded</b> {{from the use of}} corrosive salts in the ammunition primers, and carbon fouling. The muzzle assembly consisted of many fine parts and was difficult to disassemble, keep clean, and maintain in field conditions.|$|E
50|$|The Walther {{design was}} more {{successful}} because the designers had simply ignored {{the last two}} restrictions listed above. Lacking a bolt, the receiver area was much cleaner than the M version. However, both the Walther and Mauser versions suffered from gas system fouling problems, since gasses at the muzzle cool down and deposit solid carbon fouling. These problems also seemed to stem from the muzzle trap system becoming <b>excessively</b> <b>corroded</b> {{from the use of}} corrosive salts in the ammunition primers. The muzzle assembly consisted of many tight-fitting parts and was difficult to keep clean, disassemble, and maintain in field conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{ship was}} officially christened on 15 February 2013. BAE {{continued}} {{to build the}} vessel in Williamstown, Victoria integrating C3 and sensors to the ship's superstructures. Canberra commenced sea trials on 3 March 2014, sailing under power for the first time. The trials program included a visit to Fleet Base East in Sydney for drydocking tests, before returning to Williamstown for communications and weapons testing. The {{first phase of the}} trials resulted in vibration damage to decking when the thruster pods were run independently at high speed (instead of in tandem, as designed), and a melted circuit breaker board when primary and emergency power systems were activated simultaneously, along with the discovery of a crack in the hull from the delivery voyage, and <b>excessively</b> <b>corroded</b> propeller nuts. The second phase of contractor-run sea trials began in July, after repairs were made, and had concluded by early September.|$|E

The steam cycle used at present is-limited to a maximum temperature of 550 C, because above that the stainless steel tubes deform and <b>corrode</b> <b>excessively.</b> However, to boost efficiency significantly, much higher working fluid temperatures are required.

40|$|Future {{energy systems}} will be {{required}} to fire lower-grade fuels and meet higher energy conversion efficiencies than today's systems. The steam cycle used at present is limited to a maximum temperature of 550 C because above that, the stainless steel tubes deform and <b>corrode</b> <b>excessively.</b> To boost efficiency significantly, much higher working fluid temperatures are required. Although high-temperature alloys will suffice for the construction of these components in the near term, the greatest efficiency increases can be reached only with the use of advanced structural ceramics such as silicon carbide (SiC). However, SiC does not melt, but instead sublimes at temperatures over 2000 C. Therefore, {{it is not possible to}} join pieces of it through welding, and most brazing compounds have much lower melting points, so the joints lose strength at temperatures much lower than the maximum use temperature of the SiC. Since larger objects such as heat exchangers cannot be easily created from smaller ceramic pieces, the size of the SiC structures that can presently be manufactured are limited by the size of the sintering furnaces (approximately 10 feet for sintered alpha SiC). In addition, repair of the objects will require the use of field-joining techniques. Some success has been had by causing silicon and carbon to react at 1400 [...] 1500 C to form SiC in a joint (Rabin, 1995), but these joints contain continuous channels of unreacted silicon, which cause the joints to <b>corrode</b> and creep <b>excessively</b> at temperatures below 1260 C (Breder and Parten, 1996). The objective of this work conducted at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) is to develop a patentable technique for joining large SiC structures in the field. The key to developing a successful technique will be the use of reactive joining compounds to lower the joining temperature without leaving continuous channels of unreacted compounds that can weaken the joint at temperatures below 1260 C or serve as conduits for transport of corrodents. In addition, the method of heating the joint to cause the reaction bonding must be applicable to structures that are large in two dimensions, which precludes the use of furnaces for heating the samples. Special efforts will be made in this project to transfer the developed technologies to the materials industry via licensing agreements through the EERC Foundation...|$|R
