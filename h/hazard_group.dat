40|$|Mycobacterium bovis caused 3 % {{of human}} {{tuberculosis}} cases in southwest Ireland during 1998 – 2006. Of 11 M. bovis strains genotyped, 9 belonged to common animal spoligotypes. Seven strains were from sputum and {{potential sources of}} human-centered disease transmission. Tenlocus variable-number tandem repeat typing gave unique strain profi les and would detect disease outbreaks. Bovine tuberculosis occurs worldwide (1 – 3). It is caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a cattle-adapted member of the M. tuberculosis complex. M. bovis has the broadest host range of pathogenic mycobacteria, infecting domestic and wild mammals, and is classified as a <b>Hazard</b> <b>Group</b> 3 infectious agent (1). Human infection follows ingestion of unpasteurized milk or inhalation of droplet nuclei (1). In many countries, the risk for M. bovis infection in humans has been reduced by a test-and-slaughter program in which infected cattle are identified and culled. This program has eradicated M. bovis cattle infection from 11 states of the European Union (3). However, the Republic of Ireland and its neighbor the United Kingdom have failed to eradicate bovine tuberculosis (1, 4). In the 1980 s, 4 %– 6 % of all cases of laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis in southwest Ireland were caused by M. bovis (5). Our study results suggest that this remains a problem in Ireland. Molecular typing systems for pathogenic mycobacteria are important for epidemiologic control because they enable case-linking and outbreak tracing (6). We repor...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hazara virus (HAZV) is {{a member}} of the Bunyaviridae family of {{segmented}} negative stranded RNA viruses, and shares the same serogroup as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). CCHFV is responsible for fatal human disease with a mortality rate approaching 30 %, which has an increased recent incidence within southern Europe. There are no preventative or therapeutic treatments for CCHFV-mediated disease, and thus CCHFV is classified as a <b>hazard</b> <b>group</b> 4 pathogen. In contrast HAZV is not associated with serious human disease, although infection of interferon receptor knockout mice with either CCHFV or HAZV results in similar disease progression. To characterise further similarities between HAZV and CCHFV, and support the use of HAZV as a model for CCHFV infection, we investigated the structure of the HAZV nucleocapsid protein (N) and compared it to CCHFV N. N performs an essential role in the viral life cycle by encapsidating the viral RNA genome, and thus, N represents a potential therapeutic target. Results: We present the purification, crystallisation and crystal structure of HAZV N at 2. 7 Å resolution. HAZV N was expressed as an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein then purified using glutathione affinity chromatography followed by ion-exchange chromatography. HAZV N crystallised in the P 212121 space group with unit cell parameters a = 64. 99, b = 76. 10, and c = 449. 28 Å. HAZV N consists of a globular domain formed mostly o...|$|E

40|$|As {{temperatures}} increase, {{the onset}} {{and severity of}} droughts {{is likely to become}} more intense. Improved tools for understanding, monitoring and predicting droughts will be a key component of 21 st century climate adaption. The best drought monitoring systems will bring together accurate precipitation estimates with skillful climate and weather forecasts. Such systems combine the predictive power inherent in the current land surface state with the predictive power inherent in low frequency ocean-atmosphere dynamics. To this end, researchers at the Climate <b>Hazards</b> <b>Group</b> (CHG), in collaboration with partners at the USGS and NASA, have developed i) a long (1981 -present) quasi-global (50 degS- 50 degN, 180 degW- 180 degE) high resolution (0. 05 deg) homogenous precipitation data set designed specifically for drought monitoring, ii) tools for understanding and predicting East African boreal spring droughts, and iii) an integrated land surface modeling (LSM) system that combines rainfall observations and predictions to provide effective drought early warning. This talk briefly describes these three components. Component 1 : CHIRPS The Climate <b>Hazards</b> <b>group</b> InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), blends station data with geostationary satellite observations to provide global near real time daily, pentadal and monthly precipitation estimates. We describe the CHIRPS algorithm and compare CHIRPS and other estimates to validation data. The CHIRPS is shown to have high correlation, low systematic errors (bias) and low mean absolute errors. Component 2 : Hybrid statistical-dynamic forecast strategies East African droughts have increased in frequency, but become more predictable as Indo- Pacific SST gradients and Walker circulation disruptions intensify. We describe hybrid statistical-dynamic forecast strategies that are far superior to the raw output of coupled forecast models. These forecasts can be translated into probabilities {{that can be used to}} generate bootstrapped ensembles describing future climate conditions. Component 3 : Assimilation using LSMs CHIRPS rainfall observations (component 1) and bootstrapped forecast ensembles (component 2) can be combined using LSMs to predict soil moisture deficits.

40|$|Systematic soil-gas {{surveys were}} carried out in Northamptonshire to {{investigate}} the distribution of radon and its controlling factors. This followed reports in 1988 of indoor radon levels in the county exceeding the Action Level of 200 Bq m- 3. Over 3300 observations were made using a soil-gas emanometer in traverses crossing all geological formations. Over each formation results {{were found to be}} log-normally distributed, falling within 95 % Confidence Limits. The results are compared with 1026 indoor measurements provided by local authorities. Direct comparisons cannot be made due to different controlling factors; the concentration of radon in soil-gas is determined by the permeability of the source rock and overlying soil and by climate and weather, particularly temperature and wind run. Indoor radon is also affected {{by the nature of the}} house construction, particularly the floor, and heating and ventilation. Both sets of observations show that radon occurrence is primarily controlled by the underlying geology; the relationship is presented as a Radon Hazard Map for Northamptonshire. The highest soil-gas radon levels occur over the Northampton Sand Formation where indoor levels reach 1600 Bq m- 3, clearly presenting an elevated health hazard. The Marlstone Rock Bed, Upper Lincolnshire Limestone and Glacial gravels are also an elevated <b>hazard.</b> <b>Hazard</b> <b>groups</b> are defined as elevated on permeable strata where soil-gas Rn- 222 is 11 Bq L- 1 or over; moderate where soil-gas Rn- 222 is 6 - 8 Bq L- 1 on permeable strata, or 11 Bq L- 1 or over on impermeable strata; slight where soil- gas Rn- 222 is 5 Bq L- 1 or less on permeable strata, or 6 - 8 Bq L- 1 on impermeable strata; and low on impermeable strata where soil-gas Rn- 222 is 5 Bq L- 1 or less.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} a novel interpolation approach that combines long-term mean satellite observations, station data, and topographic fields to produce grids of climate normals and trends. The approach {{was developed by}} the Climate <b>Hazard</b> <b>Group</b> (CHG) at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), to support food security analyses for the U. S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). The resulting FEWS NET Climatology (FCLIM) combines moving window regressions (MWRs) with geostatistical interpolation (kriging). Satellite and topographic fields often exhibit strong local correlations with in situ measurements of air temperature and rainfall. The FCLIM method uses these relationships to develop accurate and unbiased temperature and rainfall maps. The geostatistical estimation process provides standard error fields that take into account the density and spatial distribution of the point observations. These error fields are especially important when evaluating climate trends. Numerous climate change analyses present trend evaluations without assessing spatial uncertainty. In many of these studies, the number of recent observations can be very low, potentially invalidating the results. This study {{presents a}}nalyses for the Sahelian and eastern African rainfall and air temperatures. The results indicate significant rainfall declines in Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya.

Study focus: While {{rainfall}} estimates {{based on}} satellite measurements {{are becoming a}} very attractive option, they are characterized by non-negligible biases. As such, we assessed the accuracy of two satellite products of the Climate <b>Hazard</b> <b>Group</b> (CHG) – (a) a satellite-only Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation (CHIRP) product, and (b) a CHIRP blended with ground-based station data (CHIRPS) – at a monthly time scale from 1981 to 2010 in the Koshi basin of Nepal using ground-based measurements. A separate analysis was also made for the data set after 1992, {{as the number of}} stations used in the blending has significantly reduced since 1992. Next, both CHG data sets were used to calculate one of the most popularly-used precipitation-based drought indicators – the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). New hydrological insights for the study region: The accuracy of the CHG data set was found to be better in low-lying regions, while it was worse in higher-elevation regions. While the CHIRPS data set was better for the whole period, the CHIRP data set was found to be better for the period after 1992. Physiographic region-wise bias correction has improved the accuracy of the CHG products significantly, especially in higher-elevation regions. In terms of SPI values, the two CHG data sets indicated different drought severity when considering the whole period. However, the SPI values, and hence the drought severity were comparable when using the data from after 1992...|$|E
40|$|Eastern Cape Province in South Africa has {{experienced}} extreme drought events {{during the last}} decade. In South Africa, different land management systems exist belonging to two different land tenure classes: commercial large scale farming and communal small-scale subsistence farming. Communal lands are often reported {{to be affected by}} land degradation and drought events among others considered as trigger for this process. Against this background, we analyzed vegetation response to drought in different land management and land tenure systems through assessing vegetation productivity trends and monitoring the intensity, frequency and distribution of the drought hazard in grasslands and communal and commercial croplands during drought and non-drought conditions. For the observation period 2000 – 2016, we used time series of 250 m Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Climate <b>Hazard</b> <b>Group</b> InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) precipitation data with 5 km resolution.

Change in total annual vegetation productivity could detect drought years while drought dynamics during the season could be rather monitored by the VCI.
