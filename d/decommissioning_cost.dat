5000|$|In December 2008, PG&E {{finished}} {{moving the}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} into dry cask storage on site. The next step is the decommissioning of the plant, planned to begin in 2010 along with the two original fossil-fuel-powered steam-turbine generators on site. The plant began being powered by an array of modern, multi-fuel Wärtsilä reciprocating engine-generators in late 2010. The work to dismantle the older turbine generators and continued dismantling of the nuclear side of the operations is scheduled to finish by April 2013. In the 2012 Nuclear <b>Decommissioning</b> <b>Cost</b> Triennial Proceeding (NDCTP) of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) PG&E requested approval of expending additional funds to remove more of the subterranean unit. As of 2009, PG&E planned to leave in place all HBPP3 structures three feet or more below grade (except for the Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) pool), including the concrete caisson surrounding the reactor vessel. In 2012, PG&E concluded that complete removal of the reactor caisson, and containment by a cement slurry wall, is the only appropriate alternative to meet NRC standards for remediating C-14 contamination. Currently, used fuel rods are being stored 44 {{feet above sea level}} in containers with 22,000 pound lids. These containers are filled with Helium, and will remain there for several decades. According to the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission), the dry casks are safe for at least 60 years beyond their licensing agreement.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} legislation for decommissioning offshore infrastructure when production ceases is OSPAR Decision 98/3 on Disposal of Disused Offshore Installations. Under OSPAR legislation, only installations that fulfil certain criteria (on {{the grounds of}} safety and/or technical limitations) are eligible for derogation (that is, leaving the structure, or part of, in place on the seabed). All other installations must be totally removed from the seabed. During the next two decades, the industry will begin to decommission many of the installations that have been producing oil and gas for the past forty years. There are approximately 470 installations to be decommissioned, including very large ones with concrete sub-structures, small, large and very large steel platforms, and subsea and floating equipment, {{the vast majority of}} which will have to be totally removed to the shore for dismantling and disposal. Some 10,000 kilometres of pipelines, 15 onshore terminals and around 5,000 wells are also part of the infrastructure planned to be gradually phased out, although some, or parts, of the onshore terminals will remain because they are import points for gas pipelines from Norway and the Netherlands. Decommissioning is a complex process, representing a considerable challenge on many fronts and encompassing technical, economic, environmental, health and safety issues. Expenditure is therefore projected to be £19 billion by 2030, rising to £23 billion by 2040, for existing facilities. New facilities could add another £2-3 billion to the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>cost,</b> raising the total to circa £25 billion.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} value {{relevance}} of nuclear <b>decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> and back end costs (nuclear recycle costs), which are accruals related to {{nuclear power plants}} in electric utilities. We analyze the association between those accruals and stock price levels {{at the end of}} fiscal year, based on earnings capitalization model. The findings of this paper are as follows. (1) Recognizing of <b>decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> and back end costs contribute to increase the quality of earnings of electric companies. Off-balancing regulation, which compels not to recognize some portion of back end costs, distorts the quality of earnings. (2) <b>Decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> and back end costs, which are measured by estimating of future payments, are value relevant. However, the contents of information differ each other. The result of OLS regression shows that <b>decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> (back end costs) are positively (negatively) associated with stock price levels. (3) Though both discretionary <b>decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> and discretionary back end costs are value relevant, two accruals have different information contents. Moreover, the value relevance of income-increasing (negative signed) discretionary accruals is different form that of income-decreasing (positive signed) discretionary accruals. (4) We cannot observe the signaling effect of discretionary accruals reported in some prior studies. (5) As to the back end costs, although in limited case, we find the conservative behavior of estimating the future payments. In Appendix, we detect the income smoothing strategy of electric companies by discretionary estimation of <b>decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> and back end costs. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 9 years UKAEA has {{developed}} a formalized approach to <b>decommissioning</b> <b>cost</b> estimating. The estimating methodology and computer-based application are known collectively as the PRICE system. At {{the heart of the}} system is a database (the knowledge base) which holds resource demand data on a comprehensive range of decommissioning activities. This data is used in conjunction with project specific information (the quantities of specific components) to produce <b>decommissioning</b> <b>cost</b> estimates. PRICE is a dynamic cost-estimating tool, which can satisfy both strategic planning and project management needs. With a relatively limited analysis a basic PRICE estimate can be produced and used for the purposes of strategic planning. This same estimate can be enhanced and improved, primarily by the improvement of detail, to support sanction expenditure proposals, and also as a tender assessment and project management tool. The paper will: describe the principles of the PRICE estimating system; report on the experiences of applying the system {{to a wide range of}} projects from contaminated car parks to nuclear reactors; provide information on the performance of the system in relation to historic estimates, tender bids, and outturn costs...|$|E

Disposal cost is calculated on a per ton basis and is estimated separately for each wind farm component. The model is parameterized with data from four proposed U.

25|$|Uncertain <b>decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> - Cleanup of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment {{was about}} $130 million, {{for a small}} 8 MW(th) unit.

In addition, <b>decommissioning</b> <b>costs</b> don't scale strongly with plant size based on previous experience, and costs are incurred at the end of plant life, so a small per kilowatthour fee is sufficient.

40|$|One of the {{standard}} practices in estimating costs for new procedures is to apply past experience. In this chapter, Robin Cantor uses prudency hearings and other data from power plant construction to illuminate some of the pitfalls likely to be encountered in preparing estimates for power plant decommissioning. Two of the most tempting pitfalls are scale and learning economies. She suggests that these presumed economies have had less impact on keeping construction costs down than expected, and that they also are unlikely to have much effect on decommissioning costs. Ignoring such evidence, she suggests, could result in <b>decommissioning</b> <b>cost</b> estimates that are too low and collection strategies that are inadequate.
