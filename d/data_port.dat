2500|$|There {{are several}} {{accessories}} available {{with which to}} outfit newer Taser models. From small accessories {{used in conjunction with}} a Taser such as practice targets, maintenance kits, a <b>data</b> <b>port</b> download kit, and the BlackhawkÂ® holster, there are also accessories that are interchangeable with the stock setup of a Taser (factory setup as you would receive it from an authorized Taser dealer). These accessories allow for a customizable weapon to meet the specialized needs of a particular agency or an individual user. Examples are the many power magazines available ...|$|E

[...] "Automatically capturing video and audio unburdens the user from the need to manually turn on the device during a dangerous situation. This is critical and guarantees {{there will always be}} a record of the TASER firing." [...] Designed to be interchangeable between the Taser X26 or Taser X2, the camera records both video and audio automatically each time the Taser is armed (when the safety is moved into the up or active position). There is no interference to the normal function of the Taser; it is still fully functional while the camera is in operation. This innovation coupled with the <b>data</b> <b>port</b> download kit allows for the automatic archiving of critical events for law enforcement agencies.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{typically}} {{described as}} <b>data</b> <b>ports,</b> {{the interface between}} a radio and a TNC is almost entirely analog audio (plus lines for PTT and squelch).

2500|$|The {{method of}} assimilating {{individual}} life-forms into the collective has been represented differently over time. The only constant {{is that the}} infant, and fetal humanoids have been grown in an accelerated state and surgically receive implants connected directly into the brain (cannot be removed without death), as well as ocular devices, tool-enhanced limbs, armor, and other prosthetics. In Star Trek: First Contact, the method of adult assimilation is depicted with the more efficient injection of nanoprobes into the individual's bloodstream through a pair of tubules that spring forth from the drone's hand (while in [...] "The Best of Both Worlds" [...] and , at least some Borg were shown with a syringe like prosthetic that also acted as a <b>data</b> <b>port</b> {{that allowed them to}} interface directly with technology and share data between each other). Assimilation by tubules is depicted on-screen as being a usually fast-acting process, with the victim's skin pigmentation turning gray and mottled with visible dark tracks forming within moments of contact, though it seems that the longer the victim is being injected, the quicker they can be fully transformed. The individual is then taken away for complete assimilation by drones. The tubules can also allow for direct interfacing with technology, while they are also shown to be able to reconfigure and enhance such technology into Borg technology. Sometimes assimilated Borg have been noted to be neither male nor female. [...] One theory could be that their reproductive systems have been removed upon assimilation, yet drones such as Captain Picard and Seven of Nine are easily identified as male and female. The other reason may be that the species from whence they came was gender-less. Drones who have escaped the collective have also been shown to have a gender. The individual has all traces of individuality removed and implants are attached to the new drone so it can become an integrated part of the collective. This method of assimilation is also shown to be much more surgical in nature. In Star Trek: First Contact a captured crew member is shown to have a forearm and an eye physically removed and replaced with cybernetic implants.|$|E

5000|$|The CPU {{communicates}} {{with the}} VDC through an 8-bit bus. A pin {{controlled by the}} CPU separates this bus into two [...] "ports", a control port and a <b>data</b> <b>port.</b> To write or read a byte of video memory, the CPU first has to write two bytes on the VDC's control port to the VDC's internal address register. Next, the CPU performs the actual write or read on the VDC's <b>data</b> <b>port.</b> As a data byte is written or read, the TMS9918 automatically increments the internal address register. This auto-increment feature accelerates writes and reads of blocks of data. The control port {{is also used to}} access various internal registers.|$|E
