25|$|At {{certain times}} of the year these beaches can be covered with dried seaweed from the {{extensive}} marine vegetation under the waters of Western Port, however when the seaweed is not in season, all of Somers beaches boast clean sand. The South Beach has an intricate system of rock pools, this is both of great interest to beachcombers, and something of a curse, as the beach is a difficult place to swim. The Merricks Creek Inlet is a tidal creek that flows with the tides of Western Port. About 50cm {{below the surface of the}} sandbed of the creek lies a darker sand that gives off a hydrogen sulphide smell when disturbed. Sand all these beaches is generally fine grain mixed with crushed sea shells. Small reefs exist in a few places and can be seen at low tide, but these are only rocky reefs incapable of supporting coral. At low tide these reefs can make navigation near the beach difficult for watercraft and are clearly marked with buoys. A succession of big storm tides came in on 24 March, 25 March, 22 April, 23 April and 15 June 2011, severely eroding the sand dunes east the Merricks Creek. In 2012, the wooden wall that had fixed that path of the Merricks Creek since 1974, was taken down, as it was deemed unsafe and not adequately performing its job anymore. Starting in July 2012 and finishing in September 2012, a new rock wall was built, to fix the creek on a path straight into Westernport. For the three and a half years the wall has been in place, a noticeable buildup of sand has occurred east of the wall, while considerable erosion has occurred west of the wall. In November 2015, the entrance to the Merricks Creek was filled in with a sand groyne, as a short term solution to the constant <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> <b>odour</b> caused by the breakdown of sea grasses within the creek. As of June 2016, the sand groyne is still in place, and as such the surrounding beaches have benefitted with the buildup of sand.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} LGM and Holocene marine sediments is an {{important}} goal in Antarctic research and needs high-resolution sequences to reconstruct paleoclimatic events in detail. Literature reports {{a large number of}} data coming from inner-shelf bays and fjords, especially around Antarctic peninsula, but also from western Ross Sea. In this note we discuss compositional data from a gravity core (BAY 05 - 45 c; 74 ° 09. 7 ’ S, 165 ° 57. 7 ’ E; water depth: 1058 m; core length: 445. 5 cm) collected in 2005 during the Italian PNRA cruise into the inner part ofWood Bay, in front of the Aviator Ice tongue. Wood Bay sea floor morphology is charcterised by a narrow basin, deeper than 1, 000 m, oriented WNW-ESE, and transversally connected, by a 800 -m deep sill, to the Drygalski basin, streching NE-SW. Core sediment is composed by laminated biosiliecous mud, with a strong <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> <b>odour</b> and black in colour. Within a few days from core sampling, sediment became oxidized: laminae colour ranges from dark (from dark olive grey to black) to light (from olive grey to olive). Some lighter laminae have cotton-like texture. Data set include X-ray images, magnetic susceptibility, AMS 14 C dating, organic carbon, biogenic silica, XRF-scan of major and minor elements. Discussion of the data will point out inferences about sedimentary processes, paleoproductivity and oceanographic conditions during the Holocene. The most apparent feature is the occurrence, down-core, of at least two intervals of increased productivity, characterised by higher organic carbon and biogenic silica. Within such intervals, a few cm-thick levels show peaks of biogenic silica, as well as of barium, which correspond to relatively lows in organic carbon contents. Organic carbon content is higher in darker laminae, whereas lighter and fluffy laminae display an increased percentage of biogenic silica. Such levels probably mark a rapid and not persistent change in phytoplankton assemblage compositions...|$|E
30|$|From the {{available}} data, {{it was observed}} that untreated SIWW have fishery odour Unpleasant odours in food industry wastewater are usually caused by gases produced by anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. The most common odour causing compound is <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> whose characteristic <b>odour</b> is that of rotten eggs (Metcalf and Eddy 2003). Sulphur is required in the synthesis of proteins and is released into the degradation process. Under anaerobic conditions, sulphate is reduced biologically to sulphide which can further combine with <b>hydrogen</b> forming <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> (H 2 S). This gas is readily soluble in water, colourless and inflammable, but also toxic. Although <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> is the most common gas formed during the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter when considering odours, other volatile compounds, such as indole, skatole and mercaptans, may cause odours far more unpleasant than H 2 S. Some other gases, such as carbon dioxide resulting from the decomposition of organic matter or nitrogen dissolved from the atmosphere, are also responsible for odour. The control of odours has become more important in the designing and operating of wastewater collection, treatment and disposal plants. Odours are the foremost concern of the public in wastewater treatment processes. Quite often, the psychological stress caused by odours is far more important than the harm they do to the health of humans (Droste 1997).|$|R
40|$|Application of {{zinc oxide}} (ZnO) {{nanoparticles}} was evaluated {{as a possible}} measure to mitigate the levels of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> (H 2 S), ammonia (NH 3) and odour in swine facilities. Two deployment techniques were investigated: direct mixing of zinc oxide nanoparticles into the slurry, and filtration with nanoparticles as filtering media for the manure gases. The overall goal of this work {{was to determine the}} impact of the treatments on <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide,</b> ammonia and <b>odour</b> emissions, pig performance and manure characteristics as well as to assess the feasibility of the application of this technology in a typical swine barn. Semi-pilot scale tests were conducted to evaluate operational factors in open system conditions, the results of which showed that the mixing method required a particle-to-slurry ratio of 3 grams of zinc oxide per litre of slurry to control <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> and ammonia levels. Using the air filtration technique, a fluidized bed filter design with a 0. 28 g/cm 2 loading rate and rated at 0. 5 m/s face velocity was found to be the most effective combination for controlling gas levels. Room-scale experiments were conducted in specially designed chambers to assess the effectiveness of the treatments under conditions that represent commercial swine production. The addition of zinc oxide nanoparticles into the manure achieved more than 95 % reduction in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> levels while no significant effects on ammonia concentrations were observed. Zinc oxide nanoparticles were persistent in maintaining low <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> levels up to 15 days after treatment application. On the other hand, the ventilation air recirculation system with a zinc oxide filter achieved significant reduction in both <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> and ammonia concentrations at the animal- and human-occupied zones. Neither treatment had any significant impact on pig performance and manure nutrient characteristics. Estimates of the cost of application of the treatments in a 100 -head grow-finish room showed that employing the air filtration method amounted to around 3. 8 % of the average total cost of production, which was economically more feasible than the mixing method; however, various options can be pursued to further reduce the cost of application of both treatments...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the influence of olfaction on subjective valence intensity ratings of visual presentations. Pictures of five different categories (baby, flower, erotic, fear and disgust) were presented each being associated with five different odour conditions [no odour, low and high concentrations of phenylethyl alcohol (positive odour) and low and high concentrations of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> (negative <b>odour)</b> ]. Study participants had to rate the emotional content of each picture with respect to valence and intensity while brain activities were recorded with a whole-cortex magnetoencephalograph (MEG). A significant interaction between odour condition and picture category with respect to rating performance was found. In particular, positive valence intensity ratings related to flowers were increased in positive and negative odour conditions. Negative valence intensity ratings related to disgusting pictures were also increased in positive and negative odour conditions. The only decrease was found in the baby category in the high concentration negative odour condition. No behavioural effects were found for the categories erotic and fear. Around 300 ms after stimulus onset odour-related brain activity effects were found for all picture categories. On the other hand, around 700 ms after stimulus onset odour-related brain activity effects occurred only in the flower, fear and disgust picture categories. We interpret that early information processing demonstrates more pronounced olfactory and visually induced emotion interaction than later information processing. Since the early time window more likely reflects subconscious information processing we interpret that interaction between olfaction and visually induced emotion mostly occurs below the level of consciousness. Later, rather conscious information processing, seems to be differently influenced by simultaneous olfaction depending on the kind of emotion elicited through the sense of vision...|$|R

30|$|When carbon {{monoxide}} was pre-adsorbed over the Rh/silica at 293  K and then <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> adsorbed {{over the same}} catalyst, the amount of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> adsorbed was reduced by 85 %. There {{was no evidence of}} {{carbon monoxide}} being displaced suggesting that the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> was accessing sites that were unavailable to carbon monoxide. The extent of hydrogen evolution indicates that the mode of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> adsorption had changed, such that 80 % of the adsorbed sulphur was in the form HS(ads). When <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> was pre-adsorbed and then carbon monoxide adsorbed over the same catalyst, the behaviour observed was similar to the CO/H 2 S couple, but with the carbon monoxide adsorption reduced by 88 %. The two sequential adsorption experiments suggest that there are three sites on the surface, one that adsorbs both carbon monoxide and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide,</b> one that adsorbs only <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> and one which only adsorbs carbon monoxide. These results are in accordance with the literature [7], where multiple sites were also proposed. However, when we consider the co-adsorption experiment, we find a much lower total adsorption (Table  2). The nature of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> adsorption appears similar in that the amount of hydrogen liberated during the adsorption is the same as for the single-gas adsorption. Nevertheless, the adsorption capacity has reduced. It is not clear why such a reduction takes place although both adsorbates may cause restructuring of the metal crystallites.|$|R
40|$|Predicting <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> {{concentration}} in sewer network through modelling tools will {{be beneficial for}} many stakeholders to design appropriate mitigation strategies. However, the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> modelling in a sewer network is crucially dependent on the hydraulic modelling of the sewer. The establishment of precise <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> and hydraulic modelling however requires detailed and accurate information about the sewer network structure and the model parameters. This paper outlines a novel approach {{for the development of}} hydraulic and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> modelling to predict the concentration of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> in sewer network. The approach combines the calculation of wastewater generation and implementation of flow routing on the EPA SWMM 5. 0 platform to allow hydrodynamic simulations. Dynamic wave routing is used for hydraulic simulations. It is considered to be the best approach to route existing/old sewer flow. The build-up of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> model includes the empirical models of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> generation and emission. Trial of the model was conducted to simulate a sewer network in Seoul, South Korea with some hypothetical data. Further analysis on the use of chemical dosing on the sewer pipe was also performed by the model. Promising results have been obtained through the model, however calibration and validation of the model is required.

40|$|Sulphurous {{mineral waters}} have been {{traditionally}} used in medical hydrology as treatment for skin, respiratory, and musculoskeletal disorders. However, driven by recent intense research efforts, topical treatments {{are starting to}} show benefits for pulmonary hypertension, arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, heart failure, peptic ulcer, and acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. The beneficial effects of sulphurous mineral waters, sulphurous mud, or peloids made from sulphurous mineral water {{have been attributed to}} the presence of sulphur mainly in the form of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide.</b> This form is largely available in conditions of low pH when oxygen concentrations are also low. In the organism, small amounts of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> are produced by some cells where they have numerous biological signalling functions. While high levels of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> are extremely toxic, enzymes in the body are capable of detoxifying it by oxidation to harmless sulphate. Hence, low levels of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> may be tolerated indefinitely. In this paper, we review the chemistry and actions of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> in sulphurous mineral waters and its natural role in body physiology. This is followed by an update of available data on the impacts of exogenous <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> on the skin and internal cells and organs including new therapeutic possibilities of sulphurous mineral waters and their peloids...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of <b>hydrogen</b> from <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> has a twofold goal {{as it can}} be seen as a challenging opportunity for combining hydrogen recovery with the abatement of a highly toxic pollutant. Despite the thermodynamics encourage <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> splitting with respect to water splitting, no <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> dissociation process proving a net superiority with respect to others has been exploited at large scale yet. This paper aims at surveying the most important techniques being proposed for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> splitting, with a particular attention to chemical methods that seem to be promising candidates for real industrial applications. Several processes based on thermal dissociation, catalytic cracking, multistep thermochemical methods and photocatalytic splitting are compared and critically analysed pointing out merits and drawbacks having a basic role in technology transfer. The main objective of this short review consists of collecting new process trends and improvements in pre-existing strategies in matter of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> dissociation during the last two decades. Some new techniques here reported are inspired to recent issues in material science and nanotechnology bringing basic innovations for a non-conventional hydrogen production from such a waste...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> {{formation}} in sewage {{is supposed to}} be due to two distinct processes, the splitting of protein by certain organ-isms and the reduction of inorganic sulphates by others. Led-erer (1913) concludes that more <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> is formed under 'anaerobic than under aerobic conditions. He thinks that the formation of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> from protein is a selective process and that it depends a great deal on the position of the sulphur radical in the protein molecule. At any rate other fac-tors than reduction are involved in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> formation. An organism may be a very strong nitrate reducer {{and at the same time}} a weak <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> former, although both reac-tions are reducing processes. Lederer is of the opinion that the reduction of inorganic sulphates may however be an important factor in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> formation, and thinks it probable that the action may be due to some unknown specific organism similar to the Spirillum desulphuricans of Beijerinck (1895). Several workers have observed the formation of hydrogen sul-phide in large quantities in the effluent of sewage disposal plants. Barr and Buchanan (1912) report the isolation of a specific or-ganism in one such instance. Clark (1913) and others have re-ported the reduction of inorganic sulphates in sewages. Sulphur metabolism may also play a beneficial r 6 le in sewage disposal in that certain species of bacteria may cause the oxida-tion of sulphur and of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> to sulphates thus reduc-ing the amount of odor. This is a well known property of such organisms as Beggiatoa and Thiothrix (Jordan, 1918) ...|$|R

The decline of combustion gas capacity, metal instrument corrosion in gas piping, and the environmental pollution from gas emission can affect by their presence. Bio-filter is one of the methods that selected to reduce sulphur content in natural gas. A lab scale study of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> reduction in natural gas had conducted in oil and gas field using bio-filter method. The bio-filter system (± 1 L volume) contains an active carbon and thiosulphide medium as a substrate, Thiobacillus thioparus as a single culture of sulphur bacteria, and Thiobacillus thioparus with sludge as a mixed culture of sulphur bacteria. The study of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> reduction was conducted with continuous flow line process. The gas flow rate approximately 1. 5 L/min with a fluctuate {{presence of}} <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> (approximately 40 - 70 mg/L). The bio-filter system contains active carbon, thiosulphide medium, and single culture of T. thioparus appear as a good filter for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> reduction. During 24 hours, the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> reduction obtains 93 % to 16 %. When culture media added, the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> reduction will increase almost 60 % and then the reduction decrease to 4 % after 20 hours.
