5000|$|In May 2014, Tim decided his {{relationship}} with Sally should {{come to an end}} and dumped her. Discussing Tim's reason behind his actions, Duttine said: [...] "She was getting a bit judgmental about Tim’s opinion of Maddie, and she wasn’t very sympathetic about Maddie’s situation with Ben. Plus, she was being a bit snobby about his window cleaning job. She lost her sense of humour, and I think when Tim tried to lighten the mood, it didn’t go down very well. He just thought she was being too much of a nightmare and bailed out. For Tim, it’s all about having an easy life and not wanting too much conflict or confrontation." [...] They quickly reunited and when Sally spots Tim in a jewellers, she jumps to the conclusion he is going to propose. This makes Tim consider proposing to Sally. Talking to Lynn Connolly of Unreality TV, Duttine said: [...] "He goes in there to buy Faye a watch, but then Sally jumps to the conclusion that he’s going to propose to her. He then goes to buy a ring with the intention of proposing to Sally because he feels it’s what she wants, not because he wants it. So I guess he does love her, and he’s putting her first and trying to please her." [...] Duttine continued to say how after Tim proposes, they discuss their relationship and realise neither of them want to get married, before revealing he [...] "un-proposes" [...] to Sally in the Rovers Return Inn. Duttine said he thought this was [...] "sweet". Duttine also went on to say how he felt Tim and Sally were a [...] "good, fun couple". In May 2015, Duttine and Dynevor discussed Tim and Sally's relationship with Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden on ITV daytime programme, This Morning, with Dynevor saying how she initially thought Tim and Sally would not go well as a couple: [...] "I was like, 'Tim Metcalfe and Sally Webster - how <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work?' but as soon as they put us together and we got the script and starting working together we found things hilariously funny." [...] Duttine commented that Tim is [...] "just pleased to be here and glad somebody will have him."

40|$|In {{primates}} {{the retina}} {{is connected with}} different targets in the brain via several parallel pathways, the largest of which <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and thence to the striate cortex, the geniculo-striate pathway. When this route is damaged in man, apparent blindness in a corresponding part of the visual field occurs, despite {{the integrity of the}} other parallel pathways. In animals, it has been demonstrated by conventional behavioural forced-choice techniques that extrastriate routes can sustain a variety of visual discriminations. Comparable discriminations are also possible in some human subjects with geniculo-striate damage when forced-choice 'guessing' techniques are used. 'Blind-sight' refers to those subjects who state that they are unaware of the visual stimuli, even when performing discriminations at high levels of proficiency. Extensions of this approach are reviewed, especially to spectral sensitivity and movement discrimination. But residual capacities can also be assessed without requiring guessing responses, thereby avoiding issues of differential response criteria and other practical difficulties. Effects of 'unseen' stimuli in the cortically blind field on the visible perception of concurrent stimuli in the intact field can be measured. Also, positive reactions of the autonomic nervous system, such as the galvanic skin response, can be recorded to visual stimuli presented in the blind field. Recent evidence demonstrates that the pupil in normal adult subjects is systematically sensitive to structural and chromatic features of visual stimuli. Pupillometry reveals specific changes and residual capacities in visual-field defects of adult patients with striate cortical damage. Thus non-verbal and sensitive methods are available that permit the comparative study of normal and residual visual capacity in human infants, adults and infra-human animals...|$|E
