The basin also {{supports a}} large range of animal life both {{in and around the}} river. However, the development of the river has threatened the continuing existence of a number of different species. Across the country, thirty to fifty (or higher) percent of endangered species are from freshwater river systems and the impact on the Shinano river system is also clear. Primarily this affects fish and amphibians due to their reliance on the river. The construction of weirs and dams to support agriculture and industry as well as the introduction of invasive species and pollution have been the main causes of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>degradation.</b> The Shinano basin provides a habitat for around twenty-five percent of Japan's fish species (around fifty-five of the 200 fish species living in Japan) including both endemic freshwater fish as well as diadromous fish.|$|E

However, their behaviour differs: analysis of ecosystems reveals that pollution mainly affects fresh water, while overexploitation impacts mainly on agro-ecosystems.

25|$|Coastal {{ecosystems}} {{suffer from}} a variety of anthropogenic impacts, such as large-scale eutrophication, food web alteration, runaway consumer effects, climate change, habitat destruction, and disease. Rarely do these factors act in isolated ways. Often, researchers find additive or synergistic interactions between impacts compounding the amount of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>degradation.</b> One such example is found in salt marshes in the southeastern United States. Depletion of top predators in these systems has led to snail overgrazing of salt marsh cordgrass and subsequent die-off (as explained above). However, this die-off has been linked with intense drought conditions and the resultant increases in salt and acid stress (Silliman et al. 2005). Drought stress that raises soil salinities and increases cordgrass vulnerabilities to top-down control may be a product of climate change (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman et al. 2005). Cases such as these highlight how abiotic and biotic interactions can interact to affect ecosystem health.|$|E

Zoige Marsh has a large area of high-quality grasslands, serving as the fifth largest livestock base in China, and it is also the major water source to the headstream of the Yellow River.

40|$|A key methodological {{challenge}} {{in understanding the}} relationship between the economy and the underlying ecosystem base resides in how to account for the <b>ecosystem’s</b> <b>degradation</b> and the decline of associated ecosystem services. In this study, we use information on nutrients and metals concentrations from the Environmental Change Network (ECN) database and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) for the period 2000 – 2010 in order to assess the assimilation capacity of water systems. The research covers five upstream sites and 17 downstream sites in northeast Scotland. Our results highlight the relevance of considering a number of pollutants, and suggest that elements such as arsenic, lead and mercury can pose a threat to ecosystems’ sustainability and health. However, little research has been done in terms of their assimilation capacity and their impact on grey water footprint assessments. In addition, the results indicate that background conditions might be relevant when performing sustainability analysis at different spatial scales. The study also poses relevant questions in relation to land management approaches versus traditional ‘end-of-pipe’ water treatment approaches, and the definition of maximum and background concentrations. In this regard, further studies will be required to understand the trade-offs between different ecosystem services depending on how these concentrations are defined...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent {{importance}} {{has been}} placed on the ecological and socio-economic aspects of mangroves for adjacent coastal populations, in terms of flood defense, food resources, employment and generation of income. Anthropogenic stressors, such as direct clearance, hydrological alterations, climatic change effects or chemical pollution contribute to mangrove <b>ecosystems</b> <b>degradation.</b> While the relative impact is not well understood, the hydrodynamics specific to mangroves (intertidal, land-marine interface) are undoubtedly influencing those effects. In the present study, a computer-based model was built to understand the hydrodynamic flow characteristic in a mangrove ecosystem, the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve in Singapore, with the wider intent to better understand the transport of chemical substances in mangroves. Field surveys in the mangrove and the preliminary development of a two-dimensional hydrodynamic (2 DH) model have been carried out. Higher bottom roughness was considered in the vegetated part of the model domain to account for the effect of mangrove roots. Spatial and temporal distributions, as well as minor mean differences between simulated and observed results, suggest that the developed model capture satisfactorily the tidal dynamics within the river, the wetland area covered with mangroves and in the strait. These results indicate that the hydrodynamics are properly understood within the Sungei Buloh mangrove ecosystem and can be used for modeling the fate of chemicals...|$|R

Agricultural research institutions (and researchers individually) are increasingly constrained by ethical issues related to biofuels.

40|$|Urbanization phenomena, {{associated}} with soil sealing, {{can lead to}} an increase in surface runoff, environmental pollution and <b>ecosystems</b> <b>degradation</b> with risks to human health and economic losses by floods. Then, new urban development strategies and land management models are essential. The European Union Water Framework Directive (2000) requires Member States to draw up efficient measures to ensure sustainable use of water resources. Several Best Management Practices (BMPs) were developed at this aim. BMPs are usually multifunctional structures (e. g. wetland and green roofs) that can provide suitable Habitat for species and bring to the maintenance of biodiversity, allow climate regulation by evaporation and adsorption of solar radiation together with aesthetic/amenity, recreational and educational benefits, enhancing the urban quality of life and social interaction. However, especially in Italy, the full integration of BMPs in territorial planning and urban (re-) design is not fully realized yet. The control of water quality and quantity has often been realized by isolated and localized interventions (e. g. detention/infiltration basins) without a “smart” and systemic project based on a holistic environmental sustainability concept. Through an application of a synthetic index for urban permeability assessment (RIE Index), this paper presents a systemic approach to urban green planning to reduce surface runoff in a pilot area of Bari city, increasing soil permeability and reducing hydraulic risk. This green and sustainable storm water management approach would be able to furnish environmental benefits and services to the citizens, enhancing quality of life in urban contexts...|$|R

40|$|Anaerobic {{bacteria}} play {{a crucial}} role in cycling of nutrients in diverse <b>ecosystems,</b> <b>degradation</b> of organic compounds, and as key members of the human gut microbiome. The absence of oxygen limits the chemistry that bacteria can perform; however, these organisms do make use of organic radical cofactors that are oxygen sensitive. This thesis presents a structural analysis of three enzymes that utilize a glycyl radical cofactor to perform difficult, radical-based chemistry. Benzylsuccinate synthase catalyzes the first step in the anaerobic degradation of toluene, a major component of gasoline and an environmental pollutant. Choline trimethylamine-lyase is used by gut bacteria to degrade choline, producing a byproduct, trimethylamine, which is linked to human diseases. These two enzymes share a common protein fold and also utilize a similar series of steps to initiate chemistry on their substrates. However, once they have generated a radical intermediate, the enzyme active site guides very different chemical steps in these two enzymes. Class III ribonucleotide reductases catalyze the same chemical reaction as observed in aerobic or oxygen independent systems, but utilize a glycyl radical cofactor to initiate chemistry. X-ray crystal structures have given us snapshots of these enzymes in action and accompanying biochemical experiments are help reveal the mechanisms they use to control radical chemistry. These structures have highlighted the potential diversity of chemical reactions available to anaerobic organisms through the use of a conserved enzyme fold. by Michael A. Funk. Thesis: Ph.
