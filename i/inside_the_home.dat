5|$|The first {{remodeling}} {{work on the}} Ellwood Mansion {{took place}} as the 19th century drew to a close. The changes, commissioned by Isaac Ellwood, were meant to reflect more popular architectural styles including the Georgian and Colonial Revival. Many of the building's original Gothic features were replaced with more Classical elements. On the home's exterior, some of these changes {{can be observed in}} the addition of the portico and porte-cochere. <b>Inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home,</b> the dining room was enlarged with the addition of the semicircular bay on the mansion's north facade.|$|E

25|$|On October 14, at 9:15p.m., 47-year-old Linda Franklin (née Moore), an FBI {{intelligence}} {{analyst who}} was a resident of Arlington County, Virginia, was shot dead in a covered parking lot at Home Depot {{with her husband in}} Fairfax County, Virginia, just outside Falls Church at Seven Corners Shopping Center.

25|$|Information: This is the {{day when}} {{families}} pray for the happiness and prosperity of their girls and to help ensure that they grow up healthy and beautiful. The celebration takes place both <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> and at the seashore. Both parts are meant to ward off evil spirits from girls.

25|$|Another {{factor is}} the level of privacy to which a person can be assured - for example, some parts of a home may be seen from the outside or there may be a {{possibility}} of others walking in. The expectation of privacy may be confined to the home and sometimes the backyard. <b>Inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home,</b> it may be restricted to the bedroom or just the bathroom. If a person is not alone, their comfort in removing clothing in front of another person will generally depend on the nature of a relationship of those who jointly occupy the same private space, as well as the attitudes of others to nudity. Besides the nature of a relationship, attitudes and incidences of nudity will also depend on the level of inhibition that each person has, as well as the level of privacy to which that they can be assured. Sometimes a person may unintentionally intrude on a person who is in the nude, which may lead to embarrassment of {{one or both of the}} people. The nude person may seek to quickly cover their private parts, while the clothed person may turn away, but this also depends on cultural differences and the relationship of the people.|$|E

500|$|Observers {{agree that}} Pandey's ordeal {{has brought a}} change to public conversations about women's issues, with men joining in the discussions as well. A young woman who had taken part in the protests {{at the time of}} the rape said a year later, [...] "A welcome change is that the taboo on {{discussing}} rape and sexual violence has been broken. The protests brought debates and discussions to our homes." [...] She also said that since the rape and protests the media is now providing coverage of sexual violence. However, she saw [...] "absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing [...] and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere. Sexual harassment in public places as well as <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> is still rampant." [...] She added, [...] "I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what patriarchy has done over centuries. It is too embedded in our homes, our institutions and in our laws. The police may be a little more receptive, but it is not out of a sense of duty but out of the fear of censure".|$|E
500|$|On October 24, {{during the}} early morning, Farrar {{received}} a phone call at his apartment from a neighbor who shouted that his house—meaning the Farrar–Green family home in Prairie Village—was on fire.

At least two firefighters attempted to search <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> for the missing children, but the building was so consumed by flames that they could only access {{a small portion of the}} ground level before the structure became unsafe.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the people}} of the Archaic-Early Basketmaker Era were nomadic hunter gatherers who roamed the Colorado Plateau to hunt game or gather {{seasonal}} wild plants, their homes were easily built. The bands of people generally inhabited rock alcoves or lived out in the open in brush shelters and lean-tos. The dwellings were made by digging a shallow basin and building a frame of wooden logs {{in the shape of a}} cone, dome or tent. The frames were covered with brush and earthen daub that acted as a sealant for protection against the elements. Rocks may have been placed around the base of the shelter or lean-to and fire pits were sometimes used <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes.</b> <b>The</b> shallow-basined lodgings are considered a precursor to the Basketmaker pit-houses.|$|R

500|$|Within a {{month of}} {{returning}} from their honeymoon Isabella was pregnant.

The magazine was affordable, aimed at young middle class women and was commercially successful, selling 50,000 issues a month by 1856. Isabella began by translating French fiction for publication as stories or serials. Shortly afterwards she started to work on the cookery column—which had been moribund for the previous six months following the departure of the previous correspondent—and the household article. The Beetons' son, Samuel Orchart, was born towards the end of May 1857, but died at the end of August that year. On the death certificate, {{the cause of death was}} given as diarrhoea and cholera, although Hughes hypothesises that Samuel senior had unknowingly contracted syphilis in a premarital liaison with a prostitute, and had unwittingly passed the condition on to his wife, which would have infected his son.|$|E
