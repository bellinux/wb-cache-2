5|$|After the 2004 season, four Trojan {{assistant}} coaches were offered and took jobs elsewhere. The most notable coach lost was offensive coordinator Norm Chow {{who took a}} job in the same position for the Tennessee Titans. Also leaving, were defensive line coach Ed Orgeron, who took the head coaching position at Ole Miss, quarterbacks coach Carl Smith, who became the offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars, and offensive line coach Tim Davis who was hired by the Miami Dolphins. Carroll rebuilt his staff by elevating Ken Norton, Jr. from <b>graduate</b> <b>assistant</b> to full-time assistant coaching the linebackers, and hiring Steve Sarkisian, who was with the Oakland Raiders in 2004 and was formerly with the Trojans, as quarterbacks coach. Pat Ruel, who was with the New York Giants in 2004, to coach the offensive line, and Jethro Franklin, who spent 2004 with the Green Bay Packers, as defensive line coach, Sarkisian would additionally be named as assistant head coach and Lane Kiffin, wide receivers coach, would add recruiting and offensive coordinating to his duties.|$|E
5|$|Bob Stoops {{returned}} for his eighth season as Oklahoma's head coach. During the off-season, {{he was once}} again mentioned {{as a candidate for}} positions outside of Oklahoma. While Stoops decided to stay in Norman, the rest of the Oklahoma coaching staff did see some changes. The biggest change came at the offensive coordinator position. Former offensive coordinator Chuck Long left Oklahoma to take the head coaching job at San Diego State University. Stoops chose somebody already on the staff to fill Long's spot. Kevin Wilson was named the new offensive coordinator after previously serving as the co-offensive coordinator along with Long as well as the offensive line coach. Rejoining the staff was former Sooner quarterback Josh Heupel, who led Oklahoma to the 2000 National Championship. Heupel had served two years as a <b>graduate</b> <b>assistant</b> before taking a position with Mike Stoops, Bob Stoops's brother, at the University of Arizona in 2005. Heupel took over Long's old position of quarterback coach. Leaving the staff was Darrell Wyatt, who spent four years as the wide receivers coach. He took a position with the NFL's Minnesota Vikings. This move launched another reshuffle of duties on Stoops's staff. Coach Kevin Sumlin took over Wyatt's duties with the wide receivers and was also named co-offensive coordinator with Wilson. Coach James Patton was hired on from Northwestern to take over Wilson's duties with the offensive line.|$|E

40|$|The Literacy/Reading {{program for}} <b>Graduate</b> <b>Assistants</b> {{teaching}} developmental reading {{students at a}} large, state university currently provides one week of teacher training prior {{to the beginning of}} the Fall Semester. The small group of <b>graduate</b> <b>assistants</b> in this program (including the program coordinator) are primary instructors and teach one or two sections of developmental reading, test taking, time management, and learning strategies. The main purpose for evaluating the training program was to determine the effectiveness of the training. Data was collected through a Likert survey, which included some qualitative questions, and person-to-person interviews. The results of the Likert survey are that the high quality of the training sessions, the presenters, and the strategies that were presented helped <b>graduate</b> <b>assistants</b> to better do their jobs. The results of the qualitative questions and person-to-person interviews also conclude that the fall training was very helpful and should definitely be continued. However, the results of the qualitative portion of the study also yielded additional, unexpected insights into the perceptions of <b>graduate</b> <b>assistants</b> who feel they are marginalized graduate students, teaching marginalized college courses (Reading and Study Strategies), and serving a marginalized population of students—developmental university students...|$|R
25|$|An {{additional}} {{strike by}} teachings assistants, contract faculty, and <b>graduate</b> <b>assistants</b> took place throughout March 2015.

The teaching <b>assistants</b> and <b>graduate</b> <b>assistants,</b> however, continued their strike {{until the end of}} the month. The union reached a tentative agreement with the university on March 29, 2015 which was ratified on March 31, 2015, thus putting an immediate end to the 29-day strike.|$|R
