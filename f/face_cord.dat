2500|$|In the United States and Canada, {{firewood}} {{is usually}} {{sold by the}} cord, 128ft³ (3.62 m³), corresponding to a woodpile 8ft wide × 4ft high of 4ft-long logs. The cord is legally defined by statute in most U.S. states. [...] A [...] "thrown cord" [...] is firewood {{that has not been}} stacked and is defined as 4ft wide x 4ft tall x 10ft long. [...] The additional volume is to make it equivalent to a standard stacked cord, where there is less void space. [...] It is also common to see wood sold by the [...] "face cord", which is usually not legally defined, and varies from one area to another. For example, in one state a pile of wood 8 feet wide × 4 feet high of 16"-long logs will often be sold as a [...] "face cord", though its volume is only one-third of a cord. [...] In another state, or even another area of the same state, the volume of a <b>face</b> <b>cord</b> may be considerably different. [...] Hence, it is risky to buy wood sold in this manner, as the transaction is not based on a legally enforceable unit of measure.|$|E
5000|$|Other non-official {{terms for}} {{firewood}} volume include standing cord, kitchen cord, running cord, <b>face</b> <b>cord,</b> fencing cord, country cord, long cord, and rick, all subject to local variation. These are usually taken {{to mean a}} well-stacked pile of wood in which the logs are shorter or longer than in a legal cord, to accommodate various burners. For example, a <b>face</b> <b>cord</b> commonly consists of wood that is 16 in long. [...] The volume of a <b>face</b> <b>cord</b> therefore is typically 1/3 {{of the volume of}} a full cord even though it is 8 ft long and 4 ft high. A <b>face</b> <b>cord</b> is also called a rick in Midwestern United States.|$|E

60|$|Gale drew a long, deep breath. The mood {{which had}} presaged pursuit, strife, blood on this somber desert, {{returned}} to him tenfold. He saw Thorne's <b>face</b> <b>corded</b> by black veins, and his teeth exposed {{like those of}} a snarling wolf. These rangers, who had coolly risked death many times, and had dealt it often, were white as no fear or pain could have made them. Then, on the moment, Yaqui raised his hand, not clenched or doubled tight, but curled rigid like an eagle's claw; and he shook it in a strange, slow gesture which was menacing and terrible.|$|R
60|$|A strong shock vibrated through Madeline, and {{her eyelids}} swept open. Instantly she {{associated}} the name El Capitan with Stewart and experienced a sensation of strange regret. It was not pursuit or rescue {{she thought of}} then, but death. These men would kill Stewart. But surely he had not come alone. The lean, dark <b>faces,</b> <b>corded</b> and rigid, told her in what direction to look. She heard the slow, heavy thump of hoofs. Soon into the wide aisle between the trees moved {{the form of a}} man, arms flung high over his head. Then Madeline saw the horse, and she recognized Majesty, and she knew it was really Stewart who rode the roan. When doubt was no longer possible she felt a suffocating sense of gladness and fear and wonder.|$|R

50|$|Tremor is an unintentional, {{somewhat}} rhythmic, muscle movement involving to-and-fro movements (oscillations) {{of one or}} more {{parts of}} the body. It is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands, arms, head, <b>face,</b> vocal <b>cords,</b> trunk, and legs. Ataxia is an unsteady and clumsy motion of the limbs or torso due to a failure of the gross coordination of muscle movements. People with ataxia experience a failure of muscle control in their arms and legs, resulting in a lack of balance and coordination or a disturbance of gait.|$|R

60|$|Shefford heard subdued voices. He {{dismounted}} {{and walked}} to an open door. In the dark interior he dimly descried a high counter, a stairway, a pile of bags of flour, blankets, and silver-ornamented objects, but the persons he had heard were not {{in that part of}} the house. Around another corner of the octagon-shaped wall he found another open door, and through it saw goat-skins and a mound of dirty sheep-wool, black and brown and white. It was light in this part of the building. When he crossed the threshold he was astounded to see a man struggling with a girl--an Indian girl. She was straining back from him, panting, and uttering low guttural sounds. The man's <b>face</b> was <b>corded</b> and dark with passion. This scene affected Shefford strangely. Primitive emotions were new to him.|$|R
50|$|When Eli sneaks into a chopper during Snake's {{deployment}} to OKB Zero in Kabul {{during the}} events of Episode 31, he catches {{the attention of the}} young psychic known as the Third Child, who uses Eli's will to activate Sahelanthropus and attack Snake. After Sahelanthropus is neutralized and transferred to Mother Base, the Third Child infiltrates the place and befriends Eli, giving him a vial containing the English strain of Skull <b>Face's</b> vocal <b>cord</b> parasite. The two plot out an elaborate escape plan which involves helping other child soldiers escape and fixing Sahelanthropus with the assistance of its creator Dr. Emmerich. Ultimately, Eli succeeds in reactivating Sahelanthropus and hijacks it from Mother Base, escaping alongside the Third Child and the other child mercenaries. This is Eli's last appearance in the game.|$|R

That {{is described as}} follows: “A smooth face of soil is cut through the plant axis vertically to sufficient breadth and depth to insure inclusion of the farthest ramifications of the root system in {{the plane of the}} bisection. Horizontal and perpendicular lines are marked off on this <b>face</b> with <b>cord,</b> the interval suited {{to the size of the}} root system. Then by means of a fine jet of water the soil is removed from the whole of the face of the bisection to a depth of one or two inches. The result is a bisection of the root system which may be drawn in detail. A second face perpendicular to the first gives a half bisection which may be used as a check against the first to insure a representative sample of the entire root system.” ...|$|R
25|$|A tremor is an involuntary, {{somewhat}} rhythmic, muscle contraction {{and relaxation}} involving to-and-fro movements {{of one or}} more body parts. It is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands, arms, eyes, <b>face,</b> head, vocal <b>cords,</b> trunk, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. In some people, tremor is a symptom of another neurological disorder. Many different forms of tremor have been identified, such as essential tremor or Parkinsonian tremor. It is argued that tremors are likely to be multifactorial in origin, with contributions from neural oscillations in the central nervous systems, but also from peripheral mechanisms such as reflex loop resonances.|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} generating rhythmic motor {{activity in the}} developing spinal cord of the chick embryo are poorly understood. Here we investigate whether the activity of motoneurons occurs before other neuronal populations {{at the beginning of}} each cycle of rhythmic discharge. Methodology/Principal Findings. The spatiotemporal organization of neural activity in transverse slices of the lumbosacral cord of the chick embryo (E 8 -E 11) was investigated using intrinsic and voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging. VSD signals accompanying episodes of activity comprised a rhythmic decrease in light transmission that corresponded to each cycle of electrical activity recorded from the ipsilateral ventral root. The rhythmic signals were widely synchronized across the <b>cord</b> <b>face,</b> and the largest signal amplitude was in the ventrolateral region where motoneurons are located. In unstained slices we recorded two classes of intrinsic signal. In the first, an episode of rhythmic activity was accompanied by a slow decrease in light transmission that peaked in the dorsal horn and decayed dorsoventrally. Superimposed on this signal was a much smaller rhythmic increase in transmission that was coincident with each cycle of discharge and whose amplitude and spatial distribution was similar to that of the VSD signals. At the onset of a spontaneously occurring episode and each subsequent cycle, both the intrinsic and VSD signals originated within the lateral motor column and spread medially and then dorsally. By contrast, following a dorsal root stimulus, the optical signals originated within the dorsal horn and traveled ventrally to reach the lateral motor column. Conclusions/Significance. These findings suggest that motoneuron activity contributes to the initiation of each cycle of rhythmic activity, and that motoneuro...|$|R
