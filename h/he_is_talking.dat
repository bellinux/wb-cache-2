5|$|A {{local radio}} show {{schedules}} {{an interview with}} Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to discuss Dunder Mifflin, but, unbeknown to Dwight, the interview is later canceled. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) suggests they all use this to their advantage, and stage an interview for Dwight's benefit. Dwight believes <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to the interviewer through {{the phone in the}} break room, but is actually talking to Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) who is using an American accent. They convince him that the information he is giving leads to a hostage situation with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) cornered in his house. Dwight calls David and tries to talk him into surrendering to the police. David is confused but nonetheless responds in a way that leads Dwight to believe he was successful. He emerges from the break room and is greeted by a round of applause from his coworkers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the credits}} roll, Ocelot is heard {{talking to the}} KGB Chief Director over the telephone. After {{suggesting}} that the KGB use the knowledge of both the Virtuous Mission and Operation Snake Eater to blackmail the United States during future negotiations, he then calls another, unidentified man. Ocelot informs him that the microfilm stolen by EVA was a fake and {{that half of the}} Philosopher's Legacy is now in America's hands, with the other half held by the KGB. It transpires that Ocelot has been triple-crossing everyone from the very beginning. He then reveals that he is in fact ADAM, that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to the director of the CIA, and that he has been working for the said agency all this time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, Erin {{tries to}} break up with Andy, saying she no longer loves him and is angry that he left and barely communicated with her. Andy vehemently protests the breakup and says their {{relationship}} can work out if she just pretends to still love him. Erin walks outside to Pete, saying she could not do it. Pete tells her he is okay with this, since all he wants is for her to be happy. Emboldened by this, she gives him a kiss, runs back up to Andy's office, and breaks up with him. In her brief breakup speech she repeats her complaints about his three-month absence, not realizing that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to David Wallace on speakerphone.|$|E
5000|$|During a Frontline {{interview}} {{describing the}} former president's ascendance {{into the national}} political arena, McKinnon said, [...] "Governor Bush was doing some things that really got my attention. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about education reform. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about immigration reform. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about issues that had typically <b>been</b> Democratic issues. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about them in a really compassionate way." [...] McKinnon said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> particularly [...] "impressed with how he'd gotten ahead of the Republican Party".|$|R
5000|$|On the show, James said, [...] "Well, I don't {{know who}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about for sure, Chris, {{but if he}} wasn't talking about Barack Obama, <b>he</b> should have <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about Barack Obama, I hope <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about Barack Obama." [...] The other guest, Air America Radio {{president}} and Democratic politician Mark J. Green, denounced Bush's comparison.|$|R

25|$|The {{following}} day, Col. David (Charles Napier) {{talks to}} actor Arnold Schwarzenegger (actually Irons via voice changer) about Steel {{and the events}} on what happened {{the day before and}} offers him to help before realising it is actually Irons who <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to and after that, Irons declines David's offer.|$|E
25|$|When Brigitte Nye {{comes back}} to Holby with Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori) who is seriously ill, he {{performs}} major surgery on her to prevent her dying.

25|$|He {{comes up}} with all sort of {{theories}} {{about what is happening}} on the island, but finds out the truth when Morel tells the tourists he has been recording their actions of the past week with a machine of his invention, which is capable of reproducing reality. He claims the recording will capture their souls, and through looping they will relive that week forever and he will spend eternity with the woman he loves. Although Morel does not mention her by name, the fugitive is sure <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about Faustine.|$|E

60|$|While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking,</b> the old {{man looked}} at Tom many times in curiosity.|$|R
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that I can find in Being and Event that the author really understands what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about when he invokes (as he constantly does) Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite cardinals, the axioms of set theory, Gödel's incompleteness proof or Paul Cohen's proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis. When these things appear in Badiou's texts it is always allusively, with fragments of symbolism detached from the context that endows them with sense, and often with free variables and bound variables colliding randomly. No proof is clearly stated or examined, and the jargon of set theory is waved like a magician's wand, to give authority to bursts of all but unintelligible metaphysics.|$|E
25|$|Boys {{continues}} {{the story of}} the schoolboys and Ilyusha last referred to in Book Four. The book begins with the introduction of the young boy Kolya Krasotkin. Kolya is a brilliant boy who proclaims his atheism, socialism, and beliefs in the ideas of Europe. He seems destined to follow in the spiritual footsteps of Ivan Karamazov; Dostoyevsky uses Kolya's beliefs especially in a conversation with Alyosha to poke fun at his Westernizer critics by putting their beliefs in {{what appears to be a}} young boy who doesn't exactly know what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about. Kolya is bored with life and constantly torments his mother by putting himself in danger. As part of a prank Kolya lies between railroad tracks as a train passes over and becomes something of a legend for the feat. All the other boys look up to Kolya, especially Ilyusha. Since the narrative left Ilyusha in Book Four, his illness has progressively worsened and the doctor states that he will not recover. Kolya and Ilyusha had a falling out over Ilyusha's maltreatment of a dog: Ilyusha had fed it bread in which there was a pin on Smerdyakov's suggestion. But thanks to Alyosha's intervention the other schoolboys have gradually reconciled with Ilyusha, and Kolya soon joins them at his bedside. It is here that Kolya first meets Alyosha and begins to reassess his nihilist beliefs.|$|E

500|$|Ryan {{mentions}} {{his desire}} to found the [...] "Dream for a Wish Foundation," [...] a play on the actual Make-A-Wish Foundation. During Dwight and Darryl's gym scenes, Darryl sardonically corrects Dwight by telling him that the pronunciation for LeBron James is actually [...] "LeJon Brames." [...] Later, Dwight attempts to get Darryl to stretch his pelvic bowl by telling him that The Fonz did it to become cool. Near {{the end of the}} episode, Darryl admits that he is attempting to impress Val from the warehouse, but Dwight believes <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about male actor Val Kilmer.|$|E
500|$|Beyond his obvious {{drive and}} ambition, neither his legal nor his {{political}} career was to be hampered by Owen's physical presence. He was a tall man of erect bearing, who kept {{a full head of}} hair {{to the end of his}} life. One contemporary newspaper profile described him as looking [...] "like a leading man in a society drama." [...] The New York Times spoke of him on his arrival in the Senate as [...] "the square-jawed, black eyed, lithe young man from the West" [...] and continued that [...] "The Senator's voice is his most impressive asset. Liquid and soft in quality when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> dispassionately, it is as harsh and rasping as a file when he is aroused." ...|$|E
500|$|Tot Mitică offers other glimpses {{into the}} character's {{financial}} problems, showing him complaining {{that he has}} been [...] "pulling the devil's tail"—using a traditional proverb to indicate that he has had a hard time getting by. To this, he adds that the devil would be suing him for injuries. He claims {{that he is going to}} spend his vacation in the mountains, and elaborates that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about the pawnbroking institution known as muntele de pietate (from the French for [...] "Mountain of Piety"; see Mont de Piété). Mitică enters a restaurant to order only things which he knows are free ("a toothpick, a match, a glass of water and a newspaper"). In other such sequences of events, he is shown eating in a pub as a means to [...] "defend himself from death", and borrowing money which he promises not to return.|$|E

500|$|Sonny, {{encouraged}} by Evelyn, finally tells Sunaina {{that he loves}} her. He confronts his mother, who first forbids the match but then is persuaded by Young Wasim, who speaks no English. He explains that he once knew another man who wanted to marry a smart beautiful woman against his family's wishes. Sonny's mother interprets for Young Wasim, realizing <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about her, and she finally gives the couple her blessing. She asks Sunaina to {{take good care of}} her [...] "favourite son". Before the remaining guests can leave, Muriel reveals that her experience running the family's household gave her the knowledge how to balance a budget and that the hotel can make a profit. She approaches Sonny's investor privately and then invites him to visit the hotel to discuss matters with Sonny. The investor agrees to fund Sonny's plans for renovation so long as Muriel stays on as an assistant manager.|$|E
500|$|The cold opening {{references}} several notable {{bands and}} musicians: the scene consists of Ryan complaining because he recently heard—erroneously—that notable musician Smokey Robinson died. Initially, Ryan refers {{to him as}} only [...] "Smokey", which causes Pam to believe <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about Smokey the Bear. However, Ryan, on the bequest of Pam, is only able to name one song that Robinson sung, [...] "The Tracks of My Tears". Pam, however, is later able to remember that he sang [...] "Tears of a Clown", and Jim references [...] "I Second That Emotion". After Jim proves that Robinson is both still alive and playing at a local venue, Ryan tells him {{that he will be}} unable to attend because the opening band is Paul Anka, and that is [...] "not what Smokey would have… does want!" [...] During his pontificating rant, Ryan mentions that popular music is not all about [...] "Jason Mraz and The Beatles", which shocks Dwight. Dwight lists of [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] and [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] and asks Ryan if he truly does not like those songs.|$|E
500|$|Rebecca and Jeremy host their {{engagement}} party at Rebecca's family's stately home. The guests play the parlour game sardines, {{a variation of}} hide-and-seek in which one person hides and the other players have to join them in their hiding place once they are found. Rebecca finds Ian (who works with Jeremy) in a bedroom wardrobe. As they wait for more people to arrive, Ian mistakenly calls her [...] "Rachel". A young man, Lee, enters the room but does not find the pair, though they are later found and joined by Rebecca's prudish brother Carl, and then Carl's flamboyant partner Stuart. Jeremy's ex-girlfriend Rachel finds the group and joins them. Ian mentions that Jeremy frequently talks about [...] "you", but {{it is unclear whether}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to Rebecca or Rachel. To Rebecca's annoyance, Stuart, Rachel and Ian briefly leave the wardrobe for a break. Stuart enters the en suite where Geraldine is sat on the toilet. In the wardrobe, Carl and Rebecca talk; the former is uncomfortable, and, when Rebecca asks why, he tells her to [...] "look where we are".|$|E
60|$|Annie {{knew that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> at her, though {{he spoke to}} Putney; but she was {{powerless}} to protest.|$|R
60|$|GERALD. I thought I heard him. Has <b>he</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> too much?--Poor father, he {{will take}} things to heart.|$|R

500|$|Malcolm {{appears in}} William Shakespeare’s Macbeth as Malcolm. [...] He {{is the son}} of King Duncan and heir to the throne. He first appears in the second scene where <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to a {{sergeant}}, with Duncan. The sergeant tells them how the battle was won thanks to Macbeth. Then Ross comes and Duncan decides that Macbeth should take the title of Thane of Cawdor. Then he later appears in Act 1.4 talking about the execution of the former Thane of Cawdor.

He orders the troops to hide behind branches and slowly advance towards the castle. In Act 5.8 he watches the battle against Macbeth and Macduff with Siward and Ross. When eventually Macbeth is killed, Malcolm takes over as king.|$|E

When they are rowing to Hydra Island they spot Frank Lapidus drifting in the water in life vests. When they {{get him on the}} boat Frank proposes they leave the island on the plane before the Man in Black comes. Richard and Miles agree. Miles then radios Ben again, saying they have made it to Hydra Island and about his plan about the plane. As <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking,</b> Claire comes out from the bushes and fires two warning shots to tell them not to come closer. Richard manages to calm her down but she refuses to go on the plane with them. Miles radios a third time. Kate picks up. He says to her they are patching up the plane and getting ready to take off. He tells Kate about Claire not wanting to come with them. Kate then smashes the radio she has. Miles asks Frank how the plane was doing. Frank says he has to check the electrical outlet before they take off. [...] Miles and Richard repair the hydraulics with duct tape, then rejoin Frank in the cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|Iranian {{government}} sources {{denied that}} Ahmadinejad issued {{any sort of}} threat. On 20 February 2006, Iran's foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki told a news conference: [...] "How {{is it possible to}} remove a country from the map? <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about the regime. We do not recognize this regime legally." [...] Ahmadinejad himself stated that Iran is not a threat to any country, including Israel.|$|E
