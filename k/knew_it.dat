5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was going on, and the owners <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was going on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E

5|$|Common names include gillbird, gilly warbler, barkingbird, muttonbird, butcherbird, what's o {{clock and}} chock. Unlike many species in southwestern Australia, the red wattlebird was given names {{by the local}} {{indigenous}} people that were onomatopoeic (sounding like the calls they make). Names recorded include wodjalok, durdal, doongorok, and djoongong (this last name is also applied to the western wattlebird). In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, the local Barngarla people <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> as ngarkarko or ngarkabukko. The local people of Denial Bay in South Australia called it noggal, and the Ngarrindjeri people of the Lower Murray region in South Australia <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> as rungkan.|$|E
5|$|The fairies mock {{the drunken}} poet and drive him away. With its quick repartee and its broadly “realistic” {{portrayal}} of the poor victim, the Masque of the Drunken Poet is the closest episode in Purcell’s London stage works to full-fledged opera as the Italians <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the devastating}} bombing of Rotterdam by the Luftwaffe, the Germans {{threatened}} to bomb other Dutch cities if the Dutch forces refused to surrender.

5|$|Banksia aemula {{was called}} wallum by the Kabi {{people of the}} Sunshine Coast, giving rise not only to its common name of wallum banksia {{but also to the}} name of the {{ecological}} community it grows in. Frederick Manson Bailey reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Stradbroke Island <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> as mintie. Banyalla is another aboriginal name for the species.|$|E
5|$|Commonly {{known as}} the {{tropical}} banksia, B.dentata is known locally as swamp banksia, and guibuk by the indigenous people in Kakadu National Park. Its local name in the Nunggubuyu language of eastern Arnhem Land is rilirdili. Other names from the same region include Enindurrkwa in the Enindhilyagwa language of Groote Eylandt, and gulpu in the Rirratjingu language of Yirrkala. Frederick Manson Bailey reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Cape Bedford <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> as kabir.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, he {{programmed}} one of {{the earliest}} computers, the IBM 650, and with Ruth A.

It was widely used within the Bell Labs, and also by external users, who <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> as Bell 2. It was superseded by Fortran when the Bell Labs' IBM 650 were replaced by the IBM 704 in 1957.|$|E

5|$|The Sultanate of Singora, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Songkhla at Khao Daeng, was a port {{city in the}} deep south of Thailand and precursor of the present-day town of Songkhla. It was located near the southern tip of the Sathing Phra peninsula, on and around the foothills of Khao Daeng Mountain in Singha Nakhon. British and Dutch East India Company traders called the city Sangora; Japanese officials <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> as Shinichu; contemporary French writers used the names Singor, Cingor and Soncourat.|$|E
5|$|The {{common name}} of {{firewood}} banksia {{was a result}} of its quick-burning properties. Other names recorded include Menzies banksia, firewheel banksia, port wine banksia, flame banksia, and in the cut flower industry, strawberry banksia and raspberry frost banksia. The Beeloo Whadjuk Noongar people of the Perth region <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> as the Mungyt. Despite its variation across its range, George noted that B.menziesii was a clearly defined species, and no formal division into subspecies was warranted.|$|E
5|$|D'Ávila {{had plans}} to {{establish}} a settlement in Montejo's name near Puerto de Caballos, but <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> fell within the jurisdiction of Honduras, and that Cerezeda would never support such a move. In any case, the situation in Trujillo was too precarious for Cerezeda to support a major expedition. D'Ávila became embroiled in the factional politics of the town, taking the part of Diego Díaz de Herrera. After a time, he decided to leave Honduras, and took passage {{with the majority of}} his men on a ship that stopped at Trujillo, which took them back to Yucatán. A few of D'Ávila's men stayed and settled in Trujillo, where the situation continued to deteriorate.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{upon the}} {{conclusion}} of the sketch, writer Michael O'Donoghue <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was an instant success. He had been watching the Saturday Night Live performance from beside the set, off-camera. He felt that Belushi had performed his role as Captain Kirk perfectly. As soon as Belushi left the set, O'Donoghue went over to him and gave the actor a congratulatory hug. On reflection, after the live performance, O'Donoghue stated that Belushi had performed a perfect parody of Shatner as Kirk. Belushi felt it was one of his most satisfying performances.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1548, the galleys {{returned}} to Scotland to scout for English ships. Knox's health was now {{at its lowest}} point due to the severity of his confinement. He was ill with a fever {{and others on the}} ship were afraid for his life. Even in this state, Knox recalled, his mind remained sharp and he comforted his fellow prisoners with hopes of release. While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and Dundee, the spires of the parish church where he preached appeared in view. James Balfour, a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark. He replied that he <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> well, recognising the steeple of the place where he first preached and he declared that he would not die until he had preached there again.|$|E

5|$|Kirk opts to {{take the}} {{infected}} to a nearby starbase instead of pursuing the Gorn Commander's ship through the Rip. At the starbase, Kirk, Spock, and T'Mar meet with the Commodore Daniels, who implies he gave T'Mar the specifications for the device as he <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would create a wormhole. Suddenly, the Gorn attack the starbase and kidnap T'Mar. Just as {{he is about to}} be beamed back aboard Enterprise, Spock tackles the Gorn Henchman, bringing him aboard the ship. Kirk and Spock pursue him to the shuttlebay before he can commandeer a shuttle. Spock mindmelds with the Henchman, learning Surok was killed after confessing he has no insight into the device, but that his daughter would. Kirk has the Henchman imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Prabhu further {{asserts that}} Tipu's hatred of Christians was {{compounded}} by fears that as they shared the same faith as their European co-religionists, the Christians were viewed as a potential fifth column {{in the event of}} a British attack. To this, he adds that Tipu also had future territorial ambitions in Goa and wanted to rid himself of any potential dissent from the Christians within his domain. Therefore, according to Prabhu, through coerced confessions of prominent Mangalorean Catholics, Tipu fabricated evidence of a large-scale Christian conspiracy against him, even though he <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> wasn't true.|$|E
5|$|The Saw Mill River and its {{adjacent}} terrain conferred some tactical {{advantages to}} those who <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> One skirmish began when a Patriot militiaman, Jake Acker, was hunting in a bushy area of the eastern flood plain at Elmsford. Spying {{a large group of}} British soldiers and Loyalist supporters on the road to Storm's tavern, Acker began sniping at them from his concealment. He fatally wounded one, changed his position amid the distraction, reloaded his musket, and killed another. Hearing the shots, other local Patriots came to Acker's aid, and eventually {{all but one of the}} larger force were killed or captured.|$|E
