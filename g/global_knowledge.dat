25|$|Following {{a social}} {{identity}} approach, Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens). Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural {{environment in which}} one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected {{to others in the}} world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of prosocial behaviors and values, including: intergroup empathy, valuing diversity, social justice, environmental sustainability, intergroup helping, and a felt responsibility to act. Subsequent research has examined variables that influence the model such as: participation in a college course with global components, perception of one’s <b>global</b> <b>knowledge,</b> college professors' attitudes toward global citizenship, belief in an intentional worlds view of culture, participation in a fan group that promotes the identity, use of global citizen related words when describing one's values, possible self as a global citizen, religiosity and religious orientation, threat to one’s nation, interdependent self-construal prime, perception of the university environment, and social media usage.|$|E

This article reviews the extant literature regarding the effect of globalization on organizations and develops a conceptual framework that underlines the importance of knowledge management competencies in creating global market advantage. The knowledge management competencies consist of global customer, competitor and supplier knowledge development, inter-functional coordination and value chain coordination. The relationship between <b>global</b> market <b>knowledge</b> competencies and <b>global</b> market advantage is partially mediated by company's responsiveness.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{understanding}} customer segments as communities with coherent identity {{was developed in}} 1993-4 by Angus Jenkinson and internationally adopted by OgilvyOne with clients using the name CustomerPrints as [...] "day-in-the-life archetype descriptions". Creating imaginal or fictional characters to represent these customer segments or communities followed. Jenkinson's approach was to describe an imaginal character in their real interface, behavior and attitudes with the brand, and the idea was initially realized with Michael Jacobs {{in a series of}} studies. In 1997 the Ogilvy <b>global</b> <b>knowledge</b> management system, Truffles, described the concept as follows: [...] "Each strong brand has a tribe of people who share affinity with the brand’s values. This universe typically divides into a number of different communities within which there are the same or very similar buying behaviours, and whose personality and characteristics towards the brand (product or service) can be understood in terms of common values, attitudes and assumptions. CustomerPrints are descriptions that capture the living essence of these distinct groups of customers." ...|$|E

40|$|During its 20 {{years of}} publication, the journal Global Environmental Change has given {{visibility}} and coherence to the eponymous research paradigm.

This essay reflects on some of the problems with making and governing these <b>global</b> kinds of <b>knowledge,</b> as suggested through the perspectives of a nascent geography of science. I use climate change - an emblematic theme of global environmental change research over the last 20 years - to examine three facets of the global environmental change paradigm: making <b>global</b> kinds of <b>knowledge,</b> globalising environmental values and the governance of knowledge-making. New <b>global</b> kinds of <b>knowledge</b> have gained power and visibility in contemporary scientific, public and political fora and yet such knowledge can be 'brittle', easily cracked and broken. A geography of <b>global</b> environmental change <b>knowledge</b> therefore demands we turn our attention away from the globalising instincts that so easily erase difference and collapse meaning, and instead concern ourselves with understanding the relationships between knowledge-making and human culture in evolving places. Only then will we recognise the ambiguities, voids and blind spots in our understanding of the world's complexity...|$|R
