25|$|Before it {{was turned}} off on May 2, 2000, typical SA errors were about 50m (164ft) {{horizontally}} and about 100m (328ft) vertically. Because SA affects every GPS receiver in a given area almost equally, a fixed station with an accurately known position can measure the SA error values and transmit them to the local GPS receivers so they may correct their position fixes. This is called <b>Differential</b> <b>GPS</b> or DGPS. DGPS also corrects for several other important sources of GPS errors, particularly ionospheric delay, so {{it continues to be}} widely used even though SA has been turned off. The ineffectiveness of SA in the face of widely available DGPS was a common argument for turning off SA, and this was finally done by order of President Clinton in 2000.|$|E

Specifically, {{the aim of}} this paper is to estimate whether there is an urban/rural <b>differential</b> in <b>GP</b> utilisation rates. We do this by simulating micro-level health care data. Using this synthetic data, simple logit models are employed to estimate the likelihood that individuals in different jurisdictions will attend a GP surgery. These individual logit estimates are then inputted into a spatial interaction model to highlight areas with low GP accessibility given their health status. The policy implications of these results are discussed in relation to both the health care literature and current Irish health care policy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{integrative}} view {{of diversity}} and singularity in the living world requires {{a better understanding of}} the intricate link between genotypes and phenotypes. Here we re-emphasize the old standpoint that the genotype–phenotype (GP) relationship is best viewed as a connection between two differences, one at the genetic level and one at the phenotypic level. As of today, predominant thinking in biology research is that multiple genes interact with multiple environmental variables (such as abiotic factors, culture, or symbionts) to produce the phenotype. Often, the problem of linking genotypes and phenotypes is framed in terms of genotype and phenotype maps, and such graphical representations implicitly bring us away from the <b>differential</b> view of <b>GP</b> relationships. Here we show that the <b>differential</b> view of <b>GP</b> relationships is a useful explanatory framework in the context of pervasive pleiotropy, epistasis, and environmental effects. In such cases, it is relevant to view GP relationships as differences embedded into differences. Thinking in terms of differences clarifies the comparison between environmental and genetic effects on phenotypes and helps to further understand the connection between genotypes and phenotypes...|$|R

25|$|DGPS, <b>Differential</b> <b>GPS.</b> The {{position}} {{obtained by}} GPS is not accurate enough {{for use by}} DP. The position is improved by use of a fixed ground-based reference station (differential station) that compares the GPS position to the known position of the station. The correction {{is sent to the}} DGPS receiver by long wave radio frequency. For use in DP an even higher accuracy and reliability is needed. Companies such as Veripos, Fugro or C-Nav supply differential signals via satellite, enabling the combination of several differential stations. The advantage of DGPS is that it is almost always available. Disadvantages include degradation of the signal by ionospheric or atmospheric disturbances, blockage of satellites by cranes or structures and deterioration of the signal at high altitudes. There are also systems installed on vessels that use various Augmentation systems, as well as combining GPS position with GLONASS.|$|E

50|$|Different {{astrodynamics}} {{theories are}} used to maintain these catalogs. The General Perturbations (GP) theory provides a general analytical solution of the satellite equations of motion.

The <b>GP</b> theories operated efficiently on the earliest electronic computing machines, and were therefore adopted as the primary theory for Space Catalog orbit determination. Assumptions must be made to simplify these analytical theories, such as truncation of the Earth’s gravitational potential to a few zonal harmonic terms.

The result is then generalized heuristically to the time-dependent GP form.

The various limitations of these equations as used on dilute inhomogeneous condensed Boson atomic gases are then summarized, reference also being made {{to the fact that there}} is no many-body wave function underlying the GP formulation. This then leads into a discussion of a recently proposed integral equation, derived by taking the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation as starting point. Some limitations of the static <b>GP</b> <b>differential</b> equation are thereby removed, though it is a matter of further study to determine whether a correlated wave function exists as underpinning for the integral equation formulation. ...|$|R
2500|$|This led to {{the concept}} of <b>Differential</b> <b>GPS,</b> which used {{separate}} radio systems to broadcast the correction signal to receivers.

[...] Broadcasters of the required power generally cluster around larger cities, making such DGPS systems less useful for wide-area navigation. Additionally, most radio signals are either line-of-sight, or can be distorted by the ground, which made DGPS difficult to use as a precision approach system or when flying low for other reasons.|$|E

This paper focuses on the role of gender medical practices <b>differentials</b> among <b>GPs</b> working in private practice in the southwest region of France. Methods Using data from 339 private-practice GPs, we measured an average gender income gap of approximately 26 % in favour of men. Using the decomposition method, we examined the factors that could explain gender disparities in income. Results The analysis showed that 73 % of the income gap can be explained by the average differences in doctors’ characteristics; for example, 61 % of the gender income gap is explained by {{the gender differences}} in workload, i. e., number of consultations and visits, which is on average significantly lower for female GPs than for male GPs. Furthermore, the decomposition method allowed us to highlight the differences in the marginal returns of doctors’ characteristics and variables contributing to income, such as GP workload; we found that female GPs have a higher marginal return in terms of earnings when performing an additional medical service. Conclusions The findings of this study help to understand the determinants of the income gap between male and female GPs. Even though workload is clearly an essential determinant of income, FFS does not reduce the gender income gap, and there is an imperfect relationship between the provision of medical services and income.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe gangliocytic paraganglioma (GP) is an {{extremely}} rare neuroendocrine tumour originating from {{the second part of}} the duodenum. Generally GP shows benign clinical behaviour. The GP is typically characterized by consisting of three tumour components: the epithelioid, the spindle-shaped and the ganglion-like cells. Presentation of caseWe present a female patient at the age of 65, who underwent a routine gastroscopy due to known gastro-oesophageal reflux. Accidentally a 2 × 1, 5 cm sized mass of unknown entity was revealed in the duodenum. The magnet resonance tomography neither detected distant metastasis nor any local lymphadenopathy. After endosonographically guided punctures of the submucosal mass, a malignant tumour could not be diagnosed thus the decision to perform an endoscopical resection was made and successfully conducted. Immunohistochemical examination revealed a total resected GP. DiscussionIn literature malignant transformation with distant metastasis and local recurrences has been described. Furthermore the clinical manifestation and location varies. The GP has often been misdiagnosed as a neuroendocrine tumour (NET) G 1. ConclusionDue to published cases of metastasising GPs, we recommend a long term follow-up. In a non-metastatic stage the endoscopic resection should be the therapy of choice in order to prevent unnecessary major surgical interventions. In this case report we will discuss the clinical appearance, behaviour and <b>differential</b> diagnosis of <b>GP...</b>|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) entry is {{mediated by the}} interaction between a variably glycosylated envelope glycoprotein (gp 120) and host-cell receptors. Approximately half of the molecular mass of gp 120 is contributed by N-glycans, which serve as potential epitopes and may shield gp 120 from immune recognition. The role of gp 120 glycans in the host immune response to HIV- 1 has not been comprehensively studied at the molecular level. We developed {{a new approach to}} characterize cell-specific gp 120 glycosylation, the regulation of glycosylation, and the effect of variable glycosylation on antibody reactivity. A model oligomeric gp 120 was expressed in different cell types, including cell lines that represent host-infected cells or cells used to produce gp 120 for vaccination purposes. N-Glycosylation of gp 120 varied, depending on the cell type used for its expression and the metabolic manipulation during expression. The resultant glycosylation included changes in the ratio of high-mannose to complex N-glycans, terminal decoration, and branching. <b>Differential</b> glycosylation of <b>gp</b> 120 affected envelope recognition by polyclonal antibodies from the sera of HIV- 1 -infected subjects.

40|$|Human {{melanoma}} {{arises from}} epidermal melanocytes and displays remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity. This heterogeneity in part reflects {{the ability of}} melanoma cells to undergo differentiation along a pathway parallel to differentiation of normal melanocytes. Tyrosinase, encoded by the albino (c), and the tyrosinase-related protein- 1 or gp 75, encoded by the brown (b) locus, {{are two of the}} best-characterized markers for melanocyte differentiation. Both molecules are glycoproteins expressed in melanosomes, the site of pigment synthesis. We studied the regulation of these proteins in human melanoma cells induced by the polar-planar compound hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). In well-differentiated melanoma cell lines, HMBA induced dendritic morphology and specifically regulated the expression of melanosomal glycoproteins (but not a panel of other molecules expressed by melanoma cells). HMBA specifically down-regulated gp 75 expression by rapidly decreasing the steady-state level of gp 75 mRNA and gp 75 synthesis. HMBA was able to down-regulate gp 75 expression even in the presence of cholera toxin, which when added alone induced a two- to threefold increase in gp 75 expression. In contrast to uniform down-regulation of gp 75 expression, HMBA could either up-regulate or down-regulate tyrosinase expression and pigmentation. Based on the <b>differential</b> regulation of <b>gp</b> 75 and tyrosinase, melanoma cells could be classified into two groups. In one group, gp 75 expression was coordinately regulated with tyrosinase activity and pigmentation. In the other group, gp 75 expression and tyroslnase activity and pigmentation were dissociated (with pigmentation coupling to tyrosinase activity, not to gp 75 expression). These results show that in mature melanocytlc cells, regulation of gp 75 expression follows a pattern that can be independent of regulation of tyrosinase and pigmentation...|$|R
40|$|Salivary {{scavenger}} receptor cysteine-rich protein gp 340 aggregates streptococci {{and other}} bacteria {{as part of}} the host innate defense system at mucosal surfaces. In this article, we have investigated the properties of fluid-phase gp 340 and hydroxylapatite surface-adsorbed gp 340 in aggregation and adherence, respectively, of viridans group streptococci (e. g., Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mutans), non-viridans group streptococci (e. g., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus suis), and oral Actinomyces. Fluid-phase gp 340 and surface-phase gp 340 bioforms were differentially recognized by streptococci, which formed three phenotypic groupings according to their modes of interaction with gp 340. Group I streptococci were aggregated by and adhered to gp 340, and group II streptococci preferentially adhered to surface-bound gp 340, while group III streptococci were preferentially aggregated by gp 340. Each species of Streptococcus tested was found to contain strains representative of at least two of these gp 340 interaction groupings. The gp 340 interaction modes I to III and sugar specificities of gp 340 binding strains coincided for several species. Many gp 340 interactions were sialidase sensitive, and each of the interaction modes (I to III) for S. gordonii was correlated with a variant of sialic acid specificity. Adherence of S. gordonii DL 1 (Challis) to surface-bound gp 340 was dependent upon expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin Hsa. However, aggregation of cells by fluid-phase gp 340 was independent of Hsa and involved SspA and SspB (antigen I/II family) polypeptides. Conversely, both gp 340 -mediated aggregation and adherence of S. mutans NG 8 involved antigen I/II polypeptide. Deletion of the mga virulence regulator gene in S. pyogenes resulted in increased cell aggregation by gp 340. These results suggest that salivary gp 340 recognizes different bacterial receptors according to whether gp 340 is present in the fluid phase or surface bound.
