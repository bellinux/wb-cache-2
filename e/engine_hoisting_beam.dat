50|$|The Cleveland Mine Engine House Number 3, {{also known}} as the Brownstone Engine House, is a {{building}} located at 601 Division Street in Ishpeming, Michigan. It was built to house <b>engines</b> <b>hoisting</b> ore from various Cleveland Mine locales, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.|$|R
50|$|A simple frame, {{fabricated}} from C type {{press machine}} , containing a bottle jack or simple hydraulic cylinder. Good for general-purpose {{work in the}} auto mechanic shop, machine shop, garage or basement shops, etc. Typically 1 to 30 tons of pressure, depending on size and expense. Lighter-duty mechanical versions are called arbor presses. They are classed with <b>engine</b> <b>hoists</b> and <b>engine</b> stands in many tool catalogs.|$|R
5000|$|Robinson studied {{mechanical}} engineering at Cornell University, after which he returned to Pennsylvania. In 1892 he and Samuel co-founded the Robinson Machine Company, which provided machinery and ventilation for the many mines in the region. J.R. served as chief engineer. In that capacity he directed numerous product innovations, including the development of fans, steam boilers, <b>engines,</b> <b>hoists,</b> crushers, and haulers for coal mines and mills.|$|R
50|$|An engine crane (also {{referred}} as <b>engine</b> <b>hoist)</b> {{is a common}} repair tool used in vehicle repair shops to remove or install gasoline or diesel engines in small and crowded vehicle engine compartments. It uses a heavy cantilevered support structure to hold the engine in mid-air so that the mechanic can carefully connect or disconnect fragile hoses and wires on the engine to {{the frame of the}} vehicle.|$|R
40|$|The SAE (Society for Automotive Engineers) vehicle {{teams at}} Cal Poly need {{an easy way}} to access the undersides of their {{vehicles}} to facilitate maintenance and servicing. The purpose of this project was to provide a solution that could lift the vehicles effectively and safely from above so that the underside of the vehicles can be accessed, as well as elevating the vehicles to an ergonomic working height. Design specifications were determined based off each vehicle’s requirements in addition to what the team intends to do with their suspended vehicle. After several concept iterations, the team decided to purchase an <b>engine</b> <b>hoist</b> and replace the hydraulic cylinder with a fixed tube and construct a custom transmission thereby turning the <b>engine</b> <b>hoist</b> into a crane mechanism that can be operated easily without concerns of reliability. The team constructed a total of three lifts, each with different specifications, for the Baja, Formula, and F 2000 cars. Material testing was done to verify that the unknown material of the purchased lifts was strong enough to support the loading, as well as final load testing by lifting a vehicle to its designed height...|$|R
50|$|Subsequently the {{hospital}} buildings were demolished, {{leaving only the}} house Rhyndarra, stable and significant trees, prior to the property being subdivided into approximately 30 residential allotments. Rhyndarra was extensively refurbished, albeit on a greatly reduced block, {{and is now a}} family residence. The former stables is located on a separate allotment and became part of a new house, with the hay bale <b>hoist</b> <b>beam</b> on the upper floor still readily identifiable. Part of the riverfront of the original property is now a reserve for park purposes, under the trusteeship of the Brisbane City Council.|$|R
50|$|Nordberg Manufacturing Company was a {{manufacturer}} of steam engines, large diesel <b>engines,</b> pumps, <b>hoists</b> and compressors for the mining and quarry industries located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.|$|R
50|$|The mine, Orenda Mine #1, {{extracted}} high quality, semi-bituminous coal. A steam <b>engine</b> <b>hoisted</b> {{the coal}} to the surface. The hoist pulled the coal cars up a coal tipple that was 1080 ft long, 92 ft high, and 60 ft wide. In 1920, {{this was the}} largest coal tipple in the world. At its prime, 900 men were employed and over 3,000 tons of coal were mined daily. The company was eventually renamed to the United Coal Company and in 1918 it became the Davis Coal Company.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} {{construction}} of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, showing a wooden track, ca. 1910 - 1920. A large, riveted pipe, supported by concrete blocks, runs from the left foreground to the hill that sits at the center background. A wooden track runs along the ground, parallel to the pipe. In {{the center of the}} image, two men lean on a cart that rests on the track. A metal apparatus with cables extending from the top, apparently used to <b>hoist</b> <b>beams,</b> sits {{to the right of the}} track. Hills are visible in the distance...|$|R
2500|$|Seneca then {{instructed}} Tomoka {{that she}} would be sunk by gunfire unless she proceeded toward New York City. The rum-runner started in that direction, but then suddenly started its <b>engine,</b> <b>hoisted</b> the fore staysail and stood rapidly to eastward. Seneca gave chase and opened fire. [...] The first shot was fired across the bow of the fleeing schooner, then the range was gradually decreased. After three warning shots, a fourth shot was fired to hit. The shell landed alongside a few feet from Tomoka, and the schooner immediately stopped engines, hauled down the fore staysail and headed into the wind with her foresail idly flapping.|$|R
50|$|William F. Burden {{was born}} 14 March 1830 in Troy, New York, the third son of Henry and Helen Burden. Burden {{attended}} Troy Polytechnic Institute (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute). The steam derricks, used for unloading coal, at the Burden Iron Works were designed William. A wire cable stretched between, on which an iron carriage traveled three hundred {{feet from the}} dock to the coal heap, carrying a self-dumping bucket with the capacity to hold a ton of coal. A steam <b>engine</b> <b>hoisted</b> the filled bucket to the cable, along which it traveled {{to the point where}} the tilting apparatus overturned its contents upon the pile.|$|R

Advanced technical and operational training is available in this rating during later stages of career development.|$|R
50|$|Water {{continued}} {{to be used to}} drive rural mills but mills, driven by steam, were built in towns alongside streams or canals to provide water for the engine. Murrays' Mills alongside the Rochdale Canal, in Ancoats were powered by 40 hp Boulton and Watt beam engines.b Some were built as room and power mills, which let space to entrepreneurs. The mills, often 'L' or U-shaped, were narrow and multi-storeyed. The engine house, warehousing and the office were inside the mill, although stair towers were external. Windows were square and smaller than in later mills. The walls were of unadorned rough brick. Construction was sometimes to fireproof designs. The mills are distinguished from warehouses in that warehouses had taking-in doors on each storey with an external <b>hoist</b> <b>beam.</b> Only the larger mills have survived.|$|R
50|$|In slope mines, {{where there}} was a {{continuous}} downgrade from the entrance to the working face, the rope from the <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine</b> could be used to lower empty cars into the mine and then raise full cars. In shaft mines, secondary <b>hoisting</b> <b>engines</b> could be used to pull cars on grades within the mine. For grades of a few percent, trains of 25 cars each carrying roughly half a ton were typical in the 1880s.|$|R
25|$|Using a 1962 De Havilland Caribou as {{a shuttle}} plane, the team {{departed}} the U.S. Armed Services base at Thule and flew in {{tools and equipment}} to the Kee Bird. Over the summer months, the team transported four re-manufactured engines, four new propellers, an <b>engine</b> <b>hoist,</b> and new tires, {{as well as a}} small bulldozer, to the remote site. The team successfully replaced the engines and propellers, mounted the new tires, and resurfaced the aircraft's control surfaces. As the winter snows began to fall, the Chief Engineer, Rick Kriege fell ill and was transported to a hospital in Iqaluit, Canada, where he died from a blood clot two weeks later. Although the plane was nearly ready to fly, Greenamyer's team was compelled by weather to leave the site.|$|R
50|$|All the ore was hoisted to {{the surface}} for processing. Water {{had to be removed}} by pumping. Big <b>hoisting</b> <b>engines</b> were {{installed}} to hoist lifts and buckets up the shafts.|$|R
25|$|The {{vertical}} flag for <b>hoisting</b> from a <b>beam</b> (German: Auslegerflagge or Galgenflagge; no. 3) is additionally {{attached to}} a horizontal beam, ensuring that it is fully displayed {{even if there is}} no wind.|$|R
40|$|Obtained an {{analytical}} dependence {{for determining the}} tensile forces acting in cables of the fl at rubberized rope. It {{takes into account the}} design of the <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine</b> – the deviations of generating line of the drum from a straight and of the possible break of the cable in rope. A comprehensive account of the impact of various factors on the stress-strain state of the rope allows determining the loss of tractive capacity in operation on the <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine.</b> The results should be taken into account in the design and operation of hoisting and transporting machines with fl at traction bodies...|$|R
50|$|The coroner's report {{stated that}} the {{engineer}} had lost control because of management's negligence, having failed to properly install a safety device to prevent overwinding. Also, the braking system consisting of disk brakes on the <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine</b> had been detached.|$|R
50|$|The {{basement}} is a utilitarian space extending {{under the}} west wing of the Institute. It is accessed from a staircase below the main staircase in the entrance hall and from a vehicle ramp at the south west corner {{at the rear of}} the building. There is also an open well at the northwest corner of the building which gives access to ground and first floor from the basement. A goods <b>hoist</b> and <b>beam</b> are suspended below the first floor ceiling. A steep, steel industrial staircase and balustrade connects the three levels.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] <b>engine</b> could <b>hoist</b> a three car trip, {{equivalent}} to 200 tons in three minutes. After {{a fire in}} 1868, new [...] engines were installed. These were supposedly the most powerful engines in the world, later surpassed only by the engines operating the locks on the Panama Canal. Approximately 800 to 900 railroad cars passed over the plane every twenty-four hours. The Mahanoy Plane ceased operation on February 27, 1932, due to the decline of Anthracite and the much easier route through the Mahanoy Tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The {{drive to}} recover scrap metal {{and a strong}} dislike of {{anything}} German in the islands saw the metalwork in the battery removed and scrapped from 1947 onwards, this included the armoured cover, doors, <b>hoists,</b> <b>engines</b> etc. with the barrels and mounts cut up in 1952/3.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{architectural}} {{rendering of the}} Western Machinery Company, showing a locomotive, 1900. At center, the large block building is depicted, displaying its title and the many products it manufactures on its facade. Farther forward, streetcars, pedestrians, and horse-drawn carriages can be seen moving along the street. To the right, two locomotives make their way {{up and down a}} set of tracks. The city is fainly visible in the background.; Previous record reads: "manufacturers of gasoline <b>engines,</b> mining <b>hoists,</b> portables and pumps, irrigation, electric and power plants"...|$|R
50|$|On the voyage, the {{friendly}} Antoine acts as chef, {{but the food}} mysteriously disappears from Stan's plate because stowaway Giovanni is taking it. This leads Stan to blame Ollie and an argument ensues. The engine then fails, so Ollie removes parts {{in an attempt to}} fix it. He hands them to Stan, who puts them on the deck where they slide overboard. Ollie then realises that his efforts were in vain when he notices that the fuel gauge reads empty. Having lost the <b>engine,</b> they <b>hoist</b> the sail, revealing Giovanni hiding in it.|$|R
50|$|The {{largest of}} the three <b>engines</b> is the <b>hoisting</b> <b>engine.</b> It is a double-cylinder {{horizontal}} type with a 12 in bore and 16 in stroke. In addition to powering the hoist, it provided locomotive power and could move the shovel at speeds of a 1/4 mph. About 50 ft of the hoist chain has been removed.Both of the other engines have an 8 in bore. The swing engine, attached to a chain around the swing circle, moves the boom from side to side. The other engine, the boom or crowd engine, raises and lowers the dipper. Due to its exposure to the weather, {{it is no longer}} in working condition. The other two, wholly inside the main section, were more protected from the elements and could be operated with compressed air.|$|R

He worked at $20 per week in a nine-story, red-brick building at either Insurance, Buckle's <b>Hoisting</b> <b>Engines,</b> Chiropody, Loans, Pulleys, Boas Renovated, Waltz Guaranteed in Five Lessons, or Artificial Limbs. It is not for us to wring Mr. Hopkins's avocation from these outward signs that be.|$|R
50|$|Compressed air {{for running}} power drills and for driving fans and small <b>hoisting</b> <b>engines</b> was {{adopted in the}} Comstock mines. Diamond drills for {{drilling}} long distances through solid rock were also in general use, but were discarded for prospecting purposes, being found unreliable. Several new forms of explosives for blasting were also developed.|$|R
