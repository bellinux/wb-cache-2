5|$|In early 2009, McCann {{received}} a brief {{to create a}} new campaign for the latest entrant into the Halo series, a first-person shooter called Halo 3: ODST. It would be the first game in the franchise not to feature the series' protagonist, the Master Chief. McCann returned with a pitch for a campaign in the same vein as Believe, aiming to humanize the soldiers featured in the Halo universe. The project was greenlit, and McCann brought back several collaborators from Believe to <b>handle</b> <b>this</b> new campaign, now given the working title of The Life.|$|E
5|$|To <b>handle</b> <b>this</b> new, {{considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive task, {{it was decided that}} a new organisation was needed. The Mary Rose Trust, a limited charitable trust, with representatives from many organisations would handle the need for a larger operation and a large infusion of funds. In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12m (40ft) catamaran Roger Greenville which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the salvage vessel Sleipner, the same craft that had been used as a platform for diving operations on the Vasa. The project went from a team of only twelve volunteers working four months a year to over 50 individuals working almost around the clock nine months a year. In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a laboratory staff of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities. During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8 man-years.|$|E

5|$|Transport in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was an {{important}} part of the nation's economy. The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace. Before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low. By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget. The Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest in the world, but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse. The road network remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities. At the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill-equipped to <b>handle</b> <b>this</b> growing problem. By the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to solve these problems. At the same time, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than the construction of new roads. By the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} cases where large {{differences}} between estimated intensities by the Earthquake Early Warning {{system and the}} actual intensities occurred in the aftershocks and triggered earthquakes.

25|$|Traditional folding knives {{are opened}} using nail-nicks, or slots where the user's {{fingernail}} would enter {{to pull the}} blade out of the <b>handle.</b> <b>This</b> became somewhat cumbersome and required use of two hands, so there were innovations to remedy that. The thumb-stud, a small stud on the blade that allows for one-handed opening, led the way for more innovations. One of these being the thumb hole: a Spyderco patent where the user presses the pad of the thumb against a hole and opens the blade by rotating the thumb similarly to using the thumb-stud.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 1862, the Union Army under then Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant {{captured}} Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland River, and Fort Henry, on the Tennessee River, near Dover. With these victories, {{his forces}} took about 12,000 to 15,000 Confederate prisoners. The army was unprepared to <b>handle</b> <b>this</b> {{large group of}} prisoners and scrambled to find places to house them. Colonel Tucker told General Grant's superior, Major General Henry W. Halleck, that Camp Douglas could accommodate 8,000 or 9,000 prisoners, which {{was about the same}} number as the recruits it had been built for.

Financial sponsors usually react to this again by offering to compensate the management team for a lost deal fee if the purchase price is low. Another mechanisms to <b>handle</b> <b>this</b> problem are earn-outs (purchase price being contingent on reaching certain future profitabilities).|$|E

25|$|A planned 20,000 {{jobs and}} 6,000 residences {{are to be}} located at Fornebu. The transit system {{therefore}} has to be dimensioned to <b>handle</b> <b>this</b> number of commuters during the morning rush-hour. Further expansion to the plans could bring {{the total number of}} jobs to 25,000. The increase would have to be entirely based on transit, as there is no sufficient parking capacity for more people to drive. Demand for the various modes is more or less the same, at about 4,000 people per hour in both directions. However, given a long-term, high-growth development, only the metro alternative actually has sufficient capacity to handle the traffic estimates. The zoning plan of Fornebu is designed {{in such a way that}} only a limited amount of the area can be built before a rail transit is under construction.|$|E
25|$|In the Summer of 2009, a £50million {{redevelopment}} programme for Terminal 1 was completed, {{which included}} a new £14million 14-lane security area. Passenger flow on Terminal 1's gating piers is due to be realigned, with plans to redesign the piers so departures and arrivals do not contraflow on the same level, allowing larger seating areas at the gates, express retail outlets and a dedicated lounge and gating area for future Airbus A380 flights. Currently, Gate 12, Pier B has been upgraded to accommodate the A380, the only gate at the airport that can <b>handle</b> <b>this</b> aircraft so far. An early phase of this has seen {{the removal of the}} South Bay remote aircraft stands, constructed in 1962 between taxiways Juliet and Kilo and as a result more recently re-aligning taxiway Juliet into an extended taxiway Bravo.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, the TOPS {{computer}} system for managing locomotives and rolling stock {{owned by a}} rail system, was introduced. Hauled rolling stock continued to carry numbers in a separate series. The adoption of the TOPS system made for {{some changes in the}} way the railway system in Britain worked. Hitherto, locomotives were numbered in three different series. Steam locomotives carried unadorned numbers up to five digits long. Diesel locomotives carried four-digit numbers prefixed with a letter 'D' and electric locomotives with a letter 'E'. Thus, up to three locomotives could carry the same number - steam loco 4321, diesel D4321 and electric loco E4321. TOPS could not <b>handle</b> <b>this</b> and it also required similar locomotives to be numbered in a consecutive series in terms of classification, in order that they might be treated together as a group. A new classification system was devised in which, for example, all Brush Type 4 locomotives were now called Class 47 and all had numbers beginning 47xxx.|$|E
