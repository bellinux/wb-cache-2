5|$|Basic Guides were {{formerly}} {{issued for}} students which, unlike the Resource Guides, {{remained the same}} from year to year.

Additionally, a brief introduction to art history is included. The Economics Basic Guide reviews fundamental economic concepts {{in addition to the}} basics of macroeconomics and microeconomics. The Language and Literature Basic Guide provides students with a basic grounding in the analysis of literature and introduces key terms such as synecdoche, metonymy, assonance, and aphorism. The Math Basic Guide offers a general overview of major topics in high school math, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. The Music Basic Guide begins by introducing the student to topics in music theory such as harmonics, rhythm, tempo, and the circle of <b>fifths.</b> It also includes information {{on a wide variety of}} instruments and a brief history of Western music.

5|$|Mathematics {{were also}} used in musical tuning and music theory. The 2nd-century-BCE Huainanzi, {{compiled}} by eight scholars under the patronage of King Liu An (179–122 BCE), outlined the use of twelve tones on a musical scale. Jing Fang (78–37 BCE), a mathematician and music theorist, expanded these to create a scale of 60 tones. While doing so, Jing Fang realized that 53 just <b>fifths</b> is approximate to 31 octaves. By calculating the difference at 177147⁄176776, Jing reached the same value of 53 equal temperament duly discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator (1620–1687) (i.e. 353/284, known as Mercator's comma). Later, the prince Zhu Zaiyu (1536–1611 CE) in Ming China and Simon Stevin (1548–1620 CE) of the Flemish Region in Europe would simultaneously (but separately) discover the mathematical formula for equal temperament.|$|E

5|$|Native Silver perch and {{introduced}} brown trout were released in 1981–83 and 1987–89 respectively, {{but have not}} been stocked since. Silver perch stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout have been released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, {{the reason for the}} low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one suggested theory. However, the eutrophic nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons. Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four <b>fifths</b> of the released fish in the last three decades and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years. The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014.|$|E
5|$|Treloar's death {{left the}} AWM {{in a state}} of crisis. Due to his close control over the Memorial, none of its staff knew what his plans had been and it was unclear how to {{continue}} key tasks such as completing the Roll of Honour, classifying and displaying items collected during World War II and managing the Memorial's finances. In addition, two <b>fifths</b> of the AWM's staff positions were vacant as Treloar had chosen to delay filling these vacancies. Jim McGrath, who had been the Memorial's Assistant Director (Administration) since May 1951, became acting director when Treloar was hospitalised and was confirmed in this position on 15May 1952; Bazley had also applied for this job but lost to McGrath despite having Bean's support. Under the direction of Bean, who had been appointed the Chairman of the Memorial's Board in June 1951, McGrath established a committee to develop strategies for both completing and further developing the Memorial. Bean also personally reviewed the Memorial's collection of World War I artefacts during 1952 and 1953, and found that the register of these items was inadequate and {{it was not possible to}} locate many of them. He attributed this to the movement of the collection between Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra and the changes of directorship during periods in which Treloar was absent.|$|E
5|$|Greater {{problems}} arose over financial {{speculation and}} {{the management of the}} national debt. Certain government bonds could not be redeemed without the consent of the bondholder and had been issued when interest rates were high; consequently each bond represented a long-term drain on public finances, as bonds were hardly ever redeemed. In 1719 the South Sea Company proposed to take over £31million (three <b>fifths)</b> of the British national debt by exchanging government securities for stock in the company. The Company bribed Lord Sunderland, George's mistress Melusine von der Schulenburg, and Lord Stanhope's cousin, Charles Stanhope, who was Secretary of the Treasury, to support their plan. The Company enticed bondholders to convert their high-interest, irredeemable bonds to low-interest, easily tradeable stocks by offering apparently preferential financial gains. Company prices rose rapidly; the shares had cost £128 on 1 January 1720, but were valued at £500 when the conversion scheme opened in May. On 24 June the price reached a peak of £1,050. The company's success led to the speculative flotation of other companies, some of a bogus nature, and the Government, in an attempt to suppress these schemes and {{with the support of the}} Company, passed the Bubble Act. With the rise in the market now halted, uncontrolled selling began in August, which caused the stock to plummet to £150 by the end of September. Many individuals—including aristocrats—lost vast sums and some were completely ruined. George, who had been in Hanover since June, returned to London in November—sooner than he wanted or was usual—at the request of the ministry.|$|E

25|$|The {{diatonic}} {{circle of}} <b>fifths</b> is {{the circle of}} <b>fifths</b> encompassing only members of the diatonic scale. Therefore, it contains a diminished fifth, in C major between B and F. See structure implies multiplicity.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{ascending}} by justly tuned <b>fifths</b> {{fails to}} close the circle by an excess of approximately 23.46 cents, roughly {{a quarter of a}} semitone, an interval known as the Pythagorean comma. In Pythagorean tuning, this problem is solved by markedly shortening the width of one of the twelve <b>fifths,</b> which makes it severely dissonant. This anomalous fifth is called wolf fifth as a humorous metaphor of the unpleasant sound of the note (like a wolf trying to howl an off-pitch note). The quarter-comma meantone tuning system uses eleven <b>fifths</b> slightly narrower than the equally tempered fifth, and requires a much wider and even more dissonant wolf fifth {{to close the}} circle. More complex tuning systems based on just intonation, such as 5-limit tuning, use at most eight justly tuned <b>fifths</b> and at least three non-just <b>fifths</b> (some slightly narrower, and some slightly wider than the just fifth) to close the circle. Other tuning systems use up to 53tones (the original 12tones and 42more between them) in order to close the circle of <b>fifths.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{circle of}} <b>fifths,</b> or fourths, may be mapped from the {{chromatic}} scale by multiplication, and vice versa. To map between {{the circle of}} <b>fifths</b> and the chromatic scale (in integer notation) multiply by 7 (M7), and for the circle of fourths multiply by 5 (P5).|$|E

50|$|In {{classical}} music from Western culture, a <b>fifth</b> is the interval {{from the first}} to the last of five consecutive notes in a diatonic scale. The perfect <b>fifth</b> (often abbreviated P5) spans seven semitones, while the diminished <b>fifth</b> spans six and the augmented <b>fifth</b> spans eight semitones. For example, the interval from C to G is a perfect <b>fifth,</b> as the note G lies seven semitones above C.|$|R
25|$|In meantone systems, {{there are}} two {{different}} semitones. This results because of the break in the circle of <b>fifths</b> that occurs in the tuning system: diatonic semitones derive from a chain of five <b>fifths</b> that does not cross the break, and chromatic semitones come from one that does.|$|E
25|$|The lowest five strings are {{tuned in}} perfect <b>fifths</b> {{from a low}} C. The first string is a minor third up from the E to a G. Since the lowest five strings are tuned in <b>fifths,</b> guitars with NST can be played with the fingerings for chords and scales used on the violin, cello, and mandolin.|$|E
25|$|In this case, the chord {{is viewed}} as a C major seventh chord (CM7) in which the third note is an {{augmented}} fifth from root (G), rather than a perfect fifth from root (G). All chord names and symbols including altered <b>fifths,</b> i.e., augmented (5, +5, aug5) or diminished (5, °5, dim5) <b>fifths</b> can be interpreted in a similar way.|$|E
