One focal point for the investigation concerns whether any of the donations by the Paws were reimbursed by Hsu, which would constitute a felony.

25|$|Several United States Federal Circuit Courts have {{recognized}} a limited reporter's privilege. The United States <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> a self-imposed limitation upon subpoena {{of reporters and}} their notes. This privilege is not universal, and is incomplete.|$|E
25|$|On April 23, 2015, {{a federal}} judge sentenced Petraeus to two years {{probation}} plus a fine of $100,000. The fine was {{more than double the}} amount the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> requested.|$|R

25|$|In June 2011, the U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> {{decided not}} to file charges against Coleman or Kazeminy. Louis Freeh, an {{attorney}} for Kazeminy and a former FBI Director in the Clinton Administration, said he learned the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> ended the investigation in a February 24 meeting with Andrew Levchuk of the department's Public Integrity Section in Washington.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> split {{over the}} {{constitutionality}} of legislation to give the District of Columbia voting representation in the House of Representatives. The Office of Legal Counsel reported to Attorney General Eric Holder that the proposed legislation would be unconstitutional, but Holder overrode that determination and instead obtained an opinion from officials of the United States Solicitor General's office that the legislation could be defended if it were challenged after its enactment.|$|E
25|$|Since the interview, the Judiciary Committee has {{continued}} its investigation. On April 17, 2008, the Judiciary Committee {{released a report}} which provided {{some of the details}} into the investigation into the US Attorney firings. The report stated it was impossible to know if Wecht's prosecution was politically motivated because the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> not turned over certain documents to committee investigators, and U.S. District Judge Arthur J. Schwab has refused to hold a hearing on Wecht's claim of selective prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Although Americans may favor one {{immigration}} policy over another, perceptions {{of government and}} officials' ability to implement these policies is consistently negative. In November 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama announced a set of executive actions which could extend at least temporary legal status to {{nearly half of the}} illegal immigrants in the United States. The Republican majority in the new Congress as 2015 is challenging these actions. Although some Republican senators did vote for the reform bill of 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, Obama's executive steps are not in accord with the overall stated policy position of the Republican Party. On February 16, 2015, a federal district court judge issued a temporary injunction against the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability program (one of the November 20, 2014 deferred action measures). The <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> appealed the injunction.|$|E

He has been highly critical of government secrecy and the media's willingness to accept it.|$|R
2500|$|On April 30, 2010 the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> {{announced}} {{it would not be}} pursuing charges against Jackson. Jackson’s lawyers noted that a lawyer at the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department’s</b> public integrity unit told them that it was closing its investigation. One lawyer for Jackson stated that the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> been unable to find evidence that Jackson received any benefit in exchange for his office’s recommendations and that “when that quid pro quo is missing, it takes away any motivation for improper steering.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Although illegal, 90% of {{prostitution}} in Nevada occurs in Las Vegas. [...] In 2009 Las Vegas was {{identified by the}} FBI as one of 14 cities in the U.S. with high rates of child prostitution.

[...] The U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> also named Las Vegas among the 17 most likely destinations for human trafficking.|$|E
2500|$|After his investigation, Assistant Inspector General James Ebbitt {{testified that}} he found no {{evidence}} of CIA involvement in the program. Congressman Charles Rose, after hearing Eitel's testimony, went on record saying that he was suspicious, stating, [...] "This situation stinks to high heaven." [...] Both the CIA and the Forest Service have vehemently denied CIA involvement in the exchange program. Ultimately, all of the CIA allegations link back to Eitel's claims, and other than his persistent testimony in hearings and later in court, no evidence has been produced corroborating a CIA link to the aircraft. The <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> also denied any link, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Claire Lefkowitz on record as stating [...] "We've never found any evidence of CIA involvement." ...|$|E
25|$|Judge Sullivan {{subsequently}} {{ordered the}} FBI and the US Department of State {{to answer the}} allegations. Attorneys from the US <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>have</b> requested the case be dismissed {{on the grounds that}} Idema's sentence had been commuted. Idema's lawyer said the government coordinated Idema's amnesty to avoid having to respond to allegations of misconduct.|$|R

2500|$|CQPolitics noted [...] "Harris’s former {{political}} strategist, Ed Rollins, {{spoke on}} the record about the dinner and detailed a meal that cost $2,800, far {{in excess of the}} $50 limit on gifts that members of Congress are allowed to accept" [...] at the Washington restaurant Citronelle. Wade and Harris discussed MZM's desire for a $10million appropriation, and Wade offered to host a fundraiser for Harris's 2006 Senate campaign. Regarding the MZM contributions, the Sentinel article goes on to say [...] "The <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> said Wade, who personally handed many of the checks to Harris, did not tell Harris the contributions were illegal". Regarding the expensive meal, the article quotes Harris as saying that she personally had only a [...] "beverage and appetizer" [...] worth less than [...] "$100".|$|E
2500|$|After the Democrats {{took control}} of the Senate in 1986, giving them control of both Houses of Congress, {{allegations}} were made to Attorney General Edwin Meese that Whittlesey had granted diplomatic favors for private contributions to her State Department-administered representational fund and that she had also obstructed justice. [...] Meese [...] "found no 'reasonable grounds' to pursue allegations that" [...] Whittlesey [...] "mishandled entertainment funds at the embassy or improperly aided contributors to the funds" [...] in contravention of the independent counsel statute. Hearings into the subject were held by a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, but the hearings failed to produce substantiation of the charges and went nowhere. [...] The Wall Street Journal, in an editorial entitled [...] "True Grit," [...] echoing a popular movie of the time, dismissed the investigation. [...] "The ambassador had been back in Washington for the past few months, where she successfully defended herself against charges that she'd misspent money that had been donated to the U.S. State Department and then tried to obstruct the investigation into her spending. The U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> now filed a notification in Federal Circuit Court in Washington clearing the ambassador of any wrongdoing and vindicating the view that there was a whole lot less to the whole affair than had met either the eye or ear....It is impressive to come out of such an investigation clean and clear." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Bowl Championship Series (BCS) was a {{selection}} system designed, through polls and computer statistics, {{to determine a}} No. 1 and No. 2 ranked team in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). After the final polls, the two top teams were chosen {{to play in the}} BCS National Championship Game which determined the BCS national champion team, but not the champion team for independent voting systems (most notably the AP Poll). This format was intended to be [...] "bowl-centered" [...] rather than a traditional playoff system, since numerous FBS Conferences have expressed their unwillingness to participate in a play-off system. However, due to the unique and often esoteric nature of the BCS format, there had been controversy as to which two teams should play for the national championship and which teams should play in the four other BCS bowl games (Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl, and Sugar Bowl). In this selection process, the BCS was often criticized for conference favoritism, its inequality of access for teams in non-Automatic Qualifying (non-AQ) Conferences (most likely due to perceived strength of schedule), and perceived monopolistic, [...] "profit-centered" [...] motives. In terms of this last concern, Congress has explored the possibility {{on more than one occasion}} of holding hearings to determine the legality of the BCS under the terms of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, and the United States <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> also periodically announced interest in investigating the BCS for similar reasons.|$|E
