40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of soil hydraulic properties {{is a prerequisite}} for efficient soil and water management. On a small scale, time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements obtained during an infiltration event can be used for estimating soil hydraulic properties either using a sequential or a coupled inversion approach. In the traditional sequential approach, the TDR measurements are inverted into water content averages based on travel time analysis and subsequently used for calibrating a hydrologic model. Travel time analysis has been reported to be subjective and difficult to use for analyzing TDR measurements obtained during infiltration. In this paper, we extend the sequential inversion approach by using water content profiles (WCPs) obtained via inverse modeling of TDR measurements and introduce a coupled inversion approach which directly uses the TDR measurements for constraining the inversion for hydraulic properties without first inverting them into WCPs or averages. By comparing the feasibility of these approaches to infer three Mualem-van Genuchten (MVG) hydraulic parameters (alpha, n, K-s) from TDR measurements obtained under falling <b>head</b> <b>infiltration,</b> we concluded that the coupled approach is more practical and less uncertain than the sequential approach.

Water release curves from soil cores were also used for estimating hf. The objective was to compare the performance of the different techniques for the assessment of infiltration in a no-tillage olive (Olea europaea L. subsp. europaea) orchard. Measurements were performed in two areas of the orchard, below canopy (C) and interrow among trees (IR). With the exception of the tension infiltrometer, all techniques showed significant differences in Ks, and hf between C and IR areas, attributed to different compaction. Differences in Ks among techniques were within the range observed previously. The hf estimated from the falling-head technique was significantly higher than that measured with the other techniques. The discrepancies in the results obtained with the tension infiltrometer were attributed to insufficient time of measurement, leading to recommendations for a different field procedure and analysis of this technique. To assess the use of the techniques described above for the characterization of plot infiltration, rainfall and runoff were measured in a 128 -m 2 plot. A numerical model was then used to predict runoff using the infiltration measurements. The results showed that runoff prediction is improved when different values of Ks and hf are considered for the C and IR areas instead of a single average value.

The study presented here aims to examine the mechanisms of runoff generation due to saturation excess by investigating {{the development of the}} subsurface saturated zone. Experiments were conducted on a hillslope system with a uniform slope (0. 2) and a relatively homogeneous and highly permeable medium (K-s = 1. 28 cm/min), subjected to high and constant surface recharges (0. 51 - 0. 69 cm/min). Two initial conditions prior to the rainfall events were set up in the experiments to represent relatively dry and wet antecedent soil conditions, respectively. Measurements showed that during vertical <b>infiltration,</b> local pressure <b>head</b> and soil moisture remained constant for a certain period, showing a 2 ̆ 7 waiting 2 ̆ 7 behaviour. The saturated area formed initially at the slope toe, quickly rose to the surface and subsequently expanded to the upslope. When propagating in the upslope direction, the wetting front caused the pore-water flow to deflect in areas above the wetting front and at the slope base. With a wetter initial condition, the soil responded to the rainfall more quickly. The initial moisture conditions also altered the relation between the subsurface discharge and pressure head. Under the applied rainfall rates, the system reached a fully saturated condition and produced surface runoff. The rainfall intensity was found to affect the temporal variations and magnitude of surface runoff characteristics; however it did not seem to impose any significant effect on the maximum subsurface discharge rate. These results provide insight into the behaviour of the hillslope system in response to rainfall. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

In the forecast of the water regime two kinds of hydrological information were used – experimental and pedotransfer functions (PTFs).

PTFs included: regional PTF, based on the data of the original database for the soil hydrological properties of the study area relying on the soil density and soil organic content, PTF based on particle size distribution, based on field capacity and wilting point as a predictors, and PTFs based on physico-mechanical properties, specifically Atterberg limits.

Coupled hydrogeophysical inversion schemes that enable {{the use of multiple}} geophysical and hydrological data for the {{estimation of}} soil hydraulic properties have recently been proposed. In these coupled inversion schemes, a hydrological model describing the process under investigation is coupled to a forward geophysical model and hydraulic parameters are directly estimated from geophysical measurements. While these schemes provide a suitable platform for the integration of multiple geophysical and hydrological data, efficient methods to combine these data types for improved parameter estimation still warrant investigation.

We show that successful data fusion within the coupled hydrogeophysical inversion framework depends on the choice of an appropriate objective function. We obtained the best data fusion results with an objective function defined as the sum of the root mean square error of both data types normalized by the standard deviation of the respective measurements. In this case, the inverted hydraulic parameters were very comparable to reference values obtained from a multi-step outflow experiment carried out with undisturbed soil cores from the experimental site.

40|$|Good {{knowledge}} of the hydraulic properties of the vadose zone is important for understanding water flow and solute transport processes therein. This can help to promote sustainable use and mitigate anthropogenic threats to soil and water resources. The use of time-lapse geophysical data to constrain {{our understanding of the}} flow and transport properties of the vadose zone is now well recognised. Conventional use of geophysical data to estimate the hydraulic properties of the vadose zone is based on an uncoupled inversion approach including an ill-posed tomograhic inversion step which can lead to error propagation to the estimated hydraulic properties. One way of improving the accuracy of estimating soil hydraulic properties is to use a so-called coupled hydrogeophysical inversion approach. In this inversion approach, the tomograhic inversion step is avoided as geophysical measurements are directly used in the hydrological inverse problem by coupling a forward model of the geophysical measurements with a hydrological model describing the hydrologic processes under investigation. Although the potential benefits of the coupled inversion approach have been illustrated with synthetic data, there are very few applications of the approach to actual field or laboratory data. Moreover, most studies using this approach focused on electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground penetration radar (GPR), and the usefulness of this inversion approach remains to be explored for a range of other geophysical methods. Although coupled hydrogeophysical inversion frameworks are flexible enough for the integration of multiple hydrologic and geophysical data types, this data fusion aspect has also received less attention. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop inversion frameworks for the estimation of effective subsurface hydraulic parameters from: i) the fusion of ERT and inflow data obtained under constant <b>head</b> <b>infiltration</b> in a field sandy loam, ii) SP data acquired during primary drainage of a sandy soil column, and iii) TDR data obtained under falling <b>head</b> <b>infiltration</b> into an initially dry sandy loam. Based on synthetic and actual data we showed that it is feasible to estimate three key Mualem-van Genuchten parameters (α, n and Ks), using the developed coupled hydrogeophysical inversion frameworks for ERT, SP and TDR. In all cases, the inversion results compared well with independently obtained values. With respect to the fusion of ERT and inflow data, it was observed that the success of the procedure depends on the choice of an appropriate objective function. The best results were obtained when an objective function defined as the sum of the root mean square error of both data types normalized by the standard deviation of the respective measurements was used. On the other hand, successful inversion of the SP data depended on efficient pre-treatment of the measured signals prior to inversion and the availability of an adequate model for the voltage coupling coefficient at partial saturation. By comparing different models for the voltage coupling coefficient at partial saturation to the experimental data, it was observed that models that relate the voltage coupling coefficient to the relative permeability of the porous medium in addition to the saturation in water were most appropriate. In the case of inversion of TDR data, a comparison of the coupled and uncoupled inversion approaches revealed that the coupled inversion approach is more practical and less uncertain. Particularly it was observed that coupled hydrogeophysical inversion enables simultaneous monitoring of ponding depth and water infiltration, which avoids the laborious task of manually measuring the ponding depths and can thus enable rapid estimation of the soil hydraulic parameters for multiple locations through automatic measurements of ponded infiltration for multiple rings through TDR multiplexing. Future studies should focus on using the coupled hydrogeophysical inversion approach to estimate spatially varying hydraulic properties which are more characteristic of the vadose zone. At the expense of a higher computational cost, better estimates of parameter uncertainties can be obtained with the use of MCMC algorithms that provide posterior probability distributions of the inverted parameters...|$|R

40|$|The {{prediction}} of moisture and contaminant transport through unsaturated soil to ground water {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{in the fields of}} hydrology, agriculture and environmental engineering. Computer aided simulation techniques enables one to conduct a series of systematic numerical experiments to analyze flow phenomenon in subsurface hydrology under various physical and chemical processes. The flow movement depends upon medium characteristics, initial and boundary conditions, which reflect, physical processes occurring below the ground. To understand the effects of physical process an efficient and accurate model is needed. Thus the model developed must be able to handle varied initial and boundary conditions. In this regard, infiltration into a very dry soil becomes a very important problem of study. Most of the earlier numerical models developed are concentrated on the development of an efficient algorithm or the modelling of a particular process which govern the flow in unsaturated or saturated-unsaturated homogeneous medium. Not much work has been done on the analysis of variably saturated flow in layered soil medium. Models to simulate unsaturated flow through dry soils, especially through layered soils with varied boundary conditions are very limited. Further, not much studies {{have been reported in the}} literature on the {{prediction of}} seepage face development and the phreatic surface movement in variably saturated media with layering. These aspects are very important in determining the flow field and the discharge from the domain. A detailed literature review covering above aspects has been made and is reported in this thesis. In the present work, two dimensional numerical models to predict the movement of wetting front in unsaturated domain and the movement of the phreatic surface in homogeneous and layered porous media under various initial and boundary conditions are developed based on finite difference and finite volume techniques. These models can handle flow in both rectangular flow domains and radial flow domains. The initial condition settings include the handling of very dry soil medium without any transformation of the governing equation, handling of <b>infiltration</b> and constant <b>head</b> conditions at the boundaries under steady state as well as transient scenarios. The models are also able to handle various soil moisture characteristics which depict the nonlinear behaviour between hydraulic conductivity, moisture content and pressure head in a soil media. A mixed form of the governing partial differential equation is used in the present study as it leads to better mass conservation. The finite difference model uses a central difference approximation for the space derivatives and an Eulerian backward difference approximation for the time derivative. The fully implicit formulation is solved iteratively using Strongly Implicit Procedure after making Picard approximation for the highly nonlinear coefficients. The process of infiltration into an initially dry soil leads to the development of a steep wetting front. As the finite volume technique is naturally an upwind method, it is expected to play a positive role in modelling such processes accurately. Hence, a finite volume model is also developed by approximating the convective part using a MUSCL approach and a fully implicit central difference method for the diffusive part of the governing equation. The models developed are validated using both experimental data and numerical solutions for problems reported in the literature. The validation problems cover a wide range of physical scenarios such as: infiltration into a very dry soil, infiltration into a dry soil column with gravity drainage, development of water table mound, steady state drainage in a sand filled wedge shaped tank with seepage face development and transient seepage face development in a rectangular domain. Five test problems are used for the validation of the models. The developed models perform very well for the test problems considered, indicating the models' capability in handling such situations. The results obtained by using the present models for simulating flow through highly unsaturated (very dry) soils show that the models perform very well when compared with models which use transformation techniques to handle such problems. The performance of the present models in comparison with the experimental data and numerical models available in the literature show the suitability of the present models in handling such situations. The present models are also used to analyse various types of unsaturated flow problems with varying initial and boundary conditions. The boundary conditions considered are no flow and /or free flow conditions along the left, right and bottom boundaries with infiltration condition along a part of the top boundary. For the various cases considered in the present study, infiltration rate varies from 5 cm/day to 50 cm/day through an initially very dry soil of - 15000 cm pressure head in homogeneous and layered soils. Different types of soil media considered vary from sandy loam, loam and clay with horizontal and vertical layering of these soils. A total number of 14 cases are analysed. The results are discussed in terms of pressure head variation in the flow domain along with moisture redistribution for all the cases under consideration. It is observed from these studies that the infiltration rate play an important role on the wetting front movement through layered soils depending on the type of layering and the boundary conditions considered. The soil properties of various layers affect the movement of wetting front by changing the direction of movement. Even though the wetting front movement is predominantly vertical, there is a tendency for the wetting front to move in the horizontal direction as it moves from a coarse soil to fine soil. It is also observed that the vertical layering of soils with different hydraulic conductivity helps in redirecting the flow towards the bottom boundary through the neighboring coarser layers. As finite volume method is more suitable for simulating sharp fronts, it is expected to perform better than finite difference method for simulating infiltration into very dry soils. So, a comparison is made between the performance of these two models by using the above test problems. It is observed from these studies that the performance of both the models are same except that the finite volume method takes much more CPU time than the finite difference model. Considering the type of problems tested, it is observed that for modelling unsaturated and saturated-unsaturated flows, finite difference method is better in comparison to finite volume method. It may be due to the predominant diffusive characteristics of the governing equation even while modelling flow through very dry soils. Proper estimation of the seepage height is an important aspect in finding the discharge through the porous medium. It is observed from the literature that the use of a saturated flow model in such situations can lead to an underestimation of the discharge through the porous medium. This effect is more important when dealing with small dimension problems. It is also observed that various parameters which govern the moisture movement through saturated-unsaturated regions affect proper estimation of the seepage face height and there by discharge. Various factors like effect of boundary conditions, type of soil layering, problem dimension and aspect ratio on seepage face development and the associated phreatic surface formation is studied in the present work. It is seen from the present study that the seepage face development is more in rectangular flow domain than in radial flow domain for both homogeneous and layered soils. It is also seen that the seepage face development in rectangular problems are more sensitive than radial flow problems for various factors considered. The seepage height is also influenced by the tail water level. It is seen from the present study that as the tail water level increases the seepage face reduces with no seepage face development for some of the cases studied. This influence is relatively less for radial flow problems. As the length of the domain increases the seepage height decreases. It is seen that for different cases with same horizontal dimension, as the height of the domain increases the seepage face height also increases. This phenomenon is observed for both homogeneous and layered soil medium. The influence of the aspect ratio, which is the ratio of the length to height of the domain indicate that as the aspect ratio increases the seepage height decreases. The type of the soil layering is observed to have a very strong influence on the seepage face development. The study for understanding the effect of soil layering on the development of seepage face and phreatic surface suggest that as the coarseness of the material increases, the phreatic surface become flatter and its steepness increases with the fineness of the soil. The present model is also used for studying the transient phreatic surface movement and the seepage face development. This is studied for homogeneous and layered rectangular soil medium. The present study is used to understand the effect of specific storage on the phreatic surface movement and the seepage face development. The studies indicate that the influence of specific storage on the seepage face development is insignificant in homogeneous soils with only very little effect in the early time for longer domains. It is also observed that the influence of the specific storage is significant in the case of layered soils. This effect depends on the type of layering and the problem dimension and is observed to have influence for relatively longer period. This observation suggests the importance of specific storage on transient seepage face development. When the specific storage effect is considered the drainage of the soil become faster resulting in a faster decline of the phreatic surface with time. The influence of specific storage is also studied considering the problem dimension effect. It is seen that as the aspect ratio increases, the effect of specific storage on the phreatic surface development decreases. The studies with change in the upstream boundary condition from a constant head to a no flow condition indicate that the effect of specific storage has no significant influence on the phreatic surface development for both homogeneous and layered soils...|$|R
