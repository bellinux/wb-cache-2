60|$|She {{was silent}} for several moments. <b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> {{expression}} curiously.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> profile. Her lips quivered, and a tear glistened {{through the}} veil.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> {{for a few}} moments; Barbara looked resolute, but {{he thought}} her {{resolution}} forced.|$|E
5000|$|Peter {{finds the}} baby at his home/lab. Assisted by Charlotte [...] "Charlie" [...] Tanzi, <b>he</b> <b>studies</b> <b>her</b> as she grows from infancy to {{adulthood}} within two days, and names her Jasmine.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>studies</b> <b>her</b> at his leisure, not {{speaking}} for a time. She too <b>studies</b> something at <b>her</b> leisure. She {{is not the}} first to speak, appearing indeed so unlikely to be so, though he stood there until midnight, that even he is driven upon breaking silence.|$|R
60|$|Joan's keen-wrought {{perception}} registered his covert, scarcely veiled implication. <b>He</b> was <b>studying</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> with keen, sober, moody intent. The dark fire of {{his eyes}} thrilled her.|$|E
6000|$|When Saxon at last {{lapsed into}} {{complete}} silence, <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> anxiously, with quick sidelong glances. She sighed and asked: ...|$|E
6000|$|She sat silent while, with {{enormous}} and self-betraying pains to avoid detection, <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> firm thin brilliantly red lips. At last he tried: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well! I believe I {{see what}} you mean,' <b>he</b> said, <b>studying</b> <b>her</b> with a gravity that was amusing. 'There's your {{youngest}} sister, Octavia, is not she?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou wilt not suffer, Adelheid, by the {{exposure}} on the lake!" [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>studying</b> <b>her</b> face until the tell-tale blood stole to her very temples.|$|R
6000|$|... "So am I, Miss Ogilvy," [...] he answered, with heartiness, [...] "I mean to see you. But," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>studying</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "you do {{not look}} very well." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> {{she turned}} and caught him looking, and he felt again a curious {{fluttering}} rush at his heart. He fancied she flushed a little deeper as she turned away.|$|E
60|$|On his {{sleeping}} porch, glancing at his barometers and thermometers, her laughing {{face in the}} round frame caught his eyes, and, standing before it, even bending closer to it, <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> long.|$|E
6000|$|... “Twenty-four thousand,” said Porportuk. He grinned viciously, for the certitude of his bidding {{had at last}} shaken the king. The latter {{moved over}} close to El-Soo. <b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> {{carefully}} for a long while.|$|E
60|$|This {{she said}} with some {{bitterness}} and a look of pain; <b>he,</b> meanwhile, closely <b>studying</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|R
50|$|The Widow is {{surprised}} to find that Stephen gives up his wastrel ways once married. <b>He</b> <b>studies</b> <b>her</b> accounts, and learns that she is owed funds by various debtors; he sets out in pursuit of the moneys. Old Foster remains hostile to both his brother and son, and the son now tries to relieve his father's sufferings as he previously did his uncle's. Stephen Foster pretends a persistent hostility to his brother, though it is feigned as a way of testing and reforming his difficult relative. Stephen's reversal of fortune carries him to a new height when he is selected as the next sheriff of London.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said Tom, [...] "not at all." [...] <b>He</b> was <b>studying</b> <b>her</b> face. Its {{expression}} troubled {{and moved}} him strangely, {{for he was}} not an analytical person. [...] "I didn't mean to tell you those things when I began," [...] he apologized, [...] "but you wanted to hear them." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{went with}} him, knowing this was {{imprudent}} {{but unable to}} resist, and he threw an oat-stook against the bank and covered it with his coat. Grace sat down and <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> thoughtfully.|$|E
6000|$|Hendricks {{looked up}} at her. <b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> intently. [...] "You're telling the truth?" [...] A strange {{expression}} had come over his face, an avid hunger. [...] "You will come back for me? You'll get me to the Moon Base?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{feeling was}} mixed, too, {{with a feeling}} of his unworthiness, which deepened the more closely <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her.</b> She was so free from all bruise and stain of life's battle. There were no {{questionable}} places in her life. Could he say as much? ...|$|E
60|$|Murray mentally {{decided that}} {{her voice was}} the sweetest he had ever heard. He was glad he had {{arranged}} his cow at such an angle that <b>he</b> could <b>study</b> <b>her</b> profile. It was amazing that Mrs. Palmer's niece should have such a profile. It looked as if centuries of fine breeding were responsible for it.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> {{turned and}} <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> critically. Lady Ruth raised her eyes once, but dropped them at once. She felt herself growing paler. A spasm {{of the old}} fear was upon her.|$|R
60|$|He {{placed a}} chair for {{her so that}} the light fell upon her face, {{and she knew that}} <b>he</b> {{intended}} to <b>study</b> <b>her</b> {{as if she were a}} page of strange text.|$|R
6000|$|He {{drew back}} from her hand in pain and bewilderment. [...] "Alice, you are crazy to say such things to me." [...] <b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> with {{suffering}} in his eyes. [...] "You are delirious. I am going to send the doctor to you at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just curious." [...] <b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her.</b> She {{had taken}} off her coat, tossing it over {{the end of the}} cot. She was young, about twenty. Slim. Her long hair {{stretched}} out over the pillow. She was staring at him silently, her eyes dark and large.|$|E
60|$|She {{flung the}} {{question}} at him sharply with tense apprehension, for, after all, if Gregory was sure of himself, {{there was only one}} course open to her. He leaned upon the table, gazing at her, and as <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> face his indignation melted, and doubts crept into his mind.|$|E
50|$|He got his {{hyphenated}} {{name from}} Vinnette Justine Carroll. <b>He</b> <b>studied</b> acting in <b>her</b> workshop for years. She {{said he was}} like a son to her and should take her name. So, he became Clinton Derricks-Carroll.|$|R
60|$|When Lady Bellamy reached Rewtham House, {{she went}} {{straight}} to <b>her</b> husband's <b>study.</b> <b>He</b> received <b>her</b> with much politeness, {{and asked her to}} sit down.|$|R
60|$|When she {{had passed}} him <b>he</b> again <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> back, swiftly and covertly. No, sir. No {{question}} about it. It couldn't be denied by any one {{now that the}} girl was a freak, for, charitable though Our Mr. Wrenn was, {{he had to admit}} that {{there was no sign of}} the midback ridge and little rounded knobbinesses of corseted respectability. And he had a closer view of the texture of her sage-green crash gown.|$|R
60|$|Was she young? Sometimes as <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> {{she seemed}} a woman, {{especially}} {{as she looked}} away out of the window, and the profile line of her face could be seen. But she looked younger when she bent her head upon her books, and her long eye-lashes fell upon her cheek.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> face, his {{expression}} never changing. Mary Louise {{wondered if he}} could read her suspicion and dislike of him, despite her efforts to smother those feelings {{in the cause of}} Liberty. Then Herring looked at Professor Dyer, who stood meekly, with downcast eyes. Next the grocer gazed at the supervisor, who smiled in a shrewd way and gave a brief nod.|$|E
6000|$|This silenced him. He {{took time}} to {{consider}} what this sudden depression on her part meant. As <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> he saw her lip quiver, and anxiety suddenly left him. His tone was laughter-filled as he called: [...] "Come, now, Miss Brisbane, you're making game of me by taking my criticisms so solemnly. I can see a smile twitching your lips this moment. Look at me!" ...|$|E
60|$|Lister {{was rather}} {{surprised}} to find he could not answer satisfactorily. It was not the girl's physical qualities but her emotions he had marked. He remembered the pluck with which she had struggled against the fear she obviously felt, her impulsive trust when he offered help, and her relief when she got into the locomotive cab. Although <b>he</b> had <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> at Montreal, it was her effort to play a part that impressed him most.|$|R
50|$|She is {{the sister}} of science writer Gabrielle Walker, well known for her radio shows on BBC Radio 4 and also <b>her</b> Antarctic <b>studies.</b> She married Edmund Southworth, who {{graduated}} from Lancaster University in 1977 where <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> Archaeology. <b>Her</b> husband {{has been on the}} North West Committee of the Heritage Lottery Fund, was the County Museums Officer for Lancashire County Council from 2001, and became Director of Manx National Heritage in 2009.|$|R
60|$|She {{stood before}} {{him for a}} moment in silence, as though not unwilling that he should {{appreciate}} the soft splendour of her toilette. The jewels which encircled her neck were priceless and dazzling; the soft material of her gown, the most delicate shade of sea green, seemed to foam about her feet, a wonderful triumph of allegoric dressmaking. She saw that <b>he</b> was <b>studying</b> <b>her,</b> and she laughed a little uneasily, looking all the time into his eyes.|$|R
