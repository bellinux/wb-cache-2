50|$|As of 2012, {{electronic}} TRVs {{are becoming}} available which use <b>electronic</b> <b>temperature</b> sensing, and frequently contain programmers so that individual radiators may be programmed for different temperatures {{at different times}} of the day. Such increased control allows even better energy and CO saving.|$|E
40|$|Extended {{free energy}} Lagrangians are {{proposed}} for first principles molecular dynamics simulations at finite <b>electronic</b> <b>temperatures</b> for plane-wave pseudopotential and local orbital density matrix based calculations. Thanks to the extended Lagrangian description the electronic {{degrees of freedom}} can be integrated by stable geometric schemes that conserve the free energy. For the local orbital representations both the nuclear and electronic forces have simple and numerically efficient expressions that are well suited for reduced complexity calculations. A rapidly converging recursive Fermi operator expansion method that {{does not require the}} calculation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the construction of the fractionally occupied density matrix is discussed. An efficient expression for the Pulay force that is valid also for density matrices with fractional occupation occurring at finite <b>electronic</b> <b>temperatures</b> is also demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Ultrafast laser {{excitation}} can induce fast {{increases of}} the <b>electronic</b> subsystem <b>temperature.</b> The subsequent <b>electronic</b> evolutions {{in terms of}} band structure and energy distribution can determine the change of several thermodynamic properties, including one essential for energy deposition; the electronic heat capacity. Using density functional calculations performed at finite <b>electronic</b> <b>temperatures,</b> the <b>electronic</b> heat capacities dependent on <b>electronic</b> <b>temperatures</b> are obtained {{for a series of}} metals, including free electron like, transition and noble metals. The effect of exchange and correlation functionals and the presence of semicore electrons on electronic heat capacities are first evaluated and found to be negligible in most cases. Then, we tested the validity of the free electron approaches, varying the number of free electrons per atom. This shows that only simple metals can be correctly fitted with these approaches. For transition metals, the presence of localized d electrons produces a strong deviation toward high energies of the electronic heat capacities, implying that more energy is needed to thermally excite them, compared to free sp electrons. This is attributed to collective excitation effects strengthened by a change of the electronic screening at high temperature...|$|R
40|$|Time-resolved Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} applied to probe the anharmonic coupling and electron-phonon interaction of optical phonons in graphite. From the decay of the transient anti-Stokes scattering of the G-mode following ultrafast excitation, we measured a lifetime of 2. 2 +/- 0. 1 ps for zone-center optical phonons. We also observed a transient stiffening of G-mode phonons, an effect attributed to the reduction of the electron-phonon coupling for high <b>electronic</b> <b>temperatures...</b>|$|R

50|$|In glass manufacture, a lehr is {{typically}} a long kiln with a temperature gradient from end to end, through which newly made glass {{objects such as}} glasses or vases are transported on a conveyor belt. However, the same effect can be obtained in a small kiln by controlling the cooling rate with an <b>electronic</b> <b>temperature</b> controller.|$|E
50|$|Many {{of the new}} fryer models include <b>electronic</b> <b>temperature</b> controls. These {{computerized}} controls {{save energy}} by constantly sensing and adjusting {{the temperature of the}} oil. A high quality thermostat can stay within a 7.2 ˚C range of a desired temperature, assuring accurate cook times. Safety thermostats that automatically cut the power if the oil reaches dangerous temperatures help prevent oil fires.|$|E
40|$|On {{the bases}} of the {{centerline}} enthalpy value deduced from heat transfer measurements and the NOZNT code, {{it is possible to}} predict the freestream conditions in an arcjet wind tunnel flow. The translational-rotational and vibrational temperature of NO is nearly reproducible by NOZNT. Relative to the electron and <b>electronic</b> <b>temperatures,</b> the vibrational temperature of N 2 and NO are significantly lower at enthalpies of less than 45 MJ/kg. The enthalpy deduced from spectroscopic measurements is in rough agreement with that deduced from heat transfer measurements...|$|R
30|$|Our {{findings}} suggest that an external factor, which could be the different position of the Sun relative to the satellite, still influences both the VFM <b>electronic</b> unit <b>temperature</b> and the VFM magnetic measurements which nonlinearly and chaotically respond to this external disturbance. One possible scenario is that the VFM responds nonlinearly to <b>electronic</b> unit <b>temperature</b> variations, which {{are related to the}} position of the Sun, so that to produce biased measurements. Another possible scenario is the one according to which VFM measuring process is perturbed by external temperature variations through some mechanical deformation whose effect could manifest in terms of a spurious magnetic field. In both cases due to the nonlinear response to the external forcing, the complexity of the magnetic measurements is increased with respect to those of the inducing <b>electronic</b> unit <b>temperature</b> changes, and therefore, they are characterized by a higher number of IMFs.|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} code is described whereby calculations of radiative properties of gas mixtures may be made. The program is arranged so that distinct radiative processes for each species are computed in individual subroutines.

These features should provide a flexibility not currently available in such programs. The basic equations and the program listing in FORTRAN 4 language are presented. Sample calculations are given for high temperature air and carbon dioxide and are compared to calculations made with previously developed programs...|$|R

5000|$|Signal {{amplification}} performs {{two important}} functions: increases {{the resolution of}} the input signal, and increases its signal-to-noise ratio. [...] For example, the output of an <b>electronic</b> <b>temperature</b> sensor, which is probably in the millivolts range is probably too low for an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to process directly. In this case it is necessary to bring the voltage level up to that required by the ADC.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{formulation}} for {{tight binding}} total energy calculations and tight binding molecular dynamics, which scales linearily {{with the size}} of the system, is presented. The linear complexity allows us to treat systems of very large size and the algorithm is already faster than the best implementation of classical diagonalization for systems of 64 atoms. In addition, it is naturally parallelizable and it permits us therefore to perform molecular dynamics simulations of systems of unprecedented size. Finite <b>electronic</b> <b>temperatures</b> can also be taken into account. We illustrate this method by investigating structural and dynamical properties of solid and liquid carbon at different densities...|$|R

The thermometer does not pass a current through the 2 DEG, and can be incorporated as an add-on to measure the temperature simultaneously with another operating device. Further, the tuning is independent of temperature. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

These data are used here to model a low-power arcjet, running with Argon at low pressure. In so doing, they are explicitly introduced in the chemical processes included in a fluid Navier-Stokes type code, allowing for evaluation of the spectroscopically measurable level populations and of the <b>electronic</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The characteristics of the model are described and the main processes are discussed in view {{of the results of the}} calculations...|$|R
40|$|We use {{simultaneous}} electronic {{transport and}} optical characterization measurements to reveal {{new information about}} electronic and optical processes in nanoscale junctions fabricated by electromigration. Comparing electronic tunneling and photocurrents allows us to infer the optical frequency potential difference produced by the plasmon response of the junction. Together with the measured tunneling conductance, we can then determine the locally enhanced electric field within the junction. In similar structures containing molecules, anti-Stokes and Stokes Raman emission allow us to infer the effective local vibrational and <b>electronic</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{as a function of}} DC current, examining heating and dissipation on the nanometer scale.

50|$|As Watsco’s {{distribution}} business took off, its manufacturing business became a smaller {{portion of its}} total business. By 1993, about {{three quarters of the}} company’s revenues came from distribution. Manufacturing was profitable and Watsco began manufacturing <b>electronic</b> <b>temperature</b> controls, which it sold to OEMs. Watsco also began making a new product in 1992, which it called the Flash. The Flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment. The Flash was manufactured by a Watsco subsidiary in Hialeah, and it was important because the Clean Air Act enacted in July 1992 prohibited the release of CFCs into the air. The Flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle CFCs in compliance with the law. With this new product, Watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side {{by the end of the}} decade.|$|E
40|$|The optical {{conductivity}} of freely suspended graphene {{was examined}} under non-equilibrium conditions using femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. We observed a conductivity transient that varied strongly with the <b>electronic</b> <b>temperature,</b> exhibiting a crossover from enhanced to decreased absorbance with increasing pump fluence. The response arises {{from a combination}} of bleaching of the inter-band transitions by Pauli blocking and induced absorption from the intra-band transitions of the carriers. The latter dominates at low <b>electronic</b> <b>temperature,</b> but, despite an increase in Drude scattering rate, is overwhelmed by the former at high <b>electronic</b> <b>temperature.</b> The time-evolution of the optical conductivity in all regimes can described in terms of a time-varying <b>electronic</b> <b>temperature.</b> Comment: 10 pages (4 pages manuscript + Supplemental Info. ...|$|E
