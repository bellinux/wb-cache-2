5|$|After Chamberlin's death, <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> of some 250,000 spider {{specimens}} was {{donated to}} the American Museum of Natural History in New York, bolstering the museum's status as the world's largest arachnid repository. Similarly, <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> of millipedes was deposited in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., helping to make that museum the world's largest single collection of millipede type specimens—the individual specimens used to describe species.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of the}} museum's {{holdings}} is Kanoo's own {{collection of}} Qur'anic manuscripts and Islamic art, since he was reportedly {{said to have been}} an avid collector. As <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> grew, he reportedly came to feel a strong sense of responsibility toward the rare manuscripts he had acquired. In 1990, he donated <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> to the museum he established to operate a first-of-its-kind institution dedicated to the service of the Qur'an and the preservation of historic manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was bought in 1832 by Robert Vernon to {{form part of}} <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> of British art. Vernon donated <b>his</b> <b>collection,</b> including Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, to the National Gallery in 1847, which, in turn, transferred it to the Tate Gallery in 1949. It remains one of Etty's best-known works, and formed part of major exhibitions at Tate Britain in 2001–02 and at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.|$|E

Gale also collected coins, and donated <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> to Cambridge University.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the Milford Havens {{had to give}} {{up their}} home, Kent House, for {{financial}} reasons. He sold <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> of naval medals. All of his financial investments in Russia were seized by the Bolsheviks and his German property became valueless {{with the collapse of the}} mark. He sold Heiligenberg Castle, which he had inherited from his father, in 1920.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Inglis {{ended his}} {{appointment}} as chief judge {{and returned to}} New Zealand. He became a magistrate in Hamilton in 1953, and retired in 1965.

50|$|The next 35 {{years were}} spent exchanging letters with the curators of <b>his</b> <b>collections</b> in Copenhagen, {{as well as}} {{receiving}} the visits of young European naturalists. The complete study of <b>his</b> <b>collections,</b> E Museo Lundii, was published only in 1888.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>his</b> <b>collections</b> were stored at the botanical garden in Berlin-Dahlem, whose vicedirector {{he had been}} since 1913, becoming its director in 1921 until 1945. <b>His</b> <b>collections</b> were destroyed there during an air raid in 1943. He died in Berlin.|$|R
50|$|Robert Mouawad {{acquired}} a historical residence in Beirut, Lebanon to host <b>his</b> <b>collections</b> {{of fine arts}} and antique pieces, and in 2006 established the Robert Mouawad Private Museum for <b>his</b> <b>collections</b> of books, ceramics, architectural elements, pottery, ancient weapons, carpets, jewelry, objets d'art and rare precious stones.|$|R

5|$|After {{breaking}} his own Miami Heat single-season scoring record, Wade gave the jersey he wore in that night's victory to 8-year-old Michael Stolzenberg, an avid Heat fan that {{had his hands}} and feet removed surgically due to a bacterial infection. Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> of Heat memorabilia. Wade has been known for visiting other sick children, usually in private to avoid placing himself in the media spotlight.|$|E
5|$|Although Hogg spent {{little time}} at the Varner {{plantation}} after Bayou Bend was constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf. In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different theme from Texas history: colonial times, the Confederacy, Napoleonic times (1818), and the Mexican–American War. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained his desk and chair as well as <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> of walking sticks. She donated the property to the state, and it was dedicated as the Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.|$|E

50|$|Cohen was {{a native}} of Stockton, California. As a {{collector}} of cartoon art, Cohen amassed an estimated 9,500 items of original Mad original art. <b>His</b> <b>collections</b> of comic book art were considered {{among the best in the}} country, and parts of <b>his</b> <b>collections</b> were put on national tours.|$|R
50|$|He went on {{numerous}} {{field trips to}} Central America from 1928 to 1964. His favorite collecting method was sifting litter. Because R. V. Chamberlin did not return some of <b>his</b> <b>collections</b> in 1928 but instead published on them, Chickering preferred to work on <b>his</b> <b>collections</b> himself later on.|$|R
5|$|Although {{his career}} as an artist was fleeting, Gibson's career as a patron and lover of art was lifelong. In the 1950s and 1960s Gibson made major {{contributions}} to the arts in Australia, both as a collector and a patron of arts organisations. He acquired the works of some of Australia's most highly regarded artists, such as Russell Drysdale, Albert Tucker and John Brack. Other artists well represented in <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> included Noel Counihan, John Passmore, Clifton Pugh and Clive Stephen.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole met the {{botanist}} and collector John Tradescant {{the younger}} around 1650. Tradescant had, with his father, {{built up a}} vast and renowned collection of exotic plants, mineral specimens and other curiosities {{from around the world}} at their house in Lambeth. Ashmole helped Tradescant catalogue <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> in 1652, and, in 1656, he financed the publication of the catalogue, the Musaeum Tradescantianum. In 1659, Tradescant, who had lost his only son seven years earlier, legally deeded <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> to Ashmole. Under the agreement, Ashmole would take possession at Tradescant's death. When Tradescant died in 1662, his widow, Hester, contested the deed, claiming her husband had signed it when drunk without knowing its contents, but the matter was settled in Chancery in Ashmole's favour two years later. Hester was to hold the collection in trust for Ashmole until her death. Ashmole's determined aggressiveness in obtaining the Tradescant collection for himself has led some scholars to consider that Ashmole was an ambitious, ingratiating social climber who stole a hero's legacy for his own glorification.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{published}} Z. Marcas in {{the first}} issue of the Revue Parisienne, 25 July 1840. It was republished a year later under the title La Mort d'un ambitieux ("The Death of an Ambitious Man"), in a collection from various authors called Le Fruit défendu ("Forbidden Fruit"). Shortly before his death, Balzac placed the story in the Scènes de la vie politique section of <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> La Comédie humaine.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{formally}} {{described and}} named the species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He {{did not identify}} a type specimen, but the one specimen in <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not explicitly give an etymology for the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Latin verticillatus ("whorled"), {{in reference to the}} whorled leaf arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{published}} a formal description and {{name for the}} species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He did not designate a type specimen (a specimen to {{be representative of the}} species) for the species, but the one specimen in <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not state the etymology of the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Ancient Greek sphaera- ("round"), and carpos ("fruit"), in reference to the shape of its infructescences.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{engaged the}} French scholar René-Yvon Lefebvre d'Argencé, then {{teaching}} at the University of California, as full-time curator of <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> and advisor on acquisitions. The two men made a deal—no piece would be purchased unless both men agreed. They built a collection of jade which ranged from the neolithic period to the modern era; and hundreds of Chinese, Japanese and Korean bronzes, mostly Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The painter whom Brundage admired the most was Huizong, 12th-century Chinese emperor of the Song dynasty; the collector never was able to obtain any of his work. Brundage several times bought pieces smuggled out of their lands of origin to restore them there. When Brundage sold a piece, it was most likely because he no longer favored it artistically, rather than to realize a profit. In 1954, a financial statement prepared for Brundage listed the value of <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> as more than $1million. In 1960, Robert Shaplen, in his article on Brundage for The New Yorker, noted that Brundage, during his travels as IOC president, always found time to visit art dealers, and stated that the collection was valued at $15million.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the hostility}} with which Candaules was met on its exhibition, it {{was bought by}} Robert Vernon, who had made a fortune {{supplying}} horses to the military and was using the proceeds to amass a major art collection. Vernon presented <b>his</b> <b>collection</b> to the nation in 1847, although {{in the case of}} Candaules a painting so controversial becoming government property was a source of some embarrassment. In 1929 Candaules was transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Flat Bastion Magazine {{had been}} {{abandoned}} for years when geology enthusiast Freddie Gomez undertook its restoration. Gomez, whose interests include both history and geology, converted the magazine to a geological research facility and exhibition centre. While much {{of the contents of}} the large collection of rocks and minerals are from <b>his</b> <b>collection,</b> other specimens have been donated. The men of the 150 (Yorkshire) Transport Regiment also spent a day performing repairs at the magazine. Gomez aspires to open the site to the public.|$|E
