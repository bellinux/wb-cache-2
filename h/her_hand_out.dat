The finger section would be folded in and kept away tidily. This is how ladies wore gloves while dining. After the meal they would put their hands back into the gloves, usually {{for the rest of}} the evening. During the 19th century, {{especially}} from the mid-Victorian era onwards, gloves were tailored so as to fit very tightly onto the hands and armsso tightly, in fact, that it was often necessary to use aids such as talcum powder and buttonhooks to put on one's gloves; therefore, it was considered somewhat uncouth to put on or remove one's gloves completely in public and women would make sure to don their gloves in the privacy of their homes before going out to some event (another reason for the popularity of the mousquetaire opening). The mousquetaire opening/fastening for women's long gloves seems to have become most popular during the Victorian era; during the Napoleonic/Regency period, women's long gloves were often tailored to fit loosely on the wearer's arm, and were often worn gathered below the elbow or held up on the biceps with a garter-like strap. (In the 2005 film version of Pride and Prejudice, Rosamund Pike and several other actresses wear opera-length gloves with drawstring ties at the top of the glove, but this might not be an accurate representation of the style of long gloves in the Regency era; fashion plates from the period do not appear to show gloves with drawstring-type ties, but do often show women wearing gloves held up by garterlike straps or ribbons.) ...|$|E
60|$|He halted awkwardly, and {{his very}} evident {{fear that he}} had hurt her touched Saxon. She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> to his.|$|E
6000|$|She pulled <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> of his arm, {{which she}} had taken, and halted him by her abrupt pause. [...] "You're {{not going to get}} through!" ...|$|E
60|$|Cecilia {{stretched}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>out</b> towards Martin, {{and there}} was a faint tinkling as of chains.|$|R
60|$|It {{was half}} an hour later when she met Nellie Seaforth in a corridor, and the latter {{stretched}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>out</b> impulsively and kissed her.|$|R
60|$|But already Crystal {{had torn}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>out</b> of Mme. la Duchesse's grasp {{and now was}} {{struggling}} to free herself from Jeanne's terrified and clinging embrace.|$|R
6000|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out,</b> and {{her fingers}} met his. [...] "We shall be late," [...] she said, glowing, and {{catching}} up her book: [...] "I'm always late!" ...|$|E
60|$|She drew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> of his {{arm with}} a cry of terror. She {{looked at him as}} if she doubted whether he was in his right mind.|$|E
60|$|She made {{a second}} attempt to release herself; and this time, she {{wrenched}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> of his grasp with a strength {{for which he}} was not prepared.|$|E
60|$|Not a word {{passed between}} {{them as they}} went up the quiet street. At {{the sound of their}} feet in the entry the door was flung open, and Virginia, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>out</b> stretched, stood under the hall light.|$|R
60|$|MADGE. [Looking searchingly at MRS. ROBERTS.] I {{wonder he}} can look you in the face. [She squats before the fire, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>out</b> to the flame.] Harness is here again. They'll {{have to make up}} their minds to-day.|$|R
60|$|She laughed, took <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>out</b> of the water, {{and watched}} the clear drops trickle off. Then {{she lifted her head}} suddenly, at some thought or other. She looked across the valley, and saw the red roofs of the Mill.|$|R
6000|$|Up {{came the}} little girl, with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out,</b> and a half-shy, half-merry {{look in her}} blue eyes, as she said, inquiringly, [...] "This is Tom, is n't it?" ...|$|E
60|$|She, however, held <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> {{before she}} turned to speak to Mrs. Radcliffe, {{but it was a}} slight relief to both when {{somebody}} announced that dinner was ready.|$|E
60|$|Agatha was too {{agitated}} {{to speak}} for a time, but she stretched <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> to him, and he grasped {{it in his own}} as forcibly as his strength would allow.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "I do {{not think}} we can sit. But still I like {{to be here with}} you. All that some day will be your own." [...] Then she {{stretched}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>out</b> to the far view.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> flashed <b>out</b> towards him--a gesture almost of horror.|$|R
6000|$|When he had {{finished}} {{she looked at him}} for a long while. [...] "Yes, Daren," [...] she finally said, [...] "you understand, and you have made me understand. I always felt"--and <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> went to <b>her</b> heart--"but my mind did not grasp.... Oh, Daren, how I thank you!" [...] and she held <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>out</b> to him.|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> {{through the}} door. He took {{it with some}} little surprise; it was not often in his {{experience}} that she gave him her hand of her own accord.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dowson {{looked up}} quickly, and then, {{lowering}} her eyes, took <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> of the stocking {{she had been}} darning and, placing it beside its companion, rolled the pair into a ball.|$|E
6000|$|Eveline reached <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> to her friend, and as {{she pressed}} affectionately that which Rose gave in return, she whispered to her with energy, [...] "I thank thee for the judgment, which my own heart confirms." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of the closing door she had glanced up, and then, {{at the sight of the}} king, she sprang to her feet and ran towards him, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>out,</b> <b>her</b> blue eyes bedimmed with tears, her whole {{beautiful}} figure softening into womanliness and humility.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hand</b> stole <b>out</b> {{and found}} his. They {{began to talk}} in whispers.|$|R
50|$|Bassett {{was injured}} while filming the first spousal abuse sequence. She {{fell off the}} back of a {{high-rise}} sofa, put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>out</b> to reduce the impact, and suffered a hairline fracture of <b>her</b> right <b>hand.</b> She only tried the stunt fall once, and footage leading up to the mishap appears in the film.|$|R
60|$|Therefore she did {{not make}} a rush for the studio door, {{she did not}} with {{dramatic}} gesture interpose her body between it and the CÃ¦sar: she merely put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> and let it rest upon his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't despair! Even if {{they don't}} acquit you, it'll soon be over. Don't despair!" [...] And she stole <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> and timidly touched his arm. She {{felt her heart}} turning over and over, he looked so sad.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's Ed," [...] {{cried the}} old woman. [...] "He's {{on the way}} home. Heavens an' earth! There he is now!" [...] She turned and waved <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> toward the road. They rushed {{to the door and}} looked where she pointed.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> went <b>out</b> towards him. Borrowdean, with {{an almost}} {{imperceptible}} movement, checked his advance.|$|R
6000|$|But he had {{not taken}} six steps {{when he saw her}} coming. She had on a grey furry scarf, hiding her mouth, making her look much older. The moment the door was shut she threw it off, went to the hearth, drew up a little stool, and, holding <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>out</b> to the fire, said: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hand</b> started <b>out</b> impulsively, then checked. [...] "My name is Lackland, Joan Lackland." [...] The <b>hand</b> went <b>out.</b> [...] "And {{let us be}} friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> and {{he grasped}} it, and {{stood for a}} moment looking at her. Then he seized her in his arms and kissed her brow and her lips. [...] "Oh, Emily, why were you not my wife? My darling, my darling!" ...|$|E
60|$|Meta was {{a little}} {{disappointed}} to see sovereigns instead of a book. Flora turned to go, and put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> to lean on her sister as for support; she stood still to gather strength before ascending the stairs, and a groan of intense misery was wrung from her.|$|E
6000|$|Aurora Church {{had taken}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> of Miss Ruck's arm; {{she looked at}} me, smiling, with her head a little inclined, while, upon her shoulder, she made her open parasol revolve. [...] "Which is most improper--to walk alone or to walk with gentlemen? I wish {{to do what is}} most improper." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hand</b> flashed <b>out</b> {{almost to}} his lips, long shapely fingers, ablaze with the dull fire of emeralds.|$|R
50|$|She {{turns to}} her right and begins rubbing her forearms together, then waves <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>out</b> to <b>her</b> sides with palms flat and fingers outstretched, while bowing forward {{slightly}} and rocking gently. This can all be seen through the door, which remains open. After she backs to the wall again and walks away to the left, it finally closes.|$|R
