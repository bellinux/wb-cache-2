50|$|<b>Fracture</b> <b>strength,</b> {{also known}} as {{breaking}} strength, is the stress at which a specimen fails via fracture. This is usually determined for a given specimen by a tensile test, which charts the stress-strain curve (see image). The final recorded point is the <b>fracture</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ductile {{materials}} have a <b>fracture</b> <b>strength</b> {{lower than the}} ultimate tensile strength (UTS), whereas in brittle materials the <b>fracture</b> <b>strength</b> {{is equivalent to the}} UTS. If a ductile material reaches its ultimate tensile strength in a load-controlled situation, it will continue to deform, with no additional load application, until it ruptures. However, if the loading is displacement-controlled, the deformation of the material may relieve the load, preventing rupture.|$|E

40|$|Well-defined {{segmented}} block copolymers {{were studied}} {{as the number}} and position of hard segments in the chain was varied. The hard segments were diamides of uniform length (A), and the synthesized copolymers were mono-, di-, tri- or multiblock using the soft segment (B), poly(tetramethylene oxide), with a molecular weight of 2 [*] 900 g mol− 1 and extended with terephthalate groups to reach a maximum of 20 [*] 000 g mol− 1. The diamide segments in the chain displayed very high crystallinities and a ribbon-like structure with high aspect ratio. The copolymer without hard segments was a semi-solid. For the materials with one diamide unit in the chain, the modulus was high but the yield and <b>fracture</b> <b>strengths</b> low.

40|$|The inter-relationship between <b>fracture</b> <b>strengths</b> {{determined}} by the uniaxial tensile test the 3 -point bend test, the compact tension (CT) -test and a modified CT-test specimen becomes possible with additional assumptions to Weibull's theory of fracture. These fracture tests were selected to demonstrate that in general the failure of graphite under mechanical loads may be estimated by the procedure presented in this report. However, further experimental investigations to determine the dependency of <b>fracture</b> <b>strengths</b> on volume should be performed {{in support of the}} above statement. Alternatively it is recommended that the strength of graphite components to be subjected to irradiation should be determined using specially shaped test specimens. The test specimen should have the same stress distribution as that of the graphite component. This proposal is explained for the case of stresses in block-type nuclear fuel elements...|$|R
50|$|Mixing {{polymers}} {{is another}} method of increasing strength, particularly with materials that show crazing preceding brittle fracture such as atactic polystyrene (APS). For example, by forming a 50/50 mixture of APS with polyphenylene oxide (PPO), this embrittling tendency can be almost completely suppressed, substantially increasing the <b>fracture</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{systemic}} {{review and}} meta-analysis showed a {{success rate of}} endocrowns varying from 94 to 100%.

50|$|Several nanomechanical {{characterization}} methods have yielded many results for properties of matter at the nanoscale.

50|$|There {{are a few}} {{differences}} between these groups. The SiC group has over twice the <b>fracture</b> <b>strength</b> and thermal conductivity {{when compared to the}} oxides group. However, the oxides are more stable in combustion and oxidizing environments.

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of the RSL Test Method is the time in which valid and reproducible results can be obtained. One example is the long used Sustained Load Test of notched round bar tensile specimens found in ASTM F 519. In this test, the exposed test specimens are subjected to a load equal to 75% of the <b>Fracture</b> <b>Strength</b> and held for 200 hours. If the specimen does not break, the specimen has passed. If it fractures prior to the 200 hours then it has failed. The RSL test method can provide the same information {{in less than two}} days and will also give a percentage of <b>Fracture</b> <b>Strength</b> value which provides very valuable additional information.Similarly, an ASTM E1681 KIscc determination can take 12 specimens and up to 14-months because of the necessary run out times to confirm the threshold level. Using the RSL Test Method can provide the same results with 5-coupons in five to seven days.|$|E

These pressure vessels accommodate non-round shapes resulting in increased safety, driving range, and cabin space for hydrogen vehicles.|$|E

They sprayed 15 Pholcidae spiders with water containing the nanotubes or flakes.The resulting silk had a <b>fracture</b> <b>strength</b> up to 5.4 GPa, a Young’s modulus up to 47.8 GPa and a toughness modulus up to 2.1 GPa, surpassing both synthetic polymeric high performance fibres (e.g. Kevlar49) and knotted fibers.|$|E
50|$|MEMS (microelectro{{mechanical}} systems) for in situ {{mechanical characterization}} refers to microfabricated systems (lab-on-a-chip) {{used to measure}} the mechanical properties (Young’s modulus, <b>fracture</b> <b>strength)</b> of nanoscale specimens such as nanowires, nanorods, whiskers, nanotubes and thin films. They distinguish themselves from other methods of nanomechanical testing because the sensing and actuation mechanisms are embedded and/or co-fabricated in the microsystem, providing — in the majority of cases— greater sensitivity and precision.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{macroscale}} {{mechanical characterization}} is mostly performed under uniaxial tensile conditions.

From this curve, important properties like the Young’s modulus, Yield strength, <b>Fracture</b> <b>Strength</b> can be computed.

40|$|Bonding {{strengths}} of {{three types of}} adhesives were evaluated at different temperatures. The effects of temperature and adhesive thickness on the strength were clarified from the results. It concluded that EA 9394 cured at room temperature is the overall best performing adhesive for CFRP applications at cryogenic temperatures. The initial failure mode of double-lap specimens was also discussed from the results by strain/stress analysis. And also the cryogenic fracture performance of bonded structure between CFRP using AF 163 - 2 K is examined. The tensile Mode-I and shear Mode-II <b>fracture</b> <b>strengths</b> of CFRP/AF 163 - 2 K bond joints are evaluated at room temperature and cryogenic temperature. The results indicate that both cryogenic Mode-I and Mode-II <b>fracture</b> <b>strengths</b> of CFRP/AF 163 - 2 K bond joints dropped considerably. The mismatch of coefficients of linear expansion between CFRP and AF 163 - 2 K {{is considered to be}} the primary reason. On the other hand, feasibility investigations of CFRP composite as applied to unlined CFRP cryogenic tank was conducted. Reflecting the results of the previous two phase tests on small prototype filament-wound tank conducted at room temperature and cryogenic temperature, the improved third phase of FW tank test was conducted and the result show the feasibility of CFRP tank and identified the problem to be resolved...|$|R
50|$|A {{theory was}} needed to {{reconcile}} these conflicting observations. Also, experiments on glass fibers that Griffith himself conducted suggested that the fracture stress increases as the fiber diameter decreases. Hence the uniaxial tensile strength, which had been used extensively to predict material failure before Griffith, {{could not be a}} specimen-independent material property. Griffith suggested that the low <b>fracture</b> <b>strength</b> observed in experiments, as well as the size-dependence of strength, was due to the presence of microscopic flaws in the bulk material.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fracture}} is {{the separation}} of an object or material into two or more pieces under the action of stress. The fracture of a solid usually occurs due {{to the development of}} certain displacement discontinuity surfaces within the solid. If a displacement develops perpendicular to the surface of displacement, it is called a normal tensile crack or simply a crack; if a displacement develops tangentially to the surface of displacement, it is called a shear crack, slip band, or dislocation. [...] <b>Fracture</b> <b>strength</b> or breaking strength is the stress when a specimen fails or fractures.|$|E
50|$|A stress {{concentration}} (often called stress raisers or stress risers) is a location in an object where stress is concentrated. An object is stronger when force is evenly distributed over its area, so {{a reduction in}} area, e.g., caused by a crack, results in a localized increase in stress. A material can fail, via a propagating crack, when a concentrated stress exceeds the material's theoretical cohesive strength. The real <b>fracture</b> <b>strength</b> of a material is always lower than the theoretical value because most materials contain small cracks or contaminants (especially foreign particles) that concentrate stress. Fatigue cracks always start at stress raisers, so removing such defects increases the fatigue strength.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Classic {{analyses}} {{have shown}} that dynamic growth of a shear crack cannot be arrested in a uni-formly stressed elastic medium with homogeneously dis-tributed <b>fracture</b> <b>strengths.</b> This leads to a general supposition that earthquake rupture growth is arrested by inhomogeneities in the distributions of strengths or stresses. We propose a novel idea for arresting mecha-nism of dynamic crack growth in the simulation with no constraints on the crack geometry. Our analysis shows that the arresting occurs spontaneously soon after crack bending even in the homogeneous medium and that in-homogeneities are indispensable not for stopping crack growth, but for its promotion...|$|R
