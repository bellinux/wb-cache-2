50|$|E. meningoseptica {{may show}} colistin-resistant and vancomycin-sensitive growth which is paradoxic for a gram-negative bacterium, but resembles Burkholderia cepacia {{which is also}} a nonfermenter and does not grow well on MacConkey agar.

Automated bacterial identification system results should be observed with caution, especially when a patient with gram-negative bacteremia does not improve with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, because several bacteria, including Aeromonas salmonicida (mistaken by ID32 GN) and Sphingobacterium spp. (mistaken by Vitek 2), may be confused with this bacterium, especially the atypical ones. However, unlike many other Aeromonas species such as A. hydrophilia and A. punctata, A. salmonicida is indole negative, which can help in distinguishing it in doubtful cases. An automated but so far relatively reliable Rapid NF plus system and API Zym systems use an array of biochemical tests for better identification of nonfermenters and other bacteria and can specifically identify E. meningoseptica.|$|E

40|$|Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii is the causative {{agent of}} Stewart's wilt, a {{bacterial}} disease transmitted by the {{corn flea beetle}} mainly to sweet corn (Zea mays). In many countries, it is classified as a quarantine organism and must be differentiated from other yellow enteric bacteria frequently occurring with corn. We have created novel primers from the pstS-glmS region of P. stewartii for use in conventional PCR (cPCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). To facilitate rapid diagnosis, we applied matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis. Using whole-cell protein extracts, profiles were generated with a Bruker microflex machine, and the bacteria classified. P. stewartii strains were clearly distinguished from strains of Pantoea agglomerans, Pantoea dispersa, and Pantoea ananatis. Dendrogram analysis of the protein profiles confirmed the score values and showed the formation of separate clades for each species. The identification achieved by MALDI-TOF MS analysis agrees with the diagnosis by specific PCR primers. The combination of both methods allows a rapid and simple identification of the corn pathogen. P. stewartii subsp. stewartii and P. stewartii subsp. indologenes are highly related and can be distinguished not only by virulence assays and <b>indole</b> <b>tests</b> but also by a characteristic pattern in the nucleotide sequence of recA...|$|R

Samples of artificially seeded blood cultures (193 cultures) and patient blood cultures (78 cultures) were filtered into a Dynadepth test card with the Bac-T-Screen instrument (Vitek, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.). Triton X- 100 was then filtered into the test card to lyse the blood cells but not the entrapped bacteria, and either methylumbelliferone-labeled substrates or oxidase reagent was applied to the filter surface. The oxidase test was read within 30 s, and the methylumbelliferone and indole tests were read after a 10 -min incubation at room temperature.

40|$|Degradation of indole by an indole {{degrading}} methanogenic consortium enriched from {{sewage sludge}} proceeded through a two step hydroxylation pathway yielding oxindole and isatin. The ability of this consortium to hydroxylate and subsequently degrade substituted indoles was investigated. Of the substituted <b>indoles</b> <b>tested,</b> the consortium {{was able to}} transform or degrade 3 methylindole and 3 indolyl acetate. Oxindole, 3 methyloxindole, and indoxyl were identified as degradation metabolites of indole, 3 methylindole, and 3 indolyl acetate, respectively. Isatin (indole 2, 3 dione) was produced as an intermediate when the consortium was amended with oxindole, which provided the evidence that degradation of indole proceeded through successive hydroxylation of the 2 and 3 positions prior to ring cleavage between the C 2 and C 3 atoms on the pyrrole ring of indole. The presence of a methyl group (CH 3) at either the 1 or 2 position of indole inhibited the initial hydroxylation reaction. The substituted indole, 3 methylindole, was hydroxylated at the 2 position {{but not at the}} 3 position and could not be further metabolized through the oxindole isatin pathway. Indoxyl (indole 3 one), the deacetylated product of 3 indolyl acetate, was not hydroxylated at the 2 position and thus was not further metabolized by the consortium. When an H atom or electron donating group (i. e., CH 3) was present at the 3 position, hydroxylation proceeded at the 2 position, but the presence of electron withdrawing substituent groups (i. e., OH or COOH) at the 3 position inhibited hydroxylation...|$|R
