5|$|Local {{historic}} districts usually {{enjoy the}} greatest {{level of protection}} legally from any threats that may compromise their historic integrity because many land-use <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> made at the local level. There are more than 2,300 local historic districts in the United States. Local historic districts can be administered at the county or the municipal level; both entities are involved in land use decisions.|$|E
50|$|The Rent Officer <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> {{the maximum}} that the Council {{can pay for}} Reference Rent cases, for cases that are treated under the Pre 1996 rules, the figure is used to decide how much the DWP awards the Local Authority in subsidy and is purely indicative. This <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> made annually, {{although}} the Local Council may be late in making the application. If the <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> higher the effective date of the increase will be the Monday of {{the week of the}} referral; if the <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> lower, the effective date is the Monday after the new <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> received by the Local Council. This is to avoid overpayments arising {{as a result of the}} Rent Service decision. If the <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> lower, any overpayment is LA Error and may only be recovered if it is reasonable to expect that the claimant knew that the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> going to be lower.|$|R

5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the European Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. These frequently hold pre-meetings of their European Council members, prior to its meetings. However, the European Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> generally made on these lines, though ideological alignment can colour their political agreements and their choice of appointments (such as their president).|$|E
5|$|Because {{judicial}} <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> {{subject to}} the sometimes arbitrary assessments of the CCP, citizens who attempt {{to make use of}} the legal system to pursue grievances find that, if their cause is determined to have the potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, they may be suppressed. Defendants who find themselves facing criminal charges, such as for conducting activism or for their religious beliefs, often have few means of pursuing an effective defense.|$|E

5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> within {{the jurisdiction of}} the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
5|$|Government {{meetings}} are public; however, {{the government may}} decide to close any part of its sessions (or entire sessions) to the public. The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> reached by a simple majority vote; a two-thirds majority vote is required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to supranational organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a referendum.|$|E
5|$|In the Common Pleas, Blackstone {{operated}} under a civil jurisdiction {{rather than a}} mixed civil and criminal one. This played to his strengths, {{and many of his}} <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> considered farsighted; the principle in Blaney v Hendricks, for example, that interest is due on an account where money was lent, which anticipated Section 3 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934. Blackstone's decision in Goldswain's Case was later repeated by Lord Denning in Falmouth Boat Construction Co v Howell in 1950.|$|E

5|$|Its <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> made by {{qualified}} majority voting in most areas, unanimity in others, or just simple majority for procedural issues. Usually where it operates unanimously, it only needs {{to consult the}} Parliament. However, in most areas the ordinary legislative procedure applies meaning both Council and Parliament share legislative and budgetary powers equally, meaning both have to agree for a proposal to pass. In a few limited areas the Council may initiate new EU law itself.|$|E
5|$|Like any alliance, NATO is {{ultimately}} governed by its 29 member states. However, the North Atlantic Treaty and other agreements outline how <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> {{to be made}} within NATO. Each of the 29 members sends a delegation or mission to NATO's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. The senior permanent member of each delegation {{is known as the}} Permanent Representative and is generally a senior civil servant or an experienced ambassador (and holding that diplomatic rank). Several countries have diplomatic missions to NATO through embassies in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's {{court system}} has three levels. Most cases {{start in the}} {{district}} courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction. There are 279 district court judgeships in ten judicial districts. Appeals from the trial courts and challenges to certain governmental <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> heard by the Minnesota Court of Appeals, consisting of nineteen judges who typically sit in three-judge panels. The seven-justice Minnesota Supreme Court hears all appeals from the tax court, the workers' compensation court of appeals, first-degree murder convictions, and discretionary appeals from the court of appeals; it also has original jurisdiction over election disputes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{court also}} {{elaborated}} {{on the meaning}} of [...] "gender playing a motivating part in an employment decision", saying that it meant that if, at the moment the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> made, {{one of the reasons for}} making the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> that the applicant or employee was a woman, then that <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> motivated by gender discrimination. This definition includes stereotypes based on sex, which previous definitions had not.|$|R

In April 2012, in a similar attempt, the Bertelsmann Stiftung presented a blueprint for establishing an international non-profit credit rating agency (INCRA) for sovereign debt, structured in way that management and rating <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> independent from its financiers.|$|E
5|$|Players control {{one of two}} diamond trading companies: the eponymous Diamond Trust of London or {{an unnamed}} Antwerp-based competitor. The game is set in 2000 and {{the aim is to}} extract {{diamonds}} from Angola before the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme is put in place. The winner is the one who finishes the game with the most diamonds after nine turns. Each turn, players decide where to send their three agents. They can be sent to six different Angolan regions to extract diamonds, or recalled to the player's headquarters to deposit extracted diamonds. Players make decisions in secret, and both sets of <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> resolved on the game board simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Since 2004, Shepton Mallet's {{town centre}} {{buildings}} {{have benefited from}} two conservation schemes, the Heritage Economic Regeneration Scheme and the Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme, which provided grants for the repair of buildings, reinstatement of architectural features and enhancement of public spaces, as well as community involvement, education and training. As the body which made the bid for the funding, Mendip District Council has administrated both schemes, but all <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> made by a steering group comprising the main stakeholders in the town.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept has}} most often {{been found to}} be {{relevant}} when it is legally significant that a <b>decision</b> <b>be</b> made regarding a circumstance within a specific time period. If intent regarding the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> not established prior to the deadline, but actions or events that occur after the expiration of the time period clarify the circumstances, the doctrine of breira would allow one to proceed as though the <b>decision</b> had <b>been</b> made in a timely manner. It has typically found to be inapplicable when the time to make the <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> infinite or indefinite.|$|R
5000|$|Reasonableness is {{the more}} deferential {{standard}} that a court can give to an ADM.

In other words, it is unreasonable where [...] "there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived." ...|$|R
50|$|The referee {{having made}} a <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> {{required}} {{to indicate the}} decision by blowing the whistle and signalling. Primary signals relate to what <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> being awarded. For example, whether a scrum or penalty is awarded. Secondary signals relate to why the <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> being awarded. For example, a knock-on (scrum) or a high tackle (penalty).There are also signals for stoppages in time, replacement and scoring to ensure everyone knows what is happening.|$|R
5|$|The Brewers {{have used}} 28 {{different}} Opening Day starting pitchers in their 47seasons. The 28starters have a combined Opening Day record of 15wins, 17losses and 15no decisions. No <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> only {{awarded to the}} starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game or if the starting pitcher pitches fewer than five innings.

5|$|The Supreme Court, {{reversing}} the Fifth Circuit, {{held that the}} NLRB decision was appropriate because its interpretation of the NLRA was permissible. The Court explained that the NLRB is entrusted with the responsibility to adapt the NLRA to changing times and {{that as a result}} courts reviewing its decisions only have the authority to reject its interpretations of the NLRA if those <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> impermissible under it. This also led to the Court's observation that the NLRB can change its interpretation of the NLRA over time and is not required to comply with its earlier decisions.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. federal {{government}} designates historic districts through the United States Department of Interior {{under the auspices}} of the National Park Service. Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but listing usually imposes no restrictions on what property owners may do with a designated property. State-level historic districts may follow similar criteria (no restrictions) or may require adherence to certain historic rehabilitation standards. Local historic district designation offers, by far, the most legal protection for historic properties because most land use <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> made at the local level. Local districts are generally administered by the county or municipal government.|$|E
