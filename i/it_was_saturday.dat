25|$|On October 26 at 6:00pm EDT, the State Department started {{receiving}} {{a message that}} appeared to be written personally by Khrushchev. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday</b> at 2:00am in Moscow.

25|$|At the {{distance}} of a gun-shot from the dune behind which these preparations were in progress, Menéndez had drawn {{a line in the}} sand with his spear, across the path they were to follow. Then he ordered the captain of the vanguard which escorted the prisoners that on reaching the place indicated by the line he was to cut off the heads of all of them; he also commanded the captain of the rearguard to do the same. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday,</b> September 29, the feast of St. Michael; the sun had already set when the Frenchmen reached the mark drawn in the sand near the banks of the lagoon, and the orders of the Spanish admiral were executed. That same night Menéndez returned to St. Augustine, which he reached at dawn.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday</b> night, so the bar parlour of the Ram Inn {{was fairly}} full.|$|E
60|$|Ursula {{was beside}} herself. She could not endure till the Saturday came, her {{thoughts}} burned {{up like a}} fire. If only <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>Saturday,</b> if only <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>Saturday.</b>|$|R

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>Saturday</b> night, and the {{particular}} vessel over which we hover is the Lively Poll. Let us descend into her cabin.|$|R
60|$|If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>Saturday,</b> and a holiday, {{you will}} be out again this afternoon, {{with some of the}} other boys, perhaps, and have a grand hunt.|$|R
60|$|I {{remembered that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday.</b> Perhaps Mariposilla {{had gone to}} the old church for confession. Arturo had the pony, and for a moment I was in despair.|$|E
60|$|It {{was just}} after dinner, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday</b> afternoon, when Miss Annie {{announced}} {{that she was going}} to see old Aunt Patsy, whom she had somewhat neglected of late.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday</b> night, {{the seventh}} day of April, {{nineteen}} hundred and six--a night never to be forgotten by those aboard the ship; a night which has its place in history.|$|E
6000|$|... "Such is {{precisely}} the case," [...] returned Eeldrop, [...] "but I had not thought it necessary to mention this biographical detail. As <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>Saturday</b> night, I shall return to my suburb. Tomorrow will be spent in that garden...." ...|$|R

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>Saturday</b> {{night in}} Los Angeles and six {{teenagers}} are {{in search of}} the hottest rave in the city.

6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday</b> afternoon: {{the day was}} fine, and mamma {{told them}} they could go for a holiday frolic in the woods. [...] "Don't go to the pond, and be home early," [...] she said.|$|E
60|$|How d'you do, Mrs. Kent? I've {{been having}} an early lunch at Richmond, and I thought I'd just {{drop in on}} my way back. As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday</b> {{afternoon}} I thought I might find you.|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{was quite}} {{surprised}} to find that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday.</b> In fact, in travelling on the Rhine, as there is so little to mark or distinguish one day from another, we almost always soon lose our reckoning.|$|E

60|$|I think myself <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>Saturday.</b> B. says <b>it</b> <b>is</b> only Friday; but I am {{positive}} I {{have had}} three cold baths since we left Ober-Ammergau, {{which we did}} on Wednesday morning. If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> only Friday, then I have had two morning baths in one day. Anyhow, we shall know to-morrow by the shops being open or shut.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> one <b>Saturday</b> afternoon. I {{had just}} {{returned}} from the matinee.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday</b> and Peter {{had gone}} home; Felix and Dan were helping Uncle Alec top turnips; Cecily and Felicity were making cookies for Sunday, so the Story Girl and I {{were alone in}} Uncle Stephen's Walk.|$|E
60|$|So I {{went on a}} steamer {{down the}} long lake, {{surrounded}} by low grey hills. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday</b> afternoon. A thin rain came on. I thought I would rather be in fiery Hell than in this dead level of average life.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday</b> night, and {{the boss}} laid twelve begrimed and begrudged dollars in his hand. Ikey dabbled discreetly in water, donned coat, hat and collar with its frazzled tie and {{chalcedony}} pin, and {{set forth in}} pursuit of his ideals.|$|E

60|$|If only {{sometimes}} <b>it</b> had <b>been</b> yesterday's <b>it</b> {{would have}} <b>been</b> a change. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> always {{the day before}} yesterday's; except on Tuesday; then <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> <b>Saturday's.</b>|$|R

60|$|I confided all to my aunt when I got home; and {{in spite}} of all she could say to me, went to bed despairing. I got up despairing, and went out despairing. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday</b> morning, and I went {{straight}} to the Commons.|$|E
60|$|Walter felt he {{must not}} dispute the command--a glance at his Uncle would have {{determined}} {{him if he had}} felt otherwise--and disappeared to execute it.

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Saturday</b> night, {{and most}} of the people {{belonging}} to the place where we were going were drinking elsewhere.

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>Saturday</b> {{afternoon}} and four o'clock. The country is wild and uninhabited, the train almost empty, {{yet there is}} the leaving-off-work feeling in the atmosphere. Oh twisty, wooded, steep slopes, oh glimpses of Gennargentu, oh nigger-stripped cork-trees, oh smell of peasants, oh wooden, wearisome railway carriage, we are so sick of you! Nearly seven hours of this journey already: and a distance of sixty miles.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>Saturday.</b> I <b>am</b> striding {{across the}} Common to Park Square, hurrying {{to catch the}} 5:02 train. The trees of the Mall are shaking their heavy tears upon me. Drays thunder afar off. Bells tinkle.--How simple, quiet, almost village-like this city of my vision seems in {{contrast}} with the Boston of today with its diabolic subways, its roaring overhead trains, its electric cars and its streaming automobiles! ...|$|R
