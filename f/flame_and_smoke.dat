500|$|The July 3 {{bombardment}} {{was likely}} {{the largest of}} the war, with hundreds of cannons from both sides firing along the lines for one to two hours, starting around 1 p.m. Confederate guns numbered between 150 and 170 and fired from a line over two miles (3km) long, starting in the south at the Peach Orchard and running roughly parallel to the Emmitsburg Road. Confederate Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law wrote, [...] "The cannonade in the center... presented one of the most magnificent battle-scenes witnessed during the war. Looking up the valley towards Gettysburg, the hills on either side were capped with crowns of <b>flame</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke,</b> as 300 guns, about equally divided between the two ridges, vomited their iron hail upon each other." ...|$|E

Thirty of the cylinders burst on target, enveloping the objective in <b>flame</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> but despite the bombs, German machine-gunners inflicted many casualties, on the depleted 2nd Canterbury and 2nd Otago battalions of the 2nd New Zealand Brigade.

The 2nd Otago attacked from Goose Alley and passed beyond the objective and The Circus, an empty German strong point.

2500|$|The South Africans faced {{experienced}} Italian pilots, {{including a}} cadre of Spanish Civil War veterans. Despite its lack of experience, 1 SAAF claimed 48 enemy aircraft destroyed and 57 damaged in the skies over East Africa. A further 57 were claimed destroyed on the ground; all {{for the loss of}} six pilots—it is thought the unit was guilty of severe over-claiming. From November 1940 to early January 1941, Platt continued to apply constant pressure on the Italians along the Sudan–Ethiopia border with patrols and raids by ground troops and aircraft. Hawker Hurricanes and more Gloster Gladiators began to replace some of the older models. On 6 December, a large concentration of Italian motor transport was bombed and strafed by Commonwealth aircraft a few miles north of Kassala. The same aircraft then proceeded to machine-gun from low level the nearby positions of the Italian Blackshirts and colonial infantry. A few days later, the same aircraft bombed the Italian base at Keru, fifty miles east of Kassala. The Commonwealth pilots had the satisfaction of seeing supply dumps, stores and transport enveloped in <b>flame</b> <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> as they flew away. One morning in mid-December, a force of Italian fighters strafed a Rhodesian landing-strip at Wajir near Kassala, where two Hawker Hardys were caught on the ground and destroyed and [...] of fuel were set alight, four Africans were killed and eleven injured fighting the fire.|$|E
