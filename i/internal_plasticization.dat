40|$|International audienceCopolymers of {{methacrylonitrile}} are reported. Surprisingly, their curing through urethane cross-links {{acts as an}} <b>internal</b> <b>plasticization.</b> This cross-linking prevents any dissolution or leakage, up to 90 °C, {{when the}} networks are swollen by liquid organic electrolytes. These provide high conductivities, {{and the increase in}} resistivity with respect to pure liquid electrolytes remains ≤ 2. The electrochemical investigation shows a clear improvement of stability in reduction as compared to polyacrylonitrile. The first evaluations of lithium insertion in graphite are encouraging...|$|E
40|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>plasticization</b> of {{chitosan}} with covalently linked long aliphatic branches, typically 12 C, {{was accomplished}} through the condensation of the amino groups of chitosan with acidic derivatives of lauric acid, as lauroyl anhydride or lauroyl chloride, {{that are more}} reactive than the fatty acid itself. The chemical pathway led to selective N-acylation. The degree of substitution was quantitatively determined by FTIR and ¹H NMR and varied between 3 and 35 %. The FTIR quantitative analysis was based in a calibration mmethod with good accuracy. The modified chitosan products were soluble in neutral water and/or DMF according {{to the degree of}} substitution. The modified chitosan films were more flexible than the pristine, non-modified ones...|$|E
40|$|Internally {{plasticized}} poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) {{materials are}} investigated via grafting of propargyl ether cardanol (PEC). The chemical {{structure of the}} materials was studied by FT-IR and 1 H NMR. The performace of the obtained internally plasticized PVC materials was also investigated with TGA, DSC and leaching tests. The results showed that grafting of propargyl ether cardanol (PEC) on PVC increased the free volume and distance of PVC chains, which efficiently decreased the glass transition temperature (Tg). No migration {{was found in the}} leaching tests for internally plasticized PVC films compared with plasticized PVC materials with commercial plasticizer dioctyl phthalate (DOP). The <b>internal</b> <b>plasticization</b> mechanism was also disscussed according to lubrication theory and free volume theory. This work provides a meaningful strategy for designing no-migration PVC materials by introducing cardanol groups as branched chains...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{use of the}} {{microbond}} test as a {{tool for}} the characterization of the thermo-hydrolytic resistance of interfacial zones is critically discussed for polyepoxide based composites materials. It is shown that the differences of properties observed between macroscopic and microscopic scales can induce a difference in aging conditions. The energy release rate vs. time of exposure at 60 °C and 98 % RH is reported for epoxyde–amine and epoxyde–anhydride/glass fiber systems. The evolution of the energy release rate is interpreted in terms of different degradation mechanisms: release of <b>internal</b> stresses and <b>plasticization</b> for the short term behavior of both systems, while interfacial hydrolysis is advanced for the long term behavior of the epoxyde–anhydride/glass fiber system. This latter chemical degradation is attributed to the presence of hydrolysis sensitive functional groups in the interphase resulting from the reaction between the anhydride co-monomer and the organosilane coupling agent. Trends for the design of thermo-hydrolytic resistant interphase are given on this basis...|$|R
30|$|We {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between corona structure and properties of solvent-free Fe 3 O 4 nanofluids. We proposed a series of corona structures with different branched chains and synthesize different solvent-free nanofluids {{in order to show}} the effect of corona structure on the phase behavior, dispersion, as well as rheology properties. Results demonstrate novel liquid-like behaviors without solvent at room temperature. Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles content is bigger than 8 % and its size is about 2 ∼ 3 nm. For the solvent-free nanofluids, the long chain corona has the <b>internal</b> <b>plasticization,</b> which can decrease the loss modulus of system, while the short chain of corona results in the high viscosity of nanofluids. Long alkyl chains of modifiers lead to lower viscosity and better flowability of nanofluids. The rheology and viscosity of the nanofluids are correlated to the microscopic structure of the corona, which provide an in-depth insight into the preparing nanofluids with promising applications based on their tunable and controllable physical properties.|$|E
40|$|Matrix glass {{transition}} temperature depression through <b>internal</b> <b>plasticization</b> of a styrene-sodium methacrylate ionomer resulted in enhanced clustering at low plasticization levels (up to ca. 20 mole%). At higher plasticization levels, ion aggregation was strongly disrupted. Matrix polarity effects were studied by nitrating the styrene units of the same ionomer. A sample with a relaxed dielectric constant comparable to acrylate polymers showed no decrease in clustering. Similarly, plasticization with nitrobenzene resulted in typical nonpolar diluent behavior. Polarity was, therefore, not a significant parameter affecting ion aggregation. New styrene copolymers with substituents R = $-$(CH$ sb 2 $) $ sb{ rm n}$COOMe (n = 1, 5, 10) or R = $-$O(CH$ sb 2 $) $ sb{ rm n}$COOMe (n = 1, 4, 10) in the para- position were synthesized, to form a systematic investigation of ionic group spacing effects on the dynamic mechanical properties of ionomers. The results were rationalized in terms of bulkiness and rigidity of the units supporting the ionic groups, and polymer backbone immobilization efficiency. Ion solvation effects were also suggested for the ether derivatives...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe {{control of}} the glass {{transition}} temperature (Tg) in functionalized polymers is crucial formaterials engineering and pharmaceutical applications. Tailoring must overcome experimental and theoretical issues regarding the thermodynamical phenomena involved. In this work, we study the glass transition of poly(monoitaconate) s and poly(diitaconate) s systems functionalized by <b>internal</b> <b>plasticization.</b> Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Raman spectroscopy are used to determine Tg, whereas thermal degradation analysis (TGA) is used to determinate the temperature limit where conformers relax independently, defined as T* in the Adams– Gibbs model. Our {{results show that the}} values of Tg obtained through DSC and Raman are consistent and that TGA can be used to estimate a lower bound limit for T*. We mainly conclude that a larger steric hindrance between the carboxylic group in the side chain and the backbone increases Tg and decreases the variation of specific heat and configurational entropy at different domain regions. Similar behavior is observed when chlorine atoms are substituted in the phenethyl groups. Fondecyt grants 3110149 and 1112163...|$|E
40|$|Structure and {{dynamics}} of two microphase-separated norbornene block copolymers containing one comb-like component are investigated by X-ray scattering, relaxation spectroscopy {{as well as}} differential scanning calorimetry. It is shown that two self-assembling processes on different length scales coexist for these copolymers leading to hierarchically structured systems. Microphase separation of both block copolymer components appears {{on a scale of}} 20 - 25 nm while norbornene main and long semifluorinated side chains of the comb-like block nanophase separate within their domains on a scale of about 3 nm. This hierarchical structure is accompanied by a complex relaxation behavior which is characterized by two glass transitions. The glass temperature of the block with long bulky side chains is expectedly lower due to <b>internal</b> <b>plasticization.</b> An additional relaxation process showing typical features of a dynamic glass transition is related to an independent dynamics in small na nodomains formed by long aggregated side chains similar to the findings for many other comb-like polymers. Indications for the disappearance of the nanophase separation of main and semifluorinated side chains at high temperatures are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Superior {{plasticization}} efficiency {{was achieved}} by a grafting from functionalization of the PVC backbone. This was deduced to a synergistic effect of <b>internal</b> <b>plasticization</b> and improved intermolecular interactions between PVC and an oligomeric poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) plasticizer. A mild grafting process for functionalization of the PVC chain by crotonic acid (CA) or acrylic acid (AA) was used. The formation of PVC-g-CA and PVC-g-AA was confirmed by FTIR and 1 H NMR. Grafting with the seemingly similar monomers, CA and AA, resulted in different macromolecular structures. AA is easily homopolymerized and long hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) grafts are formed resulting in branched materials. Crotonic acid does not easily homopolymerize; instead, single crotonic acid units are located along the PVC chain, leading to basically linear PVC chains with pendant crotonic acid groups. The elongation of PVC-g-CA and PVC-g-AA in comparison to pure PVC were greatly increased from 6 % to 128 % and 167 %, respectively, by the grafting reactions. Blending 20 % (w/w) PBSA with PVC, PVC-AA or PVC-CA further increased the elongation at break to 150 %, 240 % and 320 %, respectively, clearly showing a significant synergistic effect in the blends with functionalized PVC. This is a clearly promising milestone towards environmentally friendly flexible PVC materials...|$|E
40|$|Thermooxidative {{degradation}} of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is inevitable during processing of PVC. Recycling of this polymer requires reprocessing {{in most of}} the cases, and due to the low thermal stability of PVC, it is of paramount importance to reveal the effect of thermooxidation on the thermal stability of this commercially important polymer. However, detailed systematic investigations are lacking on this crucial problem. In this study, the thermal behavior of PVCs thermooxidized in dilute dioctyl phthalate (DOP) (di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, DEHP) plasticizer was investigated by DSC, thermal gravimetry and isothermal degradation under inert atmosphere. It was found that thermooxidation leads to PVCs with certain extent of <b>internal</b> <b>plasticization</b> by DOP chemically bound to the PVC chains and by the oxidized chain segments as well. Thermogravimetry and isothermal dehydrochlorination under inert atmosphere revealed that even low extent of thermooxidation of PVC (0. 4 mol% of HCl loss in 30 minutes at 200 °C) leads to dramatically decreased thermal stability of this polymer with 50 - 60 oC lower onset decomposition temperature than that of the virgin resin. This unexpected finding means that {{at least part of the}} oxidized moieties formed during oxidation of the PVC chains acts as initiators for thermal dehydrochlorination at relatively low temperatures, resulting in significant decrease of the thermal stability of the polymer. These striking results also indicate that the decreased thermal stability caused by thermooxidation in the course of the primary processing of this polymer should be taken into account in order to efficiently stabilize PVC products for reprocessing and recycling...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the potential use of two PEGylated derivatives of rosin (PD) as sustained release film forming materials. The derivatives differed chemically by their acid numbers—PD- 1 with 120. 93 and PD- 2 with 88. 19. The derivative films were characterized for surface morphology, water uptake-weight loss, angle of contact, water vapor transmission rate, mechanical properties and permeability study. Dissolution of diclofenac sodium (DS) and propranolol hydrochloride (PHL) as model drugs was studied from coated pellets. The films of derivatives with and without plasticizers were smooth and continuous. PD- 2 films developed greater numbers of pores when in contact with phosphate buffer pH  6. 8. The low weight loss, low angles of contact and high water vapor transmission rate of PD- 2 films were related to presence of higher concentration of PEG esters. Higher tensile strength and percent elongation of PD- 2 films was due to greater degree of <b>internal</b> <b>plasticization</b> of the derivative. The permeability of films to model drugs propranolol hydrochloride and diclofenac sodium was inversely proportional to the film thickness and dibutyl phthalate concentration in them; the permeability being greatest in PD- 2 films containing 10 % PEG 200. Dissolution rate of propranolol hydrochloride was higher from the coated pellets. The dissolution data followed zero order, Baker–Lonsdale equation and Hixon–Crowell equation of release kinetics with high correlation coefficients. The mechanism of drug release from these coated systems however followed class II transport (n[*]>[*] 1. 0). The derivatives investigated could successfully retard release of the model drugs and offers an alternative to the conventionally used polymers...|$|E
