500|$|The first {{civilian}} {{aircraft was}} a Douglas DC-4 operated by Braathens SAFE, which landed with some journalists on board on 29 October 1961. Other early aircraft operating to Jan Mayen were the Grumman HU-16 Albatross and the Douglas DC-6. The head {{officer of the}} Norwegian military's communications division was later criticized by Chief of Defence Bjarne Øen, who concluded: [...] "Gentlemen, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any construction of airports on Norwegian soil by the Communications Division without the plans being presented to the Central Command." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the Nazis were {{suspicious}} of {{the chairman of the}} local Olympic organizing committee, Theodor Lewald, as he had a Jewish grandmother, they quickly saw the propaganda potential in hosting the Olympic Games. Lewald had intended to stage the Games on a shoestring budget; instead, the resources of the Reich were thrown behind the effort. As the Nazi hatred of the Jews manifested itself in persecution, there were calls to move the Olympics from Germany, or alternatively, to boycott the Games. As head of the Olympic movement in the US, Brundage received many letters and telegrams urging action. In 1933 and 1934, the IOC worked to assure that, consistent with Olympic ideals, the Games would be open to all, and {{that there would be no}} discrimination because of race or religion. IOC President Comte Henri de Baillet-Latour wrote to Brundage in 1933, [...] "I am not personally fond of jews [...] and of the jewish [...] influence, but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> them molested in no way [...] whatsoever." [...] According to historical writer Christopher Hilton in his account of the 1936 Games, [...] "Baillet-Latour, and the great and good around him, had no idea what was coming, and if the [...] German delegates kept offering assurances, what else could they do but accept them?" [...] Baillet-Latour opposed boycotting the Games, as did Brundage (who had learned in 1933 that he was being considered for IOC membership).|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} birth, Maria Eleonora {{was in no}} {{condition}} to be told {{the truth about the}} baby's sex, and the king and court waited several days before breaking the news to her. She screamed: [...] "Instead of a son, I am given a daughter, dark and ugly, with a great nose and black eyes. Take her from me, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> such a monster!"

2500|$|Bikram teacher Sarah Baughn filed {{a sexual}} {{harassment}} suit in March (just before Jafa-Bodden was fired), and two other unnamed women filed similar suits accusing Choudhury of sexual harassment, intimidation and rape in May. [...] Shea Law Offices and Shegerian & Associates, the attorneys representing Baughn, now represent {{a total of six}} women claiming Bikram sexually assaulted and/or raped them. [...] In an April, 2015 CNN interview with Baughn and Bikram, Bikram spoke {{out for the first time}} denying the allegations. [...] Bikram went on to say [...] "I have no intention to have sex with any of my students or any women...Sometimes students, they commit suicide. Lots of students of mine, they commit suicide because <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> sex with them".|$|E
2500|$|Wolfe has {{an aversion}} to {{physical}} contact, even shaking hands. Early in the first novel Archie explains why there is a gong under his bed that will ring upon any intrusion into or near Wolfe's own bedroom: [...] "Wolfe told me once ... that he really had no cowardice in him, he only had an intense distaste for being touched by anyone …" [...] When Jerome Berin, creator of saucisse minuit, repeatedly taps Wolfe on the knee, Archie grins at [...] "Wolfe, who didn't like being touched, concealing his squirm {{for the sake of}} sausages." [...] In Prisoner's Base, Wolfe speaks coldly as he tells the DA and Inspector Cramer that the despised Lieutenant Rowcliff [...] "put a hand on me. ... <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a hand put on me, gentlemen. I like no man's hand on me, and one such as Mr. Rowcliff's, unmerited, I will not have." [...] Wolfe's prejudices make it all the more surprising when, in [...] "Cordially Invited to Meet Death", Archie finds Wolfe in the kitchen with a woman who has solved the problem of preparing corned beef: [...] "Standing beside him, closer to him than I had ever seen any woman or girl of any age tolerated, with her hand slipped between his arm and his bulk, was Maryella." ...|$|E
