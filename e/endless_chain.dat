Descartes {{had a more}} ambitious agenda, however, which was geared toward replacing the Scholastic philosophical tradition altogether.

(Notably, he reserved human thought and God from his scheme, holding these to be separate from the physical universe). In proposing this philosophical framework, Descartes supposed that different kinds of motion, {{such as that of}} planets versus that of terrestrial objects, were not fundamentally different, but were merely different manifestations of an <b>endless</b> <b>chain</b> of corpuscular motions obeying universal principles. Particularly influential were his explanations for circular astronomical motions in terms of the vortex motion of corpuscles in space (Descartes argued, in accord with the beliefs, if not the methods, of the Scholastics, that a vacuum could not exist), and his explanation of gravity in terms of corpuscles pushing objects downward.|$|E
