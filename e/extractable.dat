5|$|The Earth's {{crust is}} made of {{approximately}} 5% of heavy metals by weight, with iron comprising 95% of this quantity. Light metals (~20%) and nonmetals (~75%) make up the other 95% of the crust. Despite their overall scarcity, heavy metals can become concentrated in economically <b>extractable</b> quantities {{as a result of}} mountain building, erosion, or other geological processes.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{has some}} {{potential}} for the onshore production of oil and gas. Shale gas may be obtained by fracking and there is methane in unmined coal seams that may be <b>extractable.</b> Another potential source of gas is the underground controlled combustion of coal seams to produce syngas, a mixture of hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide.|$|E
5|$|Different {{estimates}} exist of {{the amounts}} of indium contained within the ores of other metals. However, these amounts are not <b>extractable</b> without mining of the host materials (see Production and availability). Thus, the availability of indium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} these ores are extracted, and not their absolute amount. This is an aspect that is often forgotten in the current debate, e.g. by the Graedel group at Yale in their criticality assessments, explaining the paradoxically low depletion times some studies cite.|$|E
5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} {{that more than}} 1 million tons of gallium is contained in known reserves of bauxite and zinc ores. Some coal flue dusts contain small quantities of gallium, typically less than 1% by weight. However, these amounts are not <b>extractable</b> without mining of the host materials (see below). Thus, the availability of gallium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} bauxite, zinc ores (and coal) are extracted.|$|E
5|$|About 118tonnes of {{germanium}} {{was produced}} in 2011 worldwide, mostly in China (80 t), Russia (5 t) and United States (3 t). Germanium is recovered as a by-product from sphalerite zinc ores where it is concentrated in amounts as great as 0.3%, especially from low-temperature sediment-hosted, massive Zn–Pb–Cu(–Ba) deposits and carbonate-hosted Zn–Pb deposits. A {{recent study found that}} at least 10,000 t of <b>extractable</b> germanium is contained in known zinc reserves, particularly those hosted by Mississippi-Valley type deposits, while at least 112,000 t will be found in coal reserves. In 2007 35% of the demand was met by recycled germanium.|$|E
5|$|During the {{processing}} of bauxite to alumina in the Bayer process, gallium accumulates in the sodium hydroxide liquor. From this it can be extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent is the use of ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is <b>extractable.</b> The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.|$|E
5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically <b>extractable</b> from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E

25|$|Bromelain {{is present}} {{in all parts of}} the {{pineapple}} plant (Ananas sp.), but the stem is the most common commercial source, presumably because usable quantities are readily <b>extractable</b> after the fruit has been harvested.|$|E
25|$|A {{deposit of}} uranium, {{discovered}} by geophysical techniques, is evaluated and sampled {{to determine the}} amounts of uranium materials that are <b>extractable</b> at specified costs from the deposit.

25|$|Historically, the Samland coast west of Königsberg in Prussia was the world's leading {{source of}} amber. The first {{mentions}} of amber deposits here {{date back to}} the 12th century. About 90% of the world's <b>extractable</b> amber is still located in that area, which became the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia in 1946.|$|E
25|$|Petroleum geologists {{study the}} {{locations}} of the subsurface of the Earth which can contain <b>extractable</b> hydrocarbons, especially petroleum and natural gas. Because many of these reservoirs are found in sedimentary basins, they study the formation of these basins, as well as their sedimentary and tectonic evolution and the present-day positions of the rock units.|$|E
25|$|Further inefficiencies, such as gearbox losses, {{generator}} and converter losses, {{reduce the}} power delivered by a wind turbine. To protect components from undue wear, extracted power is held constant above the rated operating speed as theoretical power increases at the cube of wind speed, further reducing theoretical efficiency. In 2001, commercial utility-connected turbines deliver 75% to 80% of the Betz limit of power <b>extractable</b> from the wind, at rated operating speed.|$|E
25|$|Diamonds {{also helped}} to arm the Revolutionary United Front rebels. The RUF used funds {{harvested}} from the alluvial diamond mines to purchase weapons and ammunition from neighboring Guinea, Liberia, and even SLA soldiers. But {{the most significant}} connection between diamonds and war is {{that the presence of}} easily <b>extractable</b> diamonds provided an incentive for violence. To maintain control of important mining districts like Kono, thousands of civilians were expelled and kept away from these important economic centers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Extractable</b> nuclear antigens (ENA) are a {{group of}} autoantigens that were {{originally}} identified as antibody targets in people with autoimmune disorders. They are termed ENA {{because they can be}} extracted from the cell nucleus with saline. The ENAs consist of ribonucleoproteins and non-histone proteins, named by either the name of the donor who provided the prototype serum (Sm, Ro, La, Jo), or the name of the disease setting in which the antibodies were found (SS-A, SS-B, Scl-70).|$|E
25|$|Metallocene {{polyethylene}} (PE-M) {{is prepared}} {{by means of}} metallocene catalysts, usually including copolymers (z. B. ethene / hexene). Metallocene polyethylene has a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution, exceptionally high toughness, excellent optical properties and a uniform comonomer content. Because of the narrow molecular weight distribution it behaves less pseudoplastic (especially under larger shear rates). Metallocene polyethylene has a low proportion of low molecular weight (<b>extractable)</b> components and a low welding and sealing temperature. Thus, it is particularly suitable for the food industry.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged that source-observer effects are the dominant {{source of the}} observed diurnal variations, but there remains considerable controversy about {{the degree to which}} day-night signatures are present in the data. Part of this controversy {{stems from the fact that}} the Schumann resonance parameters <b>extractable</b> from observations provide only a limited amount of information about the coupled lightning source-ionospheric system geometry. The problem of inverting observations to simultaneously infer both the lightning source function and ionospheric structure is therefore extremely underdetermined, leading to the possibility of non-unique interpretations.|$|E
25|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change {{found that}} all future carbon dioxide {{emissions}} must be less than 1,000 gigatonnes to provide a 66% chance of avoiding dangerous climate change; this figure includes all sources of carbon emissions. To avoid dangerous climate change, only 33% of known <b>extractable</b> fossil fuel of known reserves can be used; this carbon budget can also be depleted {{by an increase in}} other carbon emission sources such as deforestation and cement production. It is claimed that, if other carbon emissions increase significantly, then only 10% of the fossil fuel reserves can be used to stay within projected safe limits.|$|E
25|$|It was in {{the local}} context of {{gravitational}} collapse that the contribution of Penrose was most decisive, starting with his 1969 cosmic censorship conjecture, {{to the effect that}} any ensuing singularities would be confined within a well-behaved event horizon surrounding a hidden space-time region for which Wheeler coined the term black hole, leaving a visible exterior region with strong but finite curvature, from which some of the gravitational energy may be <b>extractable</b> by {{what is known as the}} Penrose process, while accretion of surrounding matter may release further energy that can account for astrophysical phenomena such as quasars.|$|E
25|$|One {{political}} theory, {{pioneered by}} American economist Mancur Olson, posits that warlords can function as stationary bandits. In some African states warlord politics {{can be a}} product of endowment-rich, <b>extractable</b> resources. Some nations, including Liberia and Sierra Leone, have had stationary bandits who use extraction of resources such as diamonds, cobalt and timber {{in order to increase}} their political power. They often enforce their right to these resources by claiming to be protecting the people. These warlords, or stationary bandits, often partner with compliant foreign firms and create symbiotic relationships to yield greater power for the warlords and a source of wealth for external firms. The result is a political system in which a dominant coalition of warlords strips and distributes valuable assets in exchange for bureaucratic services and security from foreign firms.|$|E
500|$|The {{total amount}} of {{economically}} <b>extractable</b> power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources. Axel Kleidon of the Max Planck Institute in Germany, carried out a [...] "top down" [...] calculation on how much wind energy there is, starting with the incoming solar radiation that drives the winds by creating temperature differences in the atmosphere. He concluded that somewhere between 18 TW and 68 TW could be extracted.|$|E
500|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} gallium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of bauxite, sulfidic zinc ores (and coal) extracted per year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically <b>extractable</b> from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of gallium at a minimum of 2,100 t/yr from bauxite, 85 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores, and potentially 590 t/yr from coal [...] These figures are significantly greater than current production (375 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of gallium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average gallium price in 2015 was $US317/kg, down from $US688/kg in 2011.|$|E
500|$|This {{prompted}} {{further exploration}} of the chemical behavior of complexes of dubnium. Thousands of repetitive chromatographic experiments were performed jointly in various labs between 1988 and 1993. All group 5 elements and protactinium were extracted from concentrated hydrochloric acid; at lower concentrations of hydrogen chloride, small amounts of hydrogen fluoride were added to start selective re-extraction. Dubnium showed a behavior {{different from that of}} tantalum at concentrations of hydrogen chloride below 12 moles, following the behavior of niobium and the pseudohomolog protactinium. Because of this similarity to these two elements, the research suggested that the formed complex was either [...] or [...] After extraction experiments of dubnium from hydrogen bromide into diisobutyl carbinol (2,6-dimethylheptan-4-ol), a specific extractant for protactinium, with subsequent elutions with the hydrogen chloride/hydrogen fluoride mix as well as hydrogen chloride, dubnium was found to be less prone to extraction than both protactinium and niobium. It was explained as an increasing tendency to form non‐extractable complexes of multiple negative charges. Further experiments in 1992 confirmed the stability of the +5 state: Db(V) was shown to be <b>extractable</b> from cation‐exchange columns with α‐hydroxyisobutyrate, similarly to other group 5 elements and protactinium; Db(III) and Db(IV) were not. In 1998 and 1999, new predictions suggested dubnium would extract nearly as well as niobium and better than tantalum from halide solutions, which was later confirmed.|$|E
500|$|In 1678 Clement Clerke {{introduced}} the coal-powered reverberatory furnace, greatly increasing {{the quantity of}} metal <b>extractable</b> from ore. The Mines Royal Act 1689 ended Crown ownership of Cornwall's mines, allowing private investors and local families to begin mining operations. At the same time, the Nine Years' War (1688–97) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14) caused high demand for metals. As a consequence the Midlands, with easy river and canal access to the coal mines of Wales and northern England and to the metal mines of Cornwall, became a major centre for metallurgy. Ore was shipped from Cornwall up the River Severn to smelters in Gloucestershire where it was refined and sold on to the factories surrounding Birmingham. Financiers and entrepreneurs began investing in and reorganising the mines of Cornwall. With a shortage of manual labour in rural and lightly-populated Cornwall, and with a prevalent belief that {{women and children were}} best suited to ore separation (which required dexterity and good observation skills but {{little in the way of}} physical strength), the large-scale recruitment of women and girls to the mines began. It is around this time that the term [...] "bal maiden" [...] appears to have come into common usage, derived from the Old Cornish [...] (mine). A significant proportion of Cornwall's young women quickly became involved in mining; by 1736 the vicar of Ludgvan was complaining that he was unable to hire servants as the young women of the town were [...] "employed about copper".|$|E

2500|$|Malt extract is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} brewing of beer. Its production begins by germinating barley grain in {{a process known as}} malting, [...] immersing barley in water to encourage the grain to sprout, then drying the barley to halt the progress when the sprouting begins. The drying step stops the sprouting, but the enzymes remain active due to the low temperatures used in base malt production. In one before-and-after comparison, malting decreased barley's <b>extractable</b> starch content by about 7% on a dry matter basis, and turned that portion into various other carbohydrates.|$|E

2500|$|Standing {{in stark}} {{contrast}} to this position is empiricism, the epistemological theory that all knowledge comes from sensory experience.

This viewpoint has a long historical tradition that parallels that of rationalism, beginning with seventeenth century empiricist philosophers such as Locke, Bacon, Hobbes, and, in the following century, Hume. The basic tenet of empiricism is that information in the environment is structured enough that its patterns are both detectable and <b>extractable</b> by domain-general learning mechanisms.
