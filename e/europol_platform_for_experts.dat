ICF is a universal framework introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) to describe and quantify the impact and burden on functioning of health conditions associated with impairment/disability. Methods. A combined effort of the EULAR Scleroderma Clinical Trial and Research and the ICF Research Branch was initiated to develop an ICF language for scleroderma. From our Medline literature review, using the abbreviation and spelled out version of ICF, we assembled approaches and methodological reasoning for steps of core set development. Results. The ICF can be used for patient care and policy-making, as well as the provision of resources, services and funding. The ICF is used on institutional, regional, national and global levels. Several diseases now have ICF Core Sets. Patients with complex rheumatologic diseases will benefit from a disease-specific ICF Core Set and should be included in all stages of development.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} architecture for citizen-expert knowledge exchange in biodiversity management. Expert services, such as taxonomic identification, are required in many biodiversity management activities, yet these services remain inaccessible to poor communities, such as small-scale farmers. The {{aim of this}} research was to combine ontology and crowdsourcing technologies to provide taxonomic services to such communities. The study used a design science research (DSR) approach to develop the conceptual architecture. The DSR approach generates knowledge through building and evaluation of novel artefacts. The research instantiated the architecture through the development of a <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> <b>experts</b> and farmers to share knowledge on fruit flies. The platform is intended to support rural fruit farmers in Kenya with control and management of fruit flies. Expert knowledge about fruit flies is captured in an ontology that is integrated into the platform. The non-expert citizen participation includes harnessing crowdsourcing technologies to assist with organism identification. An evaluation of the architecture was done through an experiment of fruit fly identification using the platform. The results showed that the crowds, supported by an ontology of expert knowledge, could identify most samples to species level and in some cases to sub-family level. The conceptual architecture may guide and enable creation of citizen-expert knowledge exchange applications, which may alleviate the taxonomic impediment, as well as allow poor citizens access to expert knowledge. Such a conceptual architecture may also enable the implementation of systems that allow non-experts to participate in sharing of knowledge, thus providing opportunity for the evolution of comprehensive biodiversity knowledge systems.

Attendance at the meeting included thirty-three participants from Bulgaria, Den-mark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Roma-nia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and; together with representatives from Danish Fishermens Association, Seas at Risk and JRC. The first two days of the workshop were to discuss the process and horizontal re-maining gaps and settle issues, followed immediately by a 3 -day workshop with four parallel sessions drafting recommendations and regional assessments for the four marine regions of MSFD (Baltic Sea, North-east Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea). The workshop was guided by the Chair and by facilitators assigned {{to each of the}} regional seas. One activity of the workshop was to take all commercially exploited fish and shellfish stocks into account under D 3 and evaluate whether sufficient data are available to assess each against the three criteria – level of pressure of the fishing activity (criteri-on 3. 1), and reproductive capacity of the stock (criterion 3. 2). Obtaining an indicator and a reference point for an age structure that fulfills Criteria 3. 3 of Descriptor 3 (COM Dec 2010 / 477 /EU) was found to be challenging. Additionally, some species may have to be considered under D 1 and D 4 and this remains an ongoing discussion.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{business}} processes often ignores detailed consideration of service cost. With competitive market pressure, {{this has become}} a key factor for the service sector. Along with cost, customer satisfaction is a driving force in all organisations these days. In an increasingly competitive marketplace, due to the current emphasis on service throughout the whole economy, businesses must fight to attract and retain their customers. The response time for modification, or reengineering, of existing processes and the creation of new processes is important in the service sector – this is usually required {{in a short period of}} time in order to respond to market and/or customer demand. Thus, there is a requirement for the automation of business process reengineering in order to facilitate this and to minimise response time. In order to address the above, the research carried out during this project involved the design and development of a framework to integrate an activity based cost estimating approach which takes into account probability of resource usage in variable processes, with an automated business process reengineering technique which incorporates an evolutionary computing (genetic algorithms) based optimisation module. Along with this, a novel methodology for detecting risk of negative impact on levels of customer satisfaction without the availability of customer related data has also been developed and integrated with the reengineering technique - cost reduction being the primary objective, but not at the expense of customer satisfaction. The overall aim is to automate the reengineering of business processes to as great an extent as possible in order to save potentially considerable human time and effort. The development of the automated framework also included the creation of a numeric process representation mechanism in order to enable quantitative analysis of complex business processes. The framework is implemented within a prototype software <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> <b>expert</b> validation...|$|R

40|$|Most industrialized {{countries}} {{benefit from a}} high level of both safety and security. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain or to increase this standard even further, given the great challenges the world is facing. Innovative technical solutions such as intelligent sensing systems and sensor networks are required. These hold the promise that hazards and threats can be detected early enough to avoid severe adverse impact, while allowing people to travel freely as well as maintaining free trade and circulation of goods. At the same time, smart factories and intelligent logistics based on cyber-physical systems and the internet of things (IoT), also referred to as Industry 4. 0, pose new challenges with respect to operational safety.

40|$|Abstract:- There is {{a growing}} need for humans to perform complex remote {{operations}} and to extend the intelligence and experience of experts to distant applications. A blending of human intelligence, modern information technology, remote control, and intelligent autonomous systems is required. Telerobotics goes beyond autonomous control in that it blends in human intelligence and action as appropriate. It goes beyond teleoperation in that it incorporates as much autonomy as is possible or reasonable. A new approach for solving {{one of the fundamental}} problems facing teleautonomous systems is discussed: the need to overcome time delays due to telemetry and signal propagation. Optimized maintenance can reduce operating costs by demanding less resources and avoiding equipment breakdown, hence ensuring that daily manufacturing and production will not be interrupted.
