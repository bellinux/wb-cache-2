5|$|One might {{believe that}} sodium or {{potassium}} hydride {{would be the}} ideal base for <b>deprotonating</b> these precursor salts. The hydride should react irreversibly {{with the loss of}} hydrogen to give the desired carbene, with the inorganic by-products and excess hydride being removed by filtration. In practice this reaction is often too slow, requiring the addition of DMSO or t-BuOH. These reagents generate soluble catalysts, which increase the rate of reaction of this heterogeneous system, via the generation of tert-butoxide or dimsyl anion. However, these catalysts have proved ineffective for the preparation of non-imidazolium adducts as they tend to act as nucleophiles towards the precursor salts and in so doing are destroyed. The presence of hydroxide ions as an impurity in the metal hydride could also destroy non-aromatic salts.|$|E

A major fragment ion is observed at m/z 160 ([C 9 H 6 NO 2]−) which, upon collisional activation, mainly eliminates CO 2 indicating that the two oxygen atoms have become bonded to the same carbon. This observation is rationalized in terms of formation of <b>deprotonated</b> 2 -phenyl- 5 -oxazolone. Various pathways to the <b>deprotonated</b> oxazolone have been elucidated through MS 3 experiments. Fragmentation of <b>deprotonated</b> N-acetylalanylalanine gives a relatively weak signal at m/z 112 which, upon collisional activation, fragments, in part, by loss of CO 2 leading {{to the conclusion that}} the m/z 112 ion is <b>deprotonated</b> 2, 4 -dimethyl- 5 -oxazolone...|$|R
