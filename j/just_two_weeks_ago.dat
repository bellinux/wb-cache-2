50|$|The {{terrain is}} 'the London side of Essex', 'theoretical Romford' {{according}} to Leigh. Beverly Moss invites her new neighbours, Angela and Tony, who {{moved into the}} road <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> over for drinks. She has also invited her neighbour Susan (Sue), divorced for three years, whose fifteen-year-old daughter Abigail is holding a party at home. Beverly's husband Laurence comes home late from work, just before the guests arrive. The gathering starts off in a stiff, insensitive, British middle-class way as the virtual strangers tentatively gather, until Beverly and Laurence start sniping at each other. As Beverly serves more drinks and the alcohol takes effect, Beverly flirts more and more overtly with Tony, as Laurence sits impotently by. After a tirade about the artwork 'Wings of Love', Laurence suffers a fatal heart attack. Within this simple framework, all of the obsessions, prejudices, fears and petty competitiveness of the protagonists are ruthlessly exposed.|$|E

40|$|I {{would like}} to begin by sharing my {{gratitude}} to Leonel for being the spark-plug igniting this conversation and the many others that have been taking place all week long in the Cambridge area. 1 His remarkable work in Colombia, {{in the midst of}} what some say is the most violent society in the world, has greatly inspired many of us. Thank you. My first memory of him comes from an international dialogue I co-convened in Cyprus in 2003. He opened with a story, which I {{would like to}} share: <b>Just</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> I was with a very famous guerilla leader in Colombia who has killed many people, I think. We are friends since years ago when I was working in that area. I was kind of challenging him with sweet eyes asking him: ‘What about if, instead of your gun, you start embracing people and feeling the kind of tenderness that your mother taught you? ’ And I remember that he just put his head on my shoulder and was kind of crying. You know, I am saying this because I think we, especially increasingly in church, I would say the Catholic Church, have not been witnesses to tenderness and compassion. (Frontiers of Social Healing Dialogue, 2003, p. 38). I love opening with this remembrance of Leonel for two reasons. First, because for me, it speaks deeply to who he is and to the real heart and substance of his work. And secondly, because my own recent research has been around the question: “How does compassion arise in the process of social healing?”, and his story speaks to that question beautifully. His image of the tender mother is found also in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition where the cultivation of compassion is seen as a process of “thinking like a mother. ” Feminist scholar Sara Ruddick (1989) advocates “maternal practice ” as a means of creating a life-sustaining society contending that it is not confined to women, but is a way o...|$|E
40|$|We have {{received}} inquiries from the European Union, the Council of Europe, and from several individual countries about media reports concerning US conduct {{in the war}} on terror. I am going to respond now to those inquiries, as I depart today for Europe. And this will also essentially form the text of the letter that I will send to Secretary Straw, who wrote on behalf of the European Union as the European Union President. The United States and many other countries are waging a war against terrorism. For our country this war often takes the form of conventional military operations in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. Sometimes this is a political struggle, a war of ideas. It is a struggle waged also by our law enforcement agencies. Often we engage the enemy through the cooperation of our intelligence services with their foreign counterparts. We must track down terrorists who seek refuge in areas where governments cannot take effective action, including where the terrorists cannot in practice be reached by the ordinary processes of law. In such places terrorists have planned the killings of thousands of innocents – in New York City or Nairobi, in Bali or London, in Madrid or Beslan, in Casablanca or Istanbul. <b>Just</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> I also visited a hotel ballroom in Amman, viewing the silent, shattered aftermath of one of those attacks. The United States, and those countries that share the commitment to defend their citizens, will use every lawful weapon to defeat these terrorists. Protecting citizens is the first and oldest duty of any government. Sometimes these efforts are misunderstood. I want to help all of you understand the hard choices involved, and some of the responsibilities that go with them. One of the difficult issues in this new kind of conflict is what to do with captured individuals who we know or believe to be terrorists. The individuals come from many countries and ar...|$|E

Pharr, (706) 542 - 5172, pharr@arches. uga. edu CONTACT: Kellie Casey, (706) 542 - 2739 UGA LAW SCHOOL SENDS TWO MORE ADVOCACY TEAMS TO NATIONAL FINALS ATHENS, Ga. [...] For {{the fourth}} time this season, the University of Georgia School of Law 2 ̆ 7 s {{advocacy}} program has advanced its teams to the final rounds of prestigious national tournaments by capturing the championships in regional competitions. The law school has now secured a berth in the national rounds of two competitions: the Association of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA) Tournament, {{to be held in}} New Orleans March 22 - 25; and the American Bar Association (ABA) National Appellate Advocacy Competition, to be held in Chicago March 29 - 31. <b>Just</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> the UGA moot court program secured a bid to the elite finals of the Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition in Washington, D. C. April 1 - 7. Earlier this season, a team competed in the national finals of the prestigious National Moot Court Competition in New York City. The law school 2 ̆ 7 s ATLA team was the only undefeated team among competitors in the northeast regional tournament held March 1 - 4 in Providence, Rhode Island. In fact, the UGA team never lost the vote of a single judge en route to winning the title. Team members included third-year students Mark Mitchell and Michele Harris and second-year students Ryan Reavis and Shalena Cook. Second-year student Caroline Rogers served as their student coach. The team acted as both attorneys and witnesses in a trial setting, arguing a hypothetical civil suit brought by a mother against state-employed paramedics for failing to diagnose and transport her 16 -year-old son, who later died. UGA sent two teams to the ABA regional tournament in Atlanta, and both teams were undefeated entering the final round, which consisted of the top eight teams from a field of approximately 30 competitors. The four winners of these arguments advance to the national finals. The judges awarded the championship to the UGA team of second-year law students Drew Baiter, Lauren Sheridan and Tiffany Rowe, who will now compete in the national competition {{at the end of the}} month. The UGA team of second-year students Mary Paige Tucker, David Adams and Ali Sawyer were narrowly defeated in the final round in a split decision. Third-year students Sam Burch and Laura Hill coached the ABA teams, and Holly Pierson, an attorney with the Atlanta law firm of King 2 ̆ 6 Spalding and a former moot court member at UGA, served as their advisor. In a moot court tournament, students argue the appeal of a hypothetical case before a panel of judges. The University of Georgia School of Law won the ATLA national championship in 1997 and reached the semifinals of the ABA national appellate competition in 1999. 2 ̆ 2 We are enjoying a wonderful season of success for our moot court and mock trial programs, 2 ̆ 2 said David Shipley, UGA law school dean. 2 ̆ 2 Their accomplishments demonstrate to a regional, national and international audience the high quality of our students and the superb training they receive. We are very proud of our students 2 ̆ 7 efforts and the excellent leadership of Advocacy Director Kellie Casey. They deserve a big round of applause. 2 ̆ 2 #...|$|E
