40|$|Conflict Alerts for {{aircraft}} in holding patterns are often missed or in error due to fact that holding trajectories are not modeled in Conflict Alert or Conflict Probe logic. In addition, a controller in one sector {{may not know}} when aircraft are holding in a neighboring sector. These factors can lead to an increased potential for loss of separation while aircraft are flying in holding patterns. A holding function for conflict probe applications has been developed and tested with air traffic data from Fort Worth Center. The holding function automatically determines when an aircraft enters a holding pattern, builds a holding region around the pattern and then probes the region for conflict with other traffic. The operational concept of use assumes that air traffic controllers are very busy during periods when aircraft are in holding and therefore don't have time to manually enter information which defines a holding pattern and activates conflict probing. For this reason, it is important the holding function automatically detect aircraft in holding and compute a holding region for conflict analysis.

40|$|The {{helicopter}} {{flight control}} system described in this report is designed {{with the objective of}} improving the handling qualities and to meet the fault tolerance requirements of a fully operational system. The emphasis in the design was put on minimising the effort in sensor redundancy required to perform the various control tasks. With respect to these objectives the most adequate design is a feed forward command system utilising the feedback of rate gyros. This controller design improves helicopter response dynamics and additionally gives sufficient (adequate) system stability. It is the basic fully redundant control mode. The higher control modes as heading <b>hold,</b> attitude <b>hold,</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>hold</b> and speed hold are designed as superimposed control modes requiring only simplex sensor signals.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the potential fuel burn benefits of altitude and speed optimization in the cruise phase of flight for domestic airlines in the United States. Airlines can achieve cost reductions and reduce environmental impact by making small {{modifications to the}} cruise phase operating condition. The efficiency of the National Airspace System can be improved with coordination between air traffic controllers, pilots, and airline dispatchers. This study builds off of prior {{work in this area}} to establish best-case benefits assuming full implementation of fuel-optimal cruise altitudes and speeds. In order to achieve these objectives, a cruise-phase fuel burn estimator was developed using publicly-available radar tracks and weather data. This estimator was used to examine 217, 000 flights from 2012. Maximum benefits from altitude optimization (holding speed constant) were found to be on the order 1. 96 %. The majority of potential altitude benefits can be achieved using step climb optimization, with only marginal gain from cruise climb implementation. The maximum benefits for speed optimization (<b>holding</b> <b>altitude</b> constant) were found to be 1. 94 % with an average flight time increase of 3. 5 minutes per flight. Simultaneous altitude and speed optimization yielded a potential cruise fuel burn reduction of 3. 71 %. In practice, operational considerations and barriers to implementation limit likely system fuel reduction to lower levels. High-benefit operations within the NAS are identified and potential implementation considerations are discussed.

These form a subset of biomorphic explorers, which, as reported in several articles in past issues of NASA Tech Briefs ["Biomorphic Explorers" (NPO- 20142), Vol. 22, No. 9 (September 1998), page 71; "Bio-Inspired Engineering of Exploration Systems" (NPO- 21142), Vol. 27, No. 5 (May 2003), page 54; and "Cooperative Lander-Surface/Aerial Microflyer Missions for Mars Exploration" (NPO- 30286), Vol. 28, No. 5 (May 2004), page 36], are proposed small robots, equipped with microsensors and communication systems, that would incorporate crucial functions of mobility, adaptability, and even cooperative behavior. These functions are inherent to biological organisms but are challenging frontiers for technical systems. Biomorphic flyers could be used on Earth or remote planets to explore otherwise difficult or impossible to reach sites. An example of an exploratory task of search/surveillance functions currently being tested is to obtain high-resolution aerial imagery, {{using a variety of}} miniaturized electronic cameras. The control functions to be implemented by the systems in development include <b>holding</b> <b>altitude,</b> avoiding hazards, following terrain, navigation by reference to recognizable terrain features, stabilization of flight, and smooth landing. Flying insects perform these and other functions remarkably well, even though insect brains contains fewer than 10 (exp - 4) as many neurons as does the human brain. Although most insects have immobile, fixed-focus eyes and lack stereoscopy (and hence cannot perceive depth directly), they utilize a number of ingenious strategies for perceiving, and navigating in, three dimensions. Despite their lack of stereoscopy, insects infer distances to potential obstacles and other objects from image motion cues that result from their own motions in the environment. The concept of motion of texture in images as a source of motion cues is denoted generally as the concept of optic or optical flow. Computationally, a strategy based on optical flow is simpler than is stereoscopy for avoiding hazards and following terrain. Hence, this strategy offers the potential to design vision-based control computing subsystems that would be more compact, would weigh less, and would demand less power than would subsystems of equivalent capability based on a conventional stereoscopic approach...|$|E

40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis, a nonlinear {{mathematical model}} simulation and linear controller {{design for the}} U 1 -H 1 helicopter was achieved. This thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. In the first part, the nonlinear dynamic model is developed using the Matrix Laboratory Software and Heli-Dyn R Software, which is a modeling and simulation tool for rotorcraft developed by Dr. Ilkay Yavrucuk at Middle East Technical University. The non-linear model consists in a contribution of main rotor, tail rotor, fuselage, gravitational model, horizontal and vertical tail rotor. The U 1 -H 1 main rotor non-linear mathematical model was build by use of blade element momentum theory, inflow dynamics and flapping dynamics. The total forces and moments are used in 6 degrees of freedom equations of motion model and helicopter states are obtained for hover conditions and forward flight. Trim and linearization process was done by Heli-Dyn R Software. The second part consists in a stability augmentation systems (SAS) followed by a set of automatic flight control systems (AFCS) designed by use of PID controllers. The AFCS main objective is to ease the pilot by decreasing the workload. The stability augmentation systems was designed by use of optimal control, especially Linear Quadratic Tracking Controller (LQT) and Linear Quadratic Regulator Controller (LQR). The automatic flight control systems implemented are heading <b>hold,</b> attitude, <b>hold</b> <b>altitude</b> acquire and <b>hold</b> mode for hover condition and heading <b>hold,</b> attitude <b>hold,</b> <b>altitude</b> acquire and <b>hold</b> mode and airspeed hold for forward flight condition.
