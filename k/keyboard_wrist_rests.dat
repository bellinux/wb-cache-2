40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis was on the design and {{construction}} of a multi-finger haptic device powered by electromechanical voice-coil actuators. Five actuators were designed and constructed and a position and force feedback control system was implemented for each. The maximum continuous force output for each actuator ranged from 12 - 16 N, which is about 15 %- 30 % of the maximum force that can be exerted by an individual finger. The bandwidth of the controlled actuators ranged from 0. 7 Hz to 1. 7 Hz, the steady-state error was zero, and the overshoot ranged from 3. 5 % to 7. 7 %. Four actuators were constructed into an array, with finger contact points 23 mm apart.

40|$|Design of {{computer}} keyboards {{no longer is}} limited to the flat keyboards that are typically shipped with personal computers. Keyboards now exist that are split into halves and these halves can be slanted away from each other (creating a triangle between the halves), sloped downward toward the visual display terminal, tilted upward like a tent, or simply separated. These design features are intended to alleviate discomfort and possible musculoskeletal disorders that have been suggested {{to be associated with the}} extensive use of conventional computer keyboards. The geometry of conventional <b>keyboards</b> requires the <b>wrists</b> to be in 10 ° to 15 ° of ulnar deviation and 20 ° of extension and the forearms to be nearly fully pronated while typing. A review of the available experimental data collected on 10 -digit touch typists indicates that (1) keyboards with a slant angle (half of the opening angle) of 10 ° to 12. 5 ° or keyboards with halves separated to approximately shoulder width are both effective in placing the wrist in near neutral (0 °) ulnar/radial deviation when typing, (2) wrist extension can be reduced to near neutral (0 °) when a keyboard with a negative slope of 7. 5 ° is used, contingent on the <b>wrist</b> <b>rest</b> also sloping with the keyboard, and (3) tilting the keyboard halves 20 ° to 30 ° is effective in reducing forearm pronation to approximately 45 °. These studies also indicate that experienced 10 -digit touch typists readily adapt (within 10 minutes) to these individual alternative keyboard features, and can type with approximately the same speed and accuracy as with the conventional keyboard. While placing the wrist and forearm in a more neutral position could, in theory, reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders, randomized controlled trials are necessary before strong recommendations can be made on the effectiveness of alternative keyboards for the prevention and/or treatment of musculoskeletal disorders.

40|$|Basic {{information}} concerning common alternative keyboard designs {{and their effects}} on work posture was provided to aid in selection of alternative keyboard designs. Alternative keyboards may assist in keeping wrists straight, thus alleviating stress to the musculoskeletal system.

Wrist extension and ulnar deviation angles were both significantly reduced with the split/angled keyboard (p =. 030 and. 010), and lower EMG activities were recorded in the extensor carpi radialis and ulnaris muscles.

Typing intensive jobs can result in pain, numbness, and possibly cumulative trauma disorders. A laboratory study was conducted to evaluate various physiological, performance, and subjective measures and determine the effects of different split and standard keyboard designs on keyboard users. Twelve healthy, college-aged participants (six female and six male) typed in a standing position for two hours per day, four days per week, {{for the duration of the}} six-week study. Six different keyboards were profiled (one keyboard per week). The keyboards tested were: IBM standard, IBM standard with <b>wrist</b> <b>rest,</b> IBM split and raised, Microsoft, Kinesis, and Fountain Hill. The following physiological variables were measured: hand and an-n skin temperature, arm volume, vibrotactile sensitivity, nerve conduction velocity, and both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Also, the performance variables of typing speed and accuracy were measured, as well as the subjective measures of body-part discomfort and keyboard preference. There were no statistically significant differences at the 0. 05 level across the six keyboards for any of the physiological measures. However, there were some statistically significant trends indicating physical stress on the user from the task of typing. There was a cooling trend exhibited in both the arm and hand skin temperatures as well as increased vibrotactile sensitivity and increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures during the two hour period. Regarding performance, the participants exhibited significantly (p = 0. 0 1 3 0) slower typing speeds on the split keyboards than on the standard keyboards. There was a tendency toward more accurate typing on the standard keyboards than on the split keyboards; however, this observation was not statistically significant (p = 0. 0885). With respect to subjective measures the participants indicated very little pain was experienced on any of the keyboard configurations, but split keyboards were preferred to standard keyboards with respect to design and usability issues. Standard keyboards were perceived easier to learn, but split keyboards were favored for lighter key force and easier keying.

40|$|International audienceRigidity is {{commonly}} {{defined as a}} resistance to passive movement. In Parkinson's disease (PD), two types of rigidity are classically recognized which may coexist, "leadpipe " and "cogwheel". Charcot {{was the first to}} investigate parkinsonian rigidity {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century, whereas Negro and Moyer described cogwheel rigidity at the beginning of the twentieth century. Jules Froment, a French neurologist from Lyon, contributed to the study of parkinsonian rigidity during the 1920 s. He investigated rigidity of the <b>wrist</b> at <b>rest</b> in a sitting position as well as in stable and unstable standing postures, both clinically and with physiological recordings using a myograph. With Gardère, Froment described enhanced resistance to passive movements of a limb about a joint that can be detected specifically when there is a voluntary action of another contralateral body part. This has been designated in the literature as the "Froment's maneuver " and the activation or facilitation test. In addition, Froment showed that parkinsonian rigidity diminishes, vanishes, or enhances depending on the static posture of the body. He proposed that in PD "maintenance stabilization " of the body is impaired and that "reactive stabilization " becomes the operative mode of muscular tone control. He considered "rigidification " as compensatory against the forces of gravity. Froment also demonstrated that parkinsonian rigidity increases during the Romberg test, gaze deviation, and oriented attention. In their number, breadth, and originality, Froment's contributions to the study of parkinsonian rigidity remain currently relevant to clinical and neurophysiological issues of PD...|$|R

To investigate the underlying pathophysiology, peripheral axonal excitability studies were performed and changes with heating and therapy explored. Multiple excitability indices (stimulus-response curve, strength-duration time constant (SDTC), threshold electrotonus, and recovery cycle) were investigated in 23 (9 EMSCN 9 A+ and 14 EMSCN 9 A-) genetically characterized patients with EM stimulating median motor and sensory axons at the <b>wrist.</b> At <b>rest,</b> patients with EM showed a higher threshold and rheobase (P < 0. 001) compared with controls. Threshold electrotonus and current-voltage relationships demonstrated greater changes of thresholds in both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing preconditioning electrotonus in both EM cohorts compared with controls in sensory axons (P < 0. 005). When average temperature was raised from 31. 5 °C to 36. 3 °C in EMSCN 9 A+ patients, excitability changes showed depolarization, specifically SDTC significantly increased, {{in contrast to the}} effects of temperature previously established in healthy subjects (P < 0. 05). With treatment, 4 EMSCN 9 A+ patients (4 / 9) reported improvement with mexiletine, associated with reduction in SDTC in motor and sensory axons.

Taken together, these changes may be attributed to systemic neurovascular abnormalities in EM, with chronic postischaemic resting membrane potential hyperpolarization due to Na/K pump overactivity.
