The citadel helped to secure the southern region, which allowed Nguyễn Ánh to implement domestic programs to strengthen himself economically in preparation to fight the Tây Sơn. He used the newfound security to undertake agrarian reforms. Due to Tây Sơn naval raids on the rice crop, the area had been suffering long term rice shortages. Although the land was extremely fertile, the region was agriculturally underexploited because it had been occupied by Vietnamese people only relatively recently. Nguyễn Ánh's programs resulted in large amounts of previously <b>idle</b> <b>land</b> being cultivated. Large surpluses of grain, taxable by the state, were generated.|$|E

This research uses the Geographical Information System (GIS) approach to obtain urban land use patterns and the distribution of <b>idle</b> <b>lands.</b> The land use data were used the historical data from year 1991 to 2012.

2500|$|In 1951, {{the agrarian}} reform law that expropriated <b>idle</b> <b>land</b> from private hands was enacted, but in 1954, with the National Liberation Movement coup {{supported}} by the United States, {{most of the land}} that had been expropriated, was awarded back to its former landowners. Flavio Monzón was appointed mayor and in the next twenty years {{he became one of the}} largest landowners in the area. [...] In 1964, several communities settled for decades on the shore of Polochic River claimed property titles to INTA which was created in October 1962, but the land was awarded to Flavio Monzón. A Mayan peasant from Panzós later said that Flavio Monzón [...] "got the signatures of the elders before he went before INTA to talk about the land. When he returned, gathered the people and said that, by an INTA mistake, the land had gone to his name." [...] Throughout the 1970s, Panzós farmers continued to claim INTA regularization of land ownership receiving legal advice from the FASGUA (Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala), an organization that supported the peasants' demands through legal procedures. However, no peasant received a property title, ever. Some obtained promises while other had provisional property titles, and there were also some that only had received permission to plant. The peasants began to suffer evictions from their land by farmers, the military and local authorities in favor of the economic interests of Izabal Mining Operations Company (EXMIBAL) and Transmetales. Another threat at that time for peasant proprietors were mining projects and exploration of oil: Exxon, Shenandoah, Hispanoil and Getty Oil all had exploration contracts; besides there was the need for territorial expansion of two megaprojects of that era: Northern Transversal Strip and Chixoy Hydroelectric Plant.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} law in enhancing the value of customary land which {{is an integral part}} of the social and economic aspect of the adat perpatih community in the State of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Tracts of customary land has been left idle for some time since 1980 s mainly because of the wrong perception that agricultural activities will not yield fast and high returns. The Malaysian government identified various strategies to help alleviate rural poverty since the early days of independence. Despite the efforts undertaken by the government, the major problem posed to the government agencies is the increasing rate of <b>idle</b> agricultural <b>land.</b> Data were collected from interviews with affected landowners in Negeri Sembilan, the adat leaders, the State Authorities responsible for land administration and development, Federal government agencies established to address rural development strategies to identify the reasons for the increase in the <b>idle</b> agricultural <b>land</b> despite the policies and measures undertaken by the government for promoting efficient use of the land. Research identified that there are factors impacting adversely on the successful implementation of the government’s plans to develop <b>idle</b> agricultural <b>lands.</b> This problem if left not being watched will impact on the supply of agriculture land available for development. This paper sets out the legal measures that can be adopted in addressing issues relating to <b>idle</b> agricultural <b>land,</b> the problems faced and the proposals to overcome the problems to prevent the loss of supply of land available for agriculture development which is very crucial to ensure food security and promote sustainable development of the rural community that can have the effect of enhancing the values of customary land...|$|R
50|$|His {{proposal}} for a presumptive tax on landed property based on area and location but regardless of actual use was particularly novel. It not only explicitly addressed the problem of tax evasion and misstatement of income but was also meant as an implicit investment incentive. Lands that were more productively cultivated and that received greater investment would be pay proportionately less tax under the scheme. Conversely, presumptive taxation would implicitly penalise <b>idle</b> <b>lands</b> and those held for speculation, stimulating their transfer and sale to more active and conscientious producers. Sancianco opposed taxation based {{on the type of}} crops cultivated, citing as a reason the unpredictability of market conditions and hence the need to allow entrepreneurs as much flexibility as possible.|$|R
