40|$|Beach profile {{change in}} the swash zone on gravel beaches is characterised by {{enhanced}} onshore sediment transport and berm formation, and infiltration loss in the swash zone is often given as the reason why gravel beaches are steeper than sand beaches. In this paper, we report on field measurements conducted on a gravel beach, Slapton Sands, Devon, UK, in April 2001. Collected data included surface pressures under uprush and backwash, subsurface pore water pressures, uprush and backwash velocities, and bed elevations. The field data were compared with predictions of the BeachWin model, which simulates interacting wave run-up/run-down, beach groundwater flow, swash sediment transport, and resulting beach profile changes.

40|$|Although the Bélanger-Böss theorem of {{critical}} flow {{has been widely}} applied in open channel hydraulics, it {{was derived from the}} laws governing ideal frictionless flow. This study explores a more general expression of this theorem and examines its applicability to flow with friction and sediment transport. It demonstrates that the theorem can be more generally presented as the principle of minimum energy (PME), with maximum efficiency of energy use and minimum friction or minimum energy dissipation as its equivalents. Critical flow depth under frictionless conditions, the best <b>hydraulic</b> section where <b>friction</b> is introduced, and the most efficient alluvial channel geometry where both friction and sediment transport apply are all shown to be the products of PME. Because PME in liquids characterizes the stationary state of motion in solid materials, flow tends to rapidly expend excess energy when more than minimally demanded energy is available.

40|$|Drilling {{performed}} from floating {{drilling rigs}} subjected to heave motion may be challenging. As the drillstring is suspended in slips during connection, the entire drillstring follows {{the motion of}} the floating rig. In harsh environment with heavy waves, drillsting heave induces severe surge and swab effects down hole. In a narrow pressure window reservoir, this effect might be crucial and worst case scenario is to lose the well. MPD on floating rigs is an approach to solve issues regarding surge and swab effects. A scaled MPD rig subjected to heave motion has been constructed at NTNU. The objective of the scaled rig is to design an automatic operated choke system to reduce pressure fluctuation due to surge and swab effects on a lab scale. A precise hydraulic model is crucial for a successful experiment. This thesis presents two different hydraulic models for the MPD heave lab. A simplified empirical model is developed based on curve matching from fixed choke experiments, this non-linear model is fairly simple and may be implemented as a controller in the heave lab. CBHP simulations based on the empirical model are performed in this thesis, but the controller has not been tested in the lab. A linear controller has been implemented in the heave lab, which reduced BHP fluctuation up to 64 % (Albert, A. 2013). A sophisticated numerical model has also been developed to analyse hydraulics in the heave lab. The numerical model simulates both flow and pressure throughout the entire heave lab. This model deviates slightly from observed data which is caused by unsteady laminar flow effects and unsteady wall shear stress due to fluid acceleration. The hydraulic analysis address important factors for a real case MPD heave compensation operation, such as; fluid acceleration effect on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>friction</b> factor and flow delay caused by fluid inertia.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, two {{single-phase}} {{liquid cooling}} strate-gies for electronics thermal management are compared and con-trasted; impinging jet arrays and laminar flow in microchannels. The comparison is posed for {{a situation in}} which an electronic de-vice must dissipate 250 W/cm while being maintained at a temper-ature of 85 C. The calculations indicate that both the impinging jet and microchannel heat sinks can provide the necessary cooling with less than 0. 1 W of pumping power. Microchannels achieve this heat transfer target with such low pumping power by the relatively high pressure drop being offset by a low volumetric flow rate. In contrast, impinging jet heat sinks require a lower pressure drop and higher volumetric flow rate. From a practical point of view, lower operating pressure and larger mass flow rates are desirable characteristics, since they will be less prone to leakage and will pro-vide better temperature uniformity across the heated component.
