40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Rubber-modified asphalt {{pavements}} {{have been}} used in Sweden and the United States since the 1970 's. In these applications ground recycled tire particles (1 / 4 inch minus) are added to a gap-graded aggregate and then mixed with <b>hot</b> <b>asphalt</b> <b>cement.</b> The benefits of adding rubber to the mix include increased skid resistance under icy conditions, improved flexibility and crack resistance, elimination of solid waste, and reduced traffic noise. The major disadvantage of these rubber-modified mixes is their high cost in relation to conventional asphaltic concrete pavements. This research project consisted of a laboratory study of mix properties as a function of variables such as rubber gradation and content, void content, aggregate gradation, mix process, temperature, and asphalt content. Twenty different mix combinations were evaluated for diametral modulus and fatigue at two different temperatures (- 6 °C, + 10 °C). Also, five different mix combinations were evaluated for static creep and permanent deformation. Layered theory was used to evaluate the effects of mixture variations on pavement life. The resulting information was used to develop guidelines for use of rubber asphalt mixes in United States road systems. The findings of the field survey indicate that the rubber-modified asphalt mixture is more susceptible than the conventional mixtures to preparation and compaction problems when adverse weather or equipment problems occur. However, with adequate equipment and favorable weather conditions, the rubber-modified asphalt mixture placement is similar to conventional mixture placement. The field study also indicates that stopping distances can be reduced 20 percent for the rubber-modified pavements in icy conditions. In view of the significant reductions in wintertime stopping distances under icy or frosty road surface conditions, the use of coarse rubber in asphalt pavements should be seriously considered. This is particularly true for areas such as bridge decks, on and off freeway ramps or insulated roadway sections. The findings of the laboratory study indicate that the rubber gradation and content, aggregate gradation, and use of surcharge during sample preparation have considerable effect on modulus and fatigue life of the mix. The results of static creep and permanent deformation tests indicate that the rubber asphalt mixes had low stability and high elasticity. Also, due to greater allowable tensile strain in rubber-modified mixtures, the thickness of the modified mixture can be reduced, using a layer equivalency of 1. 4 to 1. 0...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. In this work asphalt air blowing has been studied from two perspectives. First, the process itself was investigated in terms of the effect of air-blowing conditions on the properties of the asphalt materials obtained. It was found that according to the Superpave specification, very good grade asphalts can be produced by air blowing, and the blowing temperature does not seriously impact the grade span. Asphalt composition has a significant effect on the grade span. The materials with a higher concentration of asphaltenes and saturates have a higher performance grade span. In this work it is shown that the subsequent 88 ? C hardening and oxidation rates are higher for materials blown at higher temperature, and this is not detected by Superpave specifications. Blowing fluxes with a high saturate content may result in a higher grade but can cause subsequent susceptibility to oxidative hardening. The mechanism by which air blowing can affect the 88 ? C hardening rate is related to oxidation kinetics and the tendency of oxidation products to form asphaltenes, causing hardening. For some materials air blown at higher temperatures, the subsequent accelerated hardening rate results from an increase in the oxidation rate, while the hardening susceptibility may actually decrease.
