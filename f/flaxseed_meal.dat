40|$|Dietary <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> reduces {{proteinuria}} and ameliorates nephropathy in {{an animal}} model of type II diabetes mellitus. BackgroundEvidence is emerging that varying the type or source of dietary protein intake can have beneficial effects on chronic renal disease. Consumption of soybean and soy-based food products, {{as the source}} of plant protein, can retard the development and progression of chronic renal disease. We studied the obese spontaneously hypertensive/NIH-corpulent (SHR/N-cp) rat, a model of obesity and type II diabetes mellitus that consistently develops nephropathy resembling diabetic nephropathy. We specifically sought to determine whether changing the source of protein intake from animal protein, casein, to plant protein in the form of either soy protein concentrate or flaxseed protein in the diet has a different impact on renal function and nephropathy in this model. MethodsMale obese SHR/N-cp rats were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three diets containing either 20 % casein, 20 % soy protein concentrate, or 20 % <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal.</b> Except for the protein source, all three diets were identical and contained similar amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. All animals were maintained on these diets for 6 months. At the end of the study, blood sampling and 24 -hour urine collections were performed for renal functional measurements, and the kidneys were harvested and examined for histologic evaluation. ResultsAll three groups had similar amounts of food intake and body weight gain and exhibited fasting hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Plasma glucose levels did not differ among the three groups, but plasma insulin concentration was significantly lower in rats fed <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> than those fed either casein or soy protein concentrate. Mean plasma creatinine, creatinine clearance, and urinary urea excretion also did not differ significantly between the three groups. By contrast, urinary protein excretion was significantly lower (P < 0. 01) in rats fed flaxseed than in rats fed either casein or soy protein concentrate. Morphologic analysis of renal structural lesions showed that the percentage of abnormal glomeruli with mesangial expansion and the tubulointerstitial score (an index of severity of tubulointerstitial damage) were significantly reduced in rats fed flaxmeal compared to those fed casein or soy protein concentrate. ConclusionWe conclude that dietary protein substitution with <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> reduces proteinuria and glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions in obese SHR/N-cp rats and that <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> is more effective than soy protein in reducing proteinuria and renal histologic abnormalities in this model.

The aim was to examine whether <b>flaxseed</b> DF-enriched <b>meals</b> suppress postprandial lipemia and reduce appetite. Methods and results: Four different iso-caloric meals were tested in 18 young men in a double-blind randomized crossover design. Test meals were served after an overnight fast. DF content and source were: control (C) : 1. 4 g/MJ; whole flaxseed (WF) : 2. 4 g/MJ from whole flaxseeds; low-mucilage dose (LM) : 2. 4 g/MJ from flaxseed DF; high-mucilage dose (HM) : 3. 4 g/MJ from flaxseed DF. During the 7 h test day, subjective appetite sensation was assessed using visual analogue scales and appetite-regulating hormones, and lipemia and glycemia were measured, after which ad libitum energy intake was recorded. There was a significant time x meal effect on triacylglycerols (TG) (p = 0. 02) and an 18 % smaller area under the curve (AUC) for TG after meal HM compared to meal C was observed (p < 0. 01). AUC for insulin was smaller after both LM and HM meals compared to C and WF meals. Higher mean ratings of satiety (p < 0. 01) and fullness (p = 0. 03) was seen following the HM meal compared to meal C. AUC for ghrelin, CCK and GLP- 1 and ad libitum energy intake did not differ between meals, but ghrelin response exhibited a different response pattern after the mucilage-containing meals.

40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} {{intended}} to explore the effect of extruded <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> supplemented diet on broiler growth performance, oxidative stability and organoleptic characteristics of broiler meat and meat products. 120 (day old) broiler chicks were randomly allotted to 12 experimental groups and fed on diets containing extruded <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> at 0, 5, 10 and 15 %. The supplementation of extruded flaxseed in the diet decreases the body weight gain, feed intake and increased feed conversion ratio (FCR) values of broilers. The antioxidant enzymes were strongly influenced by different levels of extruded flaxseed supplementation among treatments. The TBARS assay revealed that maximum malondialdehyde were produced in T 3 containing highest extruded flaxseed level (15 %) and minimum malondialdehyde were produced in T 0 treatment having no extruded flaxseed. The TBARS values ranged from 0. 850 - 2. 106 and 0. 460 - 1. 052 in leg and breast met respectively. The Free radical scavenging activity varied significantly and DPPH values of breast meat ranged from 20. 70 % to 39. 09 % and in leg meat 23. 53 % to 43. 09 % respectively. The sensory acceptability of broiler meat nuggets was decreased {{with the increase in}} the level of flaxseeds due to the lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which generated off flavors and bad odors. Feeding extruded flaxseed to chicken through feed strongly inflated the quality and functional properties, fatty acid contents and reduced the oxidative stability of broiler meat and meat products.

40|$|Brown {{flaxseed}} hulls {{were added}} to de-germed corn meal and processed into extrudates with acceptable texture and increased nutritional benefits. The addition of brown flaxseed hulls to a corn based expanded snack increases the dietary fiber, alpha omega 3 fatty acids, and antioxidants levels. The addition of flaxseed hulls to a corn based snack can increase its susceptibility to oxidative rancidity which can limit shelf life. Whole ground tannin sorghum with added brown flaxseed hulls was processed into extrudates and texture, antioxidant activity, and stability were evaluated. Brown flaxseed hulls were mixed with de-germed yellow corn meal in ratios of 0 : 100, 15 : 85, 20 : 80, and 25 : 75 (w/w) and extruded with 12 and 15 % feed moistures using a twin screw extruder to produce direct expanded extrudates. Expansion of extrudates containing brown hulls decreased {{as the amount of}} hulls increased. Dried extrudates had acceptable flavor immediately after processing. Total phenols and antioxidant activity of extrudates containing 20 and 25 % brown flaxseed hulls, extruded at 15 % feed moisture were higher than de-germed corn meal extruded at 16 % feed moisture. Brown flaxseed hulls were added at 20 % to whole ground white and sumac (tannin) sorghums and processed into extrudates. Expansion increased for sorghum extrudates containing brown flaxseed hulls. The addition of brown flaxseed hulls increased antioxidant activity and total phenols of both white and sumac (tannin) extrudates. The sumac (tannin) extrudates had the longest delay in producing off odor (paintlike odor) and had the lowest p-Anisidine values compared to white (ATX 631 x RTX 436) sorghum and corn <b>meal</b> with added <b>flaxseed</b> hulls. Corn <b>meal</b> extrudates with 20 % brown flaxseed hulls produce off odors more rapidly than other extrudates. This suggests that the tannins in sorghum maybe extending shelf life because of their antioxidant activity.

Also the use of tannins sorghums in products containing flaxseed may help delay oxidation, thus preventing the occurrence of off odors. Further work {{needs to be done to}} verify results...|$|R
40|$|CDATA[This {{experiment}} {{used the}} mobile nylon bag technique (MNBT) to determine dry {{matter and energy}} digestibility in traditional feeds as well as non-traditional feeds in order to calculate digestible energy (DE) values for use in ration formulation programs for swine. A total of 23 ingredients were tested in this experiment including six animal protein sources (blood meal, fish meal, meat meal, spray dried animal plasma, spray dried red blood cells and shrimp head flour), six oilseeds (extruded full-fat soybean, raw sunflower seeds, roasted sunflower seeds, caraway seeds, raw flaxseeds, and micronized <b>flaxseeds),</b> three oilseed <b>meals</b> (cottonseed meal, soybean meal, and borage meal), five wheat or wheat by-products (wheat, wheat distillers grains, wheat mill run, wheat bran, and dried wheat thin stillage) and three miscellaneous feeds (beet pulp, barley malt and milk-fat product). Nylon bags containing one gram of feed were placed in a 1000 mL beaker containing 500 mL of a solution made up of deionized water, 0. 01 N HCl and one gram of purified activated pepsin powder and incubated for 4 h at 37 ?C. The bags were then inserted into the duodenum of one of five pigs through simple T-cannulae. Eight bags were administered to each pig daily. The bags were inserted into the duodenal cannulae during feeding time with four bags being inserted {{in the morning and}} four bags being inserted during the afternoon meal. With each feeding, two bags were introduced 15 minutes apart. Between five and ten nylon bags were prepared for each feed and the experiment was conducted over a seven-day period. Overall, the MNBT produced similar results to previously published DE values for 11 out of the 17 ingredients for which previous measurements have been made. For the six feeds where there was a significant discrepancy between the MNBT and previously published values, variation in chemical content provided a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy. For untreated flaxseed, caraway seed, barley malt and beet pulp, the author believes that previously published values are too high for feedstuffs containing such high neutral detergent fibre contents. In the present experiment, the MNBT generated a DE value of 4253 kcal/kg for untreated flaxseed, 1763 kcal/kg for caraway seed, 1800 kcal/kg for barley malt and 1905 kcal/kg for beet pulp, For raw sunflower seed, genetic selection has increased the ether extract content of the seed and therefore the DE value obtained here (3830 kcal/kg) is thought to more closely reflect the DE content of sunflower seeds currently being grown. Only for meat meal, did the MNBT produce a suspect result (3433 kcal/kg), which cannot be readily explained. For the remaining six feeds, there are no previously published values with which to compare the DE values determined with the MNBT. Based on their chemical analysis and the generated DE values, shrimp head flour (3473 kcal/kg), dried wheat stillage (4291 kcal/kg), roasted sunflower seed (3903 kcal/kg), micronized flaxseed (4155 kcal/kg), and milk fat product (8004 kcal/kg) all appear to have some potential for use as ingredients in swine rations. In contrast, borage meal (1562 kcal/kg) {{does not appear to be}} a useful ingredient. The overall results of this experiment indicate that the MNBT has considerable potential for use in determining the digestible energy content of swine feeds. The MNBT has several advantages compared with conventional digestibility methods in that many feeds can be tested in a relatively short duration of time with significantly fewer animals being used, only small amounts of feed are required and the test allows for energy measurements in feedstuffs that would not normally be fed to pigs as a single ingredient. ]]...|$|R

40|$|Background: Bariatric {{surgery is}} {{considered}} the most effective immediate weight loss method for the morbidly obese, despite widely reported weight regain after a few years. Appetite, satiety and satiation control are essential to maintaining a long-term result post-surgery. Dietary fatty acids composition may be implicated in the satiety. As flaxseed is a food high in linolenic acid, we aimed to verify the influence of flaxseed fat on appetite and satiety of women after bariatric surgery. Material and methods: Six women who underwent bariatric surgery at least 2 years before participated in a single-blind crossover trial that compared the effect of two isocaloric meals on satiety, one containing whole golden flaxseed (high in polyunsaturated fatty acids and fiber) (G 1) and another withdefatted flaxseed (high in fiber) (G 2), with one week of washout period. This variable was estimated by visual analogue scales in both meals at baseline (T 0), immediately after ingestion (T 1) and 60, 120, and 180 minutes after the meal (T 60, T 120 and T 180). Fasting anthropometric, body composition, laboratory tests (glucose and lipids) and dietary variables, were evaluated while fasting. Results: The volunteers were obese and had excess central adiposity, even {{after two years of}} surgery and still showed habitual fibre intake below recommended levels. G 1 had reduced hunger after 180 minutes compared to G 2 (P=. 046). Other parameters related to appetite and satiety did not differ between groups.

Commercially available <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> was also studied. [...] Approximately 46 to 49 % meal and 46 to 50 % oil were recovered from dry seeds depending on the extraction system employed. The removal of 4. 2 to 5. 7 % polar substances from the seeds resulted in an increase of 13 and 10 % in the content of crude protein and ash, respectively. The presence of ammonia in the polar phase had little effect on the non-protein nitrogen content. [...] A method was developed to isolate and quantify individual cyanogenic glycosides of linseed using chromatographic techniques.

The extraction system, consisting of 10 % (w/w) ammonia in 95 % (v/v) methanol, removed 57 % of linustatin and neolinustatin present in the original samples. A higher content of water, up to 15 % in the methanol-ammonia-water phase, removed 67 to 68 % of cyanogenic glycosides but resulted in a sticky, dark-coloured meal. Increased contact time (30 min) and solvent-to-seed ratio (R, 13. 3) were more effective as 78 % to 8 l% of cyanogenic glycosides were removed by this process. A two stage extraction with methanol-ammonia-water/hexane gave similar results, but, a three stage extraction removed approximately 92. 5 % of cyanogenic glycosides present in flaxseed. [...] The content of total phenolic acids (220 ± 13 mg/lOOg), condensed tannins (136 ± 13 mg/lOOg) and soluble sugars (7. 69 ± 0. 16 %) of defatted meals were reduced by 10 - 48 %, 26 - 74 % and 5 - 46 %, respectively. Defatted flaxseed meals contained 2. 4 ± 0. 13 to 2. 8 ± 0. 37 % of phytic acid and solvent extraction resulted in a slight increase in its content in the products. <b>Flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> was low in methionine, lysine and tryptophan compared to the FAO/WHO reference values. Methanol-ammonia-water/hexane extraction had little effect on the content of amino acids but resulted in lowering of the content of some of the fatty acids possibly due to the removal of some phopholipids by the polar phase. [...] <b>Flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> had a very high water absorption (9. 7 g H₂O/g) and water hydration capacity (5. 2 g H₂O/g) and they were not altered by extraction with the two-phase solvent processing. The presence of ammonia in the extraction system enhanced the fat absorption of the meals 2. 6 - 3. 2 fold and increased the pH by almost one unit. Nitrogen solubility of the meals was fairly high (46 - 65 %) and extraction with methanol-ammonia improved the nitrogen solubility of the products at their natural pH. Minimum value of the nitrogen solubility in the meals was observed at pH between 3. 0 - 3. 5. Emulsifying capacities of the meals were 64. 5 % to 80. 6 % and they were fairly stable to heat and retained 95 to 100 % of the emulsifying activity. Whippability of the meals was between 55 to 70 % and the foams were stable...|$|E

40|$|Myofibrillar proteins, {{the main}} {{components}} that impart functional properties to muscle foods, can undergo denaturation and aggregation during frozen storage. The overall objective {{of this research was}} to study the changes in protein structure that are associated with the preparation and frozen storage of surimi. In addition, the relative cryoprotective effects of whey protein concentrate, whey protein isolate, soy protein isolate, <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> and flaxseed protein were assessed in surimi during storage. Raw surimi was prepared by repeatedly washing Alaska pollock flesh with chilled water. The product was either slowly frozen or underwent rapid freezing using liquid air; in either case it was then subjected to frozen storage at - 20 °C for 24 months. Protein structural changes were monitored using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), native-PAGE, Fourier transform infrared/attenuated total reflectance (FTIR/ATR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). FTIR/ATR spectroscopy showed that during preparation of surimi the alpha-helix content increased with increased number of washing cycles. DSC results revealed a shift in the thermal transition of actin to a higher temperature during surimi preparation. All electrophoresis, FTIR/ATR spectroscopy and DSC results revealed a loss of myofibrillar proteins from surimi after three washing cycles, suggesting that three washing cycles were adequate to prepare surimi. Native-PAGE showed no major changes in surimi after 24 months storage at - 20 °C. SDS-PAGE showed relatively minor changes in protein subunit structure with some loss of the myosin light chains (MLC); myosin heavy chain (MHC), actin and tropomyosin were found to be relatively stable. FTIR/ATR spectroscopy indicated a significant decrease in alpha-helix relative to beta-sheet structure in surimi after 2 years of storage at - 20 °C. The loss of alpha-helical content was more significant in slowly frozen surimi compared to rapid-frozen surimi samples. DSC results revealed a shift in the thermal transition of actin to lower temperatures during frozen storage of surimi. Changes in the ratio of alpha-helix to beta-sheet structures suggested that flaxseed protein was the most effective cryoprotectant, followed by whey protein isolate and soy protein isolate, for maintaining protein structure stability during frozen storage. Whey protein concentrate and <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> showed the least cryoprotective ability. After 15 days storage at 4 °C, the SDS-PAGE results showed that flaxseed protein was the only cryoprotectant that prevented the degradation of myosin heavy chain, actin and myosin light chains...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Constipation is a {{very common}} health problem in the world. Intake of {{sufficient}} amount of dietary fibers is a cornerstone in the prevention and treatment of constipation. As a traditional medicine, flaxseed {{has been used to}} treat constipation for centuries, but the controlled trials are rare. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess that whether partially defatted <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> (PDFM) has the potential role to facilitate fecal output in normal and experimental constipated mice. Methods After supplemented with 2. 5 %, 5 % and 10 % (w/w) PDFM (L-, M- and H -PDFM) for 14 days, the constipation models of mice were induced by atropine-diphenoxylate. The small intestinal transit rates, start time of defecation, amount of defecation and wet weight of feces were researched in normal and constipation model mice. Results M- and H-PDFM significantly increase small intestinal transit rates in constipation model mice. All dose of PDFM markedly shortened the start time of defecation and M- and H-PDFM significantly increase stool frequency and weight in both normal and constipation model mice.

40|$|The {{possible}} role {{of dietary}} flax on prepubertal development of mammary glands and bone resorption {{was investigated in}} gilts. Fifty-seven gilts were fed 1 of 4 diets from 88 d of age until slaughter (d 212 +/- 1). Diets were control without flax (n = 14); 10 % flaxseed supplementation (n = 13); 6. 5 % <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> supplementation (n = 15); and 3. 5 % flaxseed oil supplementation (n = 15). All diets were isonitrogenous and isocaloric. Jugular blood samples were obtained on d 78 and 210 to establish the fatty acid profile and to determine the concentrations of prolactin, estradiol, and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen. At slaughter, the mammary glands were excised, parenchymal and extraparenchymal tissues were dissected, and {{the composition of the}} parenchymal tissue (protein, fat, DM, and DNA) was determined. Histochemical analyses of the mammary parenchyma were performed, and fatty acid profiles in the extraparenchymal tissue were evaluated. Dietary flax increased (P 0. 1), but concentrations of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen tended to be greater (P = 0. 1) in the bromodeoxyuridine labeling index or estrogen receptor localization was observed with treatments. Dietary supplementation with flax as seed, meal, or oil, therefore, brought about the expected changes in the fatty acid profile but had no beneficial effects on mammary development or bone resorption...|$|E
40|$|Human {{consumption}} of flaxseed is increasing {{due to its}} health benefit properties and extrusion processes can enhance its nutritional quality. Extruded <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> (EFM) obtained in a pilot plant was characterized and incorporated in flour mixes and cereal-based bars to demonstrate its nutritious usefulness. Amino acid content was not affected by extrusion and, despite lysine was the limitating amino acid, the chemical score (CS) was 83 %. Thiamin and riboflavin decreased slightly as consequence of extrusion, phytic acid did not change and trypsin inhibitor activity was undetectable. Proximate composition and nutritional quality determined by biological and chemical indexes were compared among EFM, flour mixes (FM) and cereal bars (CB). They presented high protein levels (26, 20 and 17 %, respectively), good biological value (BV) (80, 79 and 65, respectively), acceptable true protein digestibility (TD) (73, 79 and 78, respectively), and high dietary fiber (33, 20. 5 and 18 %, respectively). The ratio of ω 6 :ω 3 for CB was within the WHO/FAO recommendations.

The addition of FSM to the diet {{did not affect the}} performance and carcass characteristics, but significantly (P 20 = 0, and 80 40 = 20 = 0 g and 80 40 g FSM/kg). The male birds had significantly (P< 0. 01) higher performance, L* value of the PMN and lower a* value of the PMN than females. The breast weight of males fed 20 g FSM/kg was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than that of females. However, higher dietary levels of FSM/kg increased breast weight of females when compared with those of males. It was concluded that the addition of up to 80 g FSM/kg to the diet during 21 to 39 d did not affect the performance and carcass characteristics of broiler chickens, and that of 80 g FSM/kg increased CWLP and reduced pH of PMs. Sex of birds influenced the performance and characteristics of PMs...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Results of {{many studies}} {{indicate}} that consumption of n- 3 fatty acids can benefit persons with cardiovascular disease and rheumatoid arthritis. However, encapsulated fish oil {{is unlikely to be}} suited to lifetime daily use and recommendations to increase fish intake have not been effective. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the effectiveness of a diet that incorporates foods rich in n- 3 fatty acids in elevating tissue concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and in suppressing the production of inflammatory mediators. DESIGN: Healthy male volunteers were provided with foods that were enriched in alpha-linolenic acid (cooking oil, margarine, salad dressing, and mayonnaise) and eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (sausages and savory dip) and with foods naturally rich in n- 3 fatty acids, such as <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal</b> and fish. Subjects incorporated these products into their food at home for 4 wk. Fatty acid intakes, cellular and plasma fatty acid concentrations, and monocyte-derived eicosanoid and cytokine production were measured. RESULTS: Analyses of dietary records indicated that intake of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid averaged 1. 8 g/d and intake of alpha-linolenic acid averaged 9. 0 g/d. These intakes led to an average 3 -fold increase in eicosapentaenoic acid in plasma, platelet, and mononuclear cell phospholipids. Thromboxane B(2), prostaglandin E(2), and interleukin 1 beta synthesis decreased by 36 %, 26 %, and 20 % (P < 0. 05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Foods that are strategically or naturally enriched in n- 3 fatty acids can be used to achieve desired biochemical effects without the ingestion of supplements or a change in dietary habits. A wide range of n- 3 -enriched foods could be developed to support large-scale programs {{on the basis of the}} therapeutic and disease-preventive effects of n- 3 fatty acids.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Flaxseed is {{considered}} a functional food with several health benefits. However, because of its high phytoestrogen content, flaxseed influences hormone metabolism and affects the gonadal biomorphology. In this study, computerized histomorphometry {{was used to evaluate}} seminiferous and epididymal tubules, considering the different regions of the epididymis (head, body and tail) of rats subjected to a prolonged diet of flaxseed. Young adult male Wistar rats (n= 20) were divided into 2 groups during their lactation period: Control Group (CG), fed casein-based meals and Flaxseed Group (FG), fed a 25 % <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal.</b> After 250 days of continuous ingestion, the animals were euthanized and a blood sample was collected. The testicles and epididymis were removed and fixed in buffered formalin solution. The samples were subjected to routine histological paraffin techniques and stained with hematoxilin and eosin. Immunostaining was performed using an antivimentin antibody for Sertoli cell identification. For morphometry, images of the slides were scanned and analyzed using Image J to determine the epithelial height, tubular and luminal diameter and tubular and luminal area. In the hormonal evaluation, FG had a higher serum concentration of estrogen (P= 0. 001), but no change was observed in the concentration of testosterone. The morphometric assay of seminiferous tubules and epididymal regions revealed {{no significant differences between the}} analyzed groups. Similarly, Sertoli cell quantification showed no significant differences in the FG (P= 0. 98). These results revealed that the continuous and prolonged intake of 25 % flaxseed meals from gestation to 250 days of age, even with a significant increase in serum levels of estradiol, does not exert adverse effects on the testicular and epididymal structure or on the cells participating in the spermatogenesis of rats...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} effects of {{providing}} {{a wide range of}} foodstuffs containing n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), occurring naturally or from fortification, on intake and blood and tissue proportions of n- 3 PUFA. DESIGN: Before/after dietary intervention study. SETTING: Adelaide, Australia. SUBJECTS: 16 healthy males recruited from the community. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were provided with a range of foodstuffs naturally containing n- 3 PUFA (fresh fish, canned fish, <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal,</b> canola oil) and items fortified with fish oil (margarine spread, milk, sausages, luncheon meat, french onion dip). Food choices were left to the discretion of each subject. Intake was estimated by diet diary. Blood was collected at- 2, 0, 2, and 4 weeks for fatty acid analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary intakes; plasma, platelet, and mononuclear cell phospholipid fatty acids. RESULTS: Consumption of n- 3 PUFA increased significantly: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) from 1. 4 to 4. 1 g/day (P< 0. 001), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from 0. 03 to 0. 51 g/day (P< 0. 001), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from 0. 09 to 1. 01 g/day (P< 0. 001). Linoleic acid (LA) intake decreased from 13. 1 to 9. 2 g/day (P< 0. 001). The proportions of EPA and DHA increased significantly in all phospholipid pools examined; plasma EPA from 1. 13 % of total fatty acids to 3. 38 % (P< 0. 001) and DHA from 3. 76 to 7. 23 % (P< 0. 001); mononuclear cell EPA from 0. 40 to 1. 25 % (P< 0. 001) and DHA from 2. 33 to 4. 08 % (P< 0. 001); platelet EPA from 0. 41 to 1. 2 % (P< 0. 001) and DHA from 1. 64 to 3. 07 % (P< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Incorporating fish oil into a range of novel commercial foods provides the opportunity for wider public consumption of n- 3 PUFA with their associated health benefits.

40|$|Cyclolinopeptides (CLPs), a {{group of}} {{naturally}} occurring, hydrophobic, cyclic peptides in flax, have attracted {{a great deal of}} attention due to their immunosuppressive activity. The purpose of this project was to increase our understanding of the occurrence of CLPs in flaxseed, flaxseed tissues and flaxseed products. 	In the first study, systematic methods for CLP extraction, isolation, detection and quantification were developed. The solubility of CLPs in acetone led to its use as a preferred solvent for extraction of CLPs and other hydrophobic compounds from whole flaxseed. Solid phase extraction with a silica gel column followed by selective elution with organic solvents of increasing polarity enabled the isolation of a crude peptide-rich fraction. Reverse phase HPLC chromatography of peptide-rich fractions provided a method for separation and quantification of CLPs. 	In the second study, the levels of CLPs in cultivars of flaxseed were studied to determine if there was any impact of flax genotype or environment on peptide levels. The concentration of total CLPs varied from 189 Âµg/g (Flanders) to 303 Âµg/g (Somme) in the cultivars tested. Environment, cultivar and their interaction affected the observed concentration of CLPs. 	In the third study, the concentrations of CLPs in fractions produced from flaxseed were measured by HPLC in seed coat, cotyledon and oil bodies. The concentration of CLPs was higher in the cotyledon than in the seed coat. The highest CLP concentrations were found in the oil bodies. 	In the fourth study, CLP levels in flaxseed oil were measured during and after oil extraction and refining. The concentration of CLPs was higher in expeller-extracted crude oil and solid foots and lower in <b>flaxseed</b> <b>meal.</b> A comparison of CLP levels in flaxseed oil extracted with a small expeller and in commercially-produced flaxseed oil was performed. Crude flaxseed oil produced with a small expeller had higher levels of peptides than were observed in commercial flaxseed oil available at a local retail health food store. The effect of oil refining processes, including acid degumming and alkali refining on CLP stability, was studied. Acid degumming using 1 % H 3 PO 4 effectively removed all CLPs. Alkali refining was also demonstrated as being effective at decreasing levels of CLPs, although it failed to remove all peptides...|$|E
