Abstract: In order {{to study the}} effects of herbicide tolerant <b>fodder</b> <b>beets</b> on arable biodiversity four different herbicide regimes were set up: Application of conventional beet herbi-cides, application of Roundup Ready following label recommendation, early applica-tion of Roundup Ready, and Roundup Ready applied as late as possible without any expected reduction in root yield. The 2001 results revealed that the Roundup Ready treatments may result in significant improvements of weed flora and arthropod fauna during June and early July compared to conventionally treated plots. A prerequisite for this environmental benefit is that Roundup Ready applications follow the label rec-ommendation or are further delayed. The production of weed seeds was reduced or lacking {{as a consequence of the}} effectiveness of Roundup Ready. This may both have an effect on the availability of seeds as food for the birds and may also change the weed flora significantly.

50|$|The use {{of sugar}} beets for the {{extraction}} of crystallized sugar dates to 1747, when Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, professor of physics in the Academy of Science of Berlin, discovered {{the existence of a}} sugar in vegetables similar in its properties to that obtained from sugarcane. He found the best of these vegetable sources for {{the extraction of}} sugar was the white beet. Despite Marggraf’s success in isolating pure sugar from beets, their commercial manufacture for sugar did not take off until the early 19th century. Marggraf's student and successor Franz Karl Achard began selectively breeding sugar beet from the 'White Silesian' <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> in 1784. By the beginning of the 19th century, his beet was about 5-6% sucrose by (dry) weight, compared to around 20% in modern varieties.

50|$|In 1838 the Kleinwanzleben Zuckerfabrik (Kleinwanzleben Sugar Refinery) {{was founded}} as a stock company. In 1856 the {{majority}} of its shares were acquired by the sugar beet grower and farmer Matthias Christian Rabbethge, one of the pioneers of the German sugar industry. In the same year he and his then future son-in-law Julius Giesecke founded a general commercial partnership (OHG). In 1885 the Rabbethge & Giesecke OHG became a joint stock company (Aktiengesellschaft) under the name Zuckerfabrik Klein Wanzleben formerly Rabbethge & Giesecke Aktiengesellschaft (AG). In 1937 it was changed into Rabbethge & Giesecke AG because the Reichsnährstand did not want any anonymous investors in the agriculture and forestry sector. After the Second World War the company was relocated to the Lower Saxonian city of Einbeck which has been its headquarters since then. In 1946 a rescue company was established under the name Rabbethge & Giesecke Saatzucht GmbH. The foundation of this rescue company was necessary in order to continue the Western activities of the original joint stock company, which was still based in Klein Wanzleben. In 1951 the two companies were merged and took the title Kleinwanzlebener Saatzucht formerly Rabbethge & Giesecke AG. In 1975 it was changed into KWS Kleinwanzlebener Saatzucht formerly Rabbethge & Giesecke and then finally reduced to KWS SAAT AG in 1999.The first international branch of KWS was established in 1900 in the Ukrainian town Vinnytsia to meet the demand of sugar beet farmers in Russia. In 1920 the company began to expand its business into corn, <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> and potato breeding. Following the relocation to Einbeck, KWS focused on the breeding of sugar beet, corn, rapeseed, sunflower, cereals and potatoes. In the years directly after the war, the company became an important supplier to the West German sugar beet industry. Since 1963 it has established subsidiaries in Europe, North and South America, Asia and North Africa.|$|E

The experimental design was a four steer by two diet treatment comparison (experiment 1 and 2) with five sub-trials in each experiment. These series of trials assessed in vivo digestibility of diet energy and protein, nitrogen balance, and diurnal variations of rumen parameters (pH, redox, and acid, ammonia and urea concentrations) and urine and faeces production and parameters (pH, nitrogen concentration) in housed individual metabolism crates for 11 d. Microbial protein production was estimated from purine derivatives determined from total urine collection for 9 d of this period. Outdoors, under industry standard grazing conditions, rumen evacuations (10 am, 6 pm and 2 am) and serial placement of in sacco nylon bag (0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48 h) methods {{were used to}} assess rumen fluid passage rates, pool changes and feed dry matter and nitrogen degradability for both treatments. Voluntary dry matter intake and microbial protein supply to the steers, and the mean diurnal rumen pH, was higher in the <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> treatment than in the winter grass treatment. <b>Fodder</b> <b>beet</b> supplied almost twice as much microbial protein as winter grass despite a lower crude protein content of the diet. Total rumen VFA and ammonia concentrations, and mean redox, were lower for the <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> than winter grass but the rumen urea concentration was higher in the <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> treatment. The winter grass treatment rumen nitrogen pool size was only greater than the <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> at the 6 pm rumen evacuation. The initial 0 h DM and nitrogen % disappearance of <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> bulb was extremely high as assessed by serial nylon bag placement and removal. However, the rate of DM and N disappearance (%/h) of <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> leaf after 6 h incubation was higher than that of the <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> bulb and the winter grass. The higher voluntary intake, DMD% and rate of disappearance of <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> bulb and leaf compared with winter grass did not result in lower rumen pH or higher redox as would be expected by the current understanding of rumen function.

40|$|The New Zealand dairy {{industry}} has experienced rapid intensification during recent decades {{in response to}} increasing land values. Incorporating forage crops on the milking platform is a potential strategy to increase dry matter production and milk production for greater profitability. However, in previous studies, intensification has increased the cost of milk production. This has diminished the low-cost competitive advantage that New Zealand dairy producers have had in international markets. Feeding low crude protein forage crops {{has also been shown}} to reduce the nitrogen (N) concentration in cow urine, which may help reduce N leaching. This study used farm system modelling to determine the profitability and N leaching on the 160. 1 ha (effective) Lincoln University Dairy Farm (LUDF) when <b>fodder</b> <b>beet,</b> wheat for feed and sales, and a double crop rotation of maize and oats silage was grown. The cash operating profit was calculated using FARMAX® Professional Dairy, assuming $ 6. 00 /kg MS. The projected N leaching was calculated using Overseer TM (version 6. 2. 0), which is now compulsory for all farms in Canterbury under the Environment Canterbury Land and Water Regional Plan. The only crop scenario that increased profitability was <b>fodder</b> <b>beet.</b> Incorporating 10 ha each of spring and autumn grazed <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> increased operating profit by 20. 0 % to $ 4, 782 /ha compared to the existing 100 % pastoral system ($ 3, 984 /ha). The other cropping scenarios had significant decreases in profitability. Incorporating 20 ha of maize and oats silage reduced operating profit by 10. 6 %, despite increased overall dry matter production. This was due to poor feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and increased feed crop expenses. Operating profit reduced by 3. 2 % and 13. 1 % when wheat was grown for feed and sales respectively. The wheat (fed) scenario had similar milk production to the existing scenario, however greater crop expenditure. The wheat (sold) scenario had significantly reduced overall revenue which impacted on profitability. A second simulation with <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> was done so than daily intakes were increased to the recommended maximum 6. 0 kg DM/cow/day. Harvested <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> was included in the rotation and fed at 4. 0 kg DM/cow/day during mid-lactation when there was no grazed <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> available. The total <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> area was increased to 33. 9 ha, which increased the operating profit by 34. 8 % to $ 5, 368 /ha. The projected nitrate leaching for the all proposed scenarios increased due to significant nutrient loss from the cropping blocks. The overall N leaching increased from 34 kg N/ha for the existing system to 41 kg N/ha for both the <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> (20 ha) and maize/oats silage scenarios. Leaching was 39 and 37 kg N/ha for the wheat (fed) and wheat (sold) scenarios respectively. Leaching increased to 44 kg N/ha when the <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> area was increased to 33. 9 ha. It was concluded that <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> was the only suitable crop to increase profitability, however the projected increase in N leaching will likely prevent the strategy from being implemented...|$|E
40|$|Forecasting crop {{nitrogen}} (N) {{demand is}} important for maximising productivity and minimising losses {{to the environment and}} includes taking into account residual effects. The residual N effect was estimated in a dairy crop rotation (spring barley undersown with grass-clover, 1 st and 2 nd year ley, spring barley/pea undersown with ryegrass, oats undersown with ryegrass and <b>fodder</b> <b>beets)</b> with different management (grazed/cut) and manure type (slurry/deep litter) by anaerobic incubation and plant N-uptake in a pot experiment and in the field. For comparison a 10 -year-old grass-clover was included. Type of animal manure did not affect the residual N effect. Crop rotations with grazed grassland had a residual effect that on average was 13 % higher than the same rotation without grazing. Ploughing of grasslands clearly increased residual N effects for several years, but grassland age at ploughing was of little importance. Thus, the residual effect of 10 -year-old grass-clover ley only marginally exceeded that of undersown grass-clover despite considerable difference in estimated accumulated N-surplus. The results indicate that organic N is easier to mineralise the more recently it has been formed. Good correlations existed between soil inorganic N in the spring, N released during anaerobic incubation and plant-available N but chemical measures may be difficult to implement in practical farming due to difficulty in representative sampling in systems characterised by huge spatial variability...|$|R
40|$|Instead of {{continuously}} adapting current {{dairy farming}} systems {{according to the}} ruling legal instruments, exploring strategic development options for the farming system {{with a focus on}} the final environmental goals may provide better perspectives for farm continuation. To identify promising options, the dairy farming model was developed. The model describes options of different intensities for producing feed in the field, for processing or buying feed and for converting feed into milk. The combinations of different intensities result in different types of income levels, different nutrient emissions into the ecosystem and different abilities to manage the landscape. The model reconciles economic objectives (maximizing income per ha) with ecological objectives (minimizing nutrient leakages and maximizing landscape values). The multiple-objective model is in turn fed by other models, such as technical coefficient generators for grass, maize and <b>fodder</b> <b>beets.</b> The dairy farming model is applied to assess the type of farming systems that meet environmental policy objectives and analyse the perspectives of dairy farming on sandy soils in the Netherlands. It is shown that many different dairy farming systems are possible meeting the environmental goals (maximum 34 kg N leached, 30 kg N volatilized and a P surplus below 2. 2 kg ha¿ 1), with a range in environmental and economic performance. The scenario selected depends on the preference of the stakeholder. General characteristics are low N application rates on grazed grassland, associated with the restriction on nitrate leaching, animals housed in low-emission stables, associated with the restriction on ammonia volatilization, and a substantial part of the concentrates produced in the region, associated with the restriction on P surplus. Production and utilization of hay is an option to reduce N excretion by the animals. Regional or on-farm concentrate production is economically only attractive if land is in surplus under pressure of environmental goals...|$|R

It {{is concerned with the}} processes by which Danish policymakers implemented the Gene Technology Act in the period 1989 - 1997. Particularly, the thesis considers the regulation of the release and marketing of genetically modified sugar <b>beets</b> and <b>fodder</b> <b>beets</b> by the biggest plant breeding company in Denmark, Danisco —as a case study of science and technology policy-making under circumstances in which a large number of different social interests are actively involved in the policy-making process. Sociologists have paid considerable attention to the difficulties of policy-making under such circumstances. In particularly, they have emphasised that under the conditions of post modernity, issues of scientific ignorance, uncertainty and risk come to play a crucially important part in public debate and decision-making processes. The thesis develops Ulrich Beck's idea of reflexive modernisation, and Douglas Torgerson's notion of the "third face" of policy analysis - as tools for the analysis of Danish policy-making in the area of GMO release. Finally, the thesis considers the implications of the case study for current sociological and policy science theories of decision making in sceptical contexts. The general conclusion is that, throughout the policy implementation process, the Danish government consistently maintained a wholly supportive stance towards the development and application of modern agricultural biotechnology. But faced with a potentially sceptical and risk-averse public, the Danish government developed a sophisticated policy infrastructure that gave every appearance of: being somehow ambivalent about modern agricultural biotechnology; integrating both scientific advice and public perceptions in the decision making process; being cautious, transparent and responsible. However, this infrastructure curtailed considerable democratic scrutiny while facilitating the continued development of agricultural biotechnology in Denmark...|$|R

The following weed species: <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> without herbicides - Lamium amplexicaule, Chenopodium polyspermum, Anagallis arvensis i Echinochloa crus - galli; <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> with herbicides - Convolvulus arvensis, Lamium purpureum i Echinochloa crus - galli; spring wheat without herbicides - Capsella bursa - pastoris i Fallopia convolvulus; spring wheat with herbicides - Avena fatua; faba been without herbicides - Galium aparine, Anagallis arvensis i Convolvulus arvensis; faba been with herbicides - Galium aparine, shed diaspores in the greatest degree...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this study, <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> growing {{possibilities}} {{were examined}} in Middle Black Sea Region. The trials were arranged in randomized complete blocks experimental designs with three replications in 2004 and 2005 growing season. Two <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> cultivars (Ecdogelb and Ecdorot) at 5 locations (Bafra, Ladik, Suluova, Gümüşhacıköy and Osmancık) were grown. The highest root and leaf yields were obtained from Bafra and Osmancık locations (90. 6 - 86. 9 and 13. 1 - 12. 7 t ha- 1, respectively). While the highest root dry matter content was determined in Ladik, Gümüşhacıköy and Suluova locations (13. 9, 13. 6 and 13. 3 %, respectively), there were not significant differences among locations (10. 0 - 11. 0 t ha- 1) except Ladik in dry matter yield. Ladik and Gümüşhacıköy locations had the highest sugar content (8. 9 and 8. 6 %, respectively). It was determined that the highest root length was in Bafra location (23. 2 cm) and the highest root diameter was in Gümüşhacıköy location (10. 9 cm). Bafra, Suluova, Gümüşhacıköy and Osmacık locations were determined as suitable locations for <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> growing, whereas Ladik location was not suitable location for <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> growing because of high altitude, low precipitation and low temperature...|$|E
40|$|There is renewed {{interest}} in <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> (Beta vulgaris L.) production in Syria. However, recommended agronomic practices for maximizing productivity are limited. A field experiment was conducted in season 2011 - 2012 to study the effect of autumn and winter sowing on yields and its components of four <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> cultivars. The experiment was a randomized complete block design (RCBD) in split plots arrangement with three replicates, sowing dates {{were assigned to the}} main plots and <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> cultivars (Jamon, Splendids, Starmon and Vermon) were allotted to the sub plots. The results of T-Test exhibited the superiority of autumn date as compared with winter date, but in a small percentage. Sowing dates and varieties exhibited highly significant (p? 0. 05) differences in most of the studied characteristics (shoot weight. plant- 1, root/shoot ratio, root and shoot yield (t. ha- 1). Varieties affected all of the production traits significantly (p? 0. 05). Vermon surpassed the other cultivars in terms of the production studied traits. The conclusion is to sow <b>fodder</b> <b>beet</b> in autumn time in Al Raqqa, Syria, to attain the highest yield and yield components traits. Also The study recommends further trials identify optimum agronomic practices especially harvesting date, soil type, land preparation, fertilization and spacing in the other sites in Syria.

40|$|Forage and {{ruminant}} {{production in}} Western Europe have increased significantly since World War II. However, {{in the last}} decade the livestock production sector has come under increasing pressure as the European Union introduced the milk quota system, effectively curbing total national and individual farm production volume, and national governments increasingly took measures to reduce the losses of nutrients from these systems to the environment. In the late 1980 ’s in the Netherlands a project was initiated with the objective to design, test and further develop a farming system that can serve {{as a starting point for}} the development of dairy farms on dry sandy soils with average milk production (system ‘De Marke’) using the method of ‘prototyping’. First, a number of farming systems have been identified that, in theory, meet the formulated objectives. From this theoretically acceptable set one of the technically and economically most attractive and, from a research point of view, most interesting was implemented at the experimental farm ‘De Marke’ in 1992. The functioning of this system is monitored in quantitative terms by measuring flows of dry matter and nutrients. The results sofar suggest that on dry sandy soils strict environmental standards for losses of nitrogen and accumulation of phosphorus can be attained within a short time while maintaining the current milk quota. Grass, maize and <b>fodder</b> <b>beets</b> could be grown in such a way that the norms for nitrate losses could be met. Improved utilization of animal manure and lower manuring levels allowed a reduction in the use of fertilizer-N of 74 % compared to current practice. The input of P in feed and the output in milk and meat could be more or less balanced: P-surplus was only 18 % of that on the current farm. To obtain reliable results the research will be continued for a longer period of time because the system has to stabilize, the soil nutrient and organic matter stores and soil fertility react slowly to changes in management, and weather conditions are always variable...|$|R
