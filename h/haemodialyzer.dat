30|$|In 2017, one {{experimental}} study by Al-Chalabi et al. [89] using an animal model of ALF in pigs and one uncontrolled clinical trial by Huber et al. [90] including 14 patients with liver failure were published, {{both of which}} used a new device called ADVOS (ADVanced Organ Support). The laboratory prototype of ADVOS was first presented in 2013 [91] and included an extracorporeal blood circuit, a dialyzate circuit containing standard dialyzate with a 2 â€“ 4 % albumin concentration and a third circuit where the albumin dialyzate was divided into two parts. Before reaching the cation and anion filters, each part undergoes {{a change in the}} pH value by the addition of acid or base and is subjected to a temperature change, resulting in a release of albumin-bound toxins. The resulting dialyzates containing toxin-free albumin join with each other in order to reach the desired pH before entering the <b>haemodialyzer</b> again. In the animal study mentioned above, all of the animals treated by ADVOS survived (5 out of 10), whereas the pigs treated with SMT died in the 10 -h observation period (p[*]<[*] 0.01). Significant haemodynamic and biochemical improvements were demonstrated with ADVOS. A significant decrease in the bilirubin level was also demonstrated in the clinical trial published by Huber et al. [90]. No further clinical studies on this promising technique have been published so far.|$|E
