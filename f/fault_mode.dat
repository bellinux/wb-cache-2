The {{next day the}} rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed {{it was in a}} <b>fault</b> <b>mode.</b> Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. Spirit was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via X band to Mars Odyssey. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating – risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL ("Shutdown Dammit Until") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.|$|E

50|$|On January 21, 2004, the Deep Space Network {{lost contact}} with Spirit, for reasons {{originally}} thought {{to be related to}} a thunderstorm over Australia. The rover transmitted a message with no data, but later that day missed another communications session with the Mars Global Surveyor. The next day, JPL received a beep from the rover, indicating that it was in <b>fault</b> <b>mode.</b> On January 23, the flight team succeeded in making the rover send. The fault was believed to have been caused by an error in the rovers flash memory subsystem. The rover did not perform any scientific activities for ten days, while engineers updated its software and ran tests. The problem was corrected by reformatting Spirits flash memory and using a software patch to avoid memory overload; Opportunity was also upgraded with the patch as a precaution.

However, complete connectivity is impractical for large distributed systems.

Furthermore, we systematically analyze the load capacity of the ten-phase motor system under different fault modes. And a torque limitation control approach based on the <b>fault</b> <b>mode</b> is proposed, which was not available earlier. This approach is able {{to ensure the safety}} operation of the faulted motor system in long operating time without causing the overheat fault.

To develop the fault detection algorithm, experiment was performed under no <b>fault</b> <b>mode.</b> Total 65 experimental {{data were obtained}} from the experiment. Regression models for five heat exchangers which including one outdoor unit and four indoor units were developed by using these 65 data. Each regression model consists of seven inputs (inlet and outlet temperatures, pressure and mass flow rate of refrigerant, inlet and outlet temperature of air, fan RPM) and one output (heat capacity). Then based on these models, the fault detection algorithm was made. To ascertain whether the fault detection algorithm works well or not, series of faulty and no fault experiment were conducted. There are five working modes which including (1) no <b>fault</b> <b>mode,</b> (2) one of the indoor units <b>fault</b> <b>mode,</b> (3) two of the indoor units faults mode, (4) three of the indoor units faults mode and (5) all of the indoor units faults mode. Indoor unit fault was simulated by blocking the air inlet. The air flow rate was measured by a wind tunnel. Under this situation, the air flow rate was reduced by about 35 % of no <b>fault</b> <b>mode.</b> The fault detection algorithm works very nicely at five working modes...|$|E

We formally define {{the impact of a}} transient fault in terms of three basic parameters: frequency, observability and severity. We distinguish <b>fault</b> <b>modes</b> in systems whose noise environment changes dynamically. Based on these ideas, the problem of designing on-line architectures for transient fault characterization is formulated and analyzed for several optimization goals.

40|$|A hierarchical, {{decentralized}} {{diagnostic system}} is {{proposed for the}} Real-Time Diagnostic System component of the Intelligent Control System (ICS) for reusable rocket engines. The proposed diagnostic system has three layers of information processing: condition monitoring, <b>fault</b> <b>mode</b> detection, and expert system diagnostics. The condition monitoring layer is the first level of signal processing. Here, important features of the sensor data are extracted. These processed data are then used by the higher level <b>fault</b> <b>mode</b> detection layer to do preliminary diagnosis on potential faults at the component level. Because of the closely coupled nature of the rocket engine propulsion system components, {{it is expected that}} a given engine condition may trigger more than one <b>fault</b> <b>mode</b> detector. Expert knowledge is needed to resolve the conflicting reports from the various failure mode detectors. This is the function of the diagnostic expert layer. Here, the heuristic nature of this decision process makes it desirable to use an expert system approach. Implementation of the real-time diagnostic system described above requires a wide spectrum of information processing capability. Generally, in the condition monitoring layer, fast data processing is often needed for feature extraction and signal conditioning. This is usually followed by some detection logic to determine the selected faults on the component level. Three different techniques are used to attack different fault detection problems in the NASA LeRC ICS testbed simulation. The first technique employed is the neural network application for real-time sensor validation which includes failure detection, isolation, and accommodation. The second approach demonstrated is the model-based fault diagnosis system using on-line parameter identification. Besides these model based diagnostic schemes, there are still many failure modes which need to be diagnosed by the heuristic expert knowledge. The heuristic expert knowledge is implemented using a real-time expert system tool called G 2 by Gensym Corp. Finally, the distributed diagnostic system requires another level of intelligence to oversee the <b>fault</b> <b>mode</b> reports generated by component fault detectors. The decision making at this level can best be done using a rule-based expert system. This level of expert knowledge is also implemented using G 2...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} evaluating sensor placements {{on the basis of}} how well they are able to discriminate between a given fault and normal operating <b>modes</b> and/or other <b>fault</b> <b>modes.</b> In this approach, a model of the system in both normal operations and <b>fault</b> <b>modes</b> is used to evaluate possible sensor placements upon the basis of three criteria. Discriminability measures how much of a divergence in expected sensor readings the two system modes can be expected to produce. Accuracy measures confidence in the particular model predictions. Timeliness measures how long after the fault occurrence the expected divergence will take place. These three metrics then can be used to form a recommendation for a sensor placement.
