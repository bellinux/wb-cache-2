In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward <b>Kennedy</b> <b>said</b> that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E

25|$|On July 23, 2015, The New York Times {{reported}} {{the existence of}} a June 2015, memorandum to the Justice Department from the Inspectors General of the Intelligence Community and the State Department regarding the presence of classified government information in emails from the personal email account Hillary Clinton used as Secretary of State. A transmittal memorandum, written by State Dept. official Patrick F. <b>Kennedy,</b> <b>said</b> that, based on an assessment of a small sample of the contents of Mrs. Clinton’s private account by the two Inspectors General, it was likely that the entire body of emails contained hundreds of instances of classified information. In their joint statement, the inspectors general said that classified information in the emails had originated from U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the CIA and the NSA, and that it is illegal anyone to receive a classified document, or briefing, and then summarize or otherwise transmit that information in an unclassified email.|$|E

500|$|After {{missing the}} entire 1955–56 season, {{he came out}} of {{retirement}} to play half of the 1956–57 season to help the Leafs who were short on players due to injuries and were struggling to make the playoffs. Kennedy returned November 27 to train himself back into shape after the Leafs had won only one game in their last 11. He scored 22 points in 30 games, but the Leafs finished out of the playoffs. He shared the captaincy with Jim Thomson. A highlight of the season was March 16, 1957, when the Maple Leafs scored 14 goals against the New York Rangers and Kennedy got four assists in what is still the Leafs' all-time record for goals in a single game. When it became clear the team was not going to make the playoffs, he sat out the last two games so the management could have a look at a young Frank Mahovlich. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It was time for a new generation to lead the team." [...] Mahovlich had practiced with Kennedy the previous day and, in expressing regret at never having played in a game with <b>Kennedy</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Teeder Kennedy's last practice was my first." ...|$|E

[...] Michael Aherne, who plays The Commitments' pianist Steven Clifford, was an employee for the Dublin Corporation and took a three-month leave of absence to make the film.

500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Gerrick <b>Kennedy</b> <b>said</b> {{he liked}} the Robin character's charm and {{chemistry}} with Katherine, and said their story arc [...] "has already grown infinitely {{more interesting than the}} Angie Bolen mystery".

Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad said she was glad the episode was centered on the supporting cast, particularly praising the attention to Bob and Lee, but she said that did not like the direction the Andrew character had taken, and felt the relationship between Katherine and Robin had evolved too fast.|$|E
500|$|Unlike many Democrats, John F. Kennedy, {{who served}} in the Senate with McCarthy from 1953 until the latter's death in 1957, never {{attacked}} McCarthy. McCarthy had refused to campaign for Kennedy's 1952 opponent, Republican incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., due to his friendship with the Kennedys. When a speaker at a February 1952 final club dinner stated that he was glad McCarthy had not attended Harvard College, an angry Kennedy jumped up, denounced the speaker, and left the event.

500|$|Romney won by some 80,000votes {{and ended}} a fourteen-year stretch of Democratic {{rule in the}} state {{executive}} spot.

[...] Additionally, Romney had appeal to labor union members that was unusual for a Republican. [...] Democrats won all the other statewide executive offices in the election, including Democratic incumbent T. John Lesinski in the separate election for Lieutenant Governor of Michigan.
