40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>waves</b> are {{expected}} to intensify around the globe in the future, with potential increase in heat stress and heat-induced mortality {{in the absence of}} adaptation measures. India has a high current exposure to <b>heat</b> <b>waves,</b> and with limited adaptive capacity, impacts of increased <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> might be quite severe. This paper presents the first projections of future <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> in India based on multiple climate models and scenarios for CMIP 5 data. We find that <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> are projected to be more intense, have longer durations and occur at a higher frequency and earlier in the year. Southern India, currently not influenced by <b>heat</b> <b>waves,</b> is expected to be severely affected {{by the end of the}} twenty-first century. Projections indicate that a sizable part of India will experience heat stress conditions in the future. In northern India, the average number of days with extreme heat stress condition during pre-monsoon hot season will reach 30. The intensification of <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> might lead to severe heat stress and increased mortality...|$|R

5|$|Heat {{waves are}} a common feature of summers in the city. These heat waves place extra demand on {{electricity}} usage, leading to shortages. In extreme cases, these power shortages during heat waves can cause traffic jams and protests, such as the December 2013 <b>heat</b> <b>wave</b> (longest <b>heat</b> <b>wave</b> ever recorded in Buenos Aires) where increased energy demand lead to energy shortages and power cuts, protests against the government over the lack of service, and traffic jams {{as a result of}} these protests. However, most heat waves are of short duration (usually less than a week), and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind, which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Occasionally, a tornado can form, which can strike the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths. The greatest risk for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions. These severe storms can damage cars, houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste.|$|E

Soon, however, the piece suffered from weak ticket sales, generally ascribed to a <b>heat</b> <b>wave</b> {{that made the}} Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable. The historian Michael Ainger questions this explanation, at least in part, stating that the heat waves {{in the summer of}} 1878 were short and transient. By mid-August, Sullivan wrote to his mother that cooler weather had arrived, which was good for the show. In the meantime, the four partners of the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the opera's viability and posted closing notices.

5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl was {{an unusual}} Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclone that formed over southeastern Louisiana in August 1988. The second tropical storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl developed from a slow-moving trough of low pressure on August 8.

40|$|Abstract The aims of {{this study}} were to assess impacts of hot summer periods on {{mortality}} in the Czech Republic and to quantify the size of the short-term displacement effect which resulted in lower than expected mortality after <b>heat</b> <b>waves.</b> The analysis covered the period 1982 – 2000 when several extraordinarily hot summers occurred in central Europe. Daily total all-cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the entire population of the Czech Republic (approximately 10 million inhabitants) were examined. The daily death counts were standardized to account for the long-term decline in mortality and the seasonal and weekly cycles. Heat-related mortality is better expressed if 1 -day lag after temperature is considered compared to the unlagged relationship. With the 1 -day lag, both excess total mor-tality and excess CVD mortality were positive during all 17 <b>heat</b> <b>waves,</b> and in 14 (12) <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> the increase in total (CVD) mortality was statistically significant (P= 0. 05). The mean relative rise in total mortality during <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> was 13 %. The response was greater in females than males and similar regardless of whether total or CVD mortality was used. The largest relative increases, ex-ceeding 20 % in both total and CVD mortality, were as-sociated with <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> which occurred in early summer (the first half of July 1984 and June 1994). The mortality displacement effect played an important role since mor-tality tended to be lower than expected after hot periods. The mean net mortality change due to <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> was estimated to be about a 1 % {{increase in the number of}} deaths. The large relative increases during some <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> were particularly noteworthy since the study (in contrast to most analyses of the heat stress/mortality re-lationship) was not restricted to an urban area and/or an elderly population...|$|R

5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien planetoid, and the interiors of the Nostromo and the derelict spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a <b>heat</b> <b>wave,</b> these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.|$|E

In New Orleans, officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as a worst-case scenario, intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior. Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation.

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>waves</b> {{are among}} natural hazards {{with the most}} severe {{consequences}} for human society, including pronounced mortality impacts in mid-latitudes. Recent studies have hypothesized that the enhanced persistence of atmospheric circulation may affect surface climatic extremes, mainly the frequency and severity of <b>heat</b> <b>waves.</b> In this paper we examine relationships between {{the persistence of the}} Hess-Brezowsky circulation types conducive to summer <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> and air temperature anomalies at stations over most of the European continent. We also evaluate differences between temperature anomalies during late and early stages of warm circulation types in all seasons. Results show that more persistent circulation patterns tend to enhance the severity of <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> and support more pronounced temperature anomalies. Recent sharply rising trends in positive temperature extremes over Europe {{may be related to the}} greater persistence of the circulation types, and if similar changes towards enhanced persistence affect other mid-latitudinal regions, analogous consequences and implications for temperature extremes may be expected...|$|R
40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>waves</b> {{are thought}} to result from subseasonal {{atmospheric}} variability. Atmospheric phenomena driven by tropical convection, such as the Asian monsoon, have been considered potential sources of predictability on subseasonal timescales. Mid-latitude atmospheric dynamics have been considered too chaotic to allow significant prediction skill of lead times beyond the typical 10 -day range of weather forecasts. Here we use a 12, 000 -year integration of an atmospheric general circulation model to identify a pattern of subseasonal atmospheric variability that can help improve forecast skill for <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> in the United States. We find that <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> tend to be preceded by 15 - 20 days by a pattern of anomalous atmospheric planetary waves with a wavenumber of 5. This circulation pattern can arise {{as a result of}} internal atmospheric dynamics and is not necessarily linked to tropical heating. We conclude that some mid-latitude circulation anomalies that increase the probability of <b>heat</b> <b>waves</b> are predictable beyond the typical weather forecast range...|$|R
