Abrams and Gabe Newell announced that they had plans for a game and a film collaboration. Abrams said, [...] "There's an idea we have for a game that we'd {{like to work with}} Valve on," [...] while Newell said, [...] "We're going to figure out <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a Portal movie or Half-Life movie together". In an interview in March 2016, Abrams stated that while he has been working on many other projects since, he still has plans to direct these films in the future, with both films in the writing stage.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{initially}} uncertainty over whether a third series would be produced. In an April 2008 interview, Jones said [...] "We {{never intended to}} write a second series let alone a third. We don't want it to become predictable. We will see how the Christmas special goes and take it from there." [...] Corden added: [...] "We will write one <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it better. We have {{to be true to}} ourselves." [...] Corden and Jones completed the final draft of the Christmas Special by September 2008, although they ruled out writing the third series at the time due to pressures of other work, and repeating the wish not to produce a sub-standard script. After the 2008 Christmas special premiere, BBC Three aired a making-of documentary about the special, titled 12 Days of Christmas.|$|E
2500|$|However, in February 2015, rumors {{started that}} NBC was {{planning}} to bring the series back for 10 episodes. In May 2015, former star Sam Waterston (EADA/DA Jack McCoy) announced to The Hollywood Reporter that he supports and would join a revival of Law & Order, saying: [...] "You're darn right. Sure, I'd love it. Got to break the record." [...] Creator Dick Wolf has expressed wanting to use a L revival to do a [...] "ripped from the headlines" [...] storyline surrounding the murder trial of Robert Durst, Wolf said [...] " [...] I'd bring back Law & Order. Everybody who knows me knows it's something I want to do," [...] he continued, [...] "my only regret looking backward is all the great stories that we haven't {{been able to do}} for the past five years." [...] At the 2015 Television Critics Association summer press tour, Wolf noted everyone wants a revival, [...] "It is a question of...most of the people involved are very successful in their careers.

2500|$|Following an April 2008 set visit, Meyer {{opined that}} Pattinson and Stewart had {{developed}} chemistry so good it [...] "may cause hyperventilation". Pattinson revealed that Meyer {{had given him}} an early copy of Midnight Sun—a re-telling {{of the events of}} Twilight, narrated from Edward's point of view. He explained that: [...] "That is what I liked about [...] the job, because the guy doesn’t really exist that much, so you can just create whatever you want. Then, when I found out there was another book from Edward’s perspective, [...] we had the same perspective!" [...] In preparation for the role, Pattinson wrote journal entries as Edward and distanced from his friends and family, explaining that he [...] "wanted to feel his isolation". Physically, he revealed that; [...] "I was supposed to get a six-pack. But it didn't really work out." [...] One scene in the story sees Edward, a gifted pianist, compose a lullaby for Bella. Pattinson was given the opportunity to submit a composition for consideration for this scene, with Hardwicke stating; [...] "I told him he should write one, and let’s see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it work, because that would be really cool if it was Rob’s song. He’s a beautiful musician, a very creative soul, very similar to Edward. He just totally reads the most interesting stuff, and sees the most interesting movies, and is very introspective and diving into his existential self." [...] Meyer approved; [...] "If Robert could write a lullaby, that would definitely add to some of the mystique of the movie, wouldn’t it?" [...] While two of Pattinson's compositions do feature in the final film, the lullaby piece finally selected was composed by Carter Burwell.|$|E

2500|$|In Britain, Trainspotting was {{met with}} {{widespread}} acclaim from critics.

[...] Empire [...] magazine gave the film five out of five stars and described the film as [...] "something Britain can be proud of and Hollywood must be afraid of. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> Brits <b>can</b> <b>make</b> movies this good about subjects this horrific, what chance does Tinseltown have?" ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to find a certain {{effective}} methodology in the study of improving class practice power with a special emphasis on “reflection. ” In daily class activities, it is rather difficult to visualize teacher’s thinking process of “Plan, Do, Check and Action. ” In particular, the process from “Do”, “Check and Action” to “Re-plan is hard to grasp and visualize. However, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> successfully <b>make</b> it possible to visualize this process, it is certain that teachers will be able to improve their class practice powers by themselves. There are various formats for the reflection of the class. Above all, the specific format based on Kage’s “Shikake Theory” has been highly utilized so far because many teachers not only think that the format is easy to understand but also believe that it is useful for improving class practice power to give the teachers proper ideas for their purposes. If teachers use this format for the reflection of their daily classes, {{they will be able to}} visualize their thinking process from “Do,” “Check and Action”, to “Re-plan.

He was to express himself as deeply distressed at his estrangement from the major, and to request permission to call at the cottage, and say a few words in his own justification. That was all. The letter was not to be sent that day, for the applicants for the vacant place of Mrs. Milroy's nurse were coming, and seeing them and questioning them would put her father, with his dislike of such things, in no humor to receive Armadale's application indulgently. The Friday would be the day to send the letter, and on the Saturday morning if the answer was unfortunately not favorable, they might meet again, 'I don't like deceiving my father; he has always been so kind to me. And there will be no need to deceive him, Allan, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>make</b> you friends again.' Those were the last words the little hypocrite said, when I left them.|$|R
30|$|An {{interesting}} {{point of view}} about the reason of the disadvantages of MIP in routing and handoff latency is because the MH has the potential to move away from its home network and the HA. <b>If</b> somehow <b>we</b> <b>can</b> dynamically <b>make</b> the HA closer to the current location of MH, both routing and handoff efficiency can be achieved. Since the MH's home address is permanent, the MH's HA should not move. Therefore, the idea of Temporary HA (THA) emerges and the extension of MIP adopting the THA called HA Handover MIP (HH-MIP) is proposed in this paper. As will be shown in the analytical study, HH-MIP enjoys small handoff latency as well as routing efficiency, and signaling cost in HH-MIP is significantly less than that in ROMIP.|$|R

40|$|Ten {{models are}} {{proposed}} for predicting a student’s final grade placement in a computer-assisted instruction curriculum {{from the time}} the student spends taking lessons. Using data from approximately 2, 000 elementary students, the models are tested both for ability to predict final grade placement and for ability to describe all points observed throughout the year. Two of the simplest models, using only the most recent point and parameters estimated for the whole group, are best at prediction. The power function model with all parameters estimated individually for each student, while relatively poor at prediction, is best for describing all observed points. Several methods for predicting the amqunt of time a student will spend taking lessons during a year are also tested. In this article we consider 10 models for predicting a student’s progress through a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) curriculum. With each of these models, we {{would like to be able}} to predict a student’s final grade placement in a CAI curriculum as a function of the amount of time the student spends taking lessons in that curricu-lum. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> successfully <b>make</b> these predictions, then by adjusting the amount of time individual students receive during the year, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> help students reach individually determined grade-placement goals, or <b>we</b> <b>can</b> optimize, for a school or class, any objective that can be stated in terms of final grade placement. Earlier work in this area (Suppes, Fletcher, ¿k Zanotti, 1975, 1976) concentrated on mathematically describing student trajectories through the curriculum by fitting curves to a set of points that have already been observed. Here we focus on the somewhat different problem of predicting a future trajectory from past obser-vations. To test our models we use observations o...|$|R
