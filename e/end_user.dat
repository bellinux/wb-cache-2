5|$|In {{order for}} natural ice {{to reach its}} customers, {{it had to be}} {{harvested}} from ponds and rivers, then transported and stored at various sites before finally being used in domestic or commercial applications. Throughout these processes, traders faced the problem of keeping the ice from melting; melted ice represented waste and lost profits. In the 1820s and 1830s only 10 percent of ice harvested was eventually sold to the <b>end</b> <b>user</b> due to wastage en route. By the end of the 19th century, however, the wastage in the ice trade was reduced to between 20 and 50 percent, depending on the efficiency of the company.|$|E
5|$|Several {{countries}} employ {{government agencies}} to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories {{to the public}} in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests. Knowledge of what the <b>end</b> <b>user</b> needs from a weather forecast {{must be taken into account}} to present the information in a useful and understandable way. Examples include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS) and Environment Canada's Meteorological Service (MSC). Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public. Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found. In all cases, these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis.|$|E

5|$|In the past, {{the human}} {{forecaster}} {{was responsible for}} generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations. Today, human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters, such as model biases and performance. Using a consensus of forecast models, as well as ensemble members of the various models, can help reduce forecast error. However, regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system, large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run. Humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the <b>end</b> <b>user.</b> Humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast. While increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans {{may no longer be}} needed in the forecast process {{at some point in the}} future, there is currently still a need for human intervention.|$|E
5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known free {{space on the}} drive, gaining {{endurance}} and performance {{at the expense of}} reporting unused portions, and/or at the expense of current or future capacity. This free space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the <b>end</b> <b>user</b> to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly on the boot or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning often takes away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance.|$|E

The findings support the need for greater involvement of <b>end</b> <b>users</b> in the innovation development process and a more vibrant two-way communication process between scientists, intermediaries and <b>end</b> <b>users.</b> The results also suggest that the traditional diffusion processes are insufficient to ensure high levels of awareness and adoption...|$|R

40|$|Wireless access {{networks}} are often {{characterized by the}} interaction of different <b>end</b> <b>users,</b> communication technologies, and network operators. This paper analyzes the dynamics among these "actors" {{by focusing on the}} processes of wireless network selection, where <b>end</b> <b>users</b> may choose among multiple available {{access networks}} to get connectivity, and resource allocation, where network operators may set their radio resources to provide connectivity. The interaction among <b>end</b> <b>users</b> is modeled as a non-cooperative congestion game where players (<b>end</b> <b>users)</b> selfishly select the access network that minimizes their perceived selection cost. A method based on mathematical programming is proposed to find Nash equilibria and characterize their optimality under three cost functions, which are representative of different technological scenarios. System level simulations are then used to evaluate the actual throughput and fairness of the equilibrium points. The interaction among <b>end</b> <b>users</b> and network operators is then assessed through a two-stage multi-leader/multi-follower game, where network operators (leaders) play in the first stage by properly setting the radio resources to maximize their <b>users,</b> and <b>end</b> <b>users</b> (followers) play in the second stage the aforementioned network selection game. The existence of exact and approximated subgame perfect Nash equilibria of the two-stage game is thoroughly assessed and numerical results are provided on the "quality" of such equilibria...|$|R
