5|$|The initial non-military {{application}} of distributed element filters {{was in the}} microwave links used by telecommunications companies to provide the backbone of their networks. These links were also used by other industries with large, <b>fixed</b> <b>networks,</b> notably television broadcasters. Such applications were part of large capital investment programs. However, mass-production manufacturing made the technology cheap enough to incorporate in domestic satellite television systems. An emerging application is in superconducting filters {{for use in the}} cellular base stations operated by mobile phone companies.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} an {{algorithm}} to efficiently (re) -deploy the wireless mobile routers of a substitution network {{by considering the}} energy consumption, a fast deployment scheme and a mix of the network metric. We consider a scenario where we have two routers in a <b>fixed</b> <b>network</b> and where connectivity must be restored between those two routers with a wireless mobile router. The main objective of the wireless mobile router {{is to increase the}} communication performance such as the throughput by acting as relay node between the two routers of the <b>fixed</b> <b>network.</b> We present a fast, adaptive and localized approach which takes into account different network metrics such as Received Signal Strength (RSS), Round-Trip Time (RTT) and the Transmission Rate, between the wireless mobile router and the two routers of the <b>fixed</b> <b>network.</b> Our method ameliorates the performance of our previous approach from the literature by shortening the deployment time, increasing the throughput, and consuming less energy in some specific cases...|$|R
