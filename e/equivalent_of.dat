Finally, dioxygen re-oxidizes four <b>equivalents</b> <b>of</b> copper(I) back to copper(II).

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of {{adopting}} a post-grant review institution in the US patent system by comparing the “opposition careers” of European Patent Office (EPO) <b>equivalents</b> <b>of</b> litigated US patents to those of a control group of EPO patents. We demonstrate several novel methods of "twinning" US and European patents and investigate the implications of employing these different methods in our data analysis. We find that EPO <b>equivalents</b> <b>of</b> US litigated patent applications {{are more likely to}} be awarded EPO patent protection than are <b>equivalents</b> <b>of</b> unlitigated patents, and the opposition rate for EPO <b>equivalents</b> <b>of</b> US litigated patents is about three times higher than for <b>equivalents</b> <b>of</b> unlitigated patents. Patents attacked under European opposition are shown to be either revoked completely or narrowed in about 70 percent of all cases. For EPO <b>equivalents</b> <b>of</b> US litigated patents, the appeal rate against opposition outcomes is considerably higher than for control-group patents. Based on our estimates, we calculate a range of net welfare benefits that would accrue from adopting a post-grant review system. Our results provide strong evidence that the United States could benefit substantially from adopting an administrative post-grant patent review, provided that the post-grant mechanism is not too costly. ...|$|R

At 1200UTC on December8, Amy reached its peak intensity with winds of 220km/h (140mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg), which would classify it as a modern-day Category4 typhoon. At the same time, the tropical cyclone began to track slightly southwestward.
