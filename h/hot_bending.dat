40|$|AbstractTitanium alloy is {{frequently}} used in aerospace {{applications such as}} load carrying airframe due to their excellent mechanical and corrosion properties in combination with being comparatively light weight. However, it is well-known that titanium alloy is difficult to form at room temperature. So <b>hot</b> stretch <b>bending</b> and creep forming process is used to improve formability and reduce springback in forming titanium alloy profile. The principle of <b>hot</b> stretch <b>bending</b> and creep forming is leading a stress relaxation stage by maintaining the workpiece against the die for a selected dwell time after <b>hot</b> stretch <b>bending</b> stage. This allows the benefits of low residual stress and minimum springback including inexpensive tooling and good repeatability. In the present work, a set of uniaxial tension tests was performed on OT 4 titanium alloy at the temperature ranging from 773 K to 973 K and strain rate from 0. 0025 s- 1 to 0. 01 s- 1. Stress relaxation tests were carried out at the temperature range from 773 K to 973 K. Arrhenius model was employed to characterize the creep behaviour. Finite element model of <b>hot</b> stretch <b>bending</b> and creep forming process was created in ABAQUS.

40|$|While laser jet {{printing}} {{technology has been}} used for decades, there remain issues with consistent media output; media deformation, such as curl, is often introduced during the printing process. This deformation can be affected by factors external to the printer, such as the two-sidedness of media properties and the environmental conditions under which the printer is operated, as well as factors related to the internal processes and configuration of the printer. The purpose of this project is to provide Hewlett-Packard (HP) with a quantitative study on the effects of media fiber orientation, filler content, and moisture loss on curl generated during the printing process. Several brands of paper were characterized and compared. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed a quantifiable difference in filler content between each side of a sheet, leading to contrasting curl behaviors. Tensile testing was performed to determine sample fiber orientation, showing a predominant machine direction bias. A <b>hot</b> <b>bend</b> test was used to observe the variance in curl seen between the two sides of a sheet, while samples were fed through a laser jet printer to observe in situ deformation to validate observations from <b>hot</b> <b>bend</b> testing.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} the feasibility of a new concept in section rolling of thick strip, which either could not be rolled at present due to cracking at bent corners. Whereas, the {{second moment of area}} of sections could be increased through sharpened corners and increased gauge thickness. A heat assisted section rolling process is proposed. This process is based on application of high intensity heat on the inner surface of the strip, immediately prior to rolling. To investigate the new section rolling concept, the following work has been carried out. Firstly, the material property of the S 450 steel has been determined using the Gleeble simulator, followed by thermal conductivity tests. Since a freon was used to increase temperature gradient, the heat transfer coefficient for the freon-hot surface interaction was determined. Finally, the four point <b>hot</b> <b>bending</b> tests were conducted to validate the simulation model. For this purpose, a <b>hot</b> <b>bending</b> test rig was designed and fabricated, utilizing an halogen heater as the heat source. The results between experiment and simulation were compared and a good correlation was found. Then, finite element analyses of a single pass hot rolling process has been adopted to investigate the neutral axis shift and section thickening effects. It is revealed that localised heating creates bulging on the compressed surface. The bulged surface affects the both neutral axis and thickening of the formed parts. This research has demonstrated that localised heating has a potential to be employed in section rolling operations. It shows that the neutral axis of the bent region shifted closer to the tensile surface would reduce the tendency for surface cracking. In addition, the increase in thickness that arises at a bend would enhance the stiffness of rolled sections. Ultimately a process window for heat assisted section rolling has been established.

40|$|Abstract: In this work, a {{weld metal}} in K 65 {{pipeline}} steel pipe has been processed through self-designed post-weld heat treatments including reheating and tempering associated with <b>hot</b> <b>bending.</b> The microstructures {{and the corresponding}} toughness and microhardness of the weld metal subjected to the post-weld heat treatments have been investigated. Results show that {{with the increase in}} reheating temperature, austenite grain size increases and the main microstructures transition from fine polygonal ferrite (PF) to granular bainitic ferrite (GB). The density of the high angle boundary decreases at higher reheating temperature, leading to a loss of impact toughness. Lots of martensite/austenite (M/A) constituents are observed after reheating, and to a large extent transform into cementite after further tempering. At high reheating temperatures, the increased hardenability promotes the formation of large quantities of M/A constituents. After tempering, the cementite particles become denser and coarser, which considerably deteriorates the impact toughness. Additionally, microhardness has a good linear relation with the mean equivalent diameter of ferrite grain with a low boundary tolerance angle (2 ˝´ 8 ˝), which shows that the hardness is controlled by low misorientation grain boundaries for the weld metal...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} {{restoration}} and certain elements, nitrogen, sulphur, calcium and Misch metal, {{on the hot}} ductility of austenitic, high-alloyed austenitic and duplex stainless steels have been investigated by means of hot rolling, hot tensile, <b>hot</b> <b>bending</b> and stress relaxation tests. The results of these different testing methods indicated that hot rolling experiments using stepped specimens {{is the most effective}} way to investigate the relationship between the softening and cracking phenomena under hot rolling conditions. For as-cast, high-alloyed and duplex stainless steels with a low impurity level, the cracking tendency was observed to increase with increasing pass strain and temperature, being minimal for the small strain of 0. 1. No cracking occurred in these steels when rolled in the wrought condition. It could be concluded that the cracking problems are only exhibited by the cast structure with the hot ductility of even partially recrystallised steel being perfectly adequate. However, the recrystallisation kinetics of the high-alloyed austenitic stainless steels, determined by stress relaxation and double-pass rolling tests, were found to be so slow that only partial softening can be expected to occur between roughing passes under normal rolling conditions. In the duplex steel, the restoration is fairly fast so that complete softening can occur within typical interpass times in hot rolling, while certain changes in the phase structure take place as well. Sulphur was found to be an extremely harmful element in duplex stainless steel with regard to their hot ductility so that severe cracking can take place with sulphur content above 30 ppm. However, the effect of sulphur can be eliminated by reducing its content and by calcium or Misch metal treatments that significantly increase the number and decrease the average size of the inclusions. It seems that the desulphurisation capacity of an element is the most important property for assessing its usefulness in reducing the detrimental influence of sulphur. The hot ductility of type 316 L stainless steel determined by tensile tests was found to be better for nitrogen content of 0. 05 wt-% than 0. 02 %, while in double-hit tensile tests the hot ductility values were identical. The mechanism whereby nitrogen affects hot ductility remains unclear but a retarding effect on static recrystallisation was observed...|$|E

The base metal is submitted to two thermal cycles, one during welding, generating the heat affected zone (HAZ), and another during bending when this HAZ is reheated. Also, after the bending process is completed, heat treatment is required, which represents a third thermal cycle. The objective of the present work was to compare the effect of two different induction bending process conditions on the longitudinal SAW weld of two API 5 L X 80 steel pipes of 20 ” diameter, 19 mm thickness, Pcm of 0. 17 % and Σ NbTiV of 0. 11 %.

The bending parameters applied were 105 kW power at 2500 Hz frequency and 205 kW at 500 Hz A major microstructural decomposition of the welded joint occurred for the 205 kW / 500 Hz condition due to the higher heat input in function of the doubled power input during bending. These microstructural changes led to an inversion of the microhardness profile from the internal pass to the external pass as compared to the welded joint before bending. Tensile strength values obtained after bending were above the minimum limit (621 MPa) established for grade X 80 by the API 5 L norm, showing that these microstructural changes promoted by the bending process do not compromise the structural integrity of the joint...|$|R

However, the punch stroke increased for stretch flanging, i. e. increases in production time and cost. In order to reduce the punch stroke, a 2 -stage process using a recessed punch was developed for stretch flanging. In order to increase the safety of cars, the structure of body members was optimized. Front rail hollow sections act as an energy absorber during collision, and are permanently deformed in order to absorb the kinetic energy during the crash. These hollow sections typically joined by resistance spot welding have insufficient energy absorption, because the joint are not continuous. In order to overcome this problem, the hollow section is joined by hemming. Since the hollow section having hemmed joins is overlapped, the strength is increased in comparison with resistance spot welded joins. Although titanium alloy sheets are widely used for airplane parts due to its properties of high strength at high temperatures, low density and high corrosion resistance, ductility of the titanium alloy sheets is very low, and thus it is difficult to form the titanium alloy sheets at room temperature. The sheets are generally formed at elevated temperatures. <b>Hot</b> hat-shaped <b>bending</b> of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium sheet using the resistance was carried out. The titanium alloy sheet was successfully formed at the elevated temperatures, the bending load was reduced and the springback and oxidation are prevented...|$|R
