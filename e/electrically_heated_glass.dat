50|$|Volvo's {{first modern}} convertible, the C70 was {{manufactured}} in Uddevalla, Sweden {{on a separate}} assembly line from the 70-series sedan and station wagon. The four-seater convertible featured an <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> <b>glass</b> rear window, automatic (pop-up) rollover hoops system ROPS, seat belt pre-tensioners, boron steel reinforced A-pillars, front and side airbags, and a safety cage — a horseshoe-like structure around the passenger compartment.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} <b>electrically</b> <b>heat</b> <b>glass,</b> a {{microscopic}} tin(II) oxide coating {{is applied to}} a pane of ordinary float glass. This coating is perfectly transparent and conducts electricity. An electrical current is supplied by two busbars located {{on opposite sides of}} the glass. The electrical resistance of the Tin Oxide coating produces heat energy. This heat radiates from the glass in the form of infrared energy. The busbars are typically connected to a power control unit that regulates the flow of electricity and thus the temperature of the glass.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} made at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Laboratory of the {{operation}} of an <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> <b>glass</b> panel, which simulated a segment of an airplane windshield, to determine if ice formations, which usually result {{in the loss of}} visibility, could be prevented. Tests were made in the 7 - by 3 -foot ice tunnel, and in flight, under artificially created ice-forming conditions. Ice was prevented from forming on the windshield model in the tunnel by 1. 25 watts of power per square inch with the air temperature at 23 F and a velocity of 80 miles per hour. Using an improved model in flight, ice was prevented by 1. 43 watts of power per square inch of protected area and 2 watts per inch concentrated in the rim, with the air temperature at 26 F and a velocity of 120 miles per hour. The removal of a preformed ice cap was effected to a limited extent in the tunnel by the use of 1. 89 watts of power per square inch when the temperature and velocity were 25 F and 80 miles per hour, respectively. The results indicate that service tests with an improved design are justified...|$|E
40|$|The {{steady-state}} flow configuration in {{an array}} of parallel heated channels is examined with the objective of predicting the behavior of a reactor during a loss of flow accident. A method of combining the results of single tube experiments with a calculation scheme for the multiple tube array is developed. Only single ~single tube experiments were run. These are three possible flow solutions for a channel. They are as follows: gas and liquid flowing up, gas flowing up and liquid down, and both gas and liquid flowing down. This investigation eliminates the latter as a possible solution for a channel operating in {{an array of}} channels. For the two remaining flow cases the constraints of a common pressure drop across the channels and the satisfaction of continuity in the closed end plenum, determine a solution for each heat flux distribution over the array. The data in this investigation was obtained using Freon 113 as the coolant for an <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> <b>glass</b> tube. The data presented in not intended for use other than verification of the method of solution proposed. It is recommended that the coolant intended for use in the application be used with a prototype, rather than a model, channel in obtaining the single channel data. Atomic Energy Commissio...|$|E

40|$|Smoking free-base cocaine ("crack) is {{a serious}} drug abuse problem in many countries. Typically, cocaine is smoked mixed with tobacco or mari-juana in cigarettes, or it is inhaled as an aerosol {{produced}} by heating the base in a pipe. Presumably, this route of administration is popular because of rapid pulmonary absorption and rapid onset of action. Cocaine is not particularly volatile, {{and it would be}} expected to undergo significant decomposition during the process of smoking. Several pyrolysis products, including benzoic Lacid, methyl benzoate, N-methyl benzamide, methyl cycloheptatriene carboxylate isomers, methyl- 4 -(3 -pyridyl) -butyrate, and isomers of the product resulting from the elimination of benzoic acid from cocaine (anhydroecgonine methyl ester and isomeric compounds) have been reported (1). Whether these substances contribute to the pharmacology or toxicology of cocaine smoking is unknown. A recent study has indicated that in vitro, under conditions designed to mimic cocaine smoking, anhydroecgonine methyl ester (methylecgonidine) is the major pyrolysis product (2). We have also found that under a variety of conditions, anhydroecgonine methyl ester (AEME) is the major thermal decomposition product of cocaine (3). Consequently, it appeared likely that significant amounts of this substance would be absorbed by cocaine smokers. As a part of studies of cocaine pharmacokinetics and pharmaco-dynamics, we obtained urine samples from nine human subjects who had inhaled the aerosol produced by 100 mg cocaine base placed in an <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> <b>glass</b> apparatus designed to mimic a "free-basing " pipe...|$|E

40|$|It is not {{an unusual}} {{complaint}} that in patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis vulgaris or hand eczema, using warm water causes pain and/or itching of the injured skin. In using warm water, there are some patients with injured skin who do not complain of pain and/or itching and ordinary patients with skin injured as much as former who complain of pain and/or itching. This made us think {{that there must be}} a difference in the warm water used by these patients. Usually we get warm water from gas instantly heated water or from <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water. In patients using warm water from gas instantly heated water the complaints were more frequent than in patients using warm water from <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water. Residual chlorine in water is well known to be the main factor worsening skin disease. Therfore, residual chlorine levels in gas instantly <b>heated</b> water and <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water were measured at same temperature (40 ℃). Levels of the former were 67. 5 ～ 77. 5 % and that of the latter were 12. 5 - 31. 7 % of tap water. Then this significant difference in the levels of residual chlorine was thought to be a cause for the difference of complaints between patients using warm water from gas instantly heated water and patients using warm water from <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water...|$|R
