500|$|The first {{successful}} numerical prediction was performed using the ENIAC digital computer in 1950 {{by a team}} composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and computer programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. [...] They used a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics based on solving the barotropic vorticity equation over a single layer of the atmosphere, by computing the <b>geopotential</b> <b>height</b> of the atmosphere's [...] pressure surface. [...] This simplification greatly reduced demands on computer time and memory, so the computations could be performed on the relatively primitive computers of the day. [...] When news of the first weather forecast by ENIAC was received by Richardson in 1950, he remarked that the results were an [...] "enormous scientific advance." [...] The first calculations for a 24‑hour forecast took ENIAC nearly 24hours to produce, but Charney's group noted that {{most of that time}} was spent in [...] "manual operations", and expressed hope that forecasts of the weather before it occurs would soon be realized.|$|E
500|$|In September 1954, Carl-Gustav Rossby {{assembled}} {{an international}} group of meteorologists in Stockholm and produced the first operational forecast (i.e. routine predictions for practical use) {{based on the}} barotropic equation. Operational numerical weather prediction in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Weather Bureau. [...] The JNWPU model was originally a three-layer barotropic model, also developed by Charney. [...] It only modeled {{the atmosphere in the}} Northern Hemisphere. [...] In 1956, the JNWPU switched to a two-layer thermotropic model developed by Thompson and Gates. The main assumption made by the thermotropic model is that while the magnitude of the thermal wind may change, its direction does not change with respect to height, and thus the baroclinicity in the atmosphere can be simulated using the [...] and [...] <b>geopotential</b> <b>height</b> surfaces and the average thermal wind between them. [...] However, due to the low skill showed by the thermotropic model, the JNWPU reverted to the single-layer barotropic model in 1958. [...] The Japanese Meteorological Agency became the third organization to initiate operational numerical weather prediction in 1959. [...] The first real-time forecasts made by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology in 1969 for portions of the Southern Hemisphere were also based on the single-layer barotropic model.|$|E

During the last decade many papers have been published, devoted to the problem of inferring the dynamical mechanisms of the weather and climate changes from recorded data.

2500|$|Barotropic models {{assume the}} {{atmosphere}} is nearly barotropic, {{which means that the}} direction and speed of the geostrophic wind are independent of height. [...] In other words, no vertical wind shear of the geostrophic wind. [...] It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours. [...] In this type of atmosphere, high and low pressure areas are centers of warm and cold temperature anomalies. [...] Warm-core highs (such as the subtropical ridge and Bermuda-Azores high) and cold-core lows have strengthening winds with height, with the reverse true for cold-core highs (shallow arctic highs) and warm-core lows (such as tropical cyclones). A barotropic model tries to solve a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics {{based on the assumption that}} {{the atmosphere is}} in geostrophic balance; that is, that the Rossby number of the air in the atmosphere is small. If the assumption is made that the atmosphere is divergence-free, the curl of the Euler equations reduces into the barotropic vorticity equation. This latter equation can be solved over a single layer of the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere at a height of approximately [...] is mostly divergence-free, the barotropic model best approximates the state of the atmosphere at a <b>geopotential</b> <b>height</b> corresponding to that altitude, which corresponds to the atmosphere's [...] pressure surface.|$|E

Further, latitudinal variation of total ozone derived from these maps shows that the ozone increases at all latitudes over the Southern Hemisphere uniformly from April to July while over the Northern Hemisphere the monthly decrease at all latitudes is nonuniform. In general, these maps bear a close resemblance to the upper tropospheric circulation.

This structure is maintained for about two months. Moreover, the variability of the westerly jets is connected with the activity of planetary waves of zonal wavenumbers 1 (which shows westward phase tilt with height) and 2 (which shows little phase tilt with height) ...|$|R
