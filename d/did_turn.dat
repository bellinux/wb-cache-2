5|$|Virginia Tech's {{hopes to}} answer were smashed {{on the first}} play after Georgia's kickoff as Glennon fumbled the snap, losing the ball to Georgia's Quentin Moses. Georgia failed {{to pick up a}} first down {{following}} the turnover, but the fumble <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> into three points for the Bulldogs, as kicker Brandon Coutu connected on his third field goal of the day, giving Georgia its first lead since the first quarter, 24–21.|$|E
25|$|The Attorney General Robert H. Jackson {{left it to}} Hoover {{to decide}} {{how and when to}} use wiretaps, as he found the “whole business” distasteful. Jackson’s {{successor}} at the post of Attorney General, Francis Biddle, <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> down Hoover's requests on occasion.|$|E
25|$|He {{played only}} twice at {{first-class}} level in 1948, although he <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> {{out a few}} times for the Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship. In one of his two first-team matches, he took a career-best 3–26 against Northamptonshire in June.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{students}} of Hrushevsky, Krypiakevych never politically or intellectually rebelled against {{the authority of}} his mentor, Mykhailo Hrushevsky. Although he <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> away from Hrushevsky's populism to a pro-state interpretation of Ukrainian history, he revered his mentor's memory and in 1935 published a short biography of him.|$|E
25|$|The {{disastrous}} {{game against}} Surrey at The Oval in late August, when Worcestershire were humiliatingly dismissed for 25 and 40, {{proved to be}} his last in first-class cricket (Ashman took the single wicket of Bernie Constable), although he <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> {{out a couple of}} times for the Second XI in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1879, some Gundagai {{residents}} were in {{fear that the}} Ned Kelly gang was {{going to pay the}} town a visit and while Extra rifles and ammunition to defend the town.. were applied for and special constables were sworn in, the Kelly Gang <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> up in the town.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1975 a sparse crowd of 4,500 watched the Sting's very first home game and as it began so it {{continued}} with an average that year of around the 4,000 mark– although close to 14,000 <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> out to see the Sting take on the 1974 Polish World Cup team in a friendly.|$|E
25|$|Broadbent {{played no}} more {{first-class}} cricket after 1963, but he <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> {{out a few}} times in minor counties matches for Hertfordshire, making one List A appearance when Hertfordshire travelled to Durham {{in the first round of}} the 1964 Gillette Cup. It was a chastening experience: Broadbent himself scored 2, and Extras (13) was the highest score as Hertfordshire were bowled out for 63, losing by seven wickets.|$|E
25|$|Kean {{noted that}} some items of {{interest}} <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> up, such as NASA's general involvement in collecting space debris and analyzing it, including interest in sightings of lesser meteor fireball seen {{at about the same}} time. In addition, NASA sent out press releases to news agencies about these other fireballs. But NASA had nothing on the very widely reported and seen fireball associated with the Kecksburg case and issued no stories on it.|$|E

25|$|Fiddian-Green {{then became}} a master, and head of cricket, at Malvern College, and played no {{first-class}} cricket in 1923. However, for the following few years he <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> out for Warwickshire {{a few times a}} season during the school holidays, usually scoring good runs. There was then another gap until 1931, when he appeared for Worcestershire and scored 108 on debut against Essex. He kept wicket on a couple of occasions, and stumped Arthur Pothecary of Hampshire in August 1933.|$|E
25|$|Aside from LaRouche, some Democratic leaders {{during the}} 1980s <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> toward {{conservative}} views, albeit {{very different from}} the previous incarnations of southern Democrats. In 1988, Joe Lieberman defeated Republican U.S. Senate incumbent Lowell Weicker of Connecticut by running to the right of Weicker and receiving the endorsements of the Moral Majority and the National Rifle Association. Colorado governor Richard Lamm, and former Minnesota Senator and Presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy both took up immigration reduction as an issue. Lamm wrote a novel, 1988, about a third party Presidential candidate and former Democrat running as a progressive conservative, and Lamm himself would go on to unsuccessfully seek the nomination of the Reform Party in 1996. McCarthy began to give speeches in the late 1980s naming the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Federal Election Commission as the three biggest threats to liberty in the United States.|$|E
500|$|... "Nebraska" [...] {{contains}} a stunt sequence, in which Lori Grimes slams into a walker, {{causing her to}} swerve {{on the side of}} the road and overturn her car. Kirkman said of the scene: [...] "I had nothing to do with it. But it <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> out really well.

500|$|Regarding her {{involvement}} in a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, Foster confirmed to Larry King in 1997 that she [...] "would definitely be part of it." [...] She told Entertainment Weekly magazine in 1997 that [...] "Anthony Hopkins always talks about it. I mean, everybody wants to do it. Every time I see him, it's like: 'When {{is it going to}} happen? When is it going to happen?'" [...] De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a [...] "hunch" [...] she would not be. Foster <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> it down, confirming this in late December 1999.|$|E
500|$|On 24 August, Epstein asked Peter Brown and Geoffrey Ellis down to Kingsley Hill for {{the bank}} holiday weekend. Approximately 50 miles {{from his home in}} Chapel Street, Kingsley Hill was Epstein's country home in Warbleton, Sussex. After they arrived, Epstein decided to drive back to London alone because an {{expected}} group of rent boys he had invited failed to arrive, although they <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> up after Epstein left. Epstein phoned Brown at 5pm the next day from his Chapel Street house in London. Brown thought that Epstein sounded [...] "very groggy", and suggested that he take a train back down to the nearest railway station, in Uckfield, instead of driving under the influence of Tuinals. Epstein replied that he would eat something, read his mail and watch Juke Box Jury before phoning Brown to tell him which train to meet. He never called again.|$|E
500|$|During the 1950s {{the synagogue}} had been [...] "traditional" [...] (Conservadox), rather than {{strictly}} Orthodox; for example, the Monroe Street building had seating for {{men on the}} left, seating for women on the right, and mixed seating in the middle. Following Atlas's departure, the congregation formally moved from Orthodox Judaism to Conservative, hiring a Conservative rabbi, Joseph Reich, and, in 1957, moved to its current location at 3525 Cloverdale Road. In 1959, however, it hired as rabbi Aaron Borow, who had just graduated from the Modern Orthodox Yeshiva University. While Borow did not undo the synagogue's mixed seating, he <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> off the synagogue's microphone, and turn the bimah so that the cantor faced {{the front of the}} synagogue (rather than the congregation), in the Orthodox style. In November 1964, Borow was hired as rabbi of the Orthodox Nusach Hari B’nai Zion Congregation of St. Louis, Missouri, where he served until his retirement in 1999.|$|E

500|$|The prom itself {{took three}} very long days to shoot, {{according}} to Criss, and involved {{a lot of}} hard work, though he added that it was [...] "so much fun" [...] and the actors and extras involved [...] "had a blast." [...] In the original script, Kurt was persuaded to attend his coronation by Blaine. Colfer requested that Kurt [...] "do that for himself and not be persuaded by a second party", and events were duly changed. The actor had serious reservations about the episode, and called it [...] "the most difficult" [...] he had worked on; he explained that the combination of Kurt as prom queen, wearing a kilt and tiara and dancing to [...] "Dancing Queen" [...] caused him concern that [...] "they were just pushing it way too much", and that Kurt's [...] "helpful and progressive" [...] depiction would be tarnished. Once completed, Colfer conceded, [...] "it <b>did</b> <b>turn</b> out to be a beautiful episode. I was so wrong." ...|$|E
