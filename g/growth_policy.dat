A critical investigation of an important class of theoretical models is presented and relevance is given to variables known to be of crucial importance regarding <b>growth</b> <b>policy’s</b> design and implementation, mainly for developing countries. Levels of education, labor skills/learning, savings, provision of productive services (factors) by the government, and trade are key-variables coming from the new growth models investigated and these macroeconomic variables are shown to have strong appeal as <b>growth</b> <b>policy’s</b> design and implementation in developing countries are concerned...|$|R

40|$|In the 1960 s {{and early}} 1970 s <b>growth</b> center <b>policies</b> were {{included}} in the regional policies of countries throughout much of the world.

In the 1960 s, the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) implemented a <b>growth</b> center <b>policy.</b> Though {{much has been written about}} the ARC, there is little research on the Commission's experience in implementing its <b>growth</b> center <b>policy.</b> The author uses historical documentation from the ARC to assess the Commission's <b>growth</b> center <b>policy,</b> particularly in the context of growth center theory.
