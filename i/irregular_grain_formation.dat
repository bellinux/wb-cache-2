Hypocycloid motions occur both inside and outside the glass ring which confines the grain. Epicycloid motion only appears outside the glass ring. Cuspate cycloid motions, circle motion, and stationary grain are also observed. All these motions are related with both the initial conditions of dropped grain and the discharge parameters. The Magnus force originated from the spin of the <b>irregular</b> <b>grain</b> is confirmed by comparison experiments with regular microspheres, and it plays important role on these (cuspate) cycloid motions. The observed complex motions are explained in term of force analysis and numerical simulations. Periodical change of the cyclotron radius as the grain travelling results in the (cuspate) cycloid motions.

These equations are characterized by two parameters. One depends on the physical conditions of the system and the other reflects the nature of grain materials. An overall feature of the <b>grain</b> <b>formation</b> process is illustrated by the use of an analytic expression of the solutions. After the vapor cools down to the saturated state, a waiting time is necessary until the <b>grain</b> <b>formation</b> begins effectively. Size distribution is relatively sharp in general.

40|$|Eumycetoma is {{a chronic}} granulomatous {{subcutaneous}} infectious disease, endemic in tropical and subtropical regions and most commonly {{caused by the}} fungus Madurella mycetomatis. Interestingly, although <b>grain</b> <b>formation</b> is key in mycetoma, its formation process and its susceptibility towards antifungal agents are not well understood. This is because <b>grain</b> <b>formation</b> cannot be induced in vitro; a mammalian host is necessary to induce its formation. Until now, invertebrate hosts were never used to study <b>grain</b> <b>formation</b> in M. mycetomatis. In this study we determined if larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella {{could be used to}} induce <b>grain</b> <b>formation</b> when infected with M. mycetomatis. Three different M. mycetomatis strains were selected and three different inocula for each strain were used to infect G. mellonella larvae, ranging from 0. 04 mg/larvae to 4 mg/larvae. Larvae were monitored for 10 days. It appeared that most larvae survived the lowest inoculum, but at the highest inoculum all larvae died within the 10 day observation period. At all inocula tested, grains were formed within 4 hours after infection. The grains produced in the larvae resembled those formed in human and in mammalian hosts. In conclusion, the M. mycetomatis grain model in G. mellonella larvae described here could serve as a useful model to study the <b>grain</b> <b>formation</b> and therapeutic responses towards antifungal agents in the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of wide shear zones (or shear bands) was investigated experimentally and numerically for quasistatic dry granular flows in split bottom shear cells. We compare {{the behavior of}} materials consisting of beads, <b>irregular</b> <b>grains</b> (e. g. sand) and elongated particles. Shearing an initially random sample, the zone width was found to significantly decrease {{in the first stage}} of the process. The characteristic shear strain associated with this decrease is about unity and it is systematically increasing with shape anisotropy, i. e. when the grain shape changes from spherical to irregular (e. g. sand) and becomes elongated (pegs). The strongly decreasing tendency of the zone width is followed by a slight increase which is more pronounced for rod like particles than for grains with smaller shape anisotropy (beads or irregular particles). The {{evolution of}} the zone width is connected to shear induced density change and for nonspherical particles it also involves grain reorientation effects.

40|$|Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) {{stars are}} known to be sites of dust {{formation}} and undergo significant mass loss. The outflow is believed to be driven by radiation pressure on grains and momentum coupling between the grains and gas. While the physics of shell dynamics and <b>grain</b> <b>formation</b> are closely coupled, most previous models of circumstellar shells have treated the problem separately. Studies of shell dynamics typically assume the existence of grains needed to drive the outflow, while most <b>grain</b> <b>formation</b> models assume a constant veolcity wind in which grains form. Furthermore, models of <b>grain</b> <b>formation</b> have relied primarily on classical nucleation theory instead of using a more realistic approach based on chemical kinetics. To model <b>grain</b> <b>formation</b> in carbon-rich AGB stars, we have coupled the kinetic equations governing small cluster growth to moment equations which determine the growth of large particles. Phenomenological models assuming stationary outflow are presented to demonstrate the differences between the classical nucleation approach and the kinetic equation method. It is found that classical nucleation theory predicts nucleation at a lower supersaturation ratio than is predicted by the kinetic equations, resulting in significant differences in grain properties. Coagulation of clusters larger than monomers is unimportant for <b>grain</b> <b>formation</b> in high mass-loss models but becomes more important to grain growth in low mass-loss situations. The properties of the dust grains are altered considerably if differential drift velocities are ignored in modeling <b>grain</b> <b>formation.</b> The effect of stellar temperature, stellar luminosity, and different outflow velocities are investigated. The models indicate that changing the stellar temperature while keeping the stellar luminosity constant has little effect on the physical parameters of the dust shell formed. Increasing the stellar luminosity while keeping the stellar temperature constant results in large differences in grain properties. For small outflow velocities, grains form at lower supersaturation ratios and close to the stellar photosphere, resulting in larger but fewer grains. The reverse is true when grains form under high outflow velocities, i. e., they form at higher supersaturation ratios, farther from the star, and are much smaller but at larger quantities...|$|R

Torsional deformation under high pressure and equal-channel angular extrusion are two techniques that can produce microstructures with grain sizes in the submicrometer and nanometer range.

The microstructures formed by these two processing techniques are essentially the same and thus the processes occurring during deformation should be the same.
