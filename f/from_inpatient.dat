40|$|This review {{analyses}} {{the current}} Italian problem of clinical Staphylococcus isolates and trends in their antibiotic resistance. Most information {{has come from}} two recent nationwide collaborative studies. Some data have also been derived from particular experiences in individual laboratories. S. attreus was predominant among Staphylococcus isolates from most clinical sources. S. epidermUHs predominated in strains isolated from artificial devices, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. S. saprophyticus was isolated with greater frequency from outpatients than <b>from</b> <b>inpatients,</b> predominantly <b>from</b> urinary specimens. In spite of marked laboratory-to-laboratory and geographical variations, greater staphylococcal resistance to methicillin and most other antibiotics was noted. Overall, among clinical Staphylococcus strains isolated in Italy, {{more than a third}} of organisms <b>from</b> <b>inpatients</b> and more than a fifth of those from outpatients currently proved to be resistant to methicillin. The incidence of methicillin resistance was generally lower in Southern Italy than in the rest of the country, occurred at a twofold higher rate in isolates <b>from</b> <b>inpatients</b> than <b>from</b> outpatients, and was generally higher among isolates from intensive care units than from other hospital departments. There was increasing involvement of coagulase-negative staphylococci in human infections which made up about half of all clinical Staphylococcus isolates.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} resistance frequencies of common Gram-negative bacteria in a London teaching hospital. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibilities were analysed for the 6 years 1995 – 2000.

Results: Resistance rates for all agents and all organisms were higher in isolates <b>from</b> <b>inpatients</b> than in those from outpatients or general practice. For most agents and most species there was a trend for a highly significant linear increase in resistance over the study period, and there was significant cross-resistance between different agents. Increases in resistance were especially marked in Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Acinetobacter spp., organisms that tend to cause outbreaks of hospital cross-infection.
