2500|$|This art {{produced}} {{for commercial purposes}} has provided an important, sustainable {{source of income for}} the Huichols. Even though new materials are being used, traditional symbols are maintained and transmitted to younger generations. [...] However, the production of goods for commercial markets has caused a certain amount of controversy. One question concerns the “authenticity” of the yarn and bead art given the current forms’ modern origins. One person to do this was Fernando Benítez, who was particularly disturbed by the depiction of the dead as floating heads in yarn paintings; something he said was not traditionally Huichol. (origensbarnett) Much of the “authenticity” of the modern works {{has to do with the}} continued use of traditional symbols and designs. However, some items of Huichol items can be deemed non-traditional or borderline traditional, such as the production of Christmas tree decorations, masks of the sun and moon, the use of the jaguar (a Mesoamerican symbol) and the incorporation of modern images such as airplanes and modern buildings into designs. Selling of the items <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> for the Huichol either, with limited outlets such as tourist venues, especially Puerto Vallarta, Guadalajara and San Miguel de Allende as well as sales to middlemen who can earn much more from the works than they can.(CRUruibe) ...|$|E

2500|$|Trump {{was listed}} on the initial Forbes List of wealthy {{individuals}} in 1982 as having an estimated $200million fortune, including a share of his father's estimated $200million net worth. After several years on the list, Trump's financial losses in the 1980s caused him to be dropped from 1990 to 1995, and reportedly obliged him to borrow from his siblings' trusts in 1993; in 2005, The New York Times referred to Trump's [...] "verbal billions" [...] in a skeptical article about Trump's self-reported wealth. At the time, three individuals with direct knowledge of Trump's finances told reporter Timothy L. O'Brien that Trump's actual net worth was between $150 and $250million, though Trump then publicly claimed a net worth of $5 to $6billion. Claiming libel, Trump sued the reporter (and his book publisher) for $5billion, lost the case, and then lost again on appeal; Trump refused to turn over his unredacted tax returns despite his assertion they supported his case. In a sworn deposition, Trump testified that he once borrowed $9.6million from his father, calling it [...] "a very small amount of money", but could not recall when he did so; Trump has since told campaign audiences {{he began his career}} with [...] "a small loan of one million dollars" [...] from his father, which he paid back with interest: [...] "it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> for me", Trump told one New Hampshire crowd.|$|E
2500|$|Bicycle cranks {{can vary}} in length to {{accommodate}} different sized riders and {{different types of}} cycling. Crank length is measured {{from the center of}} the pedal spindle to the center of the bottom bracket spindle or axle. The larger bicycle component manufacturers typically offer crank lengths for adult riders from 165mm to 180mm long in 2.5mm increments, with 170mm cranks being the most common size. A few small specialty manufacturers make bicycle cranks in a number of sizes smaller than 165mm and longer than 180mm. Some manufacturers also make bicycle cranks that can be adjusted to different lengths. While logic would suggest that, all other things being equal, riders with shorter legs should use proportionally shorter cranks and those with longer legs should use proportionally longer cranks, this is not universally accepted. However, very few scientific studies have definitively examined the effect of crank length on sustained cycling performance and the studies' results have been mixed. Bicycle crank length <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> to study scientifically for a number of reasons, chief among them being that cyclists are able to physiologically adapt to different crank lengths. Cyclists are typically more efficient pedalling cranks with which they have had an adaptation period. Several different formulas exist to calculate appropriate crank length for various riders. In addition to the rider's size, another factor affecting the selection of crank length is the rider's cycling specialty and the type of cycling event. Historically, bicycle riders have typically chosen proportionally shorter cranks for higher cadence cycling such as criterium and track racing, while riders have chosen proportionally longer cranks for lower cadence cycling such as time trial racing and mountain biking. However, the evolution of very low rider torso positions to reduce aerodynamic drag for time trial racing and triathlon cycling can also affect crank selection for such events. Some have suggested that proportionally shorter cranks may have a slight advantage for a rider with a very low torso position and an actute hip angle, especially as the rider pedals near the top-dead-center position of the pedal stroke. Cranks can be shortened for medical reasons using shorteners such as Ortho Pedal ...|$|E

60|$|The colours of birds' eggs {{have long}} been a {{difficulty}} on the theory of adaptive coloration, because, in so many cases it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> to see what can be {{the use of the}} particular colours, which are often so bright and conspicuous that they seem intended to attract attention rather than to be concealed. A more careful consideration of the subject in all its bearings shows, however, that here too, in a great number of cases, we have examples of protective coloration. When, therefore, we cannot see the meaning of the colour, we may suppose that it has been protective in some ancestral form, and, not being hurtful, has persisted under changed conditions which rendered the protection needless.|$|E
