5|$|Billy Smith of the New York Islanders, in the 1979–80 season, was {{the first}} goaltender to be {{credited}} with a goal in the NHL when Rob Ramage of the Colorado Rockies put the puck into his own empty net. Smith was the last Islander to <b>have</b> <b>touched</b> the puck, and by NHL rule 78.4, an unassisted goal is awarded to the last player on the scoring team who had contacted the puck, {{in the event of}} an own goal.|$|E
5|$|A diverse {{range of}} groups have raised issues, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), over the welfare of animals, {{governmental}} and social agencies over health issues and compliance with nutritional labeling laws, and unions and trade groups over labor relations and laws. These situations <b>have</b> <b>touched</b> on the concepts of animal rights, corporate responsibility and ethics, {{as well as social}} justice. While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties. The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public.|$|E
5|$|Clark, Chloe, and Pete {{arrive at}} the dance, and say their goodbyes to Whitney before he leaves for training. The weather begins to deteriorate, and a storm picks up, as Lana takes Whitney to the bus stop. Jonathan (John Schneider) and Martha (Annette O'Toole) decide {{to head to the}} storm cellar to seek cover from the storm, and they {{discover}} Nixon just as the octagonal disk activates the ship. Nixon attempts to escape with the videotape, and Jonathan chases out into the storm after him. The ship levitates off the ground and flies out of the storm cellar. Lana says goodbye to Whitney and drives home. On her way, storm winds force her off the road, right next to three tornadoes that <b>have</b> <b>touched</b> down. The students at the dance are alerted to the tornados that have been sighted, and Clark races off to make sure Lana is all right. The three tornadoes merge into one large tornado and move in Lana's direction. Clark arrives just as Lana, in the truck, is sucked into the tornado's vortex; Clark speeds into the tornado to rescue her.|$|E

5|$|In Ireland, {{the failure}} of the French expeditionary force was the source of great frustration: Wolfe Tone, who was aboard Indomptable {{throughout}} the voyage, reported that he felt that he could <b>have</b> <b>touched</b> either side of the bay with both hands. Postponing the uprising, Tone continued to rally support in Europe, raising a fleet in the Netherlands for an attempted invasion that ended in destruction at the Battle of Camperdown. In May 1798, a British crackdown arrested the leaders of the United Irishmen in Ireland and provoked the Irish Rebellion. By the time the French had managed to gather a small force and reach Ireland in August, the rebellion was almost over and the inadequate French army, led by Jean Humbert, surrendered in September at the Battle of Ballinamuck. A subsequent invasion attempt the following month also ended in failure, when the invasion squadron was intercepted and defeated at the Battle of Tory Island. Wolfe Tone was captured at the action off Tory Island and committed suicide in prison. His death, combined with military defeat and reprisals against the Irish rebels, ended both the Society of United Irishmen and French invasion plans.|$|E

25|$|According to kashrut, {{meat and}} poultry may not be {{combined}} with dairy products, nor may they touch plates or utensils that have been touched by dairy products.

25|$|Many Stanford {{players and}} coaches objected {{immediately}} to the third lateral, from Dwight Garner to Richard Rodgers, asserting that Garner's knee was down moments beforehand. Kevin Lamar, a Stanford player who was in on the tackle, maintains that Garner's knee had hit the turf {{while he was still}} in possession of the ball; Garner and Rodgers themselves, however, assert the opposite. TV replays were inconclusive; due to the distance from the camera and the swarm of tacklers, one cannot see the exact moment Garner's knee may <b>have</b> <b>touched.</b>|$|E

The last goal of the regular season was scored by Kyle Calder of the Chicago Blackhawks in overtime in a 3–2 victory over the St. Louis Blues, which ended the 2005–06 regular season at 10:50 EDT on April 18, 2006.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Merkerson {{became the}} host of the show Find Our Missing which {{highlights}} the search for missing people of color.

Find Our Missing provides insight into these victims’ lives–their hopes and dreams, what makes them tick, and how they <b>have</b> <b>touched</b> those around them—from the people who know them best. The episodes chronicle the investigations into their disappearances, and why the search for them so far has only turned up dead ends.|$|E
25|$|A tornado in Eastern China killed 14 {{people and}} injured 196 others. Three {{villages in the}} {{province}} of Anhui were particularly hard hit by the storm. The tornado was extraordinarily long lived and destructive. It was estimated to <b>have</b> <b>touched</b> down around 2:50pm local time and lifted around 6:00pm local time, roughly 3 hours and 10 minutes in duration. Along the tornado's path 12,391 homes were destroyed and 3,180 were damaged. At least 30,000 people were affected by the tornado and damages were estimated at ¥55million (US$7.2million). Local news reports referred to the tornado as the worst in nearly 50 years in China. The Chinese Government reported that the tornado packed winds of at least 100km/h (60mph), equivalent to an F1 tornado.|$|E

25|$|The Bears {{headed south}} to face USC at home, putting their highest ranking {{of the year}} to date on the line against the #7 Trojans. Longshore got the start for the Bears and played for the first half, {{throwing}} two interceptions that were negated by penalties against the USC defense. The Bears held the Trojans to a field goal in the first quarter before marching down the field to respond with one of their own in the second, their only score of the game. Trojans quarterback Mark Sanchez, on the ensuing possession, then led USC on a 70-yard drive capped off by a 19-yard touchdown pass to Patrick Turner. Although the pass appeared on replays to <b>have</b> <b>touched</b> the ground, it was not overturned. The Trojans led the Bears 10–3 {{at the end of the}} half.|$|E
25|$|Weather {{spotters}} {{reported a}} funnel that may <b>have</b> <b>touched</b> down briefly {{several times in}} western Cherokee County, Kansas. The first observable damage was observed {{to the north of}} Melrose. It initially produced minimal F0 and F1 damage. One death occurred south of Columbus, Kansas where the tornado produced some F2 damage to several structures. It widened and intensified as it approached the Kansas/Missouri border; several homes were almost entirely destroyed and numerous structures were severely damaged. A couple was killed in their home by flying debris in this area. The now 1/2 mile wide tornado crossed into Jasper County, Missouri and raged through the center of Carl Junction, Missouri. More than 500 structures were damaged or destroyed and 2 additional deaths occurred. F2 to F3 damage was observed in Carl Junction. The storm then veered north and dissipated, moving just north of Oronogo. It had traveled approximately 25 miles.|$|E
25|$|Vigorous tornado {{activity}} {{continued on}} May 28. While the Storm Prediction Center only issued a slight risk that day, widespread tornadoes touched down in several states, some strong to violent. Several powerful supercell thunderstorms developed in central Kansas that afternoon, and large tornadoes were reported. Near {{the town of}} Corning, a strong EF3 carved an unusual V-shaped path through rural areas west of town, and completely destroyed two homes. An even larger tornado, an EF3 wedge that was over a quarter mile wide, touched down just west of Bennington, and remained nearly stationary in a field for over an hour. This tornado resulted in relatively moderate damage, but killed over 100 head of livestock. The tornado was originally rated EF4 based on mobile radar readings, but ground surveys did not reveal damage indicative of EF4 wind speeds, and the tornado was downgraded to an EF3 as a result. Later that evening, large tornadoes were sighted in southern Michigan, prompting several tornado emergencies. A total of six tornadoes were confirmed to <b>have</b> <b>touched</b> down in areas near Flint, two of which reached EF2 intensity and caused significant damage. Numerous weak tornadoes were documented in other states.|$|E

25|$|C.J. Barnes, {{portrayed by}} David Spade (2004–2005), is Cate's nephew. He was {{once in the}} Army and claims to have studied aerial {{photography}} during the Gulf War, and to have received a Purple Heart in combat, which is in complete contrast with his generally childish attitude. He is {{a teacher at the}} school and often pursues women, albeit unsuccessfully. When C.J. first arrives, the family is initially surprised. He reveals to them that he was ashamed that he did not live up to be the person Paul had once said he would be and avoided them because of that. He lives along with his grandfather, Jim, in the basement (having previously lived in a van, which was burned by that same grandfather). He once dated Mrs. Krupp, his cousins' (Kerry and Bridget) math teacher, but he ended up cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend Cheryl. He once revealed that his first initial stands for Corey, but Rory said that was untrue. C.J. previously smoked marijuana heavily (and in fact used to smoke with Kyle's older brother), but at the start of his appearances, he claims not to <b>have</b> <b>touched</b> it in two years (he originally claimed it was five, though he relented after Jim expressed disbelief).|$|E
