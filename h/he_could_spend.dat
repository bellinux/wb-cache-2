5|$|After {{his playing}} career, McBride retired to Florissant, Missouri, where he briefly owned a liquor store. He was enjoying the time <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> with his family, but the New York Mets called {{him with a}} {{coaching}} opportunity. In 1985, the organization hired McBride as an outfield and baserunning coach for their minor league system. He stayed with the organization for seven years. In the 1990s, McBride was a minor league hitting coach for the Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|The Regent of Madiun, Raden Rangga Prawirasentika, {{participated in}} funding the {{construction}} of Taman Sari. Prawirasentika also beseeched the Sultan to be relieved of Madiun's tax obligation. He offered other alternative ways of payment. The Sultan accepted his proposal. In 1758, the Sultan commanded the Regent to supervise the making of bricks and various complements, which {{would be used to}} build a beautiful garden. The sultan wanted a place where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> some time to relax after many years of wars that he had just experienced. Raden Tumenggung Mangundipura, under supervision of Raden Arya Natakusuma (who later became Sri Pakualam II), was responsible for the construction. The building was started in 1684 Javanese year (1758 AD). After finding out how large the complex was, Raden Rangga Prawirasentika realized that the cost would have been greater than the taxes. He resigned from the project and was replaced by Prince Natakusuma who continued the project to completion.|$|E

5|$|The couple put {{extra effort}} into {{avoiding}} {{the issues that}} had caused strife before their separation: Despite being an indifferent cook and housekeeper, Green {{tried to focus on}} cooking and keeping the new house cleaner, while Farrar vowed to curtail his work hours so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> more time with the family. The improvements lasted mere months, however, {{and by the end of}} 1994, both Green and Farrar had fallen back to their old habits and the marriage was again floundering. Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking forward to a trip to Peru the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to wait until after the trip to raise the issue of a divorce again.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the most}} heart-wrenching {{of the losses}} was that of Maria Sergio and her four children, 13-year-old Giuseppe, 10-year-old Anna Maria, seven-year-old Domenica, and four-year-old Rocco, who {{occupied}} a cabin on the starboard side of C Deck which was in direct line of the collision. She was traveling aboard Andrea Doria with her children {{on her way to}} South Bend, Indiana, where her husband, Ross Sergio, and their 17-year-old son Anthony, were waiting for them. Anthony Sergio had in fact sailed to the United States from Italy aboard the Andrea Doria the previous April. Also traveling with them were Maria's sister Margaret and her husband Paul Sergio, who also happened to be Ross Sergio's brother. Paul and Margaret had emigrated to the U.S. prior to the voyage and had returned to Italy for a visit and to accompany Maria and the children back to Indiana. Both Paul and Margaret survived the sinking, and for years after the disaster, Paul was haunted by the memory of his four-year-old nephew Rocco, the youngest of his brother's children, who just prior to the collision had asked if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> the night with his uncle.|$|E

Westport House was closed and with no rents forthcoming, the 3rd Lord Sligo borrowed where <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>spending</b> £50,000 {{of his own money}} to alleviate the suffering of the tenants. He imported cargoes of meal to Westport Quay and subvented the local workhouse, then the only shelter available to the destitute. He wrote tirelessly to the British Government, demanding that they do more to help the famine victims. He wrote and had published a pamphlet outlining many pioneering reforms of the economic conditions that had led to the famine. In 1854, on being offered the Order of St Patrick, an honour once held by his father and grandfather, disillusioned by Britain's Irish policy (a recurring sentiment at Westport House!), the 3rd Marquess wrote 'I have no desire for the honour.' ...|$|R
25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> the night and be driven back to the station {{in time to catch}} his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy leapt from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E

Robin was seen trying to manipulate Sunny and he locked Zeke in a store cupboard, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> time with her.

[...] Polls swung in Bush's favor; by not accepting federal matching funds for his campaign, Bush was not limited in how much money <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> on advertisements, while McCain was near his limit. [...] With three days to go, McCain shut down his negative ads against Bush and tried to stress a positive image. [...] But McCain's unconstitutional campaign finance law, line item veto, suing HMO and McCain opposed tax cuts, did not appeal to core Republicans in the state.|$|E

500|$|Development of Monaco began while Andy Schatz {{was working}} for TKO Software, before he founded his own {{independent}} company Pocketwatch Games. The game started {{as nothing more than}} a Pac-Man clone that he referred to as [...] "The Sims meets Diablo meets Hitman". After being turned down twice by Microsoft Game Studios, Monaco was released for the Xbox 360 by Majesco Entertainment. After discussions with Schatz, the soundtrack was composed by American composer Austin Wintory, who had worked on the soundtracks for games such as Flow and Journey. Andy Nguyen, whom Schatz met while he was looking for playtesters, quit his job at Citibank so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> more time helping with the development of Monaco as a level designer and producer, as well as working in booths.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{critical}} reception, Kaleidoscope Superior {{would remain}} the band's only commercial release; they were soon dropped from Sparrow's lineup due to [...] "creative differences and marketing conundrums". Earthsuit {{disappeared from the}} public eye and began posting on a website about a new independent album. In September 2001, Hutchison left the band so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> {{more time with his}} family. Rumors began circling that the band would break up. In 2003, Earthsuit revealed they were disbanding and released their last record, The Rise of Modern Simulation. The final collection featured six original studio songs and ten bonus tracks, including a live remix of [...] "Against the Grain", practice sessions of concert material, and covers of various songs. The album could only be purchased on the internet. Meany would later state [...] "most people didn't care when [...] broke up".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to recording at I.D. Sound, Rundgren took an 8-track recorder and some studio equipment, installing {{it at his}} rented home on Astral Drive, Nichols Canyon. 'Intro' and 'Breathless' were recorded here, along with various guitar and keyboard overdubs. A version of 'Torch Song' was also recorded, but was scrapped due to excessive background noise. Rundgren recalled that recording at home meant <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> time working on pieces of technology or production, such as programming a VCS3 synthesizer, at his leisure without wasting anyone else's time. The artwork on the original gatefold sleeve was also shot in this apartment. Despite working long hours each day in both I.D and at home, with minimum breaks for sleeping and eating, Rundgren said he enjoyed the recording experience, and [...] "wouldn't have had it any other way." ...|$|E

One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never <b>spend</b> the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself.

500|$|Although unconscionably perilous by {{the high}} safety, {{training}} and equipment standards of skydivers, whether Cooper's jump was virtually suicidal {{is a matter of}} dispute. The author of an overview and [...] comparison of World War II aircrew bail-outs with Cooper's drop asserts a probability for Cooper survival, and suggests that like copycat Martin McNally, Cooper lost the ransom during descent. The mystery of how the ransom could have been washed into Tena Bar from any Cooper jump area remains. The Tena Bar find anomalies led one local journalist to suggest Cooper, knowing that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never <b>spend</b> it, dumped the ransom.|$|R
500|$|As a boy, {{inventor}} George Escol Sellers knew Eckfeldt; as Sellers's {{father was}} {{partner in a}} firm which sold machinery to the Mint Bureau, Eckfeldt often dined at his house. [...] In the final years both of the 19th century and of Sellers's life, he published his memoirs, including memories of the first Philadelphia Mint. [...] He recalled in 1812 peering through a window to see cents coined, and Eckfeldt coming into the room to stop the work {{at the end of}} the day. [...] Seeing the young Sellers, he had the boy come in, had him place a cent planchet on the press, and struck it for him. [...] Sellers nearly dropped it because it was so hot, and Eckfeldt reminded him it had been cold when placed in the press. Eckfeldt bade him keep the coin until he learned why the cent had become hot, and then <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> it on candy.|$|E
500|$|Feynman did {{not return}} to Cornell. Bacher, who had been {{instrumental}} in bringing Feynman to Cornell, had lured him to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Part of the deal was that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> his first year on sabbatical in Brazil. He had become smitten by Mary Louise Bell from Neodesha, Kansas. They had met in a cafeteria in Cornell, where she had studied the history of Mexican art and textiles. She later followed him to Caltech, where he gave a lecture. While he was in Brazil, she had taught classes on the history of furniture and interiors at Michigan State University. He proposed to her by mail from Rio de Janeiro, and they married in Boise, Idaho, on June 28, 1952, shortly after he returned. They frequently quarreled and she was frightened by his violent temper. Their politics were different; although he registered and voted as a Republican, she was more conservative, and her opinion on the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing ("Where there's smoke there's fire") offended him. They separated on May 20, 1956. An interlocutory decree of divorce was entered on June 19, 1956, on the grounds of [...] "extreme cruelty". The divorce became final on May 5, 1958.|$|E
500|$|The first Silveto {{release was}} Guides to Growing Up in 1981, which {{contained}} recitations from actor and comedian Bill Cosby. Silver {{stated in the}} same year that he had reduced his touring to four months a year, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> more time with his son. This also meant that he had to audition for new band members on an annual basis. He continued to write lyrics for his new albums, although these were not always included on the recordings themselves. The song titles reflected his spiritual, self-help thinking; for example, Spiritualizing the Senses from 1983 included [...] "Seeing with Perception" [...] and [...] "Moving Forward with Confidence". The next albums were There's No Need to Struggle (1983) and The Continuity of Spirit (1985). His band for performances in the UK and elsewhere in 1987 included trumpeter Dave Douglas and saxophonist Vincent Herring. Douglas reported that Silver seldom gave direct verbal guidelines about the music, preferring to lead through playing. A revival of interest in more traditional forms of jazz in the 1980s largely passed Silver by, and his albums on Silveto were not critical successes. Its last release was Music to Ease Your Disease, in 1988. By the early 1990s Silver did not often play at jazz festivals, but his need to tour was limited, as he received steady rolyalties from his songbook.|$|E

500|$|On April 28, {{attorneys}} {{met with}} Santoro {{and said they}} made substantial progress on a revised plan. They reported having settled all disputes with Vick's creditors, including Joel. On August 27, Santoro approved the revised reorganization plan. It was supported by all of Vick's creditors but one who was owed $13,000. Every creditor was to be paid back in six years {{on the condition that}} an estimated $9 million in assets be liquidated. Vick was allowed annual living expenses of $300,000 under the plan. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> up to $3,500 a month for rent in Philadelphia and $750 for [...] "utilities and miscellaneous." [...] He was to pay $3,712 a month on the mortgage for his house in Hampton, Virginia, where his fiancée and two children lived, and could pay up to $1,355 per month in private school tuition for his children. Vick was also given up to $472 a month in car-related expenses. His mother was allowed $2,500 per month, and his former girlfriend Tameka Taylor was allotted $3,000 per month to support their son, Mitez. Vick was not required to pay creditors during his first season with the Eagles. Vick paid his agent, Joel Segal, $32,500 in 2010, $104,000 in 2011, and would pay him $160,000 each year from 2012–2015 for a total of $776,500. He paid bankruptcy lawyers $748,750 in 2010, $1 million in 2011, and a total of $2.6 million.|$|E
500|$|Noriega's {{relationship}} with the U.S. intelligence services was regularized during the 1970s, {{when he was on}} the CIA payroll; the CIA made its first regular payment to him in 1971. Previously he had been paid on a case-by-case basis. The CIA had valued him as an asset since the 1970s because he was willing to provide information about the Cuban government, and later about the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. On some occasions, the Panamanian embassy in Managua would be used by U.S. intelligence agents. Noriega was given access to CIA contingency funds, which he was supposed to use to improve his intelligence programs, but which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> with little accountability. The payments were as high as U.S. $100,000 in some years. However, the CIA was aware that Noriega was selling intelligence on the U.S. to Cuba at the same time. During negotiations for the Panama Canal treaties, the U.S. government ordered its military intelligence to wiretap Panamanian officials. Noriega discovered this operation in early 1976, and instead of making it public, bribed the U.S. agents and bought the tapes himself; the incident came to be known as the [...] "Singing Sergeants affiar". Although some intelligence officials wanted Bush to prosecute the soldiers involved, he declined to do so, because that would have exposed Noriega's role in the matter. The CIA did not report this incident to either the National Security Agency or the U.S. Justice Department. Noriega and Torrijos later used their knowledge of the U.S. wiretapping operations to tilt the Panama Canal negotiations in their favor.|$|E
500|$|The US ambassador, Elbridge Durbrow, {{described}} Bến Tre Province as an [...] "agricultural showplace" [...] {{and advised}} journalists to travel {{there to see}} Thảo's successful administration. The influential American journalist Joe Alsop changed his plans so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>spend</b> more time in Bến Tre, saying that the province [...] "particularly inspires hope". In one operation by Thảo's ARVN forces, American field journalists covering the battle saw their hours-long attempt to box in a Vietcong battalion yield only one farmer {{who lived in a}} hut with antigovernment slogans. Despite this, the American journalists and Vietnamese officers remained unaware that Thảo was a double agent. In fact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Halberstam misinterpreted the lack of attacks in Bến Tre, while other provinces were being ravaged, as proof that Thảo {{was one of the few}} capable government officials in the Mekong Delta. Journalist Robert Shaplen wrote: [...] "In all respects, Thao is one of the most remarkable Vietnamese around, being a conspiratorial revolutionary figure straight out of a Malraux novel and, at the same time, a highly sophisticated and astute man, whose talents, if only they were properly channeled, could profitably be used right now." [...] As Thảo was a former leader of the Vietminh, outsiders thought that his apparent success was due his first-hand knowledge of communist tactics. During his period as the province chief, Thảo set up the Council of Elders, a consultative body of 20–200 men and women, who were allowed to criticise local officials. He advocated the creation of the Council of Patrons, a philanthropic body to raise money for community projects.|$|E
