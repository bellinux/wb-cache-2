At {{the start of}} the Croatian War of Independence, Vlado Ćetković was captured by Croatian forces in Šibenik while being overhauled. It was commissioned with the Croatian Navy on 28 September 1991 as Šibenik (RTOP-21). Sometime between 1991 and 1994 Šibenik underwent a refit that included removing the P-20 launchers and installing two mounts for up to four Swedish built RBS-15 anti-ship missiles. As of 2014 Šibenik is in active service with the Croatian Navy.|$|E

5|$|Effective in the 2014 racing season, the {{grandstand}} capacity was reduced from 92,000 to 68,000. This {{was accomplished by}} removing approximately 12,000 seats near Turn 1 and <b>installing</b> <b>a</b> hospitality area and a digital display showing speeds along the straightaway. In addition, seats were further reduced {{as a result of}} modifying average seat width from 18 inches to 23 inches. The capacity quoted does not include luxury boxes and infield seating, which when added up reaches a capacity of approximately 100,000.|$|E
5|$|In spring 587, Philippicus {{was again}} ill, {{and unable to}} {{campaign}} in person. He assigned two thirds of his army to Heraclius the Elder and the remainder to generals Theodore and Andreas, {{and sent them to}} raid Persian territory. Heraclius the Elder besieged an unnamed strong fort, using his siege engines day and night until it fell. After <b>installing</b> <b>a</b> garrison in the captured fort, Theophanes the Confessor reports that Heraclius the Elder proceeded to join General Theodore at the siege of Beioudaes, but this seems to be an error. Theophanes seems to have misunderstood the relevant passage of Theophylact which has Theodore and Andreas joining at that siege.|$|E

5|$|Servicing Mission 3B {{flown by}} Columbia in March 2002 saw the {{installation}} of a new instrument, with the FOC (which, except for the Fine Guidance Sensors when used for astrometry, {{was the last of}} the original instruments) being replaced by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). This meant that COSTAR was no longer required, since all new instruments had built-in correction for the main mirror aberration. The mission also revived NICMOS by <b>installing</b> <b>a</b> closed-cycle cooler and replaced the solar arrays for the second time, providing 30 percent more power.|$|E
5|$|Shuey sat out {{the whole}} 2006 season, as he {{received}} a hip replacement. The procedure, which involved <b>installing</b> <b>a</b> metal hip, was performed in Montreal, as it was not approved in the United States. On February 2, 2007, he signed a minor league contract with the Orioles that included an invitation to spring training. He suffered an injury and {{did not make the}} cut, and was sent to the minor leagues. He made one appearance for the Class-AA Bowie Baysox, and then joined the Norfolk Tides, the Orioles' Class-AAA affiliate. His contract was then purchased on June 19, 2007, and he appeared in that night's game against the San Diego Padres.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Chadwick {{followed}} Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick {{earned his}} Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's {{assistant director of}} research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by <b>installing</b> <b>a</b> cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.|$|E

5|$|Buenos Aires {{attempted}} to retain {{influence over the}} settlement by <b>installing</b> <b>a</b> garrison, but a mutiny in 1832 was followed the next year {{by the arrival of}} British forces who reasserted Britain's rule. The Argentine Confederation (headed by Buenos Aires Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas) protested against Britain's actions, and Argentine governments have continued since then to register official protests against Britain. The British troops departed after completing their mission, leaving the area without formal government. Vernet's deputy, the Scotsman Matthew Brisbane, returned to the islands that year to restore the business, but his efforts ended after, amid unrest at Port Louis, gaucho Antonio Rivero led a group of dissatisfied individuals to murder Brisbane and the settlement's senior leaders; survivors hid in a cave on a nearby island until the British returned and restored order. In 1840, the Falklands became a Crown colony, and Scottish settlers subsequently established an official pastoral community. Four years later, nearly everyone relocated to Port Jackson, considered a better location for government, and merchant Samuel Lafone began a venture to encourage British colonisation.|$|E
5|$|By 1927, Yorkshire {{wished to}} appoint a more {{competent}} and permanent captain, instead of continuing the succession of ineffective amateurs, and planned to ask Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional, to take the post. Frederick Toone encouraged Rhodes to offer his resignation as senior professional, possibly {{with a view to}} <b>installing</b> <b>a</b> new regime, but Rhodes declined. Meanwhile, the proposed appointment of Sutcliffe caused controversy; some members of the county believed Rhodes should be appointed. Rhodes pointed out he had not been offered the captaincy, nor had his views been sought. He felt unappreciated when he was not offered first refusal of the captaincy. A poll of Yorkshire members showed a marked preference for Rhodes over Sutcliffe as captain; the disagreements persuaded Sutcliffe to decline the offer, and another amateur was appointed.|$|E
5|$|Commodore Josias Rowley {{was given}} {{command of the}} British {{response}} to the French deployment, a hastily assembled force composed mainly of those ships available at the Cape of Good Hope in early 1809. Ordered to stop the French raiders, Rowley was unable to spread his limited squadron wide enough to pursue the roving French frigates, instead using his forces to blockade and raid the French Indian Ocean islands in anticipation of Hamelin's return. In August 1809, Caroline arrived with her prizes at Saint-Paul on Île Bonaparte and Rowley determined to seize the frigate. He planned a successful invasion of the town, launched on 20 September, 1809, {{which resulted in the}} capture of the port's defences, Caroline and the captured East Indiamen. With his objectives complete, Rowley withdrew five days later. Almost a year later, Rowley returned with a larger task force and made a second landing around the capital of Île Bonaparte, Saint-Denis. Marching on the seat of government, Rowley's troops rapidly overwhelmed the defences and forced the island's garrison to surrender, renaming the island Île Bourbon and <b>installing</b> <b>a</b> British governor.|$|E

5|$|He faced {{a similar}} {{challenge}} with the impoverished bishopric of Argyll in the 1240s. He {{was given the}} job of restoring {{the viability of the}} diocese and <b>installing</b> <b>a</b> new bishop; this involved forming a close relationship with King Alexander II of Scotland. Clement was with the king during his campaign in Argyll in 1249 and was at his side when he died during this campaign. In 1250 Clement had been able to install a new bishop in Argyll and had become one of the Guardians appointed to govern Scotland during the minority of King Alexander III. By 1250 he had established {{a reputation as one of}} the most active Dominican reformers in Britain. Clement helped to elevate Edmund of Abingdon and Queen Margaret to sainthood. After his death, he received veneration as a saint himself, although he was never formally canonised.|$|E
5|$|In 1578, {{during the}} reign of Sebastian and {{on the eve of the}} fatal Battle of Alcácer Quibir, the flag was again modified. The number of castles was {{permanently}} fixed at seven and the royal crown was converted into a closed three-arched crown, which symbolized a stronger royal authority. With Sebastian's death and the short-lived reign of his great-uncle Cardinal Henry, in 1580, a dynastic crisis was solved with the Spanish king Philip II acceding to the Portuguese throne as Philip I, <b>installing</b> <b>a</b> Spanish dynasty. The accession was made on the condition that Portugal was ruled as a separate, autonomous state, not as a province. This was fulfilled as Portugal and Spain formed a personal union under Philip I and his successors. A consequence of this administrative situation was the maintenance of the flag created under Sebastian's reign as the Portuguese national flag, while Spain had its own. As the ruling house in Portugal, the Habsburg banner also included the Portuguese arms.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{the venue}} was {{upgraded}} for €1 million by <b>installing</b> <b>a</b> K60 inrun between the normal and large hill. This allowed the medium inrun {{to use the}} same outrun as the normal hill. In 2008, a small K25 hill, named Ninoufbakken, was installed slightly away from the main hills. The venue's certificate was due to expire in 2011, after which the venue would have to meet the International Ski Federation's (FIS) latest regulations. A €1.5 million upgrade program was initiated, which saw the inruns renovated, including installation of the Ski-Line track system and new Porsgrund ceramic tracks. The outruns saw new plastic mats and a new sprinkler system. The Nordic House, a sports centre, was also built. Construction started on the normal hill in May 2011 and on the large hill in August 2011, with completion scheduled for early 2012.|$|E
