5|$|Some {{residents}} claim that, {{independent of}} {{the truth of the}} Mussie legend, the legend's origins are older: supposedly, early settler Samuel de Champlain wrote of the creature's existence in the early seventeenth century. However, no concrete evidence of such writings has been uncovered, even though Champlain <b>did</b> <b>write</b> of loud screams from sea monsters living in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{explanations}} are highly {{specific to the}} historical periods he analysed.

5|$|Most of Kartodikromo's fictional works {{took place}} in Bandung or Surabaya. He was an early Indonesian example of the social realist movement. Like most {{nationalist}} writers at the time, Kartodikromo preferred writing in Malay (the predecessor of modern Indonesian) rather than his native Javanese; however, he <b>did</b> <b>write</b> several pieces in Javanese. While the state-owned publisher Balai Pustaka was attempting to standardise Malay, Kartodikromo experimented with the language, using words, phrases, and scenes which {{had never before been}} used.|$|E

5|$|Norton was {{the subject}} of many tales; one popular story {{suggested}} {{he was the son of}} Emperor Napoleon III, and that his claim of coming from South Africa was a ruse to prevent persecution. Another popular story suggested Norton was planning to marry Queen Victoria. While this claim is unsupported, Norton <b>did</b> <b>write</b> to the Queen on several occasions, and he is reported to have met Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Rumors also circulated that Norton was supremely wealthy—only affecting poverty because he was miserly.|$|E
5|$|After {{the court}} adjourned, St-Calais was held as a {{prisoner}} at Wilton Abbey until his followers in Durham relinquished the castle. Once the castle was back under the king's control, St-Calais was released, and left for Normandy, and no more was heard of his appeal to Rome. Pope Urban II <b>did</b> <b>write</b> to the king in 1089 requesting that St-Calais be restored to his see, but nothing came of it. In Normandy, St-Calais quickly became one of Duke Robert's principal advisors and his chief administrator. On 14 November 1091 he regained the favour of William Rufus, and was restored to his see. Duke Robert had persuaded the king to allow Bishop William's return, perhaps in recognition of a service St-Calais performed for the king by brokering {{the end of a}} siege in Normandy that the king's forces were about to lose. The end of the siege prevented the loss of the castle.|$|E
5|$|They also {{performed}} in Ireland on June 8 and the Netherlands on June 9. Zack de la Rocha had {{stated that it}} was a definite possibility that the band would record a new album, the first time since 2000's Renegades. Morter confirmed this, stating the discussions he and the band had backstage before the Finsbury Park gig saying the band <b>did</b> <b>write</b> new material, but they had no motivation to release them until now. de la Rocha mentioned the very strong reaction from the Download Festival 2010 audience as an incentive for releasing new material. In addition, the band returned to Los Angeles on July 23, 2010 for their first U.S. show in two years and their first hometown show in 10 years. The concert benefited Arizona organizations that are fighting the SB1070 immigration law. On the night of the show, a spokesperson announced to the crowd that ticket sales—all of which are non-profit to the bands—had raised $300,000. The band has been confirmed to do a short South American tour in October, performing at venues such as the SWU Festival in Brazil, the Maquinaria Festival in Chile, and Pepsi Music Festival in Argentina. It {{was the first time the}} band played in those countries.|$|E

25|$|In 966 CE, Ibn Babawayh left Qom for Baghdad. He {{travelled}} widely, {{learning about}} the tradition of Islam. Ibn Babawayh later {{emphasized the importance of}} tradition over speculative theology. His works reflect this interest in traditions and nearly all of them take the form of compilations of traditions. However, Ibn Babawayh <b>did</b> <b>write</b> a creed of Shi'ite Islam al-I'tiqadat. His pupil, the al-Shaykh al-Mufid, revised this creed in Tashih al-i'tiqad, critiquing several points.|$|E
25|$|In October 1834 a great fire {{destroyed}} {{much of the}} Palace of Westminster, which Adelaide considered divine retribution for {{the vagaries}} of reform.

25|$|However, {{despite the}} fact that so many Shakespearean {{scholars}} believed the play to have been written by someone other than Shakespeare, there were those throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century who argued against this theory. One such scholar was Edward Capell, who, in 1768, said that the play was badly written but asserted that Shakespeare <b>did</b> <b>write</b> it. Another major scholar to support Shakespeare's authorship was Charles Knight in 1843. Several years later, a number of prominent German Shakespeareans also voiced their belief that Shakespeare wrote the play, including A.W. Schlegel and Hermann Ulrici.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} feature of Italian musical {{form in the}} 19th century, and that which distinguishes it from musical developments elsewhere, is that it remained primarily operatic. All significant Italian composers of the century wrote opera almost {{to the exclusion of}} other forms, such as the symphony. There are no Italian symphonists in this century, the way one might speak of Brahms in Germany, for example. Many Italian composers, however, <b>did</b> <b>write</b> significant sacred music, such as Rossini a Stabat Mater and his late Petite messe solennelle and Verdi Messa da Requiem and Quattro Pezzi Sacri.|$|E
25|$|For a period, Fromm {{was also}} active in U.S. politics. He joined the Socialist Party of America in the mid-1950s, and {{did his best}} to help them provide an {{alternative}} viewpoint to the prevailing McCarthyism of the time. This alternative viewpoint was best expressed in his 1961 paper May Man Prevail? An Inquiry into the Facts and Fictions of Foreign Policy. However, as a co-founder of SANE, Fromm's strongest political activism was in the international peace movement, fighting against the nuclear arms race and U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. After supporting Senator Eugene McCarthy's losing bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Fromm more or less retreated from the American political scene, although he <b>did</b> <b>write</b> a paper in 1974 entitled Remarks on the Policy of Détente for a hearing held by the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probable}} that Hesiod wrote his poems down, or dictated them, rather than passed them on orally, as rhapsodes did—otherwise the pronounced personality that now emerges from the poems would surely have been diluted through oral transmission from one rhapsode to another. Pausanias asserted that Boeotians showed him an old tablet made of lead on which the Works were engraved. If he <b>did</b> <b>write</b> or dictate, it was perhaps {{as an aid to}} memory or because he lacked confidence in his ability to produce poems extempore, as trained rhapsodes could do. It certainly wasn't in a quest for immortal fame since poets in his era had probably no such notions for themselves. However, some scholars suspect the presence of large-scale changes in the text and attribute this to oral transmission. Possibly he composed his verses during idle times on the farm, in the spring before the May harvest or the dead of winter.|$|E
