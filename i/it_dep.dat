The relative growth rate was half the control value and the migratory velocity of neutrophilic cells and cell density index were markedly decreased. 5) The bone marrow from patients with chronic renal insufficiency was cultured, to investigate the megakaryocytic function, in a medium containing normal human serum. There was reduction in both megakaryocyte number and percentage of motile forms of megakaryocytes appearing in the growth zone. 6) The normal bone marrow showed a reduced relative growth rate and migratory velocity of neutrophilic cells, when cultured in a medium containing azotemic serum. 7) Similarly, the megakaryocytic function became depressed by an addition of azotemic serum to the medium.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the dynamics of}} cellular processes that are induced in context with intercellular communication, defined events along the signal transduction cascade and subsequent activation steps have to be analyzed {{on the level of}} individual cells and correlated with each other. Here we present an approach that allows the initiation of cell-cell or cell-particle interactions and the analysis of cellular reactions within various regimes while the identity of each individual cell is preserved. <b>It</b> utilizes dielectrophoresis (<b>DEP)</b> and microfluidics in a lab-on-chip system.

Expression of the activation marker molecule CD 69 was analyzed the next day and correlated with the previously recorded Ca 2 + signal for each individual cell. We found {{a significant difference in the}} patterns of Ca 2 + traces between activated and non-activated cells, which shows that Ca 2 + signals in T cells can provide early information about a later reaction of the cell. Although T cells are non-excitable cells, we also observed irregular Ca 2 + transients upon exposure to the DEP field only. These Ca 2 + signals depended on exposure time, electric field strength and field frequency.

The kinetics of clearance was also examined after single intratracheal (<b>IT)</b> instillation of <b>DEP.</b> Lungs were analyzed for DEP elemental carbon (EC) after exposure to DEE (0, 500, or 2000 mg/m 3 4 h/day, 5 days/week 3 4 weeks). SH rats had 16 % less DEP-EC at 500 and 32 % less at 2000 mg/m 3 in the lungs, despite having 50 % higher than the average minute volume. No strain-related differences were noted in number of alveolar macrophages or their average DEP load as evident from examining cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The kinetics of DEP clearance from lungs of male WKY and SH rats was studied following a single instillation at 0. 0 or 8. 33 mg/kg of DEP standard reference material (SRM 2975) from the National Institute of Standards Technology. SH rats cleared 60 % DEP over 112 days while minimal clearance occurred from the lungs of WKY. The pattern of DEP-induced inflammatory response assessed by BALF analysis was similar in both strains, although the overall protein leak was slightly greater in SH rats. A time-dependent accumulation of DEP occurred in tracheal lymph nodes of both strains (SH>WKY).

40|$|Inositol {{polyphosphate}} 4 -phosphatases (IP 4 Ps) are {{enzymes that}} catalyze the hydrolysis of the 4 -position phosphate of phosphatidylinositol 3, 4 -bisphosphate to form phosphatidylinositol 3 -phosphate. Database searches for proteins similar to IP 4 Ps {{led to the}} identification of two novel proteins: P-Rex 1 and P-Rex 2. These proteins, in addition to sharing similarity with IP 4 Ps, had a Dbl homology (DH) domain followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a characteristic feature of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). P-Rex 1 was recently isolated from neutrophils, where it {{plays a key role}} in stimulating the neutrophil oxidative burst by activating Rac, a component of the NADPH oxidase complex. Characterization of P-Rex 2 revealed that it shares 55 % amino acid identity with P-Rex 1, and a common but unusual domain architecture with N-terminal DH/PH domains, two DEP domains, two PDZ domains and a C-terminal IP 4 P-like domain. Furthermore, we identified P-Rex 2 B an alternate splice variant of P-Rex 2 that lacks the IP 4 P-like domain. Despite its 28 % amino acid identity with IP 4 Ps, phosphatase activity could not be demonstrated for P-Rex 2. P-Rex 2 was shown to be a GEF specific for Rac, and its GEF activity is conditional on the presence of phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate or the betagamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, both in vitro and in vivo. Both the lipid and protein effectors bound the PH domain of P-Rex 2. Analysis of the interaction of P-Rex 2 with Rac revealed the novel and surprising finding that the PH domain of P-Rex 2 confers substrate (Rac) recognition and specificity. This function has typically been executed by the DH domain and has never before been attributed to the PH domain of Dbl family GEFs. While DEP domains are domains of unknown function, PDZ domains are domains involved in protein-protein interaction. Binding studies with full-length P-Rex 2 revealed an intra-molecular interaction between the PDZ domains and the DEP and PH domains. This interaction obscures the Rac binding site on the PH domain of P-Rex 2, and provides an explanation for the inability of P-Rex 2 to catalyze exchange on Rac in the absence of effectors. Moreover, <b>it</b> establishes the <b>DEP</b> domains as novel ligands for the PDZ domains...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} cognitive style (CS) {{as a mediator}} between parental psychological maltreatment (PM) and depression (DEP) {{in a sample of}} adolescent boys. Rose and Abramson (1992) hypothesized that PM affects the development of DEP more than physical abuse (PA) or sexual abuse (SA) due to its unique characteristic of being a direct attack on an individual's self-worth (e. g., "You are stupid," "You never should have been born"). To assess PM in isolation, without confounding the data with other forms of maltreatment, PA and SA were measured and controlled in this study. In addition, {{this is the first time}} a comprehensive measure of PM (Comprehensive Assessment of Psychological Maltreatment - Child Version; Brassard et al., 2003 - 2011) has been used to assess the relationship between PM, CS, and DEP. A sample of 169 middle to upper-middle class ninth grade boys were administered five questionnaires: the Comprehensive Assessment of Psychological Maltreatment - Child Version, the Children's Cognitive Style Questionnaire (CCSQ; Abela, 1997), the Depression Subscale of the Behavior Assessment System for Children - Second Edition - Self-Report Adolescent (BASC- 2; Reynolds and Kamphaus, 2004), and the Physical Assault Subscale and a single Sexual Abuse item from the Conflict Tactics Scale Parent-Child (CTSPC; Straus et al., 1998). On these measures, 10. 4 percent of the participants reported significant PM, 8 percent reported negative CS, and 12. 5 percent reported at risk or clinically significant levels of <b>DEP.</b> <b>It</b> was predicted that the relationship between PM and DEP would be partially mediated by CS, when controlling for PA and SA, as existing research on the development of depression indicates numerous contributing factors (e. g., biological predisposition, negative life events). This hypothesis was tested using Baron and Kenny's (1986) four-step procedure for determining mediation and Sobel's (1982) test of significance. The results supported the prediction of partial mediation: controlling for PA and SA, CS was found to be a significant mediator between PM and DEP. Specifically, CS mediated 11 percent of the total effect of PM on DEP. Controlling for PA, PM alone accounted for 28 percent of the variance in DEP. Adding CS to the model increased the total variance in DEP to 30 percent. The results of this study suggest that PM specifically affects CS and subsequently DEP, which until now has only been speculated by researchers. Conclusions about the directionality of the data are based on a theoretical understanding that DEP and CS do not cause PM to occur. Due to this study's cross-sectional design, causality cannot be determined. Thus, the conclusions of this study must be interpreted with caution...|$|R
40|$|Nanobelts are a {{new class}} of {{semiconducting}} metal oxide nanowires with great potential for nanoscale devices. The present research focuses on the manipulation of SnO₂ nanobelts suspended in ethanol using microfluidics and electric fields. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) was demonstrated {{for the first time on}} semiconducting metal oxide nanobelts, which also resulted in the fabrication of a multiple nanobelt device. Detailed and direct real-time observations of the wide variety of nanobelt motions induced by DEP forces were conducted using an innovative setup and an inverted optical microscope. High AC electric fields were generated on a gold microelectrode (~ 20 µm gap) array, patterned on glass substrate, and covered by a ~ 10 µm tall PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) channel, into which the nanobelt suspension was introduced for performing the DEP experiments. Negative DEP (repulsion) of the nanobelts was observed in the low frequency range (< 100 kHz) of the applied voltage, which caused rigid body motion as well as deformation of the nanobelts. In the high frequency range (~ 1 MHz - 10 MHz), positive DEP (attraction) of the nanobelts was observed. Using a parallel plate electrode arrangement, evidence of electrophoresis was also found for DC and low frequency (Hz) voltages. The existence of negative DEP effect is unusual considering the fact that if bulk SnO₂ conductivity and permittivity values are used in combination with ethanol properties to calculate the Clausius Mossotti factor using the simple dipole approximation theory; <b>it</b> predicts positive <b>DEP</b> for most of the frequency range experimentally studied. A fluidic nanobelt alignment technique was studied and used in the fabrication of single nanobelt devices with small electrode gaps. These devices were primarily used for conducting impedance spectroscopy measurements to obtain an estimate of the nanobelt electrical conductivity. Parametric numerical studies were conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics software package to understand the different aspects of the DEP phenomenon in nanobelts. The DEP induced forces and torques were computed using the Maxwell Stress Tensor (MST) approach. The DEP force on the nanobelt was calculated for a range of nanobelt conductivity values. The simulation results indicate that the experimentally observed behavior can be explained if the nanobelt is modeled as having two components: an electrically conductive interior and a nonconductive outer layer surrounding it. This forms the basis for an explanation of the negative DEP observed in SnO₂ nanobelts suspended in ethanol. It is thought that the nonconductive layer is due to depletion of the charge carriers from the nanobelt surface regions. This is consistent with the fact that surface depletion is a commonly observed phenomenon in SnO₂ and other semiconducting metal oxide materials. The major research contribution of this work is that, since nanostructures have large surface areas, surface dominant properties are important. Considering only bulk electrical properties can predict misleading DEP characteristics. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Peter J. Hesketh; Committee Member: Dr. F.
