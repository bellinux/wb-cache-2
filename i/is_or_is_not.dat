The IS NULL and IS NOT NULL predicates (which use a postfix syntax) test whether data <b>is,</b> <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> Null.|$|E
5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual uncertainty arises when {{the language is}} unclear, {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. Evidential uncertainty is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who <b>is</b> <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a beneficiary.|$|E

25|$|As {{well as the}} sovereign, the Commonwealth realms share {{a single}} royal family. The family is {{frequently}} referred to informally as the British Royal Family, sometimes in conflict with official national titles, {{such as those in}} Canada. Though there is no strict legal or formal definition of who <b>is</b> <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a member of the Royal Family, the group is loosely defined as the extended family of the monarch, and these persons constitute the apex of a modern royal court.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian Royal Family is a {{group of}} people related to the country's monarch and, as such, {{belonging}} to the House of Windsor.

But detailed mapping just past the intersection shows only a complex and confused pattern of faulting, with no indication that there <b>is,</b> <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> through-going faulting. Mapping of areas further east that might clarify the pattern is not currently planned.|$|E

25|$|Chickenpox is an {{airborne}} disease which spreads easily {{through the}} coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread {{from one to}} {{two days before the}} rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. The disease can usually be diagnosed based on the presenting symptom; however, in unusual cases it may be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the blister fluid or scabs. Testing for antibodies may be done to determine if a person <b>is</b> <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> immune. People usually only get chickenpox once. Although reinfections by the virus occur, these reinfections usually do not cause any symptoms.|$|E

25|$|The British {{royal family}} {{comprises}} the monarch of the United Kingdom and her close relations. There is no strict legal or formal definition of who <b>is</b> <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{a member of}} the British royal family and, apart from Queen Elizabeth II herself, different lists include different people. Those who at the time are entitled to the style His or Her Royal Highness (HRH), and any styled His or Her Majesty (HM), are normally considered members, including those so styled before the beginning of the current monarch's reign. By this criterion, a list of the current royal family will usually include the monarch, the children and male-line grandchildren of the monarch and previous monarchs, the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, and all their current or widowed spouses.|$|E
25|$|Criticism of Hrdy's {{hypothesis}} {{emerges from}} evidence {{which suggests that}} male primates can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others. In one study, researchers analysed the DNA of 75 juvenile baboons to conclude who fathered them. They found that males selectively cared for their own offspring, particularly when their offspring became involved in aggressive confrontations which posed the possibility of injuries or {{a threat to their}} social standing. Evidently, if males can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others, then there is no purpose in the female attempting to create paternity confusion during the pregnancy stage. This would be counter-intuitive, as, once the offspring is born, the males will know whether the offspring <b>is,</b> <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> their own. Future research will need to be conducted in this vein to investigate whether males in other species show the ability to discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others before coming to any decisive conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Adding to {{the general}} {{confusion}} as to what <b>is</b> <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a dime novel, many of the series, though similar in design and subject, cost ten to fifteen cents. Beadle & Adams complicated the matter by issuing some titles in the same salmon-colored covers at different prices. Also, {{there were a number}} of ten-cent, paper-covered books of the period that featured medieval romance stories and melodramatic tales. This makes it hard to define what falls in the category of the dime novel, with classification depending on format, price, or style of material. Examples of dime novel series that illustrate the diversity of the form include Bunce's Ten Cent Novels, Brady's Mercury Stories, Beadle's Dime Novels, Irwin P. Beadle's Ten Cent Stories, Munro's Ten Cent Novels, Dawley's Ten Penny Novels, Fireside Series, Chaney's Union Novels, DeWitt's Ten Cent Romances, Champion Novels, Frank Starr's American Novels, Ten Cent Novelettes, Richmond's Sensation Novels, and Ten Cent Irish Novels.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} {{investigative tool}} at the player's disposal is the Voight-Kampff machine, which tests people {{to determine if}} they are replicants. Usually, Voight-Kampff tests are automatically triggered at certain predetermined points in the game, although on occasion, the player has the option of administering a test. The test depicts a close-up of the subject's eye, and features three needles. The further the top needle moves to the right, the more likely the subject is a replicant; the further the bottom needle moves to the right, {{the more likely they are}} human. The third needle is on a sweeping axis and measures the intensity of the questions (for every question the player can choose low, medium or high intensity), and the pressure felt by the subject. If the player pushes the subject too far, by asking too many high intensity questions, the test will end before a definite result can be obtained. If the player determines with certainty whether a subject <b>is</b> <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a replicant, the test ends automatically. The player must then decide what course of action to take, with the decision influencing the rest of the storyline; for example, if a subject tests positive as a replicant, the player can kill them, attempt to arrest them, or let them go.|$|E
