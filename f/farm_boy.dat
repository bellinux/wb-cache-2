40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{contribute}} to an improvement in educational and occupational guidance of rural farm males in Nebraska. The specific objectives were (1) to describe the educational and occupational plans of <b>farm</b> <b>boys,</b> (2) to relate the theory of choice to occupational planning, (3) to relate occupational plans and actual occupations engaged in three years after high school graduation, (4) to appraise the relative importance of factors influencing educational and occupational plans, (5) to analyze the characteristics which differentiate <b>farm</b> <b>boys</b> relative to plans for agricultural careers and nonagricultural careers, and (6) to translate this information into “Hints for Guidance of <b>Farm</b> <b>Boys.</b> ” Some of the conclusions of this study are: 1. More than one half of the rural farm high school graduates will either seek additional education or be in the military service three years following graduation. 2. One half of the rural <b>farm</b> <b>boys</b> actually will enter an institution of higher education. 3. Rural farm seniors in high school are aware of the obstacles to entry into an occupation.

He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E

40|$|This {{bulletin}} {{reports the}} findings of an exploratory study of the long-range occupational plans of Iowa <b>farm</b> <b>boys</b> in their {{senior year of high}} school. The primary objectives of the study were: (1) to relate the theory of choice to occupational planning, (2) to describe the occupational plans of the boys, (3) to determine the characteristics which differentiate boys who plan to <b>farm</b> from <b>boys</b> who plan nonfarm careers and (4) to appraise the relative importance of factors influencing farm-nonfarm occupational plans. Application of the theory of choice to occupational planning resulted in three general hypotheses to explain why some <b>farm</b> <b>boys</b> plan to <b>farm</b> while others plan nonfarm occupations. These hypotheses involved individual differences in (1) occupational satisfaction functions (preference systems), (2) available resources and (3) the results expected from using given resources in farm and nonfarm employments. Various operational hypotheses derived from the general hypotheses were evaluated on the basis of evidence obtained from a state-wide sample of senior <b>farm</b> <b>boys</b> attending Iowa high schools in rural areas and cities under 25, 000 population in the spring of 1959...|$|R

The two boys become fast friends, and Superboy builds Lex a fully stocked laboratory to allow him to conduct his experiments. Lex uses the lab to search for a cure for Superboy's weakness to Kryptonite. Just after Lex discovers the cure, a fire breaks out in his lab. When Superboy puts out the fire, the antidote is destroyed, along with a protoplasmic life form that Lex created, and Lex also loses all his hair. Lex blames Superboy for destroying his experiment and his hair loss, accusing the Boy of Steel of jealousy over his brilliance. Lex swears that he will prove to the world that he is superior to Superboy. Lex does this by trying to implement a series of scientific quality-of-life improvements for Smallville's residents; however, each invention of Lex's winds up backfiring, requiring Superboy to intervene. This series of setbacks results in Lex dedicating his life to destroying Superboy. In the years that follow, Lex becomes Superboy's (and then Superman's) archfoe. Superboy soon acquires a small rogues gallery of recurring villains, including Lex.|$|E

500|$|As Douglas and {{the other}} {{candidates}} went through with their campaigns, Lincoln {{was the only one}} of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of [...] "free labor", whereby a common <b>farm</b> <b>boy</b> could work his way to the top by his own efforts.

[...] Four years later, he supported the Republican candidate, former Illinois representative Abraham Lincoln, in the 1860 presidential race, marching in processions of the Wide Awakes and other pro-Lincoln groups, and attending as many rallies as he could. Impressed enough by one speaker to follow him to a neighboring town, he learned not to make the same speech twice in two days—at least, not in venues close to each other.|$|E
500|$|Bryan Byun, of DVD Verdict, {{believes}} that Welling {{was the perfect}} choice for Clark Kent: [...] "I can't imagine a more ideal actor to play this superpowered <b>farm</b> <b>boy</b> than Tom Welling, with his wholesome, honest face and heroic good looks—Welling not only resembles Christopher Reeve physically, but has all of the earnest charm that made Reeve the quintessential Superman." [...] The Free Lance–Stars Ron Hedelt likened Welling's performances as Clark Kent to that of Christopher Reeve's performances in the Superman films, stating that Welling manages to portray a [...] "... sweet, unassuming teenager ..." [...] while showing Clark struggle with the truth about himself. Comics2Film's Rob Worley also wrote of the physical resemblance Welling has to Christopher Reeve, noting that the actor gave the character depth with his convincing portrayal of Clark's longing to fit in. When comparing Smallville's Clark Kent to Bryan Singer's Superman (Brandon Routh) in Superman Returns, Seattle Times Julia Waterhous found Smallville's Clark Kent to be the more intriguing character. Waterhous explained that {{this was due to}} the inner turmoil of Clark— not being able to tell those he loved his secret— and the fact that no matter what his faults were he continued to put others before himself, remaining [...] "... pure and good ...". She explained that this allowed the audience to become intimate with the character, something lacking in the film version. According to the Associated Press, Welling's popularity as Clark Kent on Smallville had fans of the show wishing he would take the role Routh received in Superman Returns.|$|E
