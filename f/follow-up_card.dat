40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the mother and child health care given by primary health care units after Marmara Earthquake in 1999. This {{descriptive}} study was performed in ten primary healthcare units in Korfez District of Kocaeli. The systematic sampling was used to select the pregnant <b>follow-up</b> <b>card</b> (PFC) and the infant <b>follow-up</b> <b>card</b> (IFC) which were filled up in last five months of each 1998 and 1999. 208 IFC and 97 PFC from the year 1999 and 193 IFC and 74 PFC from 1998 were investigated. The follow-up cards of pregnant filled after earthquake were better than those filled before the earthquake. The lack of determination of pregnancy in first trimester and laboratory analysis are similar in both years. In the stage after earthquake the filling of PFC&# 146;s and IFC&# 146;s have had been similar features to previous year. This was a positive finding because the midwives performed their duties even in the extraordinary times.

This study aimed to estimate the SSI incidence rate in a Cambodian hospital and to compare different modalities of SSI surveillance. We performed an active prospective study with post-discharge surveillance. During the hospital stay, trained surveyors collected the CDC criteria to identify SSI by direct examination of the surgical site. After discharge, a card was given to each included patient to be presented to all practitioners examining the surgical site. Among 167 patients, direct examination of the surgical site identified a cumulative incidence rate of 14 infections per 100 patients. An independent review of medical charts presented a sensitivity of 16 %. The sensitivity of the purulent drainage criterion to detect SSIs was 83 %. After hospital discharge, 87 % of the patients provided follow-up data, and nine purulent drainages were reported by a practitioner (cumulative incidence rate: 20 %). Overall, the incidence rate was dependent on the surveillance modalities.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and discuss the results of osteosynthesis applied with a noncontact plate in Gustilo–Anderson Type 2, 3 a, and 3 b fractures. Method: The study included 23 patients applied with debridement + noncontact plate osteosynthesis + soft tissue procedures in a single session for the treatment of an open fracture. A <b>follow-up</b> <b>card</b> was created to evaluate the patients in respect of age, gender, fracture level, fracture etiology, open fracture type, preoperative and postoperative sedimentation and C-reactive protein values, antibiotics used and duration of use, time to union, and complications. Results: In all 23 patients, full bone union was obtained at mean 22. 5 weeks (range: 16 – 36  weeks). Complications developed in 9 patients. Implant failure occurred in 3 patients. In 5  patients, infection developed which required repeated debridements. Conclusion: In open fractures, noncontact plating following debridement seems to be a good alternative treatment method to intramedullar nailing, especially in metaphyseal and metaphyseo-diaphyseal fractures and in spiral oblique diafiz fractures. Noncontact plating may also be a good alternative to intramedullar nailing for open fracture treatment if the patients have additional pathologies such as contusion and thoracic injury.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the association between pre-pregnancy maternal body mass index (BMI), gestational weight gain and low birth weight (LBW) in babies born to a sample population ofOmani women. Methods: A case-control study was carried out among deliveries registered between 1 st May 2010 and 30 th April 2011 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman. A case {{was defined as a}} woman who delivered a low birth weight baby (< 2, 500 g); a control was a woman delivering a baby weighing between 2, 500 and 4, 000 g. A random selection of 150 cases and 300 controls was carried out using the hospital information system. Maternal, pre-natal, and delivery data were extracted from the mothers’ <b>follow-up</b> <b>cards.</b> Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were executed to examine the association between pre-pregnancy maternal BMI and LBW. Results: The percentage of underweight mothers (BMI < 18. 5) was higher among the cases compared to the controls (17. 3 % versus 6 %; P < 0. 001). The proportion of mothers with less-than-recommended weight gain wasalso higher among the cases compared to the controls (57. 7 % versus 33 %; P < 0. 001). After adjustment for potential confounders, infants of underweight mothers had more than twice the risk of LBW compared to those of mothers with normal weight (odds ratio = 2. 27; 95 % confidence interval 1. 09 – 4. 71). Conclusion: Underweight Omani women as well as women with less-than-recommended gestational weight gain were at higher risk of delivering LBW babies.

40|$|Abstract Background Unmet {{need for}} family {{planning}} {{is responsible for}} 7. 4 million disability-adjusted life years and 30 % of the maternity-related disease burden. An estimated 35 % of births are unintended and some 200 million couples state a desire to delay pregnancy or cease fertility but are not using contraception. Unmet need is higher among the poorest, lesser educated, rural residents and women under 19 years. The barriers to, and successful strategies for, satisfying all demand for modern contraceptives are heavily influenced by context. Successfully overcoming this to increase the uptake of family planning is estimated {{to reduce the risk}} of maternal death by up to 58 % as well as contribute to poverty reduction, women’s empowerment and educational, social and economic participation, national development and environmental protection. Methods To strengthen health systems for delivery of context-specific, equity-focused reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health services (RMNCH), the Investment Case study was applied in the Asia-Pacific region. Staff of local and central government and non-government organisations analysed data indicative of health service delivery through a supply–demand oriented framework to identify constraints to RMNCH scale-up. Planners developed contextualised strategies and the projected coverage increases were modelled for estimates of marginal impact on maternal mortality and costs over a five year period. Results In Indonesia, Philippines and Nepal the constraints behind incomplete coverage of family planning services included: weaknesses in commodities logistic management; geographical inaccessibility; limitations in health worker skills and numbers; legislation; and religious and cultural ideologies. Planned activities included: streamlining supply systems; establishment of Community Health Teams for integrated RMNCH services; local recruitment of staff and refresher training; task-shifting; and <b>follow-up</b> <b>cards.</b> Modelling showed varying marginal impact and costs for each setting with potential for significant reductions in the maternal mortality rate; up to 28 % (25. 1 - 30. 7) over five years, costing up to a marginal USD 1. 34 (1. 32 - 1. 35) per capita in the first year. Conclusion Local health planners are in a prime position to devise feasible context-specific activities to overcome constraints and increase met need for family planning to accelerate progress towards MDG 5. </p...|$|R

D. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 250 pages, appendices A-E. Teachers leave the profession {{at an alarming}} rate and, many times, the most talented among them (Henry, 1989; Heyns, 1988; Schlechty & Vance, 1981, cited in Gold, 1996; Shen, 1997). Historically and, even sometimes still today, there often has been little support for new teachers. To retain a sufficient number and quality of teachers, it is imperative that districts find solutions. This study aimed to examine the presence and quality of new teacher support programs as one means of providing intentional support to new teachers. The study included a conceptual framework based on the literature to help districts envision the process of implementation and maintenance of new teacher support programs. The study provided a 79 question online survey to staff development coordinators in all of the public school districts in the state of Minnesota. Specifically, letters and <b>follow-up</b> post <b>cards</b> were sent to the coordinators indicating {{the purpose of the study}} and providing a link to the online survey. The response rate to the survey was disappointingly low with only 45 of the 339 districts responding. The low response rate raised concerns about the representative nature and validity of the response set. Timing of survey administration likely hindered the response rate. The survey was sent toward the end of the school year and the state education agency had sent a survey to essentially the same respondent group not long before the survey of the present study was sent. No correlations were conducted but some qualified summary statements were suggested from the data that were returned. Of the districts that responded all of the 45 indicated that they have some form of new teacher supports and many offered evidence to suggest that best practices, such as providing mentors and focused workshops, allowing time for teachers to meet, observe, teach, and learn from experienced teachers, were in place. Responding districts also indicated common facilitators of new teacher support programs, including budgets and leadership, as well as common challenges for implementing and maintaining a high quality new teacher support system, such as funding, lack of training opportunities, and lack of leadership...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a program to improve hypertension screening practices in primary care. DESIGN: Retrospective quasi-experimental study. SETTING: Two hospital-based family medicine centres (FMCs). PATIENTS: In the study FMC, two study groups of randomly selected adult patients: 425 who visited the FMC before implementation of the screening improvement program (from Apr. 1, 1983, to Mar. 31, 1984) and 418 who visited it afterward (from Apr. 1, 1986, to Mar. 31, 1987). These patients were matched with 392 and 442 control patients respectively seen during the same time frames at the second FMC. INTERVENTIONS: Educational sessions for physicians to standardize blood pressure measurement and knowledge of the recommendations from the Canadian Hypertension Society on hypertension screening and diagnosis, and specific operational incentives to improve hypertension screening, including a reference guide placed in each physician's office, a coloured form for recording blood pressure measurements placed in every patient's chart and a <b>follow-up</b> and recall <b>card</b> file. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Frequency of blood pressure measurements recorded in patient charts. RESULTS: The hypertension screening rate was 60 % per year in the study group before program implementation and 79 % in the study group afterward; the corresponding rates in the two control groups were 72 % and 59 % (p < 0. 0001). Patients {{were more likely to be}} screened if they visited the physician for a periodic health examination than for other problems (e. g., psychosocial or dermatologic) and if they had a scheduled appointment rather than no appointment. Physician characteristics that were positive predictors of screening were low age, female sex and payment on a salary basis. CONCLUSION: Physician education and incentives are effective in improving hypertension screening practices in hospital-based FMCs without incurring additional costs or other use of resources. Further evaluation of such a program should be undertaken in other primary care settings...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the impact of a}} referral-based intervention in a prospective cohort of women disclosing intimate partner violence (IPV) on the prevalence of violence, and associated outcomes psychosocial health, help-seeking and safety behaviour during and after pregnancy. Methods: Women seeking antenatal care in eleven Belgian hospitals were consecutively invited from June 2010 to October 2012, to participate in a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) and handed a questionnaire. Participants willing to be interviewed and reporting IPV victimisation were randomised. In the Intervention Group (IG) participants received a referral card with contact details of services providing assistance and tips to increase safety behaviour. Participants in the Control Group (CG) received a "thank you" <b>card.</b> <b>Follow-up</b> data were obtained through telephone interview at an average of 10 months after receipt of the <b>card.</b> Results: At <b>follow-up</b> (n = 189), 66. 7 % (n = 126) of the participants reported IPV victimisation. Over the study-period, the prevalence of IPV victimisation decreased by 31. 4 % (P < 0. 001), psychosocial health increased significantly (5. 4 / 140, P < 0. 001), 23. 8 % (n = 46 / 193) of the women sought formal help, 70. 5 % (n = 136 / 193) sought informal help, and 31. 3 % (n = 60 / 192) took at least one safety measure. We observed no statistically significant differences between the IG and CG, however. Adjusted for psychosocial health at baseline, the perceived helpfulness of the referral card seemed to be larger in the IG. Both the questionnaire and the interview were perceived to be significantly more helpful than the referral card itself (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Asking questions can be helpful even for types of IPV of low severity, although simply distributing a referral card may not qualify as the ideal intervention. Future interventions should be multifaceted, delineate different types of violence, controlling for measurement reactivity and designing a tailored intervention programme adjusted to the specific needs of couples experiencing IPV...|$|R
40|$|More rapid {{than normal}} {{global climate change}} as {{represented}} by rising temperatures and more erratic and severe weather events have heightened the interest in how farmers use weather information. The greenhouse influence through driving climate change will likely be affecting agricultural efforts for some years to come. It behooves us {{to pay attention to}} this phenomenon, and especially put effort into understanding how farmers will respond to information about climate generally and forecasts in particular. This research is being funded by the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. To address this issue farmers were surveyed in three major agroecological zones representing 1) a western Corn Belt, rainfed corn-soybean regime, 2) a central Great Plains irrigated corn-soybean regime, and 3) a central Great Plains irrigated continuous corn regime. Each of these zones is represented in three counties in eastern Nebraska. To better reflect farmers' weather related needs and issues, focus groups were held in each county to engage farmers in helping the researchers to design the survey instrument. The fact we used focus groups added an intriguing flavor to the study. Between 15 - 20 farmers in each zone were involved. These farmers were paid $ 25 for a 2 -hour session that culminated in a provided lunch. Each session was also videotaped, providing the opportunity for all members of the research team to see the results of the event (in that only 3 - 4 members of the larger multidisciplinary research team were allowed to attend an event, due to concerns over affecting farmer responses). The focus was on the farmers' reactions to a series of questions prepared beforehand by the research team, all of which stirred lively dialogue on how farmers actually use weather information. The result was a substantially improved questionnaire. We also sent drafts back to farmer participants for final reviews, and subsequent adjustments were then made reflecting the way they used the words and understood the survey questions. The qualitative data from the focus group events ultimately influenced not only the way questions were asked but also how the modeling is done, and, especially, how the model results are interpreted. A total of 2211 questionnaires were sent, in two separate mailings. There was also a <b>follow-up</b> reminder <b>card.</b> Farmers were offered a payment of $ 25 to return the questionnaire. A total of 28 % took the offer and the overall return rate was 33 %, with 698 usable questionnaires in the econometric analysis. A distinctive aspect of this study {{is the fact that the}} research team involves active participation not only by agricultural economists but also by a psychologist and a social psychologist, as well as two meteorologists, and an agronomist (who is also a GIS specialist). The result is a nontraditional behavioral economics approach that is sensitive to the climate and agronomic realities faced by farmers in these zones. This approach has a unique two-fold feature; first, it puts special attention on underlying motives, and second, asks whether there may be a complex expression of both private (self) and public (other, community) interest in how forecasts influence farm level decisions. Yet, the modeling still reflects standard derived demand theory and the general expectancy-value or subjective utility perspective, i. e. that farmers have beliefs about fact events and values relating to the outcomes from those events, and that the demand for weather information is derived from the value (profit, sense of well-being, risk-reducing value) it produces for them. The beliefs represent probability statements about outcomes and the values represent the utility or profit related transformations of meaning about the farmer perceptions of the outcomes. The econometric analysis uses proxy measures of the expectancy-value as independent measures, along with such variables as financial capability of the farmer as represented in farm sales, to explain in a Tobit kind of framework 1) the probability of applying weather forecast information since it influences farm level decision(s), and 2) the extent to which this forecast information is influencing these decision(s). The set of four Tobit models in Table 1 test the influence of recent past and current experience (RPE), short (STF) and long-term forecasts (LTF) on 1) agronomic (e. g. selecting the crop type, spraying), 2) insurance, and 3) marketing decisions, within recent past experience/short-term and long-term forecasts. To test the models, we created four indices represented in balance (joint and nonseparable ratio of public (other) to private (self) interests); attitude as a construct of personal belief and value system, influence of social norms, household and community members, county extension, etc; farmers' need for internal control over crop production; and farm sales representing financial limitations. Preliminary analyses suggest that all the farm decisions are influenced by weather forecast information at a different intensity (Table 1). The probability of that influence increases with balance, as the farmer puts more effort into pursuing the self over the community interests. Influence of others and social norms intensify the use of weather information in the decisions as well. Those who want more control over the farm are likely to be more influenced by weather forecasts. Finally, influence of weather forecasts becomes greater as gross farm income (sales) increases. Other intriguing interpretations are suggested by the changes in the size of the parameter elasticities and marginal effects 3, e. g. the control parameter is substantively smaller in the insurance decision, which suggests farmers see insurance as offsetting the need for more control over their decisions. As another example, the balance in private and public interests is less significant and less a factor in the very personal, private marketing decision in contrast to "how one farms" (which is likely more sensitive to community scrutiny) in the agronomic decisions. The larger paper explores these refinements in greater detail. Table 1. Intensity of Weather Forecast Influence on Farm Decisions. Variables Agronomy (Cur. Rec.
