The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E

5|$|By 878 the Vikings {{had seized}} eastern Mercia and nearly conquered Wessex, and Alfred {{was reduced to}} being a {{fugitive}} in the Somerset marshes, but he fought back and won the Battle of Edington.

A further Viking assault in the mid 890s was unsuccessful.|$|E

Sometimes, the attendants also hold severed heads (not their own). While Dakini is fair, Varnini is red-complexioned. In other depictions, both are depicted blue-grey. Sometimes, her attendants are depicted as skeletons and drinking the dripping blood from Chhinnamasta's severed head, rather than her neck. The attendants are absent in some depictions.|$|E
5|$|British ships did not {{participate}} in any major wars in the ironclad period. The Royal Navy's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one-sided engagements like the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. Defending British interests against Ahmed 'Urabi's Egyptian revolt, a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria. A mixture of centre-battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day, forcing the Egyptians to retreat; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first, but inflicted little damage, killing only five British sailors. Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fortifications themselves were typically left intact. Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal, they might have quickly turned the tide, for the attacking British ironclads found it easy (for accuracy's sake) to simply anchor whilst firing—perfect targets for high-angle fire upon their thinly armored topdecks.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1917, {{divisions}} {{had begun}} appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Berlin Committee and the German high command on the other. Reports from German agents working with Ghadarites in Southeast Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganisation, as well as unrealism in gauging public mood and support within the Ghadarite organisation. The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China's participation {{in the war in}} 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly. Infiltration by British agents, change in American attitude and stance, and the changing fortunes of the war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (walking on the fingers and toes). The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; {{it would not have been}} able to gallop as a quadruped.|$|E
5|$|In his will, Sylvester had {{declared}} that royalties {{from the future}} sale of this music be devoted to two HIV/AIDS charities, Project Open <b>Hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> AIDS Emergency Fund. Although Sylvester died deeply in debt {{as a result of}} taking advances on his royalties, by the early 1990s this debt had been paid off, and a balance had begun to build up. Roger Gross, the attorney to Sylvester's manager and the openly gay lawyer who helped him draw up his will, petitioned the probate court to designate the charities as the beneficiaries of Sylvester's will. The proceeds of $140,000 in accrued royalties were split between the two groups, and they will continue to be paid the royalties in the future.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, I. C. Filitti {{worked with the}} {{formerly}} Junimist tribune Convorbiri Literare, which published fragments of his research on Maiorescu (1922) and novelist Costache Negruzzi (1923). Filitti subsequently {{turned his attention to}} some of the earliest sources on Wallachian history, adding his opinion to the debate surrounding the historicity of Negru Vodă (described by some early modern sources as Wallachia's state-builder). His topical study, published by in the 1924 Romanian Academy annals, concluded that Negru Vodă was in fact the stuff of legend, concocted by the 17th-century Wallachian Lord Matei Basarab. The next year, he returned to social history, with the book Clasele sociale în trecutul românesc ("Social Classes in the Romanian Past"). It mainly explained the difference between the concepts of nobility in Western Europe, on one <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Danubian Principalities, on the other: Moldo-Wallachian nobility had no concept of knighthood, as all boyars were defined by their demesnes.|$|E
5|$|Kosara then {{begged her}} father for Vladimir's <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tsar granted her request. He {{restored}} his new son-in-law {{to the throne}} of Duklja. In reality, the marriage was probably a result of Samuel's political assessment: he may have decided that Vladimir {{would be a more}} loyal vassal if he was married to his daughter. Resolving thus the question of Duklja, Samuel could concentrate more troops in Macedonia and Thessaly, the main site of his conflict with Byzantium. The chronicle claims that the tsar also gave Vladimir the whole territory of Dyrrachium. The prince could in fact have been given a northern part of that territory, which was partially under Samuel's rule. A brief note on Vladimir by John Skylitzes may indicate that the prince also received some territory in Raška. His paternal uncle Dragimir, ruler of Travunia and Zachlumia, who had retreated before Samuel's army, was given back his lands to rule, also as the tsar's vassal.|$|E
5|$|Koufax had {{his strong}} season despite an injured {{pitching}} hand. While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from Earl Francis. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger {{on his left}} <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so he ignored the problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and {{he was unable to}} complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers {{at the end of the}} regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.|$|E

40|$|Ride {{quality in}} {{vehicles}} can {{be influenced by}} multiple-input vibration: vibration simultaneously transmitted to the body via multiple vibrating surfaces, such as steering wheels, seats, and floors. Standardised methods of predicting the discomfort of multiple-input vibration (ISO 2631 - 1, 1997) do {{not take into account}} vibration of the hands or the phase between vibration input to <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>the</b> feet, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seat. This research seeks to understand the mechanisms associated with discomfort caused by multiple-input vertical vibration, examining the effect of vibration frequency, vibration magnitude, input location, and phase between vibration at <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>the</b> seat, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet, at frequencies between 2 and 12. 5 Hz. A total of four psychophysical laboratory experiments were conducted. Three studies were designed to expand knowledge of <b>the</b> absolute <b>and</b> relative sensitivity to vibration at the inputs, or between the three inputs, by determining: (i) absolute thresholds for perception of vibration (minimum levels of vibration that can be detected) at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> feet (Experiment 1); (ii) equivalent comfort contours for vibration (levels of vibration that produce similar discomfort across the range of frequencies) at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> feet (Experiment 2); <b>and</b> (iii) <b>the</b> equivalence of vibration sensation (vibration magnitudes required to produce equivalent discomfort) between <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet (from 2 to 12. 5 Hz), between <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seat (from 4 to 12. 5 Hz), <b>and</b> between <b>the</b> seat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet (from 4 to 12. 5 Hz) (Experiment 3). The findings indicate similar absolute thresholds at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet between 2 and 5 Hz, with the thresholds having constant velocity. At frequencies between 5 and 12. 5 Hz, absolute thresholds have constant acceleration at the feet while continuing to have constant velocity at the hands: an indication that different mechanisms may be involved in the detection of threshold levels of vibration at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet between 5 and 12. 5 Hz. Contours of equivalent comfort at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet between 2 and 12. 5 Hz resemble the shapes of the absolute thresholds, with little dependence in vibration magnitude. The relative magnitudes of vibration required to produce equivalent discomfort at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet, or at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seat, depend on the frequency of vibration and indicate greater sensitivity to vertical vibration at the seat than at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet over the frequency range investigated. A clear difference in the frequency-dependence of sensitivity to vertical vibration at the seat from those at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet suggests a separate mechanism for detecting supra-threshold vibration of the seat. The final study (Experiment 4) concerned <b>the</b> perception <b>and</b> discomfort of multiple-input vertical vibration with various phases between vibration at pairs of inputs, so as to determine: (a) difference thresholds (just noticeable differences, JNDs) for the detection of phase differences, (b) the effect of phase on discomfort, <b>and</b> (c) <b>the</b> localisation (i. e. body location) at which phase differences are detected. The results suggest that phase differences between <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet at frequencies greater than 5 Hz are unlikely to be detected, and that any phase differences between <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet over the range 2 to 12. 5 Hz are unlikely to influence discomfort. Phase differences between <b>the</b> seat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> or between <b>the</b> seat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet, over the range 4 to 12. 5 Hz were detected by some subjects and increased discomfort up to 50 % (when changing phase only, with no change in vibration magnitude). Over the three inputs (i. e. <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>the</b> feet, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seat) sensitivity to vertical vibration was greatest at <b>the</b> seat <b>and</b> least at <b>the</b> <b>hands.</b> The phase between the inputs can affect discomfort, but only when vibration is applied at the seat. Changes in discomfort due to vibration frequency, vibration magnitude, or phase differences between the inputs may be partly associated with changes in the body locations experiencing greatest discomfort, due to different paths for the transmission of vibration into the body. The research has increased understanding of how multiple-input vibration applied simultaneously at <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>the</b> seat, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet contribute to produce an overall sensation of discomfort. <br/...|$|R
5|$|Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis led the British forces southward in the {{aftermath}} of the December26 battle. Leaving 1,400 men under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood in Princeton, Cornwallis advanced on Trenton with about 5,000 men on January2. His advance was significantly slowed by defensive skirmishing by American riflemen under the command of Edward <b>Hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> advance guard did not reach Trenton until twilight. After assaulting the American positions three times, and being repulsed each time, Cornwallis decided to wait and finish the battle the next day. Washington moved his army around Cornwallis's camp that night and attacked Mawhood at Princeton the next day. That defeat prompted the British to withdraw from most of New Jersey for the winter.|$|E

The ARBiH, HVO and HV ultimately consented {{to the maintenance of}} the ceasefire of 12 October. According to British historian Marko Attila Hoare, their acquiescence was secured following massive diplomatic pressure from the West, and the alleged threat of US airstrikes against the ARBiH if it breached the ceasefire. The Bosnian War ended with the acceptance of the Dayton Agreement by all sides in November 1995.|$|E
5|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive.

A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.|$|E
