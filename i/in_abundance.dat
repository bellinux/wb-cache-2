40|$|Despite {{differences}} in the species compositions and absolute abundances of planktonic microorganisms in fresh- and saltwater, there are broad similarities in microbial food webs across systems. Relative abundances of bacteria and nanoplanktonic protozoa (HNAN, primarily heterotrophic flagellates) are similar in marine and freshwater environments, which suggests analogous trophic relationships. Ranges of microbe <b>abundances</b> <b>in</b> marine and fresh waters overlap, and seasonal changes <b>in</b> <b>abundances</b> within an ecosystem are often as great as differences <b>in</b> <b>abundances</b> between freshwater and marine systems of similar productivities. Densities of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoplankton, therefore, are strongly related {{to the degree of}} eutrophication, and not salt per se. Data from the literature is compiled to demonstrate a remarkably consistent numerical relationship (ca 1000 bacteria: 1 HNAN) between bacterioplankton and HNAN from the euphotic zones of a variety of marine and freshwater systems. Based on the results of a simple food web model involving bacterial growth, bacterial removal by HNAN, predation on HNAN, and the observed relationships between bacterial and HNAN <b>abundances</b> <b>in</b> natural ecosystems, it is possible to demonstrate that bottom-up control (food supply) is more important <b>in</b> regulating bacterial <b>abundances</b> <b>in</b> oligotrophic environments while top-down control (predation) is more important in eutrophic environments...|$|R

In this paper we report estimates of temporal variation <b>in</b> <b>abundances</b> of tropical reef fishes attributable to sampling error at diurnal, daily and ‘monthly’ scales and compare these to inter-annual variation that might arise from processes such as mortality and recruitment. Uncertainty in estimates taken from the same sites over consecutive days was large for several species and accounted for the majority of error <b>in</b> estimates of <b>abundance</b> within years. Sources of error <b>in</b> estimates of <b>abundance</b> are discussed with consideration of the implications for long-term sampling and monitoring of fish assemblages.

Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture in Wales has in {{the past}} been {{a major part of the}} economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom.

This results in only a small {{proportion}} of the land area being suitable for arable cropping, but grass for the grazing of livestock is present <b>in</b> <b>abundance.</b> As a proportion of the national economy, the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; a high proportion of the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast. Arable cropping is limited to the flatter parts and elsewhere dairying and livestock farming predominate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of life on Earth lives in mesophyllic (moderate) environments, a few organisms, most of them microbes, have managed to colonise extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms. There are bacteria, for example, living in Lake Whillans, half a mile below the ice of Antarctica; in the absence of sunlight, they must rely on organic material from elsewhere, perhaps decaying matter from glacier melt water or minerals from the underlying rock. Other bacteria can be found <b>in</b> <b>abundance</b> in the Mariana Trench, the deepest place in the ocean and on Earth; marine snow drifts down from the surface layers of the sea and accumulates in this undersea valley, providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria.|$|E

40|$|Herbivory is a {{fundamental}} process that controls primary producer abundance and regulates energy and nutrient flows to higher trophic levels. Despite the recent proliferation of small-scale studies on herbivore effects on aquatic plants, there remains limited understanding {{of the factors that}} control consumer regulation of vascular plants in aquatic ecosystems. Our current knowledge of the regulation of primary producers has hindered efforts to understand the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and to manage such ecosystems effectively. We conducted a global meta-analysis of the outcomes of plant-herbivore interactions using a data set comprised of 326 values from 163 studies, in order to test two mechanistic hypotheses: first, that greater negative changes <b>in</b> plant <b>abundance</b> would be associated with higher herbivore biomass densities; second, that the magnitude of changes <b>in</b> plant <b>abundance</b> would vary with herbivore taxonomic identity. We found evidence that plant abundance declined with increased herbivore density, with plants eliminated at high densities. Significant between-taxa differences in impact were detected, with insects associated with smaller reductions <b>in</b> plant <b>abundance</b> than all other taxa. Similarly, birds caused smaller reductions <b>in</b> plant <b>abundance</b> than echinoderms, fish, or molluscs. Furthermore, larger reductions <b>in</b> plant <b>abundance</b> were detected for fish relative to crustaceans. We found a positive relationship between herbivore species richness and change <b>in</b> plant <b>abundance,</b> with the strongest reductions <b>in</b> plant <b>abundance</b> reported for low herbivore species richness, suggesting that greater herbivore diversity may protect against large reductions <b>in</b> plant <b>abundance.</b> Finally, we found that herbivore-plant nativeness was a key factor affecting the magnitude of herbivore impacts on plant abundance across a wide range of species assemblages. Assemblages comprised of invasive herbivores and native plant assemblages were associated with greater reductions <b>in</b> plant <b>abundance</b> compared with invasive herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and mixed-nativeness plants, and native herbivores and native plants. By contrast, assemblages comprised of native herbivores and invasive plants were associated with lower reductions <b>in</b> plant <b>abundance</b> compared with both mixed-nativeness herbivores and native plants, and native herbivores and native plants. However, the effects of herbivore-plant nativeness on changes <b>in</b> plant <b>abundance</b> were reduced at high herbivore densities. Our mean reductions <b>in</b> aquatic plant <b>abundance</b> are greater than those reported in the literature for terrestrial plants, but lower than aquatic algae. Our findings highlight the need for a substantial shift in how biologists incorporate plant-herbivore interactions into theories of aquatic ecosystem structure and functioning. Currently, the failure to incorporate top-down effects continues to hinder our capacity to understand and manage the ecological dynamics of habitats that contain aquatic plants...|$|R

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{seeds and}} stems are edible {{and are used}} in {{traditional}} Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people.

Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its brittleness, but it has been used in the production of paper and candle wicks in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex, England.
