5|$|Given {{the planet}}'s high mass, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that 47 Ursae Majoris b is a gas giant with no solid surface. Because the planet {{has only been}} {{detected}} indirectly, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Due to its mass <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to have a surface gravity 68 times that of Earth. Assuming a composition {{similar to that of}} Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the upper atmosphere of the planet is expected to contain water clouds, as opposed to the ammonia clouds typical of Jupiter.|$|E
50|$|The {{chronology}} of Katha Upanishad is unclear and contested, with Buddhism scholars stating <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> composed after the early Buddhist texts (fifth century BCE), and Hinduism scholars stating <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> composed before the early Buddhist texts in 1st part of 1st millennium BCE.|$|R

5|$|Such long-distance {{high-speed}} railways are {{not included}} in the preliminary long-term plan for 2010–2040, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that railways Hamar–Trondheim and Drammen–Kristansand will be built first since they are easier to build. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that a high-speed railway to Bergen will be built sometime in the period 2030–2060.|$|E
5|$|A {{church in}} Ickenham is not {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that residents travelled to nearby Harefield for services.

5|$|A {{commercial}} document from 30 January 1359, which testifies to John's continuing {{trade relations with}} Venice, is chronologically the last reference to his activity in contemporary sources. While the date of his death was not recorded, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that John perished during the plague epidemic which hit Valona and Durazzo (today Durrës) in 1363.|$|E
5|$|According to Dio Cassius, he inflicted genocidal depredations on {{the natives}} and {{incurred}} {{the loss of}} 50,000 of his own men to the attrition of guerrilla tactics, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that these figures are a significant exaggeration.|$|E

5|$|Almost any {{substance}} containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> {{that many}} cultures, on observing that a sweet liquid {{could be obtained}} from a source of starch, independently invented beer. Bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies {{and contributed to the}} building of civilisations.|$|E
5|$|As a diplodocid, it is {{probable}} that Dinheirosaurus possessed a whip-tail. If it did, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with supersonic speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that it was probably a non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E
5|$|Differences in songs, {{genetics}} and morphology {{suggests that the}} Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late Pleistocene, about 100,000 years ago. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that the initial colonisation was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western caldera of São Miguel, where both eastern and western song types are found.|$|E

5|$|Ecgberht {{was buried}} in Winchester, as were his son, Æthelwulf, his grandson, Alfred the Great, and his great-grandson, Edward the Elder.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that Bede's work, {{because it}} was so widely copied, {{discouraged}} others from writing histories and may even have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that Hoffmann did as most chemists {{have always}} done, {{starting}} {{by studying the}} literature and recreating the published methods. On 10 August 1897 (according to his laboratory notebooks), Hoffmann found a better method for making ASA, from salicylic acid refluxed with acetic anhydride.|$|E
