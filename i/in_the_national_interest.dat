It also states that the Minister should satisfy himself that it is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> to grant <b>the</b> exemptions.

25|$|Meanwhile, {{members of}} the House Projection Forces Subcommittee had been {{pressing}} the Navy to use nuclear power for major combatants, partly {{as a response to}} concerns about the price and availability of oil. They prompted studies in 2005 and 2006, the second of which stated that nuclear power broke even at an oil price of $70–$225/barrel for escort ships of 21-26,000 tonnes with heavy radar use. This led to a requirement in the FY2008 Defense Authorization Act that all major combatant vessels be nuclear powered unless it was not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 21 December 1941, {{a formal}} {{military}} alliance between Thailand under Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram and Japan was concluded. At noon on 25 January 1942, Thailand {{declared war on}} the United States and Great Britain. Some Thais supported the alliance, arguing that it was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest,</b> or {{that it was better}} sense to ally oneself with a victorious power. Others formed the Free Thai Movement to resist. The Free Thai Movement was supported by Force 136 and the OSS, and provided valuable intelligence from within Thailand. Eventually, when the war turned against the Japanese, Phibun was forced to resign, and a Free Thai-controlled government was formed. A coup was being planned to disrupt the Japanese occupying forces in 1945, but was forestalled by the ending of the war.|$|E
25|$|Tony Blair stood down {{as prime}} {{minister}} after 10 years in June 2007, and was succeeded by chancellor Gordon Brown. That autumn, the national media reported that an imminent general election was likely, putting all polling organisations, the press and political parties on an election footing, but he eventually {{announced that he would}} not seek a dissolution. According to many media and political figures, this was because he believed that Labour was likely to lose its majority in a snap general election, even though many opinion polls suggested that a fourth successive election win for Labour was likely, and this would potentially have ensured the Labour government's survival to the end of 2012. Gordon Brown has since maintained that Labour would have won but he did not believe an early election was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E

25|$|In December 2007, the {{government}} launched the National Program for the Rational and Efficient Use of Energy (PRONUREE, Decree 140/2007).

The PRONUREE, under the responsibility of the Secretariat of Energy, aims to be a vehicle for improving energy efficiency in the energy-consuming sectors and acknowledges that energy efficiency needs to be promoted with a long-term commitment and vision. It also acknowledges the connection between energy efficiency and sustainable development, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The program also recognizes the need for individual behavioral changes to be promoted with an educational strategy, with the public sector setting the example by assuming a leadership role in the implementation of energy conservation measures in its facilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{refusal of}} the Whigs {{to make peace with}} France in 1706, and again in 1709 when Louis XIV offered to yield every point for which the allies professed to be {{fighting}} , showed that the war was not being continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest,</b> and the queen, Parliament and the people supported the ministry in its wish to terminate hostilities. Because of the diversity of aims among the allies, St John was induced to enter into separate and secret negotiations with France for the security of English interests. In May 1712, he ordered the Duke of Ormonde, who had succeeded Marlborough in command, to refrain from any further engagement. These instructions were communicated to the French, though not to the allies, Louis putting Dunkirk as security into possession of England, and the English troops deserted their allies almost on the battlefield. Subsequently, St John received the congratulations of the French foreign minister, de Torcy, on the French victory over Prince Eugene at Denain (24 July 1712).|$|E

500|$|Although Henson's {{elevation}} was controversial chiefly among {{factions of}} the clergy– in general lay people supported his appointment– it nevertheless gave fresh impetus {{to the idea}} of taking away from the prime minister the power to choose bishops. Gore attempted to promote the idea at the Convocation of Clergy in May 1918; Henson abandoned restraint and in Chadwick's words [...] "stripped Gore's arguments bare".
