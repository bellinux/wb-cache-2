40|$|China’s {{trade surplus}} is entirely in {{processing}} trade. Processed <b>exports</b> are final goods produced using parts and components coming from East Asian supply chain countries. Many claim that {{because much of}} the value added of China’s processed <b>exports</b> comes from East Asian countries, exchange rates in supply chain countries should affect China’s processed <b>exports</b> and the renminbi should not. To investigate these issues, this paper disaggregates processed <b>exports</b> into their two main categories—processing with imported materials (PWIM) <b>exports</b> and processing and assembly (PAA) <b>exports.</b> For PWIM <b>exports,</b> much of the value added comes from China, while for PAA <b>exports,</b> most of the value-added comes from supply chain countries. Dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) results indicate that East Asian exchange rates affect both types of <b>exports</b> and that the renminbi significantly affects PWIM <b>exports</b> but not PAA <b>exports.</b> Since PWIM <b>exports</b> are now six times the value of PAA <b>exports,</b> these results indicate that the renminbi matters for aggregate processed <b>exports...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{input-output}} framework is adopted to estimate China's carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions as generated by its <b>exports</b> in 2002. More than {{one half of}} China's <b>exports</b> are related to international production fragmentation. These processing <b>exports</b> generate relatively little value added but also relatively little emissions. We argue that existing estimates of the CO 2 content of China's <b>exports</b> are significantly biased because production fragmentation has not been taken into account appropriately. Using a unique tripartite input-output table, {{we are able to}} distinguish processing <b>exports</b> from normal <b>exports.</b> Our results show that China's emissions as embodied in its <b>exports</b> are overestimated by more than 60 % if the distinction between processing <b>exports</b> and normal <b>exports</b> is not made. Another finding is that each Yuan of value added generated by processing <b>exports</b> leads to 34 % less CO 2 emissions than a Yuan of value added generated by normal <b>exports.</b> (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, we show that the PRC's processing <b>exports</b> demonstrate significant heterogeneity across its trading partners; processing <b>exports</b> account for a large portion of total <b>exports</b> to high income countries but a relatively small portion of <b>exports</b> to low income countries.

40|$|The {{importance}} of finance for <b>exporting</b> goods is well {{understood in the}} literature.

To this end, we use an unbalanced panel of service firms for the years 1999 – 2007 from the Prowess data set compiled by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy. In contrast to some findings for the manufacturing industry, we found that finance is not a significant determinant of Indian service firms' <b>exporting</b> activity.
