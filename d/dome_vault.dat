25|$|When the Ottomans had conquered Constantinople, {{they found}} a variety of Byzantine Christian churches, {{the largest and most}} {{prominent}} amongst them was the Hagia Sophia. The brickwork-and-mortar ribs and the spherical shell of the central dome of the Hagia Sophia were built simultaneously, as a self-supporting structure without any wooden centring. In the early Byzantine church of Hagia Irene, the ribs of the <b>dome</b> <b>vault</b> are fully integrated into the shell, similar to Western Roman domes, and thus are not visible from within the building. In the dome of the Hagia Sophia, the ribs and shell of the dome unite in a central medallion at the apex of the dome, the upper ends of the ribs being integrated into the shell: Shell and ribs form one single structural entity. In later Byzantine buildings, like the Kalenderhane Mosque, the Eski Imaret Mosque (formerly the Monastery of Christ Pantepoptes) or the Pantokrator Monastery (today: Zeyrek Mosque), the central medallion of the apex and the ribs of the dome became separate structural elements: The ribs are more pronounced and connect to the central medallion, which also stands out more pronouncedly, so that the entire construction gives the impression as if ribs and medallion are separate from, and underpin, the proper shell of the dome.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has a square plan and is {{topped by a}} low octagonal dome with pendentives. Inside the building four niches {{are located in the}} corners. Underground there is a burial crypt with eight niches covered by a <b>dome</b> <b>vault.</b> The masonry of the lower part is made of ashlar, while in the upper part it consists of bricks. A Byzantine cistern is still extant close to the building.|$|E
50|$|The tomb is {{constructed}} of bricks (average size 40x20x5cm) {{and consists of}} four chambers set {{in the form of}} a cross. The <b>dome</b> <b>vault</b> at the center was constructed by laying bricks in a spiral, while the other chambers are barrel vaulted. Some bricks are stamped or carved with inscriptions or patterns on the exposed sides. It is believed that the rear chamber is the coffin chamber, that side chambers were used for storage, while ritual ceremonies were performed in the front chamber under the domed roof.|$|E

50|$|Plantagenet {{style is}} an {{architectural}} building design of churches and cathedrals during the 12th century, characterized by cross-ribbed vaults and extremely curved <b>dome</b> <b>vaults</b> {{which resulted in}} the use of thick walls and piers. It is also the start of the transition from the Romanesque style to the Gothic style of architecture.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} has stucco decorations {{attributed to}} Alessandro Vittoria. An entablature is {{finished with a}} rich decoration of cherubs and tendrils and creates a transition to the <b>dome</b> <b>vault,</b> along with a balustrade. Palladio alternates deep niches on a rectangular ground-plan and closed wall areas with figure tabernacles between the eight regular half-columns. The {{lower part of the}} building is completed by an unbroken continuous ledge, whose profile- three flat bands which are contrasted with each other by ovolo moulding- is taken over from the arcade arches. The architect contrasts two forms of cylinder and semi-sphere by a repeated emphasis on horizontals, and, over and above that, divides them into a palpable terrestrial zone and into a light, celestial one that cannot be precisely gaugued with the eye.|$|E
50|$|While Matthias of Arras was schooled as a geometer, thus {{putting an}} {{emphasis}} on rigid systems of proportions and clear, mathematical compositions in his design, Parler was trained as a sculptor and woodcarver. He treated architecture as a sculpture, almost as if playing with structural forms in stone. Aside from his bold vaults, the peculiarities of his work {{can also be seen}} in the design of pillars (with classic, bell-shaped columns which were almost forgotten by High Gothic), the ingenious <b>dome</b> <b>vault</b> of new St Wenceslaus chapel, the undulating clerestory walls, the original window tracery (no two of his windows are the same, the ornamentation is always different) and the blind tracery panels of the buttresses. Architectural sculpture was given a considerable role while Parler was in charge of construction, {{as can be seen in}} the corbels, the passageway lintels, and, particularly, in the busts on the triforium, which depict faces of the royal family, saints, Prague bishops, and the two master builders, including Parler himself.|$|E

40|$|Seismic {{vulnerability}} of historic churches {{is a well}} known issue in earthquake engineering. The need of preserving these buildings encourages the development of reliable numerical methods to assess their seismic behavior. In this paper a new approach is presented, based on evaluating damage pattern obtained by non-linear dynamic analysis and the energy dissipated by each macro-element during earthquakes. A “hierarchy of dissipated energy” concept emerges to give a scale of {{vulnerability of}} the parts that compose the church. By modifying masonry mechanical parameters or geometric characteristics, the crack pattern and amount of energy dissipation density of each element is varied and calibrated to achieve the desired hierarchy. The structural designer can therefore state the effectiveness of strengthening devices by checking reduction and possibly migration of dissipated energy density from weaker structural elements to more resistant ones, together with a preferable damage pattern. The proposed strategy is applied to a single nave church, hit by the Emilia Romagna earthquake (Italy, 2012), first defining a scale of vulnerability of the macro-elements and then proposing a rehabilitation strategy, which improves the seismic response in terms of damages and dissipated energy. In the case study the strong vulnerability of the main <b>dome</b> <b>vault</b> was shown, due to the combination of its high dissipated energy density with its intrinsic weakness. Strengthening techniques have been aimed {{to reduce the amount}} of dissipated energy of vulnerable macro-elements and to attenuate out-of-plane mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|For centuries {{crystallized}} in the adamantine drawings {{preserved in}} the National Library of France, the perfect sphere of the Cenotaph, designed by Louis E. Boullèe in honor of Isaac Newton in about 1780, and the Temple of the Earth of Jean-Jacques Lequeu are cited by historians and critics of architecture as the utopian dream of bending the stone and {{the force of gravity}} towards the pure form of a complete sphere. The historical formal equivalence between the architectural <b>dome</b> <b>vault</b> and the sky, assume in our case a deeper meaning. From the words of Boullèe, it is crystal clear the intention of celebrating the greatness of Newton, subtracting his burial from the darkness by placing it in the largest ever builted sky, a majestic stone dome, reversing the natural order of day and night by creating with daylight, in the interior space, the image of the constellations seen in the starry skies. First in the history of planetary science, Lequeu and Boullèe???s stone architecture carried out the plan by drilling the outer surface of the dome to let the sunlight in, directly piercing the darkness and simulating in the inside space the intense stellar glow. The geometric study conducted on the holes in both architectures, made along the stone surface of the spheres, reveals a studied convergence of solar rays, in the Cenotaph, towards the eye of the privileged observer, the one able to stand on the slender platform above Newton???s tomb, thereby creating the sensation of a Ganzfeld, which sets Newton???s Cenotaph in the field of art installations rather than scientific ones. The Lequeu???s Temple instead is designed with a perfect convergence of those rays towards the centre of the sphere, as the most part of modern planetarian, but it is also more visual than scientific in character. 3 D virtual models, and simple conical projections, have allowed us to draw the star maps referred to Boullèe and Lequeu???s architectures which, however, show deep differences compared with the contemporary ones. Using the free software Stellarium we have created a good simulation of the visible sky, at the latitude of Paris, in January 4 (Isaac Newton???s birthday), exactly in the year of the Cenotaph project and we can affirm that a good coincidence, between that image and the internal perspective of the virtual model recreated from the point of view, do really exist...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop a structural technique for roofing rice straw buildings by <b>domes</b> and <b>vaults</b> through encouraging the specification of innovative materials which may be more sustainable than their traditional counterparts. This paper examines the effectiveness of using rice straw cementitious posts and walls as an innovative natural construction method to support <b>domes</b> and <b>vaults</b> in straw bale buildings. Three proposed mix ratios for rice straw cementitious bricks were mechanically tested. A finite elements analysis of the proposed roofing system was performed, to check the safety of the roofing material, and their resultant reactions on the rice straw bricks support. Different cases of loading were applied including wind and settlement. Obtained results helped in the decision making of the most economical and environmental friendly brick mix. Besides, the results emphasized that all stresses were within acceptable limits of the Egyptian code of practice...|$|R
