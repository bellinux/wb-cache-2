40|$|This high shine <b>floor</b> <b>polish</b> {{formulation}} {{demonstrates the}} shine and protection benefits of Noverite ™ 100 polymer in a <b>floor</b> <b>polish.</b> When this formulation {{is applied to}} surfaces like laminate flooring, sealed wood flooring, and vinyl floors, it provides an enhanced gloss and visual shine appearance with no rinsing. The floor will have a restored appearance by significantly improving the gloss and filling microscratches, evening out the appearance. The dry-feel, non-tacky <b>floor</b> <b>polish</b> results in a protective layer that resists most house-hold stains and provides water resistance. The scuff and black heel resistance can be improved in areas with high foot traffic by including Aquaslip ™ 678 wax emulsion in the formulation...|$|R

Scott worked in various construction camps, where he picked up on-the-job engineering experience, and in 1918 was working in a cement pouring gang at Muscle Shoals. Following this, Scott established himself in Greenwich Village as [...] "a kind of Bohemian engineer". Scott also ran a small business called Duron Chemical Company which made paint and <b>floor</b> <b>polish</b> at Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. Scott's job was to deliver his goods and show his customers how to use the <b>floor</b> <b>polishing</b> material.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Acrylate-styrene {{copolymer}} polish {{has been}} used to protect the surface of linoleum flooring since the 1960 s. Problems with powdering of <b>floor</b> <b>polish</b> were observed at an early stage. In a secondary school in Linkoping, Sweden, this phenomenon occurred in the winter of 1994 - 1995 and the pupils frequently reported irritative symptoms from the eyes and airways. This study was undertaken to assess the potential effect of powdering <b>floor</b> <b>polish</b> on the mucous membranes of the eyes and respiratory tract. METHODS: Repeated questionnaire-based surveys were conducted with identical questions in the spring of 1995 (during the powdering period) and in the autumn of 1995 (after the polish was removed). The questions dealt with irritative symptoms from the nose, eye, throat and lower respiratory tract. RESULTS: A preventive effect related to the removal of polish was found for irritative symptoms in all locations mentioned above, but was particularly clear for the lower respiratory tract (prevalence rate ratio = 0. 37, 95 % CI = 0. 23 - 0. 59). CONCLUSIONS: The results {{of this study indicate that}} the powdering of <b>floor</b> <b>polish</b> may cause irritative symptoms from the eyes and airways in school children...|$|R

50|$|Fragrance {{chemicals}} {{are found in}} most cleaning products, perfumes, and personal care products. More than 3000 {{chemicals are}} used in these fragrance mixtures. The synthetic musks used in detergents accumulate in the environment and are harmful to aquatic organisms. Certain musks are possible endocrine disruptors that interfere with hormone functioning. Phthalates are a common ingredient in these fragrance mixtures found in laundry detergents and fabric softeners. These phthalates are suspected endocrine disrupters that affect reproduction rates including reduced sperm count in males. Certain glass cleaners and <b>floor</b> <b>polishes</b> contain dibutyl phthalate (DBP). The European Union classifies DBP as very toxic to aquatic organisms, posing a huge danger as these cleaners, especially the <b>floor</b> <b>polishes</b> are often rinsed down the drain and into aquatic environments.|$|R
50|$|The {{isolated}} cis-compound is {{used primarily}} in cosmetic applications, {{with a maximum}} permitted concentration in the EU of 0.2%.

50|$|Commercially, {{behenic acid}} {{is often used}} to give hair conditioners and moisturizers their {{smoothing}} properties. It is also used in lubricating oils, and as a solvent evaporation retarder in paint removers. Its amide is used as an anti-foaming agent in detergents, <b>floor</b> <b>polishes</b> and dripless candles. Reduction of behenic acid yields behenyl alcohol.|$|R
50|$|Acrylic {{acid and}} its esters readily combine with {{themselves}} (to form polyacrylic acid) or other monomers (e.g. acrylamides, acrylonitrile, vinyl compounds, styrene, and butadiene) by reacting at their double bond, forming homopolymers or copolymers {{which are used}} in the manufacture of various plastics, coatings, adhesives, elastomers, as well as <b>floor</b> <b>polishes,</b> and paints.|$|R
50|$|The Sudan dyes are a {{group of}} azo {{compounds}} which {{have been used to}} color hydrocarbon solvents, oils, fats, waxes, shoes, and <b>floor</b> <b>polishes.</b> As recently as 1974, about 270,000 kg of Sudan dye I,236,000 kg of Sudan dye II, 70,000 kg of Sudan dye III, and 1,075,000 kg of Sudan dye IV were produced in the United States.|$|R

50|$|Cedar oil {{is often}} used for its {{aromatic}} properties, especially in aromatherapy. It has a characteristic woody odour which may change somewhat {{in the course of}} drying out. The crude oils are often yellowish or darker in colour. Its applications cover soap perfumes, household sprays, <b>floor</b> <b>polishes</b> and insecticides and is also used in microscope work as a clearing oil.|$|R
50|$|Nitrobenzene is {{also used}} to mask {{unpleasant}} odors in shoe and <b>floor</b> <b>polishes,</b> leather dressings, paint solvents, and other materials. Redistilled, as oil of mirbane, nitrobenzene has been used as an inexpensive perfume for soaps. A significant merchant market for nitrobenzene is its use in the production of the analgesic paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) (Mannsville 1991). Nitrobenzene {{is also used}} in Kerr cells, as it has an unusually large Kerr constant.|$|R

50|$|Saltillo tile may {{be sealed}} with a {{penetrating}} sealant or a film forming sealant (coating). A film forming sealant will leave a {{film on the}} surface of the tile. With multiple coats the film will build an even protective film and gloss that may repel water, oil, grease and efflorescence. A quality acrylic sealant should be used as it will be easy to apply, non-yellowing and long lasting. A quality acrylic <b>floor</b> <b>polish</b> can be applied over the sealed surface for added abrasion and wear protection.|$|R
50|$|Cedarwood oils {{each have}} {{characteristic}} woody odours which may change somewhat {{in the course}} of drying out. The crude oils are often yellowish or even darker in color and some, such as Texas cedarwood oil (derived primarily from Juniperus ashei and J. deppeana), are quite viscous and deposit crystals on standing. They find use (sometimes after rectification) in a range of fragrance applications such as soap perfumes, household sprays, <b>floor</b> <b>polishes</b> and insecticides. Small quantities are used in microscope work as a clearing oil.|$|R

30|$|Unlike other {{renewable}} fuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol, biogas {{production is}} relatively simple and can operate under any conditions {{and is not}} monopolistic (Kalia et al. 1992; Kapadi et al. 2004).

Biogas for rural energy is sustainable, affordable, and has no negative effect on people’s health or the environment, if handled properly (Khandelwal & Mahdi 1986; Kumar & Jain 1988).
