5|$|On June 24, 2010, at a press-only Korean event, Blizzard {{announced}} that Korean players {{would be able}} to play StarCraft II for free with an active World of Warcraft subscription. In PC bangs, or other cybercafés, players can play the game by paying 500 to 1500 South Korean won (approx. $.50 to $1.50) per hour. Other options include a 30-day subscription for ₩9900 (approx. $8), a 24 hours play-time ticket for ₩2000 (approx. $1.50), and unlimited access for ₩69,000 (approx. $56). The <b>end-user</b> license agreement (EULA) for StarCraft II differs significantly from those of Blizzard's earlier titles in that buying the game only grants the buyer a license to play, while the game itself remains the property of Blizzard. Any breach of the EULA amounts not only to breach of contract but copyright infringement as well, giving Blizzard greater control over how the game is used. Concerns have been raised by Public Knowledge over how the altered EULA may affect multiplayer tournaments not endorsed by Blizzard.|$|E

The two agreed to {{complete}} it out as a game they could release on Steam though with no expectations of sales. Completion of the game from the prototype to the finished state took about 3 months with part-time development. During this time, they discovered there were several limitations on the {{size and scope of}} both Flash and ActionScript that limited how much they could do with the game, but continued to use the tools as to release the title. McMillen said that because they were not worried about sales, they were able to work with Valve to release the game without fears of censorship or having to seek an ESRB rating. Releasing through Steam also enabled them to update the game freely, several times on its initial release, an aspect that they could not do with other consoles without significant cost to themselves. They did release without significant <b>end-user</b> testing, as it would have taken several hundreds of users to go through all the various combinations of items that a player could collect, and McMillen recognized they had released the title with their buyers being playtesters for them. A week after the Steam release, McMillen released a demo version via the website Newgrounds. Merge Games produced a physical edition that included the game, soundtrack, and a poster, for stores in the United Kingdom in 2012.|$|E

However, managers and experts want to limit autonomy to ensure that procedures are followed closely, rather than permitting flexibility. This results in the creation of environments that are intrinsically de-motivating rather than motivating <b>end-users</b> to become self-determined and self-regulating co-creators of a secure IT environment.

40|$|Abstract. In Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), service {{composition}} integrates existing {{services to}} fulfill specific tasks using {{a set of}} standards and tools. However, current service composition techniques and tools are mainly designed for SOA professionals. It becomes challenging for <b>end-users</b> without sufficient service composition skills to compose services. In this paper, we propose a framework that supports <b>end-users</b> to dynamically compose and personalize services to meet their own context. Instead of requiring <b>end-users</b> to specify detailed steps in the composition, our framework only requires the <b>end-users</b> specify the goals of their desired activities using a few keywords to generate a task list. To organize the task list, we analyze the historical usage data and recover the control flows among the tasks in the task list. We also mine the task usage pattern from the historical usage data to recommend new services. A prototype is designed and developed as a proof of concept to demonstrate that our approach enables <b>end-users</b> to discover and compose services easily...|$|R

40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} the profit maximization {{problem for a}} wireless network carrier and the payment minimization for <b>end-users.</b> Motivated by recent findings on proactive resource allocation, {{we focus on the}} scenario whereby <b>end-users</b> who are equipped with device-to-device (D 2 D) communication can harness predictable demand in proactive data contents caching and the possibility of trading their proactive downloads to minimize their expected payments. The carrier, on the other hand, utilizes a dynamic pricing scheme to differentiate between off-peak and peak time prices and applies commissions on each trading process to further maximize its profit. A novel marketplace that is based on risk sharing between <b>end-users</b> is proposed where the tension between carrier and <b>end-users</b> is formulated as a Stackelberg game. The existence and uniqueness of the non-cooperative sub-game Nash equilibrium is shown. Furthermore, we explore the equilibrium points for the case when the D 2 D is available and when it is not available, and study the impact of the uncertainty of users future demands on the system's performance. In particular, we compare the new equilibrium with the baseline scenario of flat pricing. Despite <b>end-users</b> connectivity with each other, the uncertainty of their future demands, and the freshness of the pre-cached contents, we characterize a new equilibrium region which yields to a win-win situation with respect to the baseline equilibrium. We show that <b>end-users</b> activity patterns can be harnessed to maximize the carrier's profit while minimizing the <b>end-users</b> expected payments. Comment: 31 page...|$|R
