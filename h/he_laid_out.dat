5|$|Constantine the Great {{effectively}} {{became the}} emperor {{of the whole}} of the Roman Empire in September 324. Two months later, <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> the plans for a new, Christian city to replace Byzantium. As the eastern capital of the empire, the city was named Nova Roma; most called it Constantinople, a name that persisted into the 20th century. On 11 May 330, Constantinople was proclaimed the capital of the Roman Empire, which was later permanently divided between the two sons of Theodosius I upon his death on 17 January 395, when the city became the capital of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.|$|E
5|$|Having {{restored}} his surviving {{forces to}} order, and {{aware of the}} confusion in Bryennios's forces, Alexios decided to counter-attack. The plan <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> made far greater use of the particular skills of his Turkish horse-archers. He divided his force into three commands, of which two were left behind in ambush. The other, formed from the Immortals and the Chomatenoi under Alexios's own command, was not arrayed in one continuous line, but broken up in small groups, intermingled with other groups of Turkish horse-archers. This command would advance on the rebels, attack them, then feign retreat and draw them into the ambush.|$|E
5|$|In his magisterial three-volume Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion (1772–74), Priestley {{outlined}} {{his theories}} of religious instruction. More importantly, <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> {{his belief in}} Socinianism. The doctrines he explicated would become the standards for Unitarians in Britain. This work marked a change in Priestley's theological thinking that is critical to understanding his later writings—it {{paved the way for}} his materialism and necessitarianism (the belief that a divine being acts in accordance with necessary metaphysical laws).|$|E
50|$|Through {{his second}} {{marriage}} {{he came into}} possession of the estate of Lavington, Wiltshire, where <b>he</b> elaborately <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> gardens.|$|R
60|$|Harper {{laughed when}} <b>he</b> had <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> {{a bottle and}} glasses, and the faint rose‐like bouquet of Canary moscatel stole into the room.|$|R

5|$|Sir David further {{extended}} the castle {{in the late}} 16th century, {{with the addition of}} a large north range with round corner towers. <b>He</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> the garden in 1604, with symbols of England, Scotland and Ireland, to celebrate the Union of the Crowns of the previous year, when James VI acceded to the English throne on the death of his cousin, Elizabeth I. Sir David died in 1610, heavily in debt as a result of fines handed down for the unruly conduct of his son, and with both the garden and the north range incomplete.|$|E
5|$|At age fifty-eight, Baldwin {{desired to}} satisfy his nature {{of being a}} pioneer again by moving to Kansas, which {{was at that time}} a territory. He arrived as the brunt of the {{fighting}} in the territory was ending. Upon his arrival, he founded Baldwin City and built the first college building in the territory, which became the foundation for Baker University. He was in Kansas only for a short time when tragedy struck. On August 30, 1858, John's son Milton died unexpectedly after having been sick for only three days. Within a couple years, <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> a town, built a grist mill and a saw mill, and he turned over the town and college to the Methodist Conference and returned to Berea, although he continued to finance it.|$|E
5|$|His {{concern with}} public {{education}} was not interrupted by his military campaigns. In 1813 he {{was rewarded with}} 40,000 pesos for his victories at Salta and Tucumán, an amount that would equal almost 80 gold kilograms. Belgrano rejected taking the prize money for himself, considering that a patriot should not seek money or wealth. He gave {{it back to the}} XIII year Assembly, with instructions to build primary schools at Tarija, Jujuy, San Miguel de Tucumán, and Santiago del Estero. <b>He</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> a series of instructions about the methods and requirements for the selection of the teachers. However, the schools were not built, and by 1823 Bernardino Rivadavia declared that the money was lost; Juan Ramón Balcarce included it in the debt of the Buenos Aires province a decade later.|$|E

50|$|Much of the {{furniture}} was custom-designed for the house by Robert Weir Schultz {{in the early years}} of the 20th century. <b>He</b> also <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> many sections of the gardens.|$|R
500|$|The Guardian listed [...] "Improbable" [...] {{as one of}} the [...] "13 best X-Files episodes ever". UGO named God/Mr. Burt {{as one of the}} [...] "Top 11 X-Files Monsters", {{noting that}} [...] "as [...] imagines him, [...] is a benevolent deity, {{constantly}} prodding his creatures to look at the patterns before them, to see the overall plan that <b>he's</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out.</b> <b>He's</b> doomed to failure, and he knows it, though it doesn't stop him from trying".|$|R
5|$|In June 1975, O'Neill led a ten-week {{study of}} {{permanent}} space habitats at NASA Ames. During the study {{he was called}} away to testify on July 23 to the House Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. On January 19, 1976, he also appeared before the Senate Subcommittee on Aerospace Technology and National Needs. In a presentation titled Solar Power from Satellites, <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> his case for an Apollo-style program for building power plants in space. He returned to Ames in June 1976 and 1977 to lead studies on space manufacturing. In these studies, NASA developed detailed plans to establish bases on the Moon where space-suited workers would mine the mineral resources needed to build space colonies and solar power satellites.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{articulated}} his {{own beliefs}} about religion as well. He did not {{subscribe to the}} view religious feeling was primarily a social need, believing {{it to be a}} need for seeing a cause and logic to the world along with a harmony to things. A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects of the psyche lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of the times. In The Psychology of the Religious Life <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E
5|$|While {{imprisoned in}} 1924 after the failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler {{dictated}} Mein Kampf to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book is an autobiography and exposition of Hitler's ideology in which <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> {{his plans for}} transforming German society into one based on race. In it he outlined his belief in Jewish Bolshevism, a conspiracy theory that posited {{the existence of an}} international Jewish conspiracy for world domination in which the Jews were the mortal enemy of the German people. Throughout his life Hitler never wavered in his world view as expounded in Mein Kampf. The NSDAP advocated the concept of a Volksgemeinschaft ("people's community") with the aim of uniting all Germans as national comrades, whilst excluding those deemed either to be community aliens or of a foreign race (Fremdvölkische).|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> had <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> a {{long journey}} for us, and one {{that might not be}} {{performed}} before nightfall; but it had the merit of being comparatively safe until we were {{in the vicinity of the}} British encampment.|$|R
50|$|He died, greatly regretted by all {{who came}} into contact with his kindly personality, at the vicarage, Lenton, on 12 December 1889. He was buried in the churchyard of Stretton, which <b>he</b> had <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> during his {{incumbency}} there.|$|R
5|$|In Stevenson's first {{message to}} the legislature, he called on legislators to finally decide whether the state capital would remain at Frankfort or be moved to Lexington or Louisville, as some had wanted. His address {{made it clear that}} he favored keeping the capital at Frankfort, but he noted that {{additional}} space was needed at the present capitol building because the existing building could not continue to house enough room both the state treasurer and auditor. <b>He</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> a vision for an addition to the capitol that would make it more spacious and more grandiose. To pay for the expansion, the fiscally conservative Stevenson pressed the federal government to pay claims due Kentucky from Civil War expenses. By the end of his term, the state had collected over $1.5 million in claims. The legislature, however, disregarded his plan for expanding the capitol, instead opting to construct a separate executive office building next to the capitol.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{independence}} from Spain in 1821, the area {{became part of}} Mexico. Under Mexican rule, the mission system gradually ended, and its lands became privatized. In 1835, Englishman William Richardson erected the first independent homestead, near a boat anchorage around what is today Portsmouth Square. Together with Alcalde Francisco de Haro, <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> a street plan for the expanded settlement, and the town, named Yerba Buena, began to attract American settlers. Commodore John D. Sloat claimed California for the United States on July 7, 1846, during the Mexican–American War, and Captain John B. Montgomery arrived to claim Yerba Buena two days later. Yerba Buena was renamed San Francisco on January 30 of the next year, and Mexico officially ceded the territory to the United States {{at the end of}} the war. Despite its attractive location as a port and naval base, San Francisco was still a small settlement with inhospitable geography.|$|E
5|$|McConnel {{set about}} {{improving}} Bryn Eglwys {{to increase its}} output. He focused on providing rail transport for the isolated quarry, and in April 1864 he reached agreement with local landowners to purchase the land necessary to build a railway towards Tywyn and onwards to the port of Aberdyfi. Construction was well underway by July 1864. The standard gauge Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth, however, and in 1863 had reached Tywyn, so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn, as the nearest point where slate could {{be transferred to the}} standard gauge railway. This was despite the line's initial isolation {{from the rest of the}} system because of difficulties in bridging the estuary of the Afon Dyfi to the south. An Act of Parliament (28 and 29Vict, cap cccxv) allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given Royal Assent on 5 July 1865, and the company appointed James Swinton Spooner as engineer for the construction. <b>He</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway. By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the Board of Trade inspector Captain Henry Tyler could make an initial inspection and report.|$|E
50|$|In 1799, Abraham Shepherd married Margaret Moore, {{lived at}} Red Oak {{a short time}} before {{building}} a brick house and mill, later known as Pilson's Mill, on Eagle Creek. <b>He</b> also <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> and dedicated a cemetery, known as Baird's Cemetery.|$|R
60|$|There was an Australian there (a {{student from}} Stuttgart or somewhere,) and Joe told him who I was and <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> himself <b>out</b> {{to make our}} course plain, for us--so I am certain we can't get lost between here and Heidelberg.|$|R
50|$|The Quincy {{post office}} opened in 1855. James H. Bradley, {{one of the}} {{organizers}} of Plumas County, donated the land at Quincy for establishment of the county seat. <b>He</b> then <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> the town and named it after his ranch in Illinois.|$|R
25|$|On 4 June 1745 {{he became}} colonel of the Grey Dragoons and on 14 June 1746 he became General of the Marine Forces. His {{favourite}} residence was Newliston near Kirkliston in Linlithgowshire, where <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> gardens in the French style.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant-General William Evelyn Colonel of the 29th Foot in the British Army and Member of Parliament for Helston (1767–74), {{a son of}} Sir John Evelyn of Wotton, {{established}} his home at Send Grove, Church Lane, and <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> the grounds.|$|E
25|$|Paul's “Restore America” budget plan, which <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in October 2011, {{calls for}} the {{immediate}} elimination of the Department of Education. College Pell grants and other federal financial aid programs would be transferred to another branch of government during a transition period, following which all federal financial aid for education would be eliminated.|$|E
50|$|After {{the city}} fire of 1275, the foundation-stone {{for the new}} church was placed by Ottokar Přemysl. It {{was one of the}} first Gothic churches in the east-Austrian area. After Ottokar's death in the battle on the Marchfeld, <b>he</b> was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> here thirty weeks.|$|R
5000|$|In 1726, {{he built}} the Branicki Palace, the [...] "Versailles of Podlasie". <b>He</b> also <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> {{the central part}} of the town of Białystok with its {{triangular}} market. He started in the King's election of 1763-1764, but was beaten by his brother-in-law, Stanisław Poniatowski.|$|R
5000|$|It was trainer Steve Asmussen's first Belmont Stakes win. [...] "Obviously we're {{very proud}} of the horse. ... I really thought the horse tried to win late. <b>He</b> really <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> there, dug in, and I {{personally}} feel fortunate for his effort," [...] said Asmussen.|$|R
25|$|Although Sir Christopher Lowther {{initially}} purchased Whitehaven {{it was his}} son, Sir John Lowther, who {{was responsible}} for its growth and development. Sir John acquired the market charter in 1660 but the urban growth did not start until the 1680s when <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> a spacious rectangular grid of streets to the north east of the existing tiny hamlet.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, {{three years}} after the Great Seattle Fire, he became Seattle city {{engineer}} and began the process of paving roads, building sidewalks, and adding sewer lines (often through areas that earlier engineers could not work out how to plumb). With his assistant, George F. Cotterill, <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> Lake Washington Boulevard, initially conceived as a path for bicycles.|$|E
25|$|It {{was at the}} University of California, Berkeley that {{seminars}} {{attended by}} Bank of America executives helped him to develop his theories about lending and economic activity, views <b>he</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in two books, John Maynard Keynes (1975), a classic study of the economist and his contributions, and Stabilizing an Unstable Economy (1986), {{and more than a}} hundred professional articles.|$|E
60|$|It was {{arranged}} that Prince Eugene should commence the attack, {{and that when}} he had crossed the rivulets {{in front of the}} French left, Marlborough should advance and attempt to carry out the plan <b>he</b> had <b>laid</b> <b>out,</b> namely, to cut the French line between Oberglau and Blenheim.|$|R
