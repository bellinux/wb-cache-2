60|$|Morning {{brought to}} light a land of small farms, with cattle in minute pastures, {{surrounded}} by stacks of hay and grain, plowed <b>fields,</b> <b>threshing</b> crews, and teams plodding to and fro on dusty roads. The plainsman was gone, the prairie farmer filled the landscape. Towns thickened and grew larger. At noon the freight lay at a siding to let the express trains come in at a populous city, and in the wait Mose found time to pace the platform.

The genotyping cost was calculated for the whole population across successive generations (F 3 to F 7 /F 8) and compared with the genotyping cost (F 3 to F 7 /F 8) considering only the QTL classes that performed better in F 3. The genotyping cost was calculated considering five markers per QTL (one peak/near the peak, two right-hand-side flanking markers, and two left-hand-side flanking markers) using USD 0.50 per data point (Xu et al. 2002; Xu 2010).|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{equipment}} was introduced {{beginning in the}} 1930s. Tractors first replaced mules for tilling and plowing. The first tractors used were McCormick-Deering/International Harvester models with steel wheels and requiring hand cranking for starting. Mechanical harvesting was not introduced until just prior to World War II, when a McCormick Reaper was adapted for use with rice. Rice on its stalks was cut and bundled by the reaper, assembled by hand into shocks for the initial drying in the <b>field.</b> A mechanical <b>thresher</b> replaced the tractor-driven thresher, {{and the introduction of}} rice dryers allowed the rice to be dried at the field, reducing the risk of loss to birds and rain. In 1946, mechanical combines were introduced that were capable of both reaping and threshing, removing the rice from the stalk in the field and allowing all of the drying process to take place with rice off the stalk in dryers at the mill.|$|R
5000|$|Sprout {{damage is}} {{undesirable}} germination of wheat kernels that occurs on mature, unharvested wheat when wet field conditions persist {{just prior to}} and during the harvest. Mature wheat that has been cut and left lying in the <b>field</b> prior to <b>threshing</b> is particularly vulnerable to sprout damage. Early cold weather in Canada often forces wheat producers there to cut and windrow their crop to allow for drying. Wet conditions can then cause widespread sprout damage. If it has occurred, there is a dramatic increase of the enzyme alpha-amylase. The Falling Number test {{is a measure of}} the presence of this enzyme. A high falling number indicates that the wheat is sound and satisfactory for most baking processes. A low falling number indicates that harmful sprouting has occurred and is suggestive of reduced baking quality. In bread, too much alpha-amylase activity will cause wet sticky bread crumb with large voids in the loaf and too little causes dry crumble bread crumb and high loaf density.|$|R
40|$|Grain moulds {{are a major}} {{constraint}} to sorghum {{production and}} to adoption of improved cultivars in many tropical areas. Information on the inheritance of grain mould reaction is required to facilitate breeding of resistant cultivars. The genetic control of grain mould reaction was studied in 7 crosses of 2 resistant sorghum genotypes. P 1, P 2, F 1, F 2, BC 1 and BC 2 families of each cross were evaluated under sprinkler irrigation for <b>field</b> grade and <b>threshed</b> grade scores and subjected to generation mean analysis. Frequency distributions for grain mould reaction were derived and F 2 and BC 1 segregation ratios were calculated. Grain mould reaction in crosses of coloured grain sorghum was generally controlled by two or three major genes. Resistance to grain moulds was dominant. Significant additive gene effects were also found in all cross/season combinations. Significant dominance effects of similar magnitude to additive effects were also observed in five out of ten cross/season combinations. Gene interactions varied according to the parents with both resistant and susceptible parents contributing major genes. Choice of parents with complementary resistance genes and mechanisms of resistance will be {{critical to the success}} of resistance breeding...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical wheat {{threshing}} {{has gained}} a spectacular popularity in Pakistan over a short span of time {{and so is the}} population of beater wheat threshers that are being manufactured and marketed by the roadside vendors with little scientific and engineering experience. In fact, the major problems on conventional threshers have been identified as bulky weight, poor machine performance, human accidents and a high fuel consumption rate. Therefore, there was a dire need of research in Pakistan for modification and improvements in the prevalent design of the conventional wheat thresher to bring about durability, reduction in weight of machine and grain losses in addition to an accident free and cost effective thresher. A review of the indigenous thresher suggests presence of three heavy flywheels with little scientific argument and similarly poorly designed beaters/spikes and five rings on the beater-drum appear injudicious and unscientific. A horizontal throw of straw from the exhaust-blower takes away a noticeable amount of grains with it. Indigenous threshers have witnessed terrifying accidents for the persons feeding the material. The local manufacturers least care about the fabrication drawings of the conventional machines and therefore their knowledge of manufacturing is restricted to the whims and wishes of â&# 8364;&# 339;ustad-shagirdâ&# 8364;� (seniors, juniors). In view of above mentioned problems, the present study hypothesizes engineering oriented solutions for the ill-designs of the conventional threshers. Modified designs and fabrication drawings of various components such as flywheel, beater, beater drum, blower and feeding conveyer were prepared. Both machines were operated during the wheat threshing seasons for two consecutive years at farmerâ&# 8364;&# 8482;s <b>field.</b> During <b>threshing</b> seasons 2011 - 2012 farmers were interviewed about this new design. Their comments were commamorable. Major hindrance in purchasing conventional thresher is high cost. Total weight of redesigned wheat thresher was reduced from 1600 kg to 1300 kg by improving beaters in thresher drum and the grain damage in redesigned thresher reduced four times, thereby saving buying cost about Rs. 50, 000 The mean threshing efficiency is increased from 98...|$|R
40|$|Grain molds in {{rainy season}} sorghums can cause poor grain quality {{resulting}} in economic losses. Grain molds {{are a major}} constraint to the sorghum production and for adoption of the improved cultivars. A complex of fungi causes grain mold. Information on genetics of grain mold resistance and mechanisms is required to facilitate the breeding of durable resistant cultivars. A genetic study was conducted using one white susceptible, three white resistant/tolerant sources, and one colored resistant source in the crossing programme to obtain four crosses. P 1, P 2, F 1, BC 1, and BC 2, and F 2 families of each cross were evaluated for the <b>field</b> grade and <b>threshed</b> grade scores, under sprinkler irrigation. Generation mean analyses and frequency distribution studies were carried out. The frequency distribution studies showed that grain mold resistance in the white-grained resistance sources was polygenic. The additive gene action and additive × additive gene interaction were significant in all the crosses. Simple recurrent selection or backcrossing should accumulate the genes for resistance. Epistasis gene interactions were observed in colored resistance × white resistance cross. Gene interaction was influenced by pronounced G × E. Pooled analysis showed that environment × additive gene interaction and environment × dominant gene interaction were significant. The complex genetics of mold resistance {{is due to the}} presence of different mechanisms of inheritance from various sources. Evaluation of segregating population for resistance and selection for stable derivatives in advanced generations in different environments will be effectiv...|$|R
5000|$|As {{many other}} villages in Cyprus, Angastina, until 1907, was bi-communal. On the 17 August {{of that year}} a murder {{occurred}} that would eventually {{drive a wedge between}} the village's Christian and Muslim communities. A young Turk {{fell in love with a}} married Greek woman. He was warned off but took it to heart and stupidly fired upon a company of young Greek men very late at night while they were having a coffee in the village square. One the Greek young men suspecting the young Turk took the Police to the young Turk's house. The young Turk confessed and the father offered monetary retribution. The young Greek man refused to be bough off by the father so the young Turk was arrested by the Police. The father was furious that the young Greek man would not accept the money. That night he went with his son inlaw to the <b>threshing</b> <b>field</b> which the young Greek man was guarding with his mother-in-law nearby. The Turkish father murdered him while he was asleep by bashing his head in with a rock. Eventually the Turkish father was arrested and he and his son in law were tried, sentenced and hung by the British authorities of the island. The whole story is recorded in the ballad [...] "The murder of Nikoli Philippou" [...] by C. T. Palaisi written at the time and the local press. After that event all Turkish Angastiniotes sold up and moved to nearby Turkish villages.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-two sorghum genotypes were {{evaluated}} for grain mould response, 13 morphological and biochemical traits thought {{to contribute to}} resistance, and 3 agronomic traits related to utilization. Measurements of grain mould (<b>field</b> grade score, <b>threshed</b> grade score, ergosterol content, and percentage germination) were strongly correlated with one another. Highly significant correlations between measures of grain mould and seed hardness, seed phenol content in acid methanol extract, and glume colour indicated that they strongly affected grain mould response. Harder grain, higher levels of seed phenols, and darker glumes contributed to grain mould resistance. Weaker and less consistent correlations between measures of grain mould and seed colour, seed flavan- 4 -ol content, glume phenol and flavan- 4 -ol contents, and glume cover indicated relatively less effect of these traits on grain mould response. Genotype means indicated that combinations of several traits are required to achieve resistance. Germplasm lines, including coloured-seeded lines IS 14375, IS 14387, IS 18144, and IS 18528, and white-seeded lines IS 21443, IS 24495 and IS 25017, showed greatest grain mould resistance. Improved lines generally had poorer grain mould resistance than these landraces. However, the best improved lines were comparable in resistance to white-seeded landraces. B 58586, IS 14375 and IS 14387 are hard-seeded guinea sorghum lines {{that can be used}} as sources of grain mould resistance of West Africa. SP 33316, SP 33349 and GM 15018 are agronomically elite lines that can be used as sources of grain mould resistance for further improvement of white-seeded sorghum for South Asia and other regions...|$|R
