5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are <b>diverse</b> <b>and</b> use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E
5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the <b>diverse</b> <b>and</b> sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E

The city's cultural scene spans its history, dating back to Roman times: the city started to be built in that period, which has left its mark on the urban layout (centered on today's Piața Muzeului) as well as surviving ruins. However, the medieval town saw a shift in its centre towards new civil and religious structures, notably St. Michael's Church.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{now having}} {{established}} a taxonomic grouping for the Liliaceae family that is genetically monophyletic, {{compared to the}} prior longstanding polyphyletic assemblages under this name, the morphology remains <b>diverse,</b> <b>and</b> there exists within the Liliaceae clade a number of subclades. There appeared to be two major clades, the first and largest of these consisted of three subclades: Clintonia—Medeola—Gagea, Lilium Fritillaria—Notholirion, and Tulipa—Erythronium. The second smaller clade, Streptopus—Tricyrtis contained elements of Dahlgren's Uvulariaceae. The position of Calochortus remained problematic, being considered a sister clade to Liliaceae, as treated by Tamura, but further analysis suggested {{it was in fact}} sister to Tricyrtis, although it is now considered separate once again (see Table 3).|$|E
