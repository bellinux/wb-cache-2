" The story of Brer Rabbit and the Tar-Baby is a case study in dysfunctional conversation. A conversation is a kind of approach, an attitude towards the conversational partner. Steve Talbott (2004) and Craig Holdrege (2005) have explored the metaphor of conversation as an approach to the world. The way in which one approaches a conversation, they show, reveals much about how one conceives of the world, how one relates to the other.

6000|$|The {{comedy of}} The Good-Natured Man was {{completed}} by Goldsmith early in 1767, and submitted to the perusal of Johnson, Burke, Reynolds, and others of the literary club, by whom it was heartily approved. Johnson, who was seldom half way either in censure or applause, pronounced it the best comedy that had been written since The Provoked Husband, and promised to furnish the prologue. This immediately became an object of great solicitude with Goldsmith, knowing the weight an introduction from the Great Cham of literature would have with the public; but circumstances occurred which he feared might drive the comedy and the prologue from Johnson's thoughts. The latter was {{in the habit of}} visiting the royal library at the Queen's (Buckingham) House, a noble collection of books, in the formation of which he had assisted the librarian, Mr. Bernard, with his advice. One evening, as he was seated there by the fire reading, he was surprised by the entrance of the king (George III.), then a young man; who sought this occasion to have a conversation with him. The conversation was varied and discursive; the king shifting from subject to subject according to his wont; [...] "during the whole interview," [...] says Boswell, [...] "Johnson <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> his majesty with profound respect, but still in his open, manly manner, with a sonorous voice, and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee and in the drawing-room. 'I found his majesty wished I should talk,' said he, 'and I made it my business <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> I find it does a man <b>good</b> <b>to</b> be <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> by his sovereign. In the first place, a man cannot be in a passion--'" [...] It would have been well for Johnson's colloquial disputants could he have often been under such decorous restraint. He retired from the interview highly gratified with the conversation of the king and with his gracious behavior. [...] "Sir," [...] said he to the librarian, [...] "they may talk of the king as they will, but he is the finest gentleman I have ever seen." [...] "Sir," [...] said he subsequently to Bennet Langton, [...] "his manners are those of as fine a gentleman as we may suppose Louis the Fourteenth or Charles the Second." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I could but do her any good," [...] sighed Beatrice, as {{she opened}} the door and hastened upstairs. She knocked, and entered without waiting for an answer: Henrietta lifted up her head, came forward with a little cry, threw herself into her arms, and wept bitterly. Mournful as all around was, there was a bright ray of comfort in Queen Bee's heart when she was thus hailed as a friend and comforter. She only wished and longed to know what might best serve to console her poor Henrietta; but all that {{occurred}} to her was to embrace and fondle her very affectionately, and call her by the most caressing names. This was all that Henrietta was as yet fit to bear; and after a time, growing quieter, she poured out to her cousin all her grief, without fear of blame for its violence. Beatrice was sometimes indeed startled by the want of all idea of resignation, but she could not believe that any one could feel otherwise,--least of all Henrietta, who had lost her only parent, and that parent Aunt Mary. Neither did she feel herself <b>good</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> seriously <b>to</b> Henrietta; she considered herself as only sent to sit with her, so she did not make any attempt to preach the resignation which was so much wanted; and Henrietta, who had all day been hearing of it, and rebelling against it, was almost grateful <b>to</b> her. So Henrietta <b>talked</b> and talked, the same repeated lamentation, the same dreary views of the future coming over and over again; and Beatrice's only answer was to agree with all her heart to all that was said of her own dear Aunt Mary, and to assure Henrietta of the fervent love that was still left for her in so many hearts on earth.|$|R
40|$|Background: The rate of autopsies {{has dropped}} to low levels in Western {{countries}} during the last four decades. In Sweden the rate of autopsy was 11 % 2015. Aim: The overall aim {{of the project was}} to study the background to the low levels of autopsies. One specific aim was to describe the attitudes of registered nurses (RN) and physicians (MD) toward clinical autopsy in neonatal and adult hospital care (I). Another was to investigate the clinical usefulness of autopsies for determining the cause of death and as a source of information for relatives (II). Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to RNs and MDs in the following specialized clinics at Karolinska University Hospital: gastroenterology, hematology, geriatrics and neonatal care. A total of 336 surveys were distributed. The data were divided into two groups, neonatal care and adult care, and were analyzed with descriptive statistical methods. Three questions with free-text comments were analyzed with qualitative analysis (I). The process of post-mortem examination at the university hospital was investigated. A total of 53 autopsies were studied using data from medical records, including nurse´s records, autopsy request forms, autopsy reports and death certificates (II). Results: The response rate was 35 %, and the results were similar in the two groups. About 40 % of the RNs had experience in participating in an autopsy. 14 % of the MDs had only limited or no experience. Notably few RNs and approximately one-third of the MDs were familiar with the autopsy process and the treatment of the deceased person after an autopsy. More than one-third of the RNs had experience with <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> relatives regarding autopsy. Most responders agreed that an autopsy could be supportive for relatives during the grieving process and beneficial for the quality of health care. Most MDs thought that autopsies should be performed more frequently than they are today: however, 17 % of the MDs did not agree {{that there should be a}} higher frequency of autopsies. The qualitative analysis provided a deeper understanding of the answers of the respondents (I). In two-thirds of the cases, the autopsy significantly altered or complemented the clinical picture in a way that was noted in the death certificate. In two-thirds of the cases, it was documented that the relatives was informed of the result of the autopsy. The frequency of autopsy request varied between 4 % and 23 % among the studied clinics. In six cases the relatives requested the examination (II). Conclusion: The survey data confirmed the value of clinical autopsies in neonatal and adult hospital care. Clinical autopsy was a valuable source of information for the death certificates and for the relatives. The diagnostic value of autopsies in adult care was the same when autopsy frequencies was above 50 %. RNs and MSs should receive training regarding the autopsy process and methods for obtaining consent for an autopsy. In addition, we believe that the RNs are in a <b>good</b> position <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the relatives of the possibilities of autopsy and offer a postmortem examination to get answers of questions raised by the relatives. RNs have an opportunity to take a more active role in the autopsy process as a member of a care team...|$|R
