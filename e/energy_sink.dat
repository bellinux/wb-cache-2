500|$|As was {{explained}} by Leon Mestel in 1952, unless the white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star or other source, its radiation comes from its stored heat, {{which is not}} replenished.,§2.1. White dwarfs have an extremely small surface area to radiate this heat from, so they cool gradually, remaining hot for a long time. As a white dwarf cools, its surface temperature decreases, the radiation which it emits reddens, and its luminosity decreases. Since the white dwarf has no <b>energy</b> <b>sink</b> other than radiation, it follows that its cooling slows with time. The rate of cooling has been estimated for a carbon white dwarf of 0.59 [...] with a hydrogen atmosphere. After initially taking approximately 1.5billion years to cool to a surface temperature of 7,140K, cooling approximately 500 more kelvins to 6,590K takes around 0.3billion years, but the next two steps of around 500kelvins (to 6,030K and 5,550K) take first 0.4 and then 1.1billion years., Table 2.|$|E

40|$|Residual {{feed intake}} (RFI) is a {{candidate}} trait for feed efficiency in dairy cattle. We investigated the influence of lactation stage {{on the effect of}} <b>energy</b> <b>sinks</b> in defining RFI and the genetic parameters for RFI across lactation stages for primiparous dairy cattle. Our analysis included 747 primiparous Holstein cows, each with recordings on dry matter intake (DMI), milk yield, milk composition, and body weight (BW) over 44 lactation weeks. For each individual cow, energy-corrected milk (ECM), metabolic BW (MBW), and change in BW (ΔBW) were calculated in each week of lactation and were taken as <b>energy</b> <b>sinks</b> when defining RFI. Two RFI models were considered in the analyses; RFI model [1] was a 1 -step RFI model with constant partial regression coefficients of DMI on <b>energy</b> <b>sinks</b> (ECM, MBW, and ΔBW) over lactation. In RFI model [2], data from 44 lactation weeks were divided into 11 consecutive lactation periods of 4 wk in length. The RFI model [2] was identical to model [1] except that period-specific partial regressions of DMI on ECM, MBW, and ΔBW in each lactation period were allowed across lactation. We estimated genetic parameters for RFI across lactation by both models using a random regression method. Using RFI model [2], we estimated the period-specific effects of ECM, MBW, and ΔBW on DMI in all lactation periods. Based on results from RFI model [2], the partial regression coefficients of DMI on ECM, MBW, and ΔBW differed across lactation in RFI. Constant partial regression coefficients of DMI on <b>energy</b> <b>sinks</b> over lactation was not always sufficient to account for the effects across lactation and tended to give roughly average information from all period-specific effects. Heritability for RFI over 44 lactation weeks ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 29 in model [1] and from 0. 10 to 0. 23 in model [2]. Genetic variance and heritability estimates for RFI from model [2] tended to be slightly lower and more stable across lactation than those from model [1]. In both models, RFI was genetically different over lactation, especially between early and later lactation stages. Genetic correlation estimates for RFI between early and later lactation tended to be higher when using model [2] compared with model [1]. In conclusion, partial regression coefficients of DMI on <b>energy</b> <b>sinks</b> differed across lactation when modeling RFI. Neglect of lactation stage when defining RFI could affect the assessment of RFI and the estimation of genetic parameters for RFI across lactation...|$|R

The optimization problem becomes especially important in those cases where there are several different energy sources, including, e. g., renewable energy sources, and several <b>energy</b> <b>sinks</b> of different power.

40|$|Solar {{thermal water}} {{splitting}} (STWS) {{is a process}} which utilizes concentrated sun-light to drive the endothermic water split-ting reaction. This processes stores the intermittent and diffuse energy of the sun into storable, and energy dense chemical bonds. In STWS a metal oxide is heated to temperatures exceeding 1000 °C. This drives the metal oxide to reduce, liberat-ing O 2 and generating a reduced metal oxide. In a second step, the reduced metal oxide is exposed to steam, liberating H 2 and re-gen-erating the original metal oxide, which can then be re-used in {{the first step of}} the reaction.

50|$|Studies {{published}} in 2010 claimed to identify electronic quantum coherence and entanglement between the excited states of different pigments in the light-harvesting stage of photosynthesis. However, critical follow-up studies question {{the interpretation of}} these results and assign the reported signatures of electronic quantum coherence to nuclear dynamics in the chromophores. There {{are a number of}} proposals as to how quantum coherence transfers the absorbed energy to the reaction site. According to one proposal, if each site within the complex feels its own environmental noise, then because of both quantum coherence and thermal environment, the electron will not remain in any local minimum but proceed to the reaction site. Another proposal is that the rate of quantum coherence combined with electron tunneling creates an <b>energy</b> <b>sink</b> that moves the electron to the reaction site quickly. Recent work indicates that symmetries present in the geometric arrangement of the complex may favor efficient energy transfer to the reaction center, in a way that resembles perfect state transfer in quantum networks. However, control experiments cast doubts on the interpretation that quantum effects last any longer than one hundred femtoseconds.|$|E
5000|$|Maturity {{is after}} {{the time of}} {{occlusion}} when the storm has completed strengthening and the cyclonic flow is at its most intense. [...] Thereafter, {{the strength of the}} storm diminishes as the cyclone couples with the upper level trough or upper level low, becoming increasingly cold core.

40|$|Using Vibro-Impact Nonlinear <b>Energy</b> <b>Sinks</b> (VI NESs) {{is one of}} {{the novel}} {{strategies}} to control structural vibrations and mitigate their seismic response. In this system, a mass is tuned on the structure floor, so that it has a specific distance from an inelastic constraint connected to the floor mass. In case of structure stimulation, the displaced VI NES mass collides with the  inelastic constraint and upon impacts, energy is dissipated. In the present work, VI NES is studied when its parameters, including clearance and stiffness ratio, are simultaneously optimized. Harmony search as a recent meta-heuristic algorithm is efficiently specialized and utilized for the aforementioned continuous optimization problem. The optimized attached VI NES is thus shown to be capable of interacting with the primary structure over a wide range of frequencies. The resulting controlled response is then investigated, in a variety of low and medium rise steel moment frames, via nonlinear dynamic time history analyses. Capability of the VI NES to dissipate siesmic input energy of earthquakes and their capabilitiy in reducing response of srtructures effectively, through vibro-impacts between the <b>energy</b> <b>sink’s</b> mass and the floor mass, is discussed by extracting several performance indices and the corresponding Fourier spectra.

50|$|Plasma {{discharges}} {{within the}} tokamak's vacuum chamber consist of energized ions and atoms {{and the energy}} from these particles eventually reaches the inner wall of the chamber through radiation, collisions, or lack of confinement. The inner wall of the chamber is water-cooled and {{the heat from the}} particles is removed via conduction through the wall to the water and convection of the heated water to an external cooling system. Turbomolecular or diffusion pumps allow for particles to be evacuated from the bulk volume and cryogenic pumps, consisting of a liquid helium-cooled surface, serve to effectively control the density throughout the discharge by providing an <b>energy</b> <b>sink</b> for condensation to occur. When done correctly, the fusion reactions produce large amounts of high energy neutrons. Being electrically neutral and relatively tiny, the neutrons are not affected by the magnetic fields nor are they stopped much by the surrounding vacuum chamber. The neutron flux is reduced significantly at a purpose-built neutron shield boundary that surrounds the tokamak in all directions. Shield materials vary, but are generally materials made of atoms which are close to the size of neutrons because these work best to absorb the neutron and its energy. Good candidate materials include those with much hydrogen, such as water and plastics. Boron atoms are also good absorbers of neutrons. Thus, concrete and polyethylene doped with boron make inexpensive neutron shielding materials. Once freed, the neutron has a relatively short half-life of about 10 minutes before it decays into a proton and electron with the emission of energy. When the time comes to actually try to make electricity from a tokamak-based reactor, some of the neutrons produced in the fusion process would be absorbed by a liquid metal blanket and their kinetic energy would be used in heat-transfer processes to ultimately turn a generator.|$|E

There were three distinct metabolic phases during this time. In phase I (0 to 50 seconds after the pulse), the carbon/electron balances closed up to 85 %.
