40|$|A novel {{thruster}} fault {{identification method}} for {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} is presented in this article. It uses the proposed peak region energy method to extract fault feature and uses the proposed least square grey relational <b>grade</b> <b>method</b> to estimate fault degree. The peak region energy method is developed from fusion feature modulus maximum method. It applies the fusion feature modulus maximum method to get fusion feature and then regards the maximum of peak region energy in the convolution operation results of fusion feature as fault feature. The least square grey relational <b>grade</b> <b>method</b> is developed from grey relational analysis algorithm. It determines the fault degree interval by the grey relational analysis algorithm and then estimates fault degree in the interval by least square algorithm. Pool experiments of the experimental prototype are conducted to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed methods. The experimental results show that the fault feature extracted by the peak region energy method is monotonic to fault degree while the one extracted by the fusion feature modulus maximum method is not.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} cytograding of breast cancers using Robinson&#x 2032;s and Mouriquand&#x 2032;s <b>grading</b> <b>methods.</b> Materials and Methods: A 5 -year retrospective (from Oct 2000 to Sept 2005) and 1 -year prospective study (from Oct 2005 to Oct 2006). A total of 110 fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) cases of breast cancers were studied. These were graded according to Robinson&#x 2032;s and Mouriquand&#x 2032;s <b>grading</b> <b>methods</b> (grade I-III) followed by comparison of the two methods. Results: Of the 110 cases graded according to Robinson&#x 2032;s method, 28 (25. 45 &#x 0025;) cases were grade I, 46 (41. 81 &#x 0025;) grade II, and 36 (32. 72 &#x 0025;) were grade III, whereas using Mouriquand&#x 2032;s <b>grading</b> <b>methods,</b> 28 (25. 45 &#x 0025;), 42 (38. 18 &#x 0025;), and 40 (36. 36 &#x 0025;) cases were graded as grade I, II, and III, respectively. A high degree of concordance was observed between the two <b>grading</b> <b>methods</b> (90. 9 &#x 0025;).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Structural timber in Europe {{is either}} graded {{visually}} or by machine. Both <b>grading</b> <b>methods</b> {{are applied to}} limit the variation in engineering properties of sawn timber. The obtained grading results are largely dependent on the method chosen. In addition, parameters such as species, source, and cross-section of the timber, {{as well as the}} applied grading rules also play a role. To what extent these parameters- depending on the chosen grading method- actually affect timber properties and yields is of interest for both producers and users of sawn timber. For analysing the different grading results, laboratory data of 10704 spruce specimens were evaluated. The used cross-section has a major influence on the grading result. Furthermore, the used grading rule and the method applied to determine characteristic values are essential for the grading result. The origin of the timber influences the grading results of both <b>grading</b> <b>methods.</b> While the yields for machine grading are always higher than for visual grading, both <b>grading</b> <b>methods</b> are prone to fall short of the declared properties. It is recommended to adjust the normative framework as well as to regulate both grading procedures similarly...|$|E
