40|$|Soon {{after its}} {{entry into the}} Indo-Pakistan subcontinent in 1964, cholera <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> {{progressively}} replaced classical cholera. One of the probable reasons for this was found from laboratory studies of {{the interaction of the}} two choleragenic vibrios, V. cholerae and V. <b>El</b> <b>Tor.</b> It was observed, in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, that in mixed culture <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> <b>vibrios</b> from cholera cases are capable of outgrowing and rapidly eliminating V. cholerae. The apathogenic <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> strains from the Middle East countries differed significantly from the pathogenic type of <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> strains isolated from cholera cases in that the former did not inhibit the growth of V. cholerae strains. The possible mechanism of interaction of the pathogenic <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> <b>vibrios</b> and V. cholerae was studied in detail.

40|$|A {{new medium}} that stimulates in vitro {{production}} of cholera toxin by Vibrio cholerae O 1 <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> (<b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> <b>vibrios)</b> was developed. The medium contains 0. 5 % NaCl, 0. 3 % NaHCO 3, 0. 4 % yeast extract, and 1. 5 % Bacto-Peptone. <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> <b>vibrios</b> were cultured in a stationary test tube at 37 degrees C for 20 h. The culture supernatant was assayed for cholera toxin by a reversed passive latex agglutination method. Most vibrios grown in this medium produced 10 to 20 times more toxin than in traditional syncase medium. The number of live vibrios {{at the end}} of culture was about 10 (8) /ml in the new medium (AKI medium) and about 10 (10) /ml in the syncase medium. As a result, each individual organism in the new medium should have produced as much as 1, 000 times more toxin than in syncase medium.

The vibrios {{were found in the}} guts of six pilgrims returning from Mecca. Though the pilgrims failed to show ante or post mortem evidence of cholera, the vibrios isolated from the guts were agglutinable within the anti-cholera serum. Later in 1905, Kraus and Pribram found that the bacteria, which produced soluble hemolysin, were more related to non-cholera vibrios; therefore, referred to all hemolytic <b>vibrios</b> as <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> <b>vibrios.</b> In the early 1930s, A. Shousha, A. Gardner and K.

Pollitzer designated <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> as its own species V. eltor separate from V. cholera, but six years later, in 1965, R.

Thus, they were classified as a single species V. cholera: however, Hugh believed the differing features between the two could be of epidemiological importance, so <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> <b>vibrios</b> were further classified as V. cholerae biotype eltor (serogroup O1).|$|R

40|$|Cholera is endemic in Bangladesh, and {{a regular}} {{seasonal}} pattern of cholera epidemics occurs. We examined the clonal relationships among 103 clinical and environmental Vibrio cholerae isolates belonging to O 1, O 139, or non-O 1 non-O 139 serogroups isolated during epidemic and interepidemic periods in Bangladesh and compared them with those of 51 V. cholerae isolates from four countries in Asia and Africa. These studies were done by a computer-assisted numerical analysis of the restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns of rRNA genes (ribotypes). Unweighed pair-group cluster analysis of BglI- and HindIII-generated band patterns revealed 16 clusters. Ribotypes were defined as clusters of strains possessing > 98 % similarity. The results showed that 154 isolates could be differentiated into 15 different ribotypes, and strains belonging to 3 of these ribotypes (ribotypes I, V, and VIIIA and VIIIB) were isolated more frequently during the epidemic periods than during interepidemic periods in Bangladesh. Classical vibrios belonged to six different ribotypes (ribotypes I to VI), with a mean similarity coefficient of 0. 84, and the <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> <b>vibrios</b> belonged to five different ribotypes (ribotypes VIIIA and IX to XII), with a mean similarity coefficient of 0. 82. A single clone of <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> <b>vibrios</b> (ribotype XII) was resident in Tanzania, whereas Nigeria, Syria, and India shared toxigenic <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> strains with Bangladesh.

40|$|We {{identify}} and characterize a gene cluster in <b>El</b> <b>Tor</b> <b>Vibrio</b> cholerae that encodes a cytotoxic activity for HEp- 2 cells in vitro. This gene cluster contains four genes and is physically {{linked to the}} cholera toxin (CTX) element in the V. cholerae genome.

The toxin, RtxA, resembles members of the RTX (repeats in toxin) toxin family in that it contains a GD-rich repeated motif. Like other RTX toxins, its activity depends on an activator, RtxC, and an associated ABC transporter system, RtxB and RtxD. In V. cholerae strains of the classical biotype, a deletion within the gene cluster removes rtxC and eliminates cytotoxic activity. Other strains, including those of the current cholera pandemic, contain a functional gene cluster and display cytotoxic activity. Thus, the RTX gene cluster in El Tor O 1 and O 139 strains might have contributed significantly to their emergence.
