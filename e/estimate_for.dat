40|$|A new {{approach}} to error analysis of hybridized mixed methods is proposed and applied to study a new hybridized variable degree Raviart-Thomas method for second order elliptic problems. The approach gives error <b>estimates</b> <b>for</b> the Lagrange multipliers without using error <b>estimates</b> <b>for</b> the other variables. Error <b>estimates</b> <b>for</b> the primal and flux variables then follow from those for the Lagrange multipliers. In contrast, traditional error analyses obtain error <b>estimates</b> <b>for</b> the flux and primal variables first and then use it to get error <b>estimates</b> <b>for</b> the Lagrange multipliers. The {{new approach}} not only gives new error <b>estimates</b> <b>for</b> the new variable degree Raviart-Thomas method, but also new error <b>estimates</b> <b>for</b> the classical uniform degree method with less stringent regularity requirements than previously known estimates. The error analysis is achieved by using a variational characterization of the Lagrange multipliers wherein the other unknowns do not appear. This approach {{can be applied to}} other hybridized mixed methods as well...|$|R

5|$|A later model {{suggested}} that confinement {{resulted from a}} co-rotational eccentricity resonance (CER). The model {{takes into account the}} finite mass of the Adams ring, which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring. A byproduct of this theory is a mass <b>estimate</b> <b>for</b> the Adams ring—about 0.002 of the mass of Galatea. A third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case are trapped in its stable Lagrangian points. However Voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, making such a theory unlikely. Some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets are trapped in co-rotational resonances with Galatea, providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} {{study on}} adaptation, 57 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were {{introduced}} to the island of Desecheo and other southern off-shore islands and cays in 1967. Prior to the introduction, Desecheo was the largest nesting colony of the brown booby, but mainly as a result of egg predation by the introduced macaques, no bird species presently nests in the island. Efforts to trap and remove the species have been unsuccessful and it has expanded its range to southwestern Puerto Rico. Other primates also have established populations in Puerto Rico. As a result of vandalism, 107 squirrel monkeys escaped from a research station at Sabana Seca in the late 1970s. The latest <b>estimate</b> <b>for</b> this population is 35 individuals.|$|E
