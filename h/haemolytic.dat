5|$|The {{research}} group's principal investigations concerned {{immunological tolerance}} (the body's acceptance of tissues, {{as opposed to}} rejection), autoimmune <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia (especially in mice), and immune responses to cancer in various animals. In his clinical role, Woodruff started a vascular surgery program and worked {{with the use of}} immunotherapy as a cancer treatment as well as the treatment of autoimmune <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia. However, his most important clinical accomplishments were in kidney transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe <b>haemolytic</b> anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
25|$|Both anti-S and anti-s {{have been}} implicated in {{transfusion}} reactions and <b>haemolytic</b> disease of the newborn. Anti-M although occurring naturally has rarely {{been implicated in}} transfusion reactions. Anti-N is not considered to cause transfusion reactions. Severe reactions have been reported with anti-U and anti-Miltenberger. Anti Mi-I (Vw) and Mi-III has been recognised {{as a cause of}} <b>haemolytic</b> disease of the newborn. Raddon has been associated with severe transfusion reactions.|$|E
25|$|EL1: Less {{common than}} spectrin {{mutations}} are band 4.1 mutations. Spectrin tetramers must bind to actin {{in order to}} create a proper cytoskeleton scaffold, and band 4.1 is an important protein involved in the stabilisation of the link between spectrin and actin. Similarly to the spectrin mutations, band 4.1 mutations cause a mild <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia in the heterozygous state, and a severe <b>haemolytic</b> disease in the homozygous state.|$|E
25|$|<b>Haemolytic</b> crises are acute {{accelerated}} {{drops in}} haemoglobin level. The {{red blood cells}} break down at a faster rate. This is particularly common in patients with coexistent G6PD deficiency. Management is supportive, sometimes with blood transfusions.|$|E
25|$|As vitamin C enhances iron absorption, iron {{overload}} {{may become}} an issue to people with genetic iron overload disorders, such as haemochromatosis. One trial in people with sickle cell anemia reported that compared to placebo, after 180 days of supplementation with 1400 mg vitamin C and 800 IU vitamin E, {{there was a significant}} increase in <b>haemolytic</b> biomarkers.|$|E
25|$|Common {{hereditary}} elliptocytosis {{is the most}} common form of elliptocytosis, and the form most extensively researched. Even when looking only at this form of elliptocytosis, there is a high degree of variability in the clinical severity of its subtypes. A clinically significant <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia occurs only in 5-10% of sufferers, with a strong bias towards those with more severe subtypes of the disorder.|$|E
25|$|Tick bites - Babesiosis {{is a rare}} tickborne infection. Patients {{should check}} {{themselves}} or have themselves inspected for tick bites {{if they are in}} an at-risk situation. Presentation with fever, fatigue, and <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia requires diagnostic confirmation by identifying the parasites within red blood cells on blood film and by specific serology. Quinine (with or without clindamycin) is usually an effective treatment.|$|E
25|$|Nitrofurantoin is also {{contraindicated}} in babies {{up to the}} age of one month, as {{they have}} immature enzyme systems in their red blood cells (glutathione instability), so nitrofurantoin must not be used because it can cause <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia. For the same reason, nitrofurantoin should not be given to pregnant women after 38 weeks of pregnancy. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency because of risk of intravascular hemolysis resulting in anemia.|$|E
25|$|The aging {{red blood}} cell {{undergoes}} changes in its plasma membrane, making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocyte system (spleen, liver and lymph nodes), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This process is termed eryptosis, {{red blood cell}} programmed cell death. This process normally occurs {{at the same rate}} of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating red blood cell count. Eryptosis is increased {{in a wide variety of}} diseases including sepsis, <b>haemolytic</b> uremic syndrome, malaria, sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, phosphate depletion, iron deficiency and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, energy depletion as well as a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics. Excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. Inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin, nitric oxide, catecholamines and high concentrations of urea.|$|E
500|$|The jack jumper ant and its {{relatives}} in the genus Myrmecia {{are among the most}} dangerous ant genera and have fearsome reputations for their extreme aggression; Guinness World Records certifies the ant Myrmecia pyriformis as the world's most dangerous ant. The jack jumper have been compared to other highly aggressive ant species, such as [...] Brachyponera chinensis, Brachyponera sennaarensis, and the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta). The retractable sting is located in their abdomen, attached to a single venom gland connected by the venom sac, which is where the venom is accumulated. Exocrine glands are known in jack jumpers, which produce the venom compounds later used to inject into their victims. Their venom contains <b>haemolytic</b> and eicosanoid elements and histamines. It contains a range of active ingredients and enzymatic activity, which includes phospholipase A2 and B, hyaluronidase, acid and alkaline phosphatase. The venom of the ant also contains several peptides; one being pilosulin 1, which causes cytotoxic effects, pilosulin 2, which has antihypertensive properties and pilosulin 3, which is known to be a major allergen. Other pilosulins include pilosulin 4 and pilosulin 5. The peptides have known molecular weights. The LD50 (lethal dose) occurs at a lower concentration than for melittin, a peptide found in bee venom. Its LD50 value is 3.6 mg/kg (injected intravenously in mice).|$|E

2500|$|Delayed {{hemolytic}} reactions occur {{more than}} 24 hours until 14 {{days after a}} transfusion. This is due to low amount of antibodies available during {{the start of the}} transfusion. Therefore, acute <b>haemolytic</b> reaction does not manifests until after 24 hours when enough amount of antibodies are available to cause a reaction. The red blood cells are removed by macrophages from the blood circulation into liver and spleen to be destroyed, which leads to extravascular haemolysis.

Other features may include; leukocytosis (50% of cases); left shift and dysplasia of monocytes and granulocytes; presence of metamyelocytes, myelocytes and promonocytes; monocytes with hypersegmented/abnormal shaped nuclei, increased cytoplasmic basophilia and/or the presence of cytoplasmic granules; eosinophilia (in cases of CMML with eosinophilia); and spherocytosis (in cases of DCT positive <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia). Platelet counts may be reduced, increased or normal. Haemoglobin levels are usually reduced with normocytic and normochromic red blood cells. Autoantibodies and cold agglutinins may be present and 10% of CMML is DCT positive.|$|E
2500|$|EL2 and EL3: The {{most common}} genetic defects (present in {{two-thirds of all}} cases of {{hereditary}} elliptocytosis) are in genes for the polypeptides α-spectrin or β-spectrin. These two polypeptides combine {{with one another in}} vivo to form an αβ heterodimer. These αβ heterodimers then combine to form spectrin tetramers. [...] These spectrin tetramers are among the basic structural subunits of the cytoskeleton of all cells in the body. Although there is much interindividual variability, it is generally true that α-spectrin mutations result in an inability of α-spectrin to interact properly with β-spectrin to form a heterodimer. In contrast, it is generally true that β-spectrin mutations lead to αβ heterodimers being incapable of combining to form spectrin tetramers. In both cases the end result is a weakness in the cytoskeleton of the cell. Individuals with a single mutation in one of the spectrin genes are usually asymptomatic, but those who are homozygotes or are compound heterozygotes (i.e. they are heterozygous for two different elliptocytosis-causing mutations) have sufficient cell membrane instability to have a clinically significant <b>haemolytic</b> anaemia.|$|E
