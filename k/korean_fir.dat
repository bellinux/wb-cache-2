50|$|<b>Korean</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies koreana; 구상나무, Gusang namu in Korean) is a fir {{native to}} the higher {{mountains}} of South Korea, including Jeju-do island. It grows at altitudes of 1,000 - 1,900 m in temperate rain forest with high rainfall and cool, humid summers, and heavy winter snowfall.|$|E
50|$|<b>Korean</b> <b>fir</b> is a {{very popular}} {{ornamental}} plant in gardens in cool climates, grown for its foliage {{but also for the}} abundant cone production even on young trees only 1 - 2 m tall. The cultivar 'Silberlocke' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
50|$|Nordmann fir, noble fir, Fraser fir and {{balsam fir}} are popular Christmas trees, {{generally}} considered to be the best for this purpose, with aromatic foliage that does not shed many needles on drying out. Many are also decorative garden trees, notably <b>Korean</b> <b>fir</b> and Fraser fir, which produce brightly coloured cones even when very young, still only 1 - 2 m tall. Other firs can grow anywhere between 30 and 236 ft tall. Fir Tree Appreciation Day is June 18.|$|E
50|$|This Korean {{stamp mill}} {{appeared}} in 2003, the first Asian mill on the museum site. It is an overshot mill from a hill {{region in the}} province of Gangwon-do in South Korea. Hill farmers used this type of farm in the 19th century to grind corn. The Gifhorn mill was built in Korea using old traditional methods and <b>Korean</b> <b>firs</b> and birches and transported by ship to Germany, where three specialists from Korea erected it. It is a present from the Korean governor in whose district this type of mill was used.|$|R
50|$|In South Korea, {{boreal forest}} doesn't {{exist in the}} lowlands. However, subalpine {{coniferous}} forest is found in highland or mountainous district in South Korea. Part of Hallasan, part of Seoraksan, fir forest of Jirisan and Gotjawal Forest in Jejudo are the subalpine forests in South Korea. At an altitude of 1200 m-1500 m in Hallasan Mountain, there is a coniferous forest which consists of pine, juniper, a <b>Korean</b> <b>fir.</b> Fruticeta is formed in 1500 m-1700 m and the alpine zone spread out above 1850 m. South-facing slopes have more mild weather than north-facing slopes. Therefore, its height extends a little more on the south side.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLimited {{knowledge}} {{is available on}} the regeneration of <b>Korean</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies koreana Wilson), an endemic plant species, growing on the upper part of Mt. Hallasan, a volcanic mountain, located in the central part of Jeju Island, Korea. A forest stand with the size of 1 ha dominated by <b>Korean</b> <b>fir</b> trees was established and all the trees with DBH 2 cm or larger were mapped and surveyed. Initial analysis indicated that the numbers of saplings with their DBHs between 2 cm and 10 cm were very small and that there was a big gap in the frequency of the number of saplings regenerated from the forest stand. It seems clear that the regeneration of the <b>Korean</b> <b>fir</b> trees was disturbed for longer than the last two decades, potentially by the browsing of the seedlings by ungulate including Siberian roe deer and by the physical hindrance of the dwarf bamboo {{to the development of the}} saplings of the <b>Korean</b> <b>fir.</b> Urgent measures and extensive studies are needed to promote the natural regeneration of the tree species on the dynamics of the forest regeneration and the mechanism of forest development of the forests on the Mt. Hallasan, Jeju Island, Korea...|$|E
