500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I knew there was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>your</b> concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E
2500|$|Juin {{was greatly}} opposed to de Gaulle's {{decision}} to grant independence to Algeria, although he remained steadfastly loyal to de Gaulle. In {{the wake of}} the Algiers putsch of 1961 and the Organisation Armée Secrète terrorist campaign, he was placed under house arrest. He was [...] "retired" [...] and his special privileges as a marshal were taken away. In December 1963, he suffered a thrombosis and was hospitalised in the Val-de-Grâce, where he was visited by de Gaulle. Delirious, Juin spoke of [...] "Constantine, Algeria, my country", to which de Gaulle embraced him and replied [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>your</b> country is there".|$|E
2500|$|On 26 July, Naguib {{arrived to}} say his farewells to the former King, {{arriving}} late and catching up with Farouk by boat, {{a few minutes after}} Farouk had set sail. After an awkward silence {{on the deck of the}} royal yacht El-Mahrousa, Naguib reminded Farouk that until the 1942 standoff with the British the army had been loyal to the monarchy, but that things had changed since then. Naguib said, [...] "Sir, we were forced to do what we did," [...] to which Farouk replied, [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>Your</b> mission is a difficult one. As you know, governing Egypt is not an easy task." [...] Naguib later stated [...] "I could not feel joy for his defeat".|$|E

2500|$|The most {{pervasive}} rumors concerned Brown's ties to {{well known}} gangsters. Legend {{has it that}} he survived as a bootlegger during Prohibition in the United States. Another rumor was that before he came to Hollywood, {{he had been a}} bodyguard for a Detroit gangster. [...] He apparently knew Benjamin Bugsy Siegel, but not well. In the 1967 paperback We Only Kill Each Other: The life and bad times of Bugsy Siegel, includes an anecdote in which Brown and Siegel meet at Santa Anita and threaten to commit various degrees of mayhem on each other. Brown (described as a thin and wiry man) responds to Siegel's threat by saying,"I'm just as tough as you are, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>your</b> pals Frank Costello and Frank Nitti and I've got a mind to call 'em and report what you said." [...] Siegel' or his biographer's description of Brown differs from his friend, Gene Fowler's, who described Brown as [...] "hulking." [...] Philip Dunne described him as a [...] "big bear of a man." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Guert Ten Eyck, {{why do you}} try me thus?" [...] {{demanded the}} fortune-teller, solemnly. [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>your</b> father, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>your</b> mother; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>your</b> {{ancestors}} in Holland, and their children in America. Generations on generations have <b>I</b> <b>known</b> <b>your</b> people, {{and you are the}} first that I have seen so ill-clad! Do you suppose, boy, that old Doortje's eyes are getting dim, and that she cannot tell her own nation? I saw you on the river--ha! ha! 't was a pleasant sight--Jack and Moses, too; how they snorted, and how they galloped! Crack--crack--that's the ice--there comes the water!--See, that bridge may hit you on the head! Do you take care of this bird, and do you take care of that--and all will come round with the seasons. Answer me one thing, Guert Ten Eyck, and answer me truly. Know you ever a young man who goes quickly into the bush?" ...|$|R
