5000|$|In {{membrane}} {{science and}} technology, concentration polarization {{refers to the}} emergence of concentration gradients at a membrane/solution interface resulted from selective transfer of some species through the membrane under the effect of transmembrane driving forces. Generally, the cause of concentration polarization is the ability of a membrane to transport some species more readily than the other(s) (which is the membrane permselectivity): the retained species are concentrated at the upstream membrane surface while the concentration of transported species decreases. Thus, concentration polarization phenomenon is inherent to all types of membrane separation processes. In the cases of gas separations, pervaporation, membrane distillation, reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration separations, the concentration profile has a higher level of solute nearest to the upstream membrane surface compared with the more or less well mixed bulk fluid far from the membrane surface. In the case of dialysis and electrodialysis, the concentrations of selectively transported dissolved species are reduced at the upstream membrane surface compared to the bulk solution. The emergence of concentration gradients is illustrated in Figs. 1a and 1b. Fig. 1a shows the concentration profile near and within a membrane when an external driving force is just applied to an initially equilibrium system. Concentration gradients have not yet formed. If the membrane is selectively permeable to species 1, its flux (...) within the membrane is higher than that in the solution (...) [...] Higher flux in the membrane causes a decrease in the concentration at the upstream membrane surface (...) and an increase at the downstream surface (...) , Fig. 1b. Thus, the upstream solution becomes depleted and the downstream solution becomes enriched in regard to species 1. The concentration gradients cause additional diffusion fluxes, which contribute to an increase of the total flux in the solutions and to a decrease of the flux in the membrane. As a result, the system reaches a steady state where [...] The greater the external force applied, the lower [...] In electrodialysis, when [...] becomes much lower than the bulk concentration, the resistance of the <b>depleted</b> <b>solution</b> becomes quite elevated. The current density related to this state is known as the limiting current density.|$|E

40|$|The free {{growth of}} {{dendrites}} in a uniformly supercooled solution was examined using cine photography with a Schlieren optical system. Crystals were {{grown in the}} bulk of the solution from a centrally located capillary tube, nucleated at the interface with a liquid nitrogen cooled wire. Crystals propagated along the tube, the slower growing orientations eliminated, and emerged at the tip, usually growing parallel to the tube direction. For both sodium sulfate decahydrate from its solution and ice from sodium chloride solution, growth rate and fineness of dendrites increased with supercooling. In sodium sulfate, upward convection of the less dense <b>depleted</b> <b>solution</b> occurs; downward convection was observed for the rejected, more concentrated sodium chloride solution. In both cases, there was a spatial and temporal delay in the release of the convective plume from the moving dendrite tip.

Three FGF receptors from Pleurodeles PR 1, PR 3, PR 4, homologs to human receptors, and the human EGF receptor were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Under FGF 1, FGF 2 and FGF 4 stimulation, PR 1 and PR 3 display a one phase inward chloride calcium dependent current superimposed by sustained oscillations, whereas PR 4 did not show any oscillations. These currents were dependent on intracellular calcium mobilisation, as the responses were reduced by caffeine (10 mM). Solely PR 4 responses were affected by an extracellular calcium <b>depleted</b> <b>solution</b> suggesting the involvement of concomitant extracellular and intracellular calcium intervention in the calcium chloride current, whereas PR 1 and PR 3 did not. Under EGF stimulation, the EGF receptor elicits a two component inward current composed of an undelayed rapid transient dependent on intracellular calcium store recruitment followed by a second slower current dependent on calcium influx. The specific pattern and amplitude of the calcium oscillations induced by the combinatorial action of growth factors on their receptors could be relevant in numerous calcium dependent cell functions...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} sucrose {{crystals}} from aqueous solution has been investigated. A Review {{of the previous}} work on the growth of crystals from solution has been made. A new interference technique {{has been applied to}} the problem in the employment of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This has the advantage over any other type of interferometer for two reasons. One is that the fringes can be localized in any desired plane. (In the present case this was the plane of the growing crystal). The second is that in an interferometer such as the Michelson type the light beam traverses the object in two directions i. e. in going from the beam splitter and returning to it. If the object has considerable local variations in refractive index there can be some displacement of the beam, which on its return journey does not pass exactly along the same path that it did initially. This might lead to fringe confusion. In the Mach-Zehnder system the beam passes through the object in one direction only and this difficulty does not arise. The changes in refractive index of the solution were measured for a number of crystals growing from solution and hence the concentration along a face was determined. This was in many cases a maximum at the corners of the crystal but faces were observed which had a uniform concentration along their length for quite a long period of time. The value in all cases was greater than solubility concentration. The effect of convection on growth was investigated. When a crystal grows a stream of <b>depleted</b> <b>solution</b> can be seen rising from the crystal. This was observed to become established at a corner of the crystal. The concentration of the solution at the centre of this stream has been measured and was approximately 1 % less than that in the bulk of the solution.

40|$|Synopsis [...] The {{sorption}} of {{cationic surfactants}} (cationics) from aqueous solution onto hair is determined {{as a function}} of time using a solution depletion method. The solutions are periodically analyzed for cationic content by an Orange II dye procedure. Data from the sorption runs are conveniently processed by a programmed computer. Two quaternary amxnonium surfaetants, hexadeeyl-(CTAB) and dodeeyl-(DTAB) tri-methylammonium bromides, have been studied under various experimental conditions. The rate of CTAB sorption onto hair increases with increased pH or temperature, choice of buffer anion, or use of bleached hair. A decrease in "hair-to-solution " ratio also causes an increase in CTAB sorption.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the sensitometric {{properties}} of Insight and Ektaspeed Plus radiographic films manually and automatically processed using fresh and <b>depleted</b> chemical <b>solutions.</b> Ten sets of each type of film were obtained (1 set = 5 films), 5 sets being manually processed and 5 sets being automatically processed. A total of 100 films (50 Ektaspeed Plus and 50 Insight film) were exposed and developed. The first two sets of each film type were developed in fresh chemicals (one set per each type of processing), on the first day of the experiment. The other sets were processed in the same progressively <b>depleted</b> <b>solutions</b> once a week until the end of experiment, which was completed within 4 weeks. Characteristic curves were constructed to compare the sensitometric properties of the films: contrast, latitude and speed. Processing solution depletion had different effects on manually and automatically developed films, which was confirmed by the changes in the form of the characteristic curves in the third week of the automatic processing and fourth week of the manual processing. Ektaspeed Plus showed 11 % reduction in contrast values for manual processing and 53 % for automatic processing, while Insight contrast values showed a reduction of 25 % and 59 %, respectively. Insight film, however, showed lesser loss of speed and lesser increase of latitude than Ektaspeed Plus. In conclusion, chemical depletion in automatic film processing was faster than in manual developing. In depleted chemicals, both types of films had an increase in latitude values and a decrease in speed and contrast. Insight was more resistant than Ektaspeed Plus to decrease in speed and latitude when processed using older chemicals, whereas contrast in Ektaspeed Plus was comparatively more stable...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for clean industrial processes has intensified {{the use of}} electrodialysis {{in the treatment of}} metal containing effluents and encourages the investigation of the different phenomena involved in the transport of metal ions through cation-exchange membranes. Ion sorption, chronopotentiometric and current–voltage characteristics have been obtained to characterize the transport of sodium and iron through homogeneous and heterogeneous cation-exchange membranes. The heterogeneous membranes having a broader pore size distribution showed increased electrical resistances with solutions of trivalent iron, which may be caused by the blockage of the smallest pores by multivalent ions. However, for both types of membranes an unexpected decrease of the electrical resistance with increasing current densities was verified with concentrated solutions of Fe 2 (SO 4) 3. This behavior was explained to be a consequence of the dissociation of FeSO 4 +FeSO 4 + ions into more conductive Fe 3 + and SO 42 −SO 42 − ions as the <b>depleting</b> <b>solution</b> layer becomes diluted. When tested with multicomponent mixtures, the homogeneous perfluorosulfonic membranes show an increased preference for Na+ ions at low current densities and, once Na+ ions are depleted from the membrane surface Fe 3 + ions are transported preferentially at higher current densities. On the contrary, both Na+ ions and Fe(III) species are responsible for the ion transport through the heterogeneous membranes within the ohmic regime of currents. CAPE...|$|R

Various kinetically and thermodynamically con-trolled processes affected the size of the window of Fe uptake. Adsorption lowered, but did not prevent Fe mobilization by DMA. Microbial activity <b>depleted</b> DMA from <b>solution,</b> but not on time scales jeopardizing Strategy II Fe acquisition. Complexation o...|$|R
40|$|Selection-cutting is the {{preferred}} method of logging in northern hardwood forests, because it is thought to favor the regeneration of valuable, shade-tolerant trees, maximize long-term productivity, and increase the health, quality and economic value of residual trees. Claims have also been made for the ecological sustainability of selection cutting, in particular that it: (a) preserves soil fertility; (b) maintains natural canopy composition; (c) protects plant and animal habitat. I evaluated these claims by studying the effects of selection-cutting on several measures of soil fertility (Ca, Al, Ca/Al molar ratios, pH), canopy composition and tree regeneration, herbaceous layer composition, and structural features related to habitat quality (cavity trees, snags, coarse woody debris) in 55 stands ranging from newly cut to old-growth (not all data overlaps). I found that forest growth after selection-cutting <b>depletes</b> soil <b>solution</b> calcium and lowers soil solution Ca/Al molar ratios, posing a threat to long-term forest health and productivity, particularly at higher elevations and in sites on siliceous bedrock. I found that selection-cut stands dominated by red oak (Quercus rubra) are converting to sugar maple (Acer saccharum) stands, posing a threat to both canopy and herbaceous layer diversity. I found no lasting effects of selection-cutting on herbaceous layer composition, diversity or quality, but I found indirect threats from the conversion of red oak stands to sugar maple and from depletion of soil solution calcium. Finally, I found that current selection-cutting practices generally do not meet published targets for large trees, cavity trees, snags and coarse woody debris, but that they probably could meet those targets with minor changes to cutting practices. I conclude by discussing {{the implications of these}} results for the management of northern hardwood forests...|$|R
40|$|Isotopic {{fractionation}} {{of oxygen}} and hydrogen in water caused by gas hydrate formation was investigated experimen-tally. Two different gas hydrates in structures, Structure I hydrate and Structure II hydrate, were formed with methane and krypton gases in a NaCl solution. Isotopic fractionation during gas hydrate formation was observed by measuring oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions in the solutions sampled {{before and after}} gas hydrate formation. Heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water were <b>depleted</b> in the <b>solution</b> resulting from that those isotopes were concentrated in the gas hydrate. The isotopic fractionation was larger as increasing amounts of gas hydrates that were calculated from both the decrease of gas pressure and increase of NaCl concentration in solution. The isotopic fractionation factors of oxygen and hydrogen in water between gas hydrate and liquid water were determined to be 1. 0023 – 1. 0032 and 1. 014 – 1. 022, respectively. The significant difference of the gas hydrate structures was not observed beyond the analytical errors. These factors {{are similar to those}} between ice and liquid water...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{growth is}} common on wetted {{surfaces}} in spacecraft environmental control and {{life support systems}} despite the use of chemical and physical disinfection methods. Advanced control technologies are needed to limit microorganisms and increase the reliability of life support systems required for long-duration human missions. Silver ions and compounds are widely used as antimicrobial agents for medical applications {{and continue to be}} used as a residual biocide in some spacecraft water systems. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified silver fluoride for use in the potable water system on the next generation spacecraft. Due to ionic interactions between silver fluoride in solution and wetted metallic surfaces, ionic silver is rapidly <b>depleted</b> from <b>solution</b> and loses its antimicrobial efficacy over time. This report describes research to prolong the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver by maintaining its solubility. Three types of metal coupons (lnconel 718, Stainless Steel 316, and Titanium 6 AI- 4 V) used in spacecraft potable water systems were exposed to either a continuous flow of water amended with 0. 4 mg/L ionic silver fluoride or to a static, pre-treatment passivation in 50 mg/L ionic silver fluoride with or without a surface oxidation pre-treatment. Coupons were then challenged in a high-shear, CDC bioreactor (BioSurface Technologies) by exposure to six bacteria previously isolated from spacecraft potable water systems. Continuous exposure to 0. 4 mg/L ionic silver over the course of 24 hours during the flow phase resulted in a > 7 -log reduction. The residual effect of a 24 -hour passivation treatment in 50 mg/L of ionic silver resulted in a > 3 -log reduction, whereas a two-week treatment resulted in a > 4 -log reduction. Results indicate that 0. 4 mg/L ionic silver is an effective biocide against many bacteria and that a prepassivation of metal surfaces with silver can provide additional microbial control...|$|R
40|$|Rates of P influx and efflux were {{determined}} in whole plants at ambient P concentrations {{comparable to those}} found in soil solutions. Maize (Zea mays L. var NC+ 59) seedlings were trimmed (endosperm and adventitious roots removed) and grown in a greenhouse in solution cultures at P concentrations of approximately 0. 4 and 1. 8 micromolar. Roots of intact plants previously exposed to 32 P-labeled solutions at 0. 2 and 2. 0 micromolar P for 48 hours were rinsed 10 minutes in P-free solution and exposed to 33 P solutions at 0. 2 and 2. 0 micromolar for 10 minutes. Net depletion of 33 P from and appearance of 32 P in the ambient solution were used to measure influx and efflux. The ration of 32 P efflux to 33 P influx was about 0. 68 at 0. 2 micromolar and 0. 08 at 2. 0 micromolar. When plants were allowed to <b>deplete</b> P from <b>solutions,</b> the P concentration in the medium dropped to about 0. 15 micromolar within 24 hours and 0. 05 micromolar within 60 hours. Results indicate that P efflux is a substantial component of net P accumulation at P concentrations normally found in soil solutions...|$|R
