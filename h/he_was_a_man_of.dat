5|$|Bethune {{was known}} as a strict Augustinian canon, a priest living a monastic life but not a monk. Bethune was often {{appointed}} a judge delegate by the papacy to try cases and disputes, which had been referred back to England by the popes. The historian David Knowles said of Bethune that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> wide outlook, with a great desire for reform. He was praised by contemporaries for the care with which he selected men to serve as clergy in his diocese. He also held synods in his diocese, including two {{during the first year of}} his episcopate.|$|E
5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
5|$|When Gothenburg left Port Darwin on Tuesday, 16 February 1875, Captain Robert George Augustus Pearce {{was under}} orders to make best {{possible}} speed. Pearce {{had been her}} captain on the Adelaide-Darwin run {{for some time and}} had built up a solid reputation. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> the sea, a man of sobriety and kindness and was well respected by his fellow sea captains.|$|E

5|$|Whitlam was {{the most}} {{paradoxical}} of all Prime Ministers {{in the last half}} of the 20th century. A man of superb intellect, knowledge, and literacy, he yet had little ability when it came to economics.... Whitlam rivalled Menzies in his passion for the House of Representatives and ability to use it as his stage, and yet his parliamentary skills were rhetorical and not tactical. He could devise a strategy and then often botch the tactics in trying to implement that strategy.... Above all <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> grand vision with serious blind spots.|$|E
5|$|Evangelis Zappas {{was often}} {{described}} as a solitary and eccentric personality, who had no children. On the other hand, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> vision, determination and a patriot, who {{was well aware of}} the magnitude of his acts. His cousin, Konstantinos Zappas, was the executor of his will and he continued Evangelis Zappas philanthropic works through his legacy. Zappas's wish was to be initially buried in Romania, where he lived most of his life. But after four years his bones were exhumed and reinterred at the school's courtyard in Labovo where he was born, and his skull was enshrined beneath his memorial statue outside the Zappeion in Athens, Greece. A ceremony for the interment was held at 10am on 20 October 1888 at the Zappeion. Baron Pierre de Coubertin made a similar gesture by having his heart buried at Olympia.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> substance, {{his will}} showing {{connections}} with other county families. He left {{money to pay}} for an “Usher” or assistant in the School as well as dictionaries and other books, which would of course be valuable in those days.|$|E

50|$|Abbot Radulfus: Head of the Benedictine Abbey of St Peter and St Paul at Shrewsbury. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{of noble}} birth, {{with ties to}} King Stephen. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of great inner {{strength}} and exterior calm. With his position as abbot, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to <b>a</b> baron like Huon de Domville in the aristocracy. In this story, he and Prior Robert are the only characters who really existed historically. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> introduced {{at the end of}} Monk's Hood.|$|R
25|$|Through {{the years}} Boring’s {{rigidity}} softened {{and he was}} able to contribute to many areas in psychology. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> experimental psychology, objective science, but also philosophical science. His research was based on sensory and perceptual phenomena, but he was also a statesman and advocate for women in psychology and military psychology.|$|E
25|$|Bourne {{travelled}} and preached {{widely in}} England, Scotland, Ireland, Canada and the USA {{until his death}} in 1852. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> exceptional energy and organisational abilities. Bourne also wrote the 'History of the Primitive Methodists' (1823), a variety of theological tracts on subjects from baptism to salvation, edited the Primitive Methodist hymn book, and was editor of the denominational magazine for two decades.|$|E
25|$|According to Sebastian's 18th-century {{entry in}} Acta Sanctorum, still {{attributed}} to Ambrose by the 17th-century hagiographer Jean Bolland, and the briefer {{account in the}} 14th-century Legenda Aurea, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> Gallia Narbonensis who was taught in Milan. In 283, Sebastian entered the army in Rome under Emperor Carinus to assist the martyrs. Because of his courage {{he became one of}} the captains of the Praetorian Guards under Diocletian and Maximian, who were unaware that he was a Christian.|$|E

25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> strong character, athletic, brave, resolute, {{cool and}} {{resourceful}} in emergency; {{a man of}} rare ability and natural aptitude for war, and possessed, moreover, of that magnetic influence which communicates the highest confidence and devotion to those who follow. Lumsden upheld the principle that the greatest and best school for war is war itself. He believed in the elasticity which begets individual self-confidence, and preferred a body of men taught to act and fight with personal intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Eakins {{was a man}} {{of great}} character. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> iron will and his will to paint and to carry out his life as he thought it should go. This he did. It cost him heavily but in his works we have the {{precious}} result of his independence, his generous heart and his big mind. Eakins was a deep student of life, and with a great love he studied humanity frankly. He was not afraid of what his study revealed to him.|$|E
25|$|His {{death was}} {{a blow to the}} Heath government. Robert Carr {{described}} him as “our trumpeter … any government needs a great trumpeter.” Edmund Dell wrote: “His {{death was a}} tragedy for the Conservative Party and possibly for the country. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> considerable intellectual brilliance and one of the finest debaters in the House of Commons. He was the first professional gambler to become Chancellor…” His successor Anthony Barber was much less of a political heavyweight and Heath was able to dictate economic policy.|$|E

25|$|While Arjuna {{destroying}} {{the rest of}} the Shakatavuyha, Vikarna, the third eldest Kaurava, challenged Arjuna to an archery fight. Arjuna asked Bhima to decimate Vikarna, but Bhima refused to, because Vikarna had defended the Pandavas during the Draupadi Vastrapaharanam. Bhima and Vikarna showered arrows at each other. Later Bhima threw his mace at Vikarna, killing him. The muscular Pandava was devastated and mourned his death saying <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> Dharma and it was a pity how he lived his life. Drona killed Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of Kekaya and Dhrishtakethu, the ruler of Chedi.|$|E
25|$|On 3 January {{the third}} debate took place, hosted by RTL Televizija. The main topics were {{the return of}} former prime {{minister}} Ivo Sanader to the political scene, the economy, taxes and foreign relations, especially with Slovenia. Bandić once again repeated <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> work who {{would do anything for}} the people, while Josipović demonstrated his knowledge of law and foreign policy. On the next day, the results of a second set of election polls were published, showing Bandić made some gains, but Josipović's support was mostly unchanged.|$|E
25|$|Mr. T.M. Carnegie's {{abilities}} {{were too}} numerous and complex to {{be summed up}} in a sentence. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> sterling integrity; and it was a common saying in Pittsburg that his word was better than some men's bond. He had remarkable judgment; and his opinion on commercial questions was valued above that of much older and more experienced men. Quick and keen in his perceptions, cautious but progressive in his ideas, faithful to his engagements, and just in all his dealings, he gave to his company that which corporations are habitually lacking, namely, a conscience.|$|E

25|$|In June 1920 Forster {{was offered}} the post of Governor-General of Australia, which he accepted. Shortly afterwards, on 28 June 1920, he was {{appointed}} Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG). This was the first occasion on which the Australian government was genuinely consulted about {{the appointment of a}} Governor-General. The Colonial Secretary, Lord Milner, sent the Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, two other suggested appointments before Hughes approved of Forster. Hughes seems to have preferred Forster because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> modest reputation whom he thought he could control. His reputation as a sportsman was also an asset.|$|E
25|$|Penderel Moon simply {{attributes}} the League's {{rise to power}} to the alluring and irresistible appeal of the Pakistan cry to the Muslim masses. Peter Hardy's explained that the Muslim League gained its electoral success in the Punjab by making a religious appeal {{over the heads of}} the professional politicians. Pakistani historians have explained the League's success in the Punjab, as elsewhere in the subcontinent, solely in terms of the Two Nation Theory. Whatever the historians may suggest, one thing is clear that League's success was due to the political vision, farsightedness of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> high personal integrity and intelligence who became a Grandmaster of the game by his clever, and clever calculations.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> {{warm and}} kindly feelings, honest, outspoken and benevolent. Many anecdotes are told of his frankness of speech at court, {{and of his}} generous actions. He holds a {{well-defined}} place in French literature, as the first who reduced its versification to rule, and taught the value of workmanship for its own sake. His influence on English literature, through Pope and his contemporaries, was not less strong, though less durable. After much undue depreciation, Boileau's critical work has been rehabilitated by recent writers, perhaps {{to the extent of}} some exaggeration in the other direction. It has been shown that in spite of undue harshness in individual cases most of his criticisms have been substantially adopted by his successors.|$|E
