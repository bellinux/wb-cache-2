In this spy story, Neagle plays a German-sympathiser (or {{at least that}} <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{seems to be at}} first) who is forced to go to Canada for her own safety. In reality, of course, she's working as an undercover agent out to expose a plot to blow up Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia. The Yellow Canary received positive comment for its atmospheric recreation of wartime conditions.|$|E

25|$|She {{was born}} Elise Meitner on 7 November 1878 into a Jewish upper-middle-class family in Vienna, 2nd {{district}} (Leopoldstadt), {{the third of}} eight children. Her father Philipp Meitner {{was one of the}} first Jewish lawyers in Austria. She shortened her name from Elise to Lise. The birth register of Vienna's Jewish community lists Meitner as being born on 17 November 1878, but all other documents list her date of birth as 7 November, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> used. As an adult, she converted to Christianity, following Lutheranism, and was baptized in 1908.|$|E
25|$|Polyandrous {{relations}} are disapproved of inmost expressions of Hinduism.There {{is at least}} one reference to polyandry in the ancient Hindu epic Mahabharata. Draupadi married the five Pandava brothers, as this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> chose in a previous life. This ancient text remains largely neutral to the concept of polyandry, accepting this as her way of life. However, in the same epic, when questioned by Kunti to give an example of polyandry, Yudhishthira cites Gautam-clan Jatila (married to seven Saptarishis) and Hiranyaksha's sister Pracheti (married to ten brothers), thereby implying a more open attitude toward polyandry in Vedic society.|$|E
25|$|The {{law clerk}} Mr. Guppy, enamoured of Esther, hopes {{to win her}} affection by helping her {{discover}} the identity of her parents. He finds connections to both Lady Dedlock and the deceased Nemo, who {{has been identified as}} Captain James Hawdon, and is eventually alerted to the existence of letters left behind by Hawdon but kept by his drunken landlord, Krook. Realizing that Esther is her daughter whom she was told had died — fathered by Hawdon before her current marriage — Lady Dedlock confesses to Esther but swears her to secrecy. Esther is stricken by smallpox and nearly dies; she recovers but is terribly scarred. John proposes marriage to Esther, but though she accepts, he convinces her to keep it secret until she is sure it <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants. While amassing other enemies, Tulkinghorn deduces Lady Dedlock's secret and tries to use it to keep her in line.|$|E

And the thing <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had talked about as well, is that before a concert, what she finds very interesting is the rehearsals and the straining and maybe {{she would like to}} injure.

500|$|According to {{academic}} Robin Ellen Visel, Rosa {{is a complicated}} person, with roles thrust on her by her parents, which suppresses her own goals and desires. Gordimer explained how she constructed the book's narrative structure to convey this struggle and explain Rosa: [...] "he idea came to me of Rosa questioning herself as others see her and whether what they see <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> really is. And that developed into another stylistic question—if you're {{going to tell the}} book in the first person, to whom are you talking?" [...] This led to Gordimer creating Conrad and Katya for Rosa to use as sounding boards to question and explain herself.|$|E
500|$|For writing Ibuki, Zubkavich was {{nominated}} for a Joe Shuster Award. He said that, compared to Sakura, [...] "Ibuki's a more complex character, more flawed. She's a great ninja but she isn't even sure this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants out of life. (...) Sakura's never-give-up attitude may be more of a classic anime archetype, but I feel Ibuki's a character more people can empathize with." [...] He added, [...] "Ibuki’s personality has been limited to game endings and oh-so brief lines of dialogue from her victory quotes, so expanding upon those with this focused story is an honour and a challenge." [...] In a poll by Omar Dogan on his DeviantArt website, most of voters wanted to see Ibuki [...] "wearing something cute", and precisely something in the Harajuku-style Lolita fashion. Dogan's own favourite part of the story was [...] "the part where Ibuki and Oro battle." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were several}} ways of {{understanding}} her: there <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said, and there <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant, {{and there was}} something, between the two, that was neither. It is probable that, in the last analysis, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant <b>was</b> that Felix should spare her the necessity of stating the case more exactly and should hold himself commissioned to assist her by all honorable means to marry the best fellow in the world. But in all this it <b>was</b> never discovered <b>what</b> Felix understood.|$|R

500|$|Recorded at Henson Recording Studios, Hollywood, California, and Radley Studios, Los Angeles, California, by Justin Stanley, [...] "Army of Me" [...] was co-written by Aguilera with Jamie Hartman, David Glass and Phil Bentley. It was {{produced}} by Tracklacers and it was co-produced by Hartman. Aguilera's vocals were recorded by Oscar Ramirez at The Red Lips Room in Beverly Hills in California. Programming {{was carried out by}} Steve Daly and John Keep, while strings were composed by Hartman. In an interview with Andrew Hampp for Billboard, Aguilera explained how her role on The Voice has allowed her to reach a new generational audience who may not be familiar with her past work, including songs such as her 2002 single, [...] "Fighter". When asked if some of the songs on Lotus feature themes which are similar to that of her 2002 album, Stripped, Aguilera responded by saying that [...] "Army of Me" [...] <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> describes as [...] "Fighter 2.0".|$|E
500|$|Central to Franklin's pacifism and {{her view}} of life <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> calls [...] "the Quaker vision of the world". Individual {{conscience}} {{is at the heart}} of that vision. So too, is the need to discern appropriate ways of working for peace in each time and place [...] "rather than relying on a dogma of unvarying rules of conduct". She notes that for more than 300 years, Quakers have opposed war and violence and have objected to military service and conscription. They have worked on reconciliation, peace research and disarmament and in many countries have won the right for conscientious objectors to perform alternative service instead of taking part in war. Franklin remarks that Quaker principles have not changed, but technology has changed the nature of war. In a modern technological society she argues, there is no longer a clear boundary between war and peace. War planning is constant during peacetime and when wars are fought, women and children become targets. Nations no longer depend primarily on conscripting military recruits, but rely on advanced weapons systems that are costly to build or acquire. She writes that the arms race is driven by a [...] "technological imperative" [...] which requires the creation of an enemy as a permanent social institution: ...|$|E

2500|$|She used {{three primary}} elements: Christianity, classicism, and hierophantic solar worship. The hierophantic solar worship <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{brought with her}} from Africa; the worship of sun gods is {{expressed}} {{as part of her}} African culture. As her parents were sun worshipers, it may be why she used so many different words for the sun. [...] For instance, she uses Aurora eight times, [...] "Apollo seven, Phoebus twelve, and Sol twice." [...] Shields believes that the word [...] "light" [...] is significant to her as it marks her African history, a past that she has left physically behind.|$|E

[...] This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is best known for. She also wrote articles for the Library Journal, worked on editing and creating bibliographies, dictionaries and other reference materials. Quite often her writings were assisted by Minnie Earl Sears, a colleague and companion. [...] Some of Mudge's writings are still found at Columbia University.|$|E

[...] Davidson has also managed to get O'Hara punished for being immoral, but Sadie will {{be able to go to}} Australia instead if Davidson approves. Sadie pleads with him, but to no avail. [...] She {{eventually}} confesses that, if she goes back to San Francisco, there is [...] "a man there who won't let her go straight", which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants to do. [...] Davidson figures out this means that there is a warrant for her arrest back in San Francisco.
