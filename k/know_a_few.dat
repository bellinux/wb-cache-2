2500|$|Rap {{and other}} forms of secular music, which his parents had highly opposed in their household, became very {{appealing}} to Chamillionaire, who was still in his teens at the time. Chamillionaire has stated that he was inspired by local rap acts such as the Geto Boys, 8 Ball & MJG, and UGK, as well as other national acts such as N.W.A and Public Enemy. At a young age, Chamillionaire, along with fellow rap music artist and childhood friend Paul Wall, had decided to make music their careers. Chamillionaire has a brother, who is 3 years younger than him, Rasaq Seriki who is also an occasional rapper and a past member of The Color Changin' Click. He announced through a video log that he has a son born on May 14, 2010. He points out that his son’s name, Xavier, means “new house”.

2500|$|Speakers of Cornish reside {{primarily}} in Cornwall {{which has a}} population of just 536,000 (2014). There are also some speakers living outside Cornwall, particularly in the countries of the Cornish diaspora, as well as other Celtic nations. Estimates of the number of Cornish speakers vary according to the definition of being a speaker, and is difficult to accurately determine due to the individualised nature of language take-up. Nevertheless, there is recognition that the number of Cornish speakers is growing. One figure for the mean number of people who <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> basic words, such as knowing that [...] "Kernow" [...] means [...] "Cornwall", was 300,000; the same survey gave the figure of people able to have simple conversations at 3,000. The Cornish Language Strategy project commissioned research to provide quantitative and qualitative evidence for the number of Cornish speakers: due {{to the success of the}} revival project it was estimated that 2,000 people were fluent (surveyed in spring 2008), an increase from the estimated 300 people who spoke Cornish fluently suggested in a study by Kenneth MacKinnon in 2000. In the 2011 UK census, 557 people in England and Wales declared Cornish to be their main language, 464 of whom lived in Cornwall.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Mussenden {{was hired}} as casting director, and held casting calls {{throughout}} the United States including San Antonio, Texas, Miami, Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles. Casting calls began on March 16, 1996 and concluded on March 23. Over 21,000 people auditioned for the title role, becoming the second largest audition since the search for Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind (1939). Casting turnouts reached 10,000 in Los Angeles and 5,000 in Chicago, while turnouts reached 8,000 in San Antonio. Mussenden chose 10-year-old Becky Lee Meza of Harlingen to portray young Selena, her acting debut. [...] Mexican actress Salma Hayek was invited to test the role of Selena by Esparza. Hayek turned the role down; she said she felt it was [...] "too early" [...] to base a movie on Selena {{and that it would}} be emotional because Selena's death was still being covered on U.S. television. Abraham discovered an actress in Los Angeles and wanted her for the role as Selena, despite her inability to convince the casting crew. He later had a change of heart when American actress and dancer Jennifer Lopez had showed up for the audition. Lopez found the audition process an elaborated procedure and was asked to sing, dance, and act out the elopement scene in front of the casting crew and Abraham. Within three takes of the elopement scene, Lopez convinced the entire casting crew who believed her performance was [...] "among the strongest". Lopez had previously worked with Nava in My Family (1995). Screen testing was described as [...] "grueling" [...] and required [...] "nine minutes of singing and dancing and eight pages of script." [...] After the announcement that Lopez would portray Selena, news media and fans criticized Abraham for choosing Lopez, a New York City native born to Puerto Rican parents, was selected to play a Texan of Mexican descent. The Mexican media disapproved the film and were outraged that Lopez was chosen for the title role. Lopez received backlash from the media and fans because she was not a Mexican American. The Hispanic community began protesting for a recast. During pre-production, Lopez stated: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> people were protesting, but in Corpus [...] everyone has been really supportive". Nava admitted that the backlash was [...] "a little hurtful", and felt the protesters [...] "should be celebrating that we have an all-Latino cast and that Lopez, one of our own, is becoming a star." [...] The announcement was described as the [...] "role of a lifetime." [...] from news outlets and Lopez's salary for the film was reported at $1 million, which made Lopez the highest paid Hispanic actress in history. Dave Karger of Entertainment Weekly noted that [...] "nothing could have prepared [...] for the hype attached to her million-dollar salary." ...|$|E
