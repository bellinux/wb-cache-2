However, as these standstone oilfields have been entering into the ultra-high water cut period, the conventional layered water injection technology has too long test and adjustment period and heavy workload and cannot determine the reservoir condition.

40|$|AbstractThe {{splitting}} rate model {{proposed by}} Smith and Mounce (2011) establishes a traffic evolution process on a link-node network representation, which overcomes {{the difficulties in}} applying traditional path-based models and provides the ease of implementing controls at nodes. While their model offers a new method for modeling traffic evolution, it contains an ad-hoc step of <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> to preserve the flow conservation. This <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> step leads to difficulties in analyzing the system properties. This paper proposes a generalized flow splitting model for day-to-day traffic assignment based {{on the concept of}} splitting flow at nodes. The proposed model preserves the flow conservation endogenously by introducing the inflow variable into the formulation. The generalized formulation provides the ease to construct a variety of day-to-day traffic assignment models, and serves as a framework for analyzing the models’ properties, such as the invariance property and the preservation of the Lipschitz continuity and strong monotonicity. Specifically, a proportional-adjustment model and a projection-type model are developed based on the proposed generalized formulation.

Since temperature is an important environmental parameter influencing animal physiology and metabolic heat production an energetically expensive process, measuring temperature and energy exchange in animals is critical to understanding physiology, especially under field conditions. As a non-contact approach, infrared thermography provides a non-invasive complement to physiological data gathering. One caveat, however, is that only surface temperatures are measured, which guides much research to those thermal events occurring at the skin and insulating regions of the body.

The Skill Score (SS) is defined as the ratio of the rmse of the difference between analysis and forecast and the rmse of the difference between analysis and persistence. The SS shows that at 5 and 30 m the forecast is always better than the persistence, but at 300 m it can be worse than persistence for the first days of the forecast. This result may be related to <b>flow</b> <b>adjustments</b> introduced by the data assimilation scheme. The monthly variability of SS shows that when the system variability is high, the values of SS are higher, therefore the forecast has higher skill than persistence. We give evidence that the error growth in the surface layers is controlled by the atmospheric forcing inaccuracies, while at depth the forecast error can be interpreted as due to the data insertion procedure.

These autonomic adjustments represent {{an equivalent of}} the cardiovascular responses described as features of defense-alerting reactions. However, while the muscle vasodilatation observed in rats during stimulation of hypothalamic sites involved in defense reactions {{has been referred to}} as a general, non-selective increase in blood flow, previous studies conducted on cats have demonstrated that high-intensity cutaneus stimulation produces vasodilatation in the stimulated limb and vasoconstriction in the other limbs. in anesthetized rats, the effects of SNS in the muscle vascular territory of the contralateral limb, as well as the participation of circulating catecholamines in these adjustments continued to be unknown. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the blood <b>flow</b> <b>adjustments</b> elicited by SNS in the stimulated and in the contralateral hind limbs before and after bilateral adrenalectomy. in urethane-anesthetized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated rats, SNS (800 - 1000 muA, 1 ms, 100 Hz, 10 s) produced hypertension, tachycardia, vasodilatation in the stimulated hindlimb and vasoconstriction in the contralateral hindlimb. After bilateral adrenalectomy the pressor responses to SNS were abolished, the vasodilatation in the stimulated limb was greater and the vasoconstriction in the contralateral limb was replaced by vasodilatation. These results suggest that the vasodilatation in the stimulated limb does not depend on circulating catecholamines. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All right reserved.

40|$|Nitrate can {{be removed}} from {{wastewater}} streams, including subsurface agricultural drainage systems, using woodchip bioreactors to promote microbial denitrification. However, the variations in water flow in these systems could make reliable performance from this microbially-mediated process a challenge. In the current work, the effects of fluctuating water levels on nitrate removal, denitrifying activity, and microbial community composition in laboratory-scale bioreactors were investigated. The performance was sensitive to changing water level. An average of 31 % nitrate was removed at high water level and 59 % at low water level, despite <b>flow</b> <b>adjustments</b> to maintain a constant theoretical hydraulic retention time. The potential activity, as assessed through denitrifying enzyme assays, averaged 0. 0008 mg N 2 O-N/h/dry g woodchip and did not show {{statistically significant differences between}} reactors, sampling depths, or operational conditions. In the denitrifying enzyme assays, nitrate removal consistently exceeded nitrous oxide production. The denitrifying bacterial communities were not significantly different from each other, regardless of water level, meaning that the denitrifying bacterial community did not change in response to disturbance. The overall bacterial communities, however, became more distinct between the two reactors when one reactor was operated with periodic disturbances of changing water height, and showed a stronger effect at the most severely disturbed location. The communities were not distinguishable, though, when comparing the same location under high and low water levels, indicating that the communities in the disturbed reactor were adapted to fluctuating conditions rather than to high or low water level. Overall, these results describe a biological treatment process and microbial community that is resistant to disturbance via water level fluctuations...|$|E

Experimental data from the rotor are compared with analytical results obtained by using the code. The experimental data available for comparison are the radial distributions of circumferentially averaged values of absolute flow angle and total pressure downstream of the rotor exit. The computed rotor-exit flow angles are generally underturned relative to the experimental values, which reflect the boundary-layer separation at the trailing edge {{and the development of}} wakes downstream of the rotor. The experimental rotor is designed for a higher-than-optimum work factor of 1. 126 resulting in a nonoptimum positive incidence and causing a region of rapid <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> and large velocity gradients.

40|$|The {{transport}} of fine sediment and organic matter {{plays an important}} role in the nutrient dynamics of shallow aquatic systems, and the fate of these particles is closely linked to vegetation. We describe the mean and turbulent flow near circular patches of synthetic vegetation and examine how the spatial distribution of flow is connected to the spatial distribution of suspended sediment deposition. Patches of rigid, emergent, and flexible, submerged vegetation were considered, with two different stem densities. For the rigid emergent vegetation, <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> was primarily two-dimensional, with flow deflected in the horizontal plane. Horizontal shear layers produced a von Kármán vortex street. Flow through the patch shifted the vortex street downstream, resulting in a region directly downstream of the patch in which both the mean and turbulent velocities were diminished. Net deposition was enhanced within this region. In contrast, for the flexible, submerged vegetation, <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> was three-dimensional, with shear layers formed in the vertical and horizontal planes. Because of strong vertical circulation, turbulent kinetic energy was elevated directly downstream of the patch. Consistent with this, deposition was not enhanced at any point in the wake. This comparison suggests that morphological feedbacks differ between submerged and emergent vegetation. Further, enhanced deposition occurred only in regions where both turbulent and mean velocities were reduced, relative to the open channel. Reduced deposition (indicating enhanced resuspension) occurred in regions of high turbulence kinetic energy, regardless of local mean velocity. These observations highlight the importance of turbulence in controlling deposition. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (grant EAR 0738352) National Science Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) {{is common}} after cardiac operations. There are {{different}} risk factors or determinants of AKI, {{and some are}} related to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In this study, we explored the association between metabolic parameters (oxygen delivery (DO(2)) and carbon dioxide production (VCO(2))) during CPB with postoperative AKI. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data at two different institutions. The study population included 359 adult patients. The DO(2) and VCO(2) levels of each patient were monitored during CPB. Outcome variables were related to kidney function (peak postoperative serum creatinine increase and AKI stage 1 or 2). The experimental hypothesis was that nadir DO(2) values and nadir DO(2) /VCO(2) ratios during CPB would be independent predictors of AKI. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to detect the independent predictors of AKI and any kind of kidney function damage. Results: A nadir DO 2 level < 262 mL/minute/m(2) and a nadir DO(2) /VCO(2) ratio < 5. 3 were independently associated with AKI within a model including EuroSCORE and CPB duration. Patients with nadir DO(2) levels and nadir DO(2) /VCO(2) ratios below the identified cutoff values during CPB had a significantly higher rate of AKI stage 2 (odds ratios 3. 1 and 2. 9, respectively). The negative predictive power of both variables exceeded 90 %. The most accurate predictor of AKI stage 2 postoperative status was the nadir DO(2) level. Conclusions: The nadir DO(2) level during CPB is independently associated with postoperative AKI. The measurement of VCO(2) -related variables does not add accuracy to the AKI prediction. Since DO(2) during CPB is a modifiable factor (through pump <b>flow</b> <b>adjustments),</b> this study generates the hypothesis that goal-directed perfusion management aimed at maintaining the DO(2) level above the identified critical value might limit the incidence of postoperative AKI...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{many large}} {{commercial}} buildings use sophisticated {{building automation systems}} (BASs) to manage {{a wide range of}} building equipment. While the capabilities of BASs have increased over time, many buildings still do not fully use the BAS's capabilities and are not properly commissioned, operated or maintained, which leads to inefficient operation, increased energy use, and reduced lifetimes of the equipment. This report investigates the energy savings potential of several common HVAC system retuning measures on a typical large office building prototype model, using the Department of Energy's building energy modeling software, EnergyPlus. The baseline prototype model uses roughly as much energy as an average large office building in existing building stock, but does not utilize any re-tuning measures. Individual re-tuning measures simulated against this baseline include automatic schedule adjustments, damper minimum <b>flow</b> <b>adjustments,</b> thermostat adjustments, as well as dynamic resets (set points that change continuously with building and/or outdoor conditions) to static pressure, supply air temperature, condenser water temperature, chilled and hot water temperature, and chilled and hot water differential pressure set points. Six combinations of these individual measures have been formulated - each designed to conform to limitations to implementation of certain individual measures that might exist in typical buildings. All of these measures and combinations were simulated in 16 cities representative of specific U. S. climate zones. The modeling results suggest that the most effective energy savings measures are those that affect the demand-side of the building (air-systems and schedules). Many of the demand-side individual measures were capable of reducing annual HVAC system energy consumption by over 20 % in most cities that were modeled. Supply side measures affecting HVAC plant conditions were only modestly successful (less than 5 % annual HVAC energy savings for most cities for all measures). Combining many of the retuning measures revealed deep savings potential. Some of the more aggressive combinations revealed 35 - 75 % reductions in annual HVAC energy consumption, depending on climate and building vintage...|$|E
40|$|Irrigation of pasture {{enables the}} {{intensification}} of land use, but can also result in increased losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). In 2006 an irrigation scheme was introduced into the Kakanui River and Waiareka Creek catchments in North Otago, New Zealand, which has intensified land use, especially dairying. Supplementation of the Waiareka Creek by direct discharge of 'clean' irrigation water from a nearby River is practiced to raise the minimum flow. This supplementation is hypothesized to dilute N and P losses associated with increased land use intensification and irrigation return flow. Farm losses of N and P before irrigation were then used as a reference to judge in the Kakanui River, and compare against dilution in the Waiareka Creek, the effectiveness of best management practices (BMPs) to improve water quality in 2010 and 2020. Data for N and P fractions from three sites since the mid 1990 s were analysed, and <b>flow</b> <b>adjustments</b> for direct discharge to the Waiareka Creek made. Similar concentrations of N and P fractions in Waiareka Creek before and after irrigation began suggest the current minimum flow of 100 Â LÂ s- 1 is insufficient to improve the nutrient status of the Creek, but does dilute recent intensification, which without dilution would have increased concentrations by 30 - 400 %. In the lower Kakanui catchment, direct discharge does not occur and N and P concentrations increased, while little change occurred in the upper Kakanui catchment. Within each catchment, N and P losses from sheep and beef farms and dairy farms (with and without BMPs) were modelled for 2010 and 2020 and compared against that estimated in 2000. This showed that although substantial decreases could be made by adopting BMPs, the predicted increase in N and P losses (up to 200 % by 2020) would require either more rigorous use of existing strategies or additional strategies to improve water quality, over and above dilution which is restricted by a need to minimise the risk of flooding.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the transition from}} open channel flow to flow over submerged vegetation using velocity measurements collected with acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) and particle-image velocimetry (PIV). Submerged canopies were constructed from arrays of rigid circular cylinders of height h in water of depth H. Both the canopy density, described by the frontal area per volume (a), and degree of submergence (H/h) were varied. <b>Flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> occurs in three stages. First, velocity begins to decelerate upstream of the canopy, due to a high-pressure region generated at the canopy leading edge, and continues to decelerate within the canopy, due to canopy drag. Rapid flow deceleration within the canopy creates strong vertical flux out through {{the top of the}} canopy that extends over a length proportional to the canopy drag length scale, (CDa) − 1, with CD being the canopy drag coefficient. Second, a mixing layer develops at the canopy interface, with the stress {{at the top of the}} canopy initially increasing, but eventually reaching a constant value. At this point, the flow within the canopy is fully developed. The length scale for mixing-layer development is related to canopy drag (CDa) and the depth ratio (H/h). In the third stage, the boundary layer above the mixing layer adjusts to the channel boundary conditions. A model is developed to predict the adjustment of vertically averaged velocity within the canopy. Measurements confirm that the <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> is not dependent on canopy length.

In our base case, the economy moves 95 % of the distance to the new steady state in approximately eight years. Gross flows have a large effect on this rate of adjustment and on the normative effects of trade. Announcing and delaying the liberalization can build - or destroy - a constituency for free trade. We study the conditions under which these contrasting outcomes occur. Labor mobility Gross flows Net flows Gradualism Trade shocks Trade liberalization...|$|R
40|$|This paper re-assesses {{findings}} of the literature that the systematic debt stabilising response in fiscal policy has been sufficiently strong for keeping debt ratios on a sustainable path in Euro area countries. In doing so, it adjusts the standard approach to the specific context of Economic and Monetary Union. Results show that before 1993 policy responses towards net and gross debt are comparable. After 1993, the reaction to net debt weakens while policies react more strongly to the build-up of gross debt according {{to the definition of}} the EU fiscal rules. This suggests that financial assets have increasingly been used for managing gross debt ratios while improving net worth has received less priority. debt; sustainability; EMU; stock <b>flow</b> <b>adjustment...</b>|$|R
