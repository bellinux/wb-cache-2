40|$|Regulation (EC) No 1272 / 2008 on classification, {{labelling}} {{and packaging}} of substances and mixtures entered into force 20 January 2009, and replaces in a staggered way Directives 67 / 548 /EEC and 1999 / 45 /EC within the European Community. The Regulation implements the Globally Harmonised System on {{classification and labelling}} within the Community. This paper provides a short overview of the Regulation and how manufacturers and importers should apply the new rules. In certain cases {{they will be able}} to use the translation table as provided in Annex VII to the Regulation and in others they must compute re-classification based on data by applying the new classification rules. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) will establish a Classification and Labelling Inventory. Substances placed on the market which are either subject to registration under REACH (Regulation (EC) No 1907 / 2006) or substances not subject to registration, but meeting the criteria for classification as hazardous, will need to be notified to the inventory. The Inventory contains 'self-classifications' besides the list of harmonised classified and labelled substances in Annex VI to the Regulation, which is legally binding on the EU market. The list, as amended by the 1 st Adaptation of Technical Progress of Regulation 1272 / 2008 includes approximately 4130 substances or groups of substances. 1276 of these substances/groups of substances are classified as carcinogenic, <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mutagenic</b> and/or reproductive toxic and are therefore potential candidates for authorisation under REACH.

It has proved difficult to obtain highly purified primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> for preparation of a specific antibody. In the present study, a new method for purifying mouse primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> was developed using a Nycodenz gradient. Furthermore, the polyclonal anti-mouse primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> IgG derived from mouse primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> was prepared. As this IgG reacted only with primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> obtained at day 12. 5 after mating, this antibody appeared to recognize the stage-specific antigen of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> One reason that a continuous primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> marker has not been obtained is because the purity of the primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> used has been too low to prepare the antibody. This new method represents a significant improvement in the purification of primordial germ cells; it is simpler than previous methods, and produced mouse primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> with a purity of more than 95 %. In addition, the separation reagent Nycodenz is non-toxic and achieved separation of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> without attachment of antibodies against the primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> membrane surface.

40|$|Type II <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors arise after puberty from a <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> {{that was}} {{incorrectly}} programmed during fetal life. Failure of testicular <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> to properly differentiate {{can lead to}} the formation of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia in situ of the testis; this precursor cell invariably gives rise to <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> cancer after puberty. The Nodal co-receptor Cripto is expressed transiently during normal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development and is ectopically expressed in non-seminomas that arise from <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia in situ, suggesting that its aberrant expression may underlie <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> dysregulation and hence <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> cancer. Here we investigated methylation of the Cripto promoter in mouse <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and human <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> cancer and correlated this with the level of CRIPTO protein expression. We found hypomethylation of the CRIPTO promoter in undifferentiated fetal <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> embryonal carcinoma and seminomas, but hypermethylation in differentiated fetal <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and the differentiated types of non-seminomas. CRIPTO protein was strongly expressed in <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia in situ along with embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor and seminomas. Further, cleaved CRIPTO was detected in media from seminoma and embryonal carcinoma cell lines, suggesting that cleaved CRIPTO may provide diagnostic indication of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> cancer. Accordingly, CRIPTO was detectable in serum from 6 / 15 patients with embryonal carcinoma, 5 / 15 patients with seminoma, 4 / 5 patients with <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia in situ cells only and in 1 / 15 control patients.

Despite the critical importance of this step for sexual reproduction, gene networks underlying <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development have remained only partially understood. Taking advantage of the W v mouse model, in which gonads lack <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> we conducted a microarray study to identify genes expressed in fetal <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition to distinguishing genes expressed by <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> from those expressed by somatic cells within the developing gonads, {{we were able to}} highlight specific groups of genes expressed only in female or male <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> Our results provide an important resource for deciphering the molecular pathways driving proper <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development and sex determination and will improve our understanding of the etiology of human <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors that arise from dysregulation of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we show that mouse {{primordial}} <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and fetal <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> at certain stages of differentiation express E-cadherin and α and β catenins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the formation of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> aggregates that rapidly occurs when monodispersed <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> populations are released from embryonic gonads in culture is E-cadherin mediated, developmentally regulated, and dependent on {{the sex of the}} <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> Immunoblotting analyses indicate that the lower ability to form aggregates of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in comparison to fetal <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> is not due to gross changes in E-cadherin expression, altered association with β catenin, or changes in β catenin phosphorylation. Investigating possible functions of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion in primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development, we found that E-cadherin-mediated adhesion may stimulate the motility of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> Moreover, treatment of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> cultured on STO cell monolayers with an anti-E-cadherin antibody caused a significant decrease in their number and markedly reduced their ability to form colonies in vitro. The same in vitro treatment of explanted undifferentiated gonadal ridges cultured for 4 days results in decreased numbers and altered localization of the <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> inside the gonads.

Approximately 50 % of the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that form reach their target. The errant cells within the embryo undergo developmentally regulated cell death. Prior studies have identified some autosomal genes that regulate <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> migration, but the genes that control <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> death are not known. To identify X-linked genes required for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> migration and/or death, we performed a screen for mutations that disrupt these processes. Here we report the identification of scattershot and outsiders, two genes that regulate the programmed death of <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> The scattershot gene is defined by a mutation that disrupts both <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> migration {{and the death of}} <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> ectopic to the gonad. Maternal and zygotic expression of scattershot is required, but the migration and cell death functions can be genetically uncoupled. Zygotic expression of wild-type scattershot rescues <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> pathfinding, but does not restore the programmed death of errant cells. The outsiders gene is required zygotically.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> becomes sexually dimorphic during gonadal sex differentiation, although the underlying dynamics {{of this are}} not well understood in vertebrates. By tracing GFP-labeled <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo and analyzing the germ cell-depleted mutant, zenzai, we show that the proliferation and differentiation of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are regulated in a sexually dimorphic manner in the teleost fish medaka. In the undifferentiated gonads, <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> resume proliferation by slow intermittent division (type I), producing isolated daughter <b>cells.</b> While <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in the male gonads continue this mode of proliferation, some <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> fractions in the female gonads initiate two to four rounds of continuous division (type II), forming cysts of four, eight, or sixteen cells, which subsequently enter meiosis synchronously. Thus, female <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> become differentiated much earlier than do male <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> In the zenzai mutant, a defect in slow intermittent division eventually leads to the depletion of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in the adult gonads in both sexes, {{despite the fact that}} cyst-forming division is unaffected. This argues that slow intermittent division is essential for the maintenance of <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> The proliferation and differentiation of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are thus important components of gonadal sex differentiation in vertebrates...|$|R

Here, we applied a small-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) method on purified mouse fetal <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> to generate genome-wide maps of four histone modifications (H 3 K 4 me 3, H 3 K 27 me 3, H 3 K 27 ac, and H 2 BK 20 ac).

40|$|In Drosophila, {{the sex of}} <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> is {{determined}} by cell-autonomous and inductive signals. XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> autonomously enter spermatogenesis when developing in a female host. In contrast, XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> non-autonomously become spermatogenic when developing in a male host. In first instar larvae with two X chromosomes, XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> enter the female or the male pathway depending on {{the presence or absence}} of transformer (tra) activity in the surrounding soma. In somatic cells, the product of tra regulates the expression of the gene double sex (dsx) which can form a male-specific or a female-specific product. In dsx mutant larvae, XX and XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> develop abnormally, with a seemingly intersexual phenotype. This indicates that female-specific somatic dsx products feminize XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> and male-specific somatic dsx products masculinize XX and XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> The results show that tra and dsx control early inductive signals that determine the sex of XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and that somatic signals also affect the development of XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that develop in pseudomales lacking the sex-determining function of Sxl are spermatogenic. If, however, female-specific tra functions are expressed in these animals, XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> become oogenic. Furthermore, transplanted XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> can become oogenic and form eggs in XY animals that express the female-specific function of tra.

40|$|In Drosophila, <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> {{survival}} and directionality of migration {{are controlled by}} two lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP), wunen (wun) and wunen- 2 (wun 2). wun wun 2 double mutant analysis reveals that the two genes, hereafter collectively called wunens, act redundantly in primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> We find that wunens mediate <b>germ</b> cell-germ <b>cell</b> repulsion and that this repulsion is necessary for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> dispersal and proper transepithelial migration {{at the onset of}} migration and for the equal sorting of the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> between the two embryonic gonads during their migration. We propose that this dispersal function optimizes adult fecundity by assuring maximal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> occupancy of both gonads. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for wunens in <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> survival can be eliminated by blocking <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> migration.

40|$|This {{workshop}} {{reviewed the}} current science to inform and recommend the best evidence-based approaches {{on the use}} of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> genotoxicity tests. The workshop questions and key outcomes were as follows. (1) Do genotoxicity and mutagenicity assays in somatic <b>cells</b> predict <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> effects? Limited data suggest that somatic cell tests detect most <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagens, but there are strong concerns that dictate caution in drawing conclusions. (2) Should <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tests be done, and when? If there is evidence that a chemical or its metabolite(s) will not reach target <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> or gonadal tissue, {{it is not necessary to}} conduct <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tests, notwithstanding somatic outcomes. However, it was recommended that negative somatic cell mutagens with clear evidence for gonadal exposure and evidence of toxicity in <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> could be considered for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagenicity testing. For somatic mutagens that are known to reach the gonadal compartments and expose <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> the chemical could be assumed to be a <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagen without further testing. Nevertheless, <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagenicity testing would be needed for quantitative risk assessment. (3) What new assays should be implemented and how? There is an immediate need for research on the application of whole genome sequencing in heritable mutation analysis in humans and animals, and integration of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> assays with somatic cell genotoxicity tests. Focus should be on environmental exposures that can cause de novo mutations, particularly newly recognized types of genomic changes. Mutational events, which may occur by exposure of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> during embryonic development, should also be investigated.

40|$|AbstractThe initial {{cohort of}} {{mammalian}} gametes is {{established by the}} proliferation of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in the early embryo. Primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> first appear in extraembyronic tissues and subsequently migrate to the developing gonad. Soon after they arrive in the gonad, the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> cease dividing and undertake sexually dimorphic patterns of development. Male <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> arrest mitotically, while female <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> directly enter meiotic prophase I. These sex-specific differentiation events are imposed upon a group of sex-common differentiation events that are shared by XX and XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> We have studied the appearance of GCNA 1, a postmigratory sex-common <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> marker, in cultures of premigratory <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> to investigate how this differentiation program is regulated.

We also found that GCNA 1 expression was accelerated by agents which promote DNA demethylation or histone acetylation.

Through careful analyses of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> distribution in developing Drosophila melanogaster embryos, we show that normal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development involves extensive {{programmed cell death}} during stages 10 - 12 of embryogenesis. This <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> death is mediated by Drosophila p 53 (p 53). Mutations in p 53 result in excess primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that are ectopic to the gonads.

40|$|Steel factor, {{the protein}} {{product of the}} Steel locus in the mouse, is a {{multifunctional}} signal for the primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> population. We have shown previously that its expression accompanies the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> during migration to the gonads, forming a "travelling niche" that controls their survival, motility, and proliferation. Here we show that these functions are distributed between the alternatively spliced membrane-bound and soluble forms of Steel factor. The <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> normally migrate as individuals from E 7. 5 to E 11. 5, when they aggregate together in the embryonic gonads. Movie analysis of Steel-dickie mutant embryos, which make only the soluble form, at E 7. 5, showed that the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> fail to migrate normally, and undergo "premature aggregation" {{in the base of}} the allantois. Survival and directionality of movement is not affected. Addition of excess soluble Steel factor to Steel-dickie embryos rescued <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> motility, and addition of Steel factor to <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro showed that a fourfold higher dose was required to increase motility, compared to survival. These data show that soluble Steel factor is sufficient for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> survival, and suggest that the membrane-bound form provides a higher local concentration of Steel factor that controls the balance between <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> motility and aggregation.

40|$|Mutations in {{the genes}} ovo or otu can cause {{abnormal}} proliferation of XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> which leads to so-called ovarian tumors, or they {{can lead to the}} elimination of XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> such that adult females possess empty ovaries. Males carrying ovo or otu mutations are unaffected. To find out when this sexual dimorphism affects <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> we analyzed the requirement of embryos and larvae for zygotic ovo and otu products. We found that ovo is required for the survival of XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> during larval stages, while XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> lacking otu survive until metamorphosis. Furthermore, we found no sex-transformed mutant larval <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and no evidence for an early sex-specific vital process acting in <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> of the embryo, contrary to what had been suggested earlier...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) are {{expressed}} in several cancers and during normal adult male <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. Little is known about their role in fetal development of human <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> METHODS: We examined expression of the CTAs MAGE-A 1, GAGE and NY-ESO- 1 in fetal gonads by single and double immu-nohistochemical staining. RESULTS: We found that GAGE was expressed in the primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> of the gonadal primordium, whereas MAGE-A 1 and NY-ESO- 1 were first detected in <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> of both testis and ovary after sexual differentiation was initiated. The number of positive <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and the staining intensity of all three CTAs peaked during the second trimester and gradually decreased towards birth in {{both male and female}} <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> In oocytes, MAGE-A 1 expression terminated around birth, whereas NY-ESO- 1 expression persisted through the neonatal stage and GAGE expression was maintained until adulthood. The population of GAGE-expressing male and female <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> partially overlapped the population of OCT 4 -positive cells, whereas MAGE-A 1 and NY-ESO- 1 were clearly expressed only by OCT 4 -negative cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that MAGE-A 1 and NY-ESO- 1 are associated with highly proliferating <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas GAGE proteins have a more general function in <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> unrelated to any specific developmental stage. The recognition of differential cellular expression of GAGE, MAGE-A 1, NY-ESO- 1 and OCT 4 may help define biologically distinct <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> subpopulations.

40|$|AbstractThe spermatogenic and oogenic {{lineages}} {{originate from}} bipotential primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> {{in response to}} signalling in the foetal testis or ovary, respectively. The signals required for male <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> commitment and their entry into mitotic arrest remain largely unknown. Recent data show that the ligand GDNF is up regulated in the foetal testis indicating {{that it may be}} involved in male <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development. In this study genetic analysis of GDNF-RET signalling shows that RET is required for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> survival. Affected <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in Ret−/− mice lose expression of key <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> markers, abnormally express cell cycle markers and undergo apoptosis. Surprisingly, a similar phenotype was not detected in Gdnf−/− mice indicating that either redundancy with a Gdnf related gene might compensate for its loss, or that RET operates in a GDNF independent manner in mouse foetal <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> Either way, this study identifies the proto-oncogene RET as a novel component of the foetal male <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development pathway...|$|R
40|$|<b>Germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors occur {{mostly in}} the gonad. Extragonadal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors are rare, and most occur in the retroperitoneum and mediastinum. Primary mediastinal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors are often found in the {{anterior}} portion of the mediastinum and include teratomas and non-teratomatous tumors. Non-teratomatous tumors include seminomas and malignant non-seminomatous <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors (MNSGCTs). MNSGCTs include yolk sac tumors, choriocarcinomas, embryonal carcinomas, and mixed type <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors.

Cases of primary mediastinal MNSGCT reported in the literature are rare. In this report, we review all primary mediastinal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors from a 10 -year period at the Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital of Kaohsiung Medical University. A total of 14 cases were reviewed, including 11 patients with mature teratomas, two with yolk sac tumors, and one with seminoma.

40|$|Specification of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in mice occurs {{relatively}} late in embryonic development. It is {{initiated by}} signals that induce expression of Blimp 1, a key regulator of the <b>germ</b> <b>cell,</b> {{in a few}} epiblast cells of early postimplantation embryos. Blimp 1 represses the incipient somatic program in these cells and promotes progression toward the <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> fate. Blimp 1 may also {{have a role in}} the maintenance of early <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> characteristics by ensuring their escape from the somatic fate as well as possible reversion to pluripotent stem <b>cells.</b> Primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> (PGCs), the foundercells of the <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> lineage, are usuallyestablished early during embryonic de-velopment. Specification of PGCs can occur either through the inheritance of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> determinants already present in the egg, as in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, or in response to inductive signals, as in mice and probably all mammals. In all instances howev-er, <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are maintained by mechanisms that prevent them from differentiating into somatic cells...|$|R
40|$|Human <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> {{originate}} in an extragonadal location {{and have to}} migrate to colonize the gonadal primordia at around seven weeks of gestation (W 7, or five weeks post conception). Many <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are lost along the way and should enter apoptosis, but some escape and can give rise to extragonadal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors. Due to the common somatic origin of gonads and adrenal cortex, we investigated whether ectopic <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> {{were present in the}} human adrenals. <b>Germ</b> <b>cells</b> expressing DDX 4 and/or POU 5 F 1 were present in male and female human adrenals in the first and second trimester. However, in contrast to what has been described in mice, where ‘adrenal’ and ‘ovarian’ <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> seem to enter meiosis in synchrony, we were unable to observe meiotic entry in human ‘adrenal’ <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> until W 22. By contrast, ‘ovarian’ <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> at W 22 showed a pronounced asynchronous meiotic entry. Interestingly, we observed that immature POU 5 F 1 + <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in both first and second trimester ovaries still expressed the neural crest marker TUBB 3, reminiscent of their migratory phase. Our findings highlight species-specific differences in early gametogenesis between mice and humans. We report the presence of a population of ectopic <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in the human adrenals during development...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} {{in vitro}} studies we found that contact between mouse primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and other cell types (neighbouring somatic cells or established TM 4 or STO cell lines) is crucial for supporting primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> survival and proliferation and for activating their motility. We have studied primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion to different cell monolayers (STO, TM 4, COS and F 9 cells) as an in vitro model for interactions between primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and cellular substrates. The results suggest that these cell interactions are mediated by multiple mechanisms involving Steel factor and its receptor encoded by c-kit, carbohydrates and possibly other unknown factors. We find that Steel factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor are survival rather than proliferation factors for primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> Both molecules prevent primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> death in culture by suppressing apoptosis. Morphological and molecular features of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis in vitro are reported. Activation of protein kinase C does not promote primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, but compounds known to enhance intracellular levels of cAMP (i. e. dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin) markedly stimulate primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> to proliferate in culture. We have preliminary results indicating that neuropeptides PACAP- 27 and PACAP- 28 are possible physiological activators of adenylate cyclase in primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|In mice, {{primordial}} <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> migrate {{into the}} genital ridges by embryonic day 13. 5 (E 13. 5), {{where they are}} then subjected to a sex-specific fate with female and male primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> undergoing mitotic arrest and meiosis, respectively. However, the sex-specific basis of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation is poorly understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to investi-gate the sex-specific features of mouse primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> We performed RNA-sequenc-ing (seq) of E 13. 5 female and male mouse primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> using next-generation sequencing. We identified 651 and 428 differentially expressed transcripts (> 2 -fold, P < 0. 05) in female and male primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> respectively. Of these, many transcription factors were identified. Gene ontology and network analysis revealed differing functions of the identified female- and male-specific genes that were associated with primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> acquisition of sex-specific properties required for differentiation into <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> Further-more, DNA methylation and ChIP-seq analysis of histone modifications showed that hypo-methylated gene promoter regions were bound with H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 27 me 3. Our global transcriptome data showed that in mice, primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are decisively assigned to a sex-specific differentiation program by E 13. 5, which is necessary for the development of vital <b>germ</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, {{primordial}} <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are specified at {{the posterior}} pole {{of the very}} early embryo. This process is regulated by the posterior localized germ plasm that contains {{a large number of}} RNAs of maternal origin. Transcription in the primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> is actively down-regulated until <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> fate is established. Bulk expression of the zygotic genes commences concomitantly with the degradation of the maternal transcripts. Thus, during embryogenesis, maternally provided and zygotically transcribed mRNAs determine <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development collectively. In an effort to identify novel genes involved in the regulation of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> behavior, we carried out a large-scale RNAi screen targeting both maternal and zygotic components of the embryonic germ line transcriptome. We identified 48 genes necessary for distinct stages in <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development.

Our data uncover a previously unanticipated role of mei-P 26 in maintenance of embryonic <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> fate. We also performed systematic co-RNAi experiments, through which we found a low rate of functional redundancy among homologous gene pairs.
