5000|$|<b>Gold-plating</b> is pejorative term to characterise {{the process}} where an EU {{directive}} is given additional powers when being transposed {{into the national}} laws of member states.

50|$|At long last, Rollei had {{a camera}} that could match the Hasselbad 500C. Indeed, {{had it been}} {{released}} earlier, around 1960 say, {{it could have been}} enormously successful. On top of that, despite declining profit margins and tough competition from the Japanese, Rollei continued to target its advertising at the amateur market. In contrast, other companies such as Leitz and Hasselblad had better understood how to promote their expensive cameras in photographic magazines - not just through paid advertising, but also through feature articles in the editorial pages. As a result, the SL66 never sold in the numbers that the company had hoped for or needed. Nevertheless, Rollei owes its survival as a company to the SL66 camera system, along with its enduring reputation for quality. Its successor, the SL66E, was released in 1984; externally the camera was largely unchanged, but it now had a built-in light meter. Additional lenses were released, such as the Fisheye-Distagon (f/3.5, 30 mm), the Distagon (f/4, 40 mm), and the Sonnar (f/4, 150 mm) with a between-the-lens shutter along with more accessories including close-up lenses, extension bellows, a Polaroid film cassette, a sheet film cassette, an underwater housing, and a ring flash unit. Its successor, the SL66-X, released in 1968 only had TTL flash metering, while the SL66-SE (Special Edition) also included a standard light meter. Prior to this, TTL metering required a special prism viewfinder with a built-in light meter. The release in 1992 of the SE Exclusive Professional incorporating selective <b>gold-plating</b> on the housing marked the end of the SL66 series.|$|E

40|$|This article {{uses the}} recent {{drive in the}} UK to abolish <b>gold-plating</b> as a {{starting}} point to analyse whether EU legislation on prospectus disclosure, transparency requirements, and market abuse provides for maximum harmonisation or allows Member States to adopt super-equivalent implementing measure. In addition, the article develops a number of general criteria to identify situations where maximum harmonisation may be beneficial, and cases where the setting of minimum standards, or merely the removal of obstacles to cross-border mobility, is advantageous. The article argues that prospectus disclosure entails largely maximum harmonisation. The character of the Transparency and Market Abuse Directives, on the other hand, is ambivalent. Recent case law calls into question the permissibility of the super-equivalent implementation of the Market Abuse Directive by UK law. As far as the benefits of harmonisation are concerned, the article distinguishes between disclosure obligations and liability provisions.

Results suggest that an increase in velocity from about 1. 2 m/min (bulk flow) to about 5 mmin (reduced section) had no significant impact on compatibility of 316 L with Hg. In addition, various surface treatments such as <b>gold-plating,</b> chemical etching, polishing, and steam cleaning resulted in little or no influence on compatibility of 316 L with Hg when compared to nominal mill-annealed/surface-ground material. A sensitizing heat treatment also had little/no effect on compatibility of 316 L with Hg for the bulk specimen, although intergranular attack was observed around the specimen holes in each case.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} major {{findings on}} the shape transformation of the precursor silver decahedral nanoparticles (AgDeNPs) with pentagonal symmetry and twin defects into silver pentagonal prism nanoparticles (AgPPNPs) using Br¯ as a shape selective reagent. Silica-encapsulation of the gold-plated AgDeNPs was also carried out forming ordered arrays of silica encapsulated gold-plated AgDeNPs (SiO 2 @Au@AgDeNPs) of different sizes. At first, synthetic procedures for AgDeNPs (pentagonal bipyramids), silver pentagonal rod nanoparticles (AgPRNPs) and <b>gold-plating</b> of AgDeNPs (Au@AgDeNPs) were optimized. Gold plating enhances the chemical stability of AgDeNPs and preserves the superior plasmonic properties of silver. This thesis deals with {{the transformation of the}} precursor AgDeNPs into silver pentagonal prism nanoparticles (AgPPNPs) using Br¯ as a shape selective reagent. The degree of truncation was monitored by transverse LSPR plasmon band position shift with varying Ag/Br molar ratio. Length control was addressed from 50 nm to 128 nm by varying the amount of added silver. Colloidal synthesis of the silica encapsulation of the gold-plated AgDeNPs was also done forming SiO 2 @Au@AgDeNPs of different diameters. Silica coating was developed using the modified Stӧber process. SiO 2 @Au@AgDeNP of different size/diameter was prepared and studied. SiO 2 @Au@AgDeNPs of different diameters were obtained that ranged from 45 nm up to 310 nm.

40|$|Better {{regulation}} in the European Union cannot be achieved without serious attention to transposition of EU law into national legislation. As {{a matter of}} fact, EU member states breach EU law – perpetuately. Why do member states miss deadlines when transposing EU internal market directives? What factors determine delays when transposing EU directives? How do these factors influence the timeliness of the national transposition processes? And under what conditions are transpositions of directives delayed? This study analyses the timeliness of national transposition processes across nine member states of the 2004 EU transport acquis. Based on a truly mixed-method approach – a new quantitative data set with further insights gleaned from four controlled case studies and a concluding fuzzy set analysis - this study shows that the European Union has a serious transposition problem. Almost 70 percent of all national legal measures transposing the transport acquis cause problems, either because they are transposed too late, risking the opening of an infringement proceeding, or because they are too early (<b>gold-plating),</b> risking warping effects on the regulatory environment for business and citizens in the EU alike. Furthermore, this book provides some progress regarding {{the conditions under which}} transposition performance of member states could be improved. Seven potential European and national drivers and constrainers for timely transposition can be identified with different effects on the lengths of transposition delays. Distinguishing between three outcomes of transposition process (on time, short and long delay) it is the specific features of European directives that account for short term delays, whereas serious time lags of more than six months are a result of domestic factors. Furthermore, the timing of general elections in a member state and policy sector-related crises retard or rather accelerate national transposition processes just as political priority represents a significant necessary condition for timeliness.

However, some applications, in particular, biological imaging, prefer improved efficiency, which {{can be achieved by}} high-aspect-ratio zone plates. We accomplish this by using a bilayer-resist process in the zone plate fabrication. As our first attempt, a 40 -nm-outer-zone-width MZP with a nickel-plating thickness of 150 nm (aspect ratio of 4 : 1) was successfully fabricated. Relative to the 25 -nm MZP, this zone plate is ten times more efficient. Using this high-efficiency MZP, a line test pattern with half period of 30 nm is resolved by the microscope at photon energy of 500 eV. Furthermore, with a new multilayer mirror, the XM- 1 can now perform imaging up to 1. 8 keV. An image of a line test pattern with half period of 40 nm has a measured modulation of 90 %. The image was taken at 1. 77 keV with the high-efficiency MZP with an outer zone width of 35 nm and a nickel-plating thickness of 180 nm (aspect ratio of 5 : 1). XM- 1 provides a gateway to high-resolution imaging at high energy. To measure frequency response of the XM- 1, a partially annealed gold ''island'' pattern was chosen as a test object. After comparison with the SEM image of the pattern, the microscope has the measured cutoff of 19 nm, close to the theoretical one of 17 nm. The normalized frequency response, which is the ratio of the power density of the soft x-ray image to that of the SEM image, is shown in this paper...|$|E
