The class {{was the first in}} the world to use the EMD D43 traction motor, similar to but smaller than that used in the C and G classes. Head end power is provided by a separate engine unit in a special compartment located at the number 1 end of the locomotive behind the <b>electrical</b> <b>cabinet.</b> The 240kW generator provides 415V 3-phase AC power for train lighting, air conditioning and other carriage requirements.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 2011, a fire {{broke out}} on a Di 8 {{locomotive}} at Kl√∏fta on the Trunk Line while hauling a 16-wagon train of jet fuel to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. The fire started in an <b>electrical</b> <b>cabinet</b> after a diesel pipe running over it had cracked. The fire fighting was complicated by the train dispatcher not wanting to disconnect the overhead wire power as {{he thought it was}} an electric train. The damages were so severe that the locomotive was scrapped. The Accident Investigation Board Norway criticized CargoNet for not having sufficient maintenance routines for diesel pipes, as they were neither part of the maintenance procedure nor where there specified intervals for replacement.|$|E

50|$|MATEs appear {{similar to}} slugs, but their design is different. Instead of siphoning-off {{power as a}} slug does, the axles in a MATE are fully {{connected}} into the transition series in the locomotive it is connected to. A double-ended MATE (a MATE with connections on both ends) turns two four-axle locomotives into the equivalent of two fully fledged six-axle locomotives. A single-ended mate turns a four-axle locomotive into the equivalent of an eight-axle locomotive. MATEs do not cut out at speed as the motors are fully included in the series-parallel transition stages. SCL's GE U36B fleet is the prime example: they were delivered new with special <b>electrical</b> <b>cabinets</b> to handle the 2 to 4 extra motors in a MATE.
