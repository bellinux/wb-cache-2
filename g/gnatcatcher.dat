5|$|The Laguna Canyon area {{supports}} {{a variety of}} native Southern California wildlife, including large mammals such as mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes and mule deer. Like Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park to the south, the canyon supports over one hundred species of birds. Some of its endangered species include California <b>gnatcatcher,</b> cactus wren, and orange-throated whiptail. Except for the Laguna Lakes, the canyon has no fish habitat, and riparian habitat is sparse because the local creeks have only seasonal flow.|$|E
5|$|Although {{historically}} {{many fish}} species used Aliso Creek, {{the only remaining}} one is carp, which is known to survive in areas with high toxicity. Bird life was also abundant in the watershed—and 137species remain in the less developed areas of the watershed. Some of these birds include California least tern, least Bell's vireo, southwestern willow flycatcher, California <b>gnatcatcher,</b> and western snowy plover. Remaining habitat for native wildlife is now primarily along Wood Canyon Creek, in {{the upper reaches of}} Aliso Creek, and along some parts of English Canyon.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the San Juan {{watershed}} supported up to 12 invertebrate species, 5 fish species, 12 amphibian species, 35 reptile species, 143 bird species, and 42 mammal species, which {{benefited from}} the diverse vegetation communities present. Some streams and ponds host federally listed endangered/threatened species such as tidewater goby, fairy shrimp, and California red-legged frog. Federally listed bird species include least Bell's vireo, California <b>gnatcatcher,</b> California least tern, and southwestern willow flycatcher. Other listed species include Pacific pocket mouse and Quino checkerspot butterfly. As urbanization continues to increase in the San Juan watershed, most sensitive species have been pushed back to the foothills, mountains, and agricultural/ranching areas of the watershed.|$|E
