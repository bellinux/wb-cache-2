40|$|A {{free flow}} of ideas and {{information}} {{is vital to the}} process of scientific inquiry, and in turn to the ability to address economic, environmental and social development issues both in the <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> region and globally. Most of the challenges facing scholarly publishing in <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> are global and do not respect national boundaries. Scholarly publishing enables research findings of scholars to cross international boundaries to provide strong, positive connections between individual scholars, institutions and nations. Such exchanges contribute to the expansion of the global knowledge base to which the <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> region is linked. Participation in the global arena through scholarly communication may enable the <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> region to have access to knowledge and information it needs to succeed in the global economy that is being digitized rapidly. Scholarly publishing is as a result of research and innovation which may improve the quality of knowledge and information produced by scholars in the <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> region. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities of scholarly publishing in <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> in the twenty-first century. The paper also proposes ways of capitalising on the vast opportunities of enhancing knowledge production and dissemination in <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> through scholarly publishing in the twenty-first century. An analysis of publication records of <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> between 1997 and 2007 in the Thompson Scientific was conducted. There are many challenges confronting scholarly publishing in <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa.</b> The challenges include technological, socio-political, economic and environmental. The 21 st century brings with it opportunities that may enhance <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa’s</b> visibility of scholarly publishing...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{trends in}} cohort infant mortality rates and adult heights in 39 developing countries since 1961.

We argue that in <b>Sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> the decline in infant mortality may have been due to interventions that prevent infant deaths rather than improved nutrition and childhood morbidity.

However, child mortality figures in <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> are still sobering. The region alone accounts for 3,370,000 deaths of children under 5 in 2011 (WHO, 2012) which corresponds to 9,000 children dying every day, and six children dying every minute. Out of 3 million neonatal deaths worldwide, approximately 1.1 million are found in <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> (WHO, 2012).
