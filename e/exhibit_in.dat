5|$|At {{least a dozen}} {{recordings}} {{were issued}} {{in the wake of}} the success of the Nonesuch recording, and the work enjoyed significant exposure in a number of artistic media worldwide. The work was repeatedly used by filmmakers in the 1990s and onwards to elicit a sense of pathos or sorrow, including as an accompaniment to a plane crash in Peter Weir's Fearless (1993), and in the soundtrack to Julian Schnabel's Basquiat (1996). An art gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico opened an <b>exhibit</b> <b>in</b> 1995 dedicated entirely to visual art inspired by the piece.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the planned}} exhibit, {{especially}} those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association, charged that the exhibit focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, {{rather than on the}} motivations for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise the <b>exhibit</b> <b>in</b> order to meet the satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the National Air and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1898, back in Romania, Bogdan-Pitești and {{the other}} Salonul Independenților {{initiators}} joined up with author Ioan Bacalbașa and architect Ștefan Ciocâlteu.

Its steering committee was later joined by the intellectual and political figures Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Nicolae Xenopol, and Nicolae Filipescu, {{as well as by}} the painter Jean Alexandru Steriadi. The society took up the effort to uproot against academic salons, organizing a large and provocative <b>exhibit</b> <b>in</b> 1898, and, at the height of its popularity, enlisted in its ranks some 300 people. Despite such consolidation, various Ileana affiliates were not entirely committed to the cause, and never severed their links with Stănescu's official section.|$|E
5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry.

In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
