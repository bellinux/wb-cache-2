5000|$|When a <b>garlic</b> <b>clove</b> is crushed, {{the enzyme}} alliinase is {{released}} forming allicin from the cysteine sulfoxide alliin. Allicin breaks down into additional organosulfur compounds. In {{the presence of}} oil or organic solvents, among the compounds formed are the isomeric vinyldithiins and ajoene. As shown in the Scheme, allicin (1) decomposes into 2-propenesulfenic acid (2) and thioacrolein (3). Compound 2 reforms allicin while 3 gives Diels-Alder dimers 3-vinyl-4H-1,2-dithiin (4) and 2-vinyl-4H-1,3-dithiin (5). [...] Garlic cloves yield about 2.5-4.5 mg of allicin per gram when crushed.

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} shown that several {{extracts}} and compounds derived from garlic are able to inhibit Cu 2 + -induced low density lipoprotein oxidation. In this work we explored if the ability of aqueous garlic extract to prevent in vitro Cu 2 + -induced lipoprotein oxidation in human serum is affected by heating (a) aqueous garlic extracts or (b) <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves.</b> In the first case, aqueous extract of raw garlic and garlic powder were studied. In the second case, aqueous extract of boiled <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves,</b> microwave-treated <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves,</b> and pickled <b>garlic</b> were studied. It was also studied if the above mentioned preparations were able to chelate Cu 2 +. Methods Cu 2 + -induced lipoprotein oxidation in human serum was followed by the formation of conjugated dienes at 234 nm and 37 °C by 240 min in a phosphate buffer 20 mM, pH 7. 4. Blood serum and CuSO 4 were added to a final concentration of 0. 67 % and 0. 0125 mM, respectively. The lag time and the area under the curve from the oxidation curves were obtained. The Cu 2 + -chelating properties of garlic extracts were assessed using an approach based upon restoring the activity of xanthine oxidase inhibited in the presence of 0. 050 mM Cu 2 +. The activity of xanthine oxidase was assessed by monitoring the production of superoxide anion at 560 nm and the formation of uric acid at 295 nm. Data were compared by parametric or non-parametric analysis of variance followed by a post hoc test. Results Extracts from garlic powder and raw garlic inhibited in a dose-dependent way Cu 2 + -induced lipoprotein oxidation. The heating of garlic extracts or <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> was unable to alter significantly the increase in lag time and the decrease in the area under the curve observed with the unheated garlic extracts or raw garlic. In addition, {{it was found that the}} garlic extracts were unable to chelate Cu 2 +. Conclusions (a) the heating of aqueous extracts of raw garlic or garlic powder or the heating of <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> by boiling, microwave or pickling do not affect garlic's ability to inhibit Cu 2 + -induced lipoprotein oxidation in human serum, and (b) this ability is not secondary to Cu 2 + -chelation. </p...|$|R

Seed treatment with neem leaf, <b>garlic</b> <b>clove,</b> allamonda leaf, ginger rhizome, kalijira seed, bel leaf, turmeric rhizome, katamehedi leaf and onion bulb were evaluated against damping-off, seed germination and growth characters of tomato, eggplant and chilli seedlings. All the treatments were significantly reduced percent damping-off of these three vegetable over untreated control. The most effective treatment was neem leaf extract followed by <b>garlic</b> <b>clove</b> and allamonda leaf extracts in terms of suppressing damping-off disease incidence with increasing plant growth characters. The seed germination of three vegetable seedlings was also increased after sowing plant extracts treated seed in the pot. The highest seed germination of tomato (86. 67 %), eggplant (86. 33 %) and chilli (90. 33 %) was recorded after seed treatment with neem leaf extract.

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{research}} {{on the effects of}} garlic (Allium sativum) on numerous pathogens, but very few, if any, studies on its effect on beneficial, probiotic bifidobacteria. We have recently shown that garlic exhibits antibacterial activity against bifidobacteria. The mechanism by which garlic kills bifidobacteria is yet to be elucidated. This study sought to determine the mechanism of action of <b>garlic</b> <b>clove</b> extract on selected Bifidobacterium species using scanning and transmission electron microscopy and SDS-PAGE analysis. SEM micrographs revealed unusual morphological changes such as cell elongation, cocci-shaped cells with cross-walls, and distorted cells with bulbous ends. With TEM, observed changes included among others, condensation of cytoplasmic material, disintegration of membranes, and loss of structural integrity. SDS-PAGE analysis did not reveal any differences in whole-cell protein profiles of untreated and <b>garlic</b> <b>clove</b> extract-treated cells. The current study is the first to reveal the mechanism of action of <b>garlic</b> <b>clove</b> extract on probiotic Bifidobacterium species. The results indicate that garlic affects these beneficial bacteria {{in a manner similar to}} that exhibited in pathogens. These results therefore further highlight that caution should be taken especially when using raw garlic and probiotic bifidobacteria simultaneously as viability of these bacteria could be reduced by allicin released upon crushing of garlic cloves, thereby limiting the health benefits that the consumer anticipate to gain from probiotics.

40|$|Fusarium proliferatum is {{considered}} to be a pathogen of many economically important plants, including garlic. The objective of this research was to apply near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to rapidly determine fungal concentration in intact <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves,</b> avoiding the laborious and time-consuming procedures of traditional assays. Preventive detection of infection before seeding is of great interest for farmers, because it could avoid serious losses of yield during harvesting and storage. Spectra were collected on 95 <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves,</b> divided in five classes of infection (from 1 -healthy to 5 -very highly infected) in the range of fungal concentration 0. 34 – 7231. 15 ppb. Calibration and cross validation models were developed with partial least squares regression (PLSR) on pretreated spectra (standard normal variate, SNV, and derivatives), providing good accuracy in prediction, with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 829 and 0. 774, respectively, a standard error of calibration (SEC) of 615. 17 ppb, and a standard error of cross validation (SECV) of 717. 41 ppb. The calibration model was then used to predict fungal concentration in unknown samples, peeled and unpeeled. The results showed that NIRS could be used as a reliable tool to directly detect and quantify F. proliferatum infection in peeled intact <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves,</b> but the presence of the external peel strongly affected the prediction reliability...|$|R
