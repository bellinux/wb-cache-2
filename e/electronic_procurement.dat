The classification of groups of temporary, quantitative, qualitative, cost, technical and technological indicators as well as indicators of the level of readiness of the <b>electronic</b> public <b>procurement</b> system at the macro- and microlevels is proposed.

In order to encourage these efforts, {{as a part}} of the FP 6 IST Project „European <b>Electronic</b> Public <b>Procurement</b> Application Framework in the Western Balkan Region“ (ELLECTRA WeB), there has been developed an Application Framework for generating solutions for <b>electronic</b> public <b>procurement</b> by applying Model Driven Engineering and Service Oriented Architecture. While making the framework, there has been a full implementation of the IDABC manual [2] for <b>electronic</b> public <b>procurement</b> for the EU countries, which by default led to a complete coordination between the solution and the legal framework of EU. The major efforts when it comes to developing the solution are focused on creating independent models and transformation rules which enable automatic transformation of the independent models into a programming code. Due to this approach, the generated solutions are interoperable, portable and they easily adapt to different platforms and technologies.

This system was developed by reputable international anti-corruption organization Transparency International Ukraine with a help of volunteers, NGOs, business community and state bodies of Ukraine, the WNISEF fund, EDGE, and other partners. During pilot stage of the project Transparency International Ukraine was administering the development of the system: ProZorro.Sale central database and a number of additional modules.

The first major reform instituted was the [...] "what {{you see is what you}} get" [...] or WYSWIG policy that is a simplified system of fund release for the General Appropriations Act (GAA). This allowed agency heads to immediately plan and contract out projects by just looking at the GAA, which is available in print and at the DBM website, without waiting for the issuance of an allotment authority. Diokno initiated the reform of the government procurement system (GPS) through the adoption of rapidly improving information and communications technology. He secured technical assistance from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) to help the GPS develop an <b>electronic</b> <b>procurement</b> system along the lines of the Canadian model. By August 1999, the DBM had two documents necessary to initiate reforms in public procurement. In early 2000, Diokno and USAID successfully concluded a substantial technical assistance program for the DBM's budget reform programs, which now included procurement reform. Other budget reforms instituted by Diokno concerned procedures for payment of accounts payable and terminal leave/ retirement gratuity benefits. The release of cash allocation were programmed and uploaded to the department's website while payments were made direct to the bank accounts of specific contractor.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how <b>electronic</b> <b>procurement</b> influences {{the organization of}} economic transactions. It seeks evidence for ICT-induced changes in how companies organize their activities and whether ICT lead to more competitive and transparent markets. Testing {{the relationship between the}} effect of <b>electronic</b> <b>procurement</b> on procurement cost and sourcing strategy, I provide new evidence that <b>electronic</b> <b>procurement</b> leads to more market transactions. This leads to the conclusion that <b>electronic</b> <b>procurement</b> increases market transparency, lowers search and supplier switching costs and improves the management of supply chain and contradicts the predictions that ICT will lead to a dominance of network-like organizational form and an increasing reliance on hybrid forms of organizing economic transactions. Two implications emerge from these results. The first one is relevant for companies engaging in ICT projects. ICT combined with changes in business strategy leads to a reduction of market transaction costs and, as a result, opens up new possibilities in terms of how business activities can be organized and/or how to structure competition in upstream markets. This effect of new technologies is of clear benefit to companies successfully implementing and using new technologies. The second implication is of great importance for companies whose customers implement ICT to intensify competition among suppliers. Changing environment forces them to adapt to new market conditions and look for new ways of maintaining profitability. information technology and firm boundaries, markets vs. hierarchies, sourcing strategy, <b>electronic</b> <b>procurement...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} address the lack of {{reliable}} indicators of corruption, this article develops a composite indicator of high-level institutionalised corruption through a novel ‘Big Data’ approach. Using publicly available <b>electronic</b> public <b>procurement</b> records in Hungary, we identify “red flags” in the public procurement process and link them to restricted competition and recurrent contract award to the same company. We use this method to create a corruption indicator at contract level that can be aggregated {{to the level of}} individual organizations, sectors, regions and countries. Because <b>electronic</b> public <b>procurement</b> data is available in virtually all developed countries from about the mid- 2000 s, this method can generate a corruption index based on objective data that is consistent over time and across countries. We demonstrate the validity of the corruption risk index by showing that firms with higher corruption risk score had relatively higher profitability, higher ratio of contract value to initial estimated price, greater likelihood of politicians managing or owning them, and greater likelihood of registration in tax havens, than firms with lower scores on the index. In the conclusion we discuss the uses of this data for academic research, investigative journalists, civil society groups, and small and medium business. This is the author accepted manuscript.
