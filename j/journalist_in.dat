40|$|As the Global War on Terror has {{prompted}} {{new interest in}} Islam in Southeast Asia, western governments have scrambled to engage with Muslim <b>journalists</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia and Malaysia.

This article draws on a series of semi-structured interviews with elite <b>journalists</b> <b>in</b> Jakarta, Surabaya, and Kuala Lumpur to provide some preliminary explorations of the relationship between Islam and journalism in Southeast Asia. It argues that Muslim <b>journalists</b> <b>in</b> both Indonesia and Malaysia express the universal values of journalism, but do so within an Islamic idiom. It concludes with a discussion of justice as the overarching ideology of journalism in Islam, and a comment on how western diplomats might use the language of Islam to reach out to <b>journalists</b> <b>in</b> these two majority Muslim countries...|$|R

He began conducting interviews about Yamato with former Japanese naval commanders and survivors of the battleship's last mission.

For the American side of the story, he interviewed US naval commanders and personnel involved in the sinking of Yamato. Satisfied with what he had, Spurr began writing the book in the late 1970s, over 30 years after he first found out about the battleship.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Journalists</b> <b>in</b> the Arab world hold many of {{the same}} values with their news {{generation}} as do <b>journalists</b> <b>in</b> the Western world. <b>Journalists</b> <b>in</b> the Arab world often aspire to Western norms of objectivity, impartiality, and balance. Kuldip Roy Rampal's study of <b>journalist</b> training programs <b>in</b> North Africa leads him to the conclusion that, [...] "the most compelling dilemma faced by professional journalists, increasingly graduates of journalism degree programs, in the four Maghreb states is how to reconcile their preference for press freedom and objectivity with constraints imposed by political and legal factors that point to a pro-government journalism." [...] Iyotika Ramaprasad and Naila Nabil Hamdy state, “A new trend toward objectivity and impartiality as a value in Arab journalism seems to be emerging, and the values of Arab and Western journalism in this field have started to converge.” [...] Further, many <b>journalists</b> <b>in</b> the Arab world express their desires for the media to become a fourth estate akin to the media in the West. In a survey of 601 <b>journalists</b> <b>in</b> the Arab world, 40% of them viewed investigation of the government as part of their job.|$|R

Buendía took the death threats he received very seriously and thereby carried a pistol, either on his belt or in a leather pocket. Prior to his death, Buendía wrote extensively on the alleged corruption within Mexico's Petroleum Workers Union; the allegations of wrongdoings of Jorge Díaz Serrano, former leader of Pemex, the national oil company; and Arturo Durazo Moreno, {{the former head of}} Mexico City's police force. Buendía also criticized the role of the U.S. government and the CIA in Mexico, and often published names of American officials involved in secret operations. Although he was quick to publish controversial reports, Buendía's direct reporting was respected and generally considered reliable given his access to top Mexican officials. He was the most-read <b>journalist</b> <b>in</b> Mexico's print media, and is often cited by newspapers and journalists as the most influential political columnist in Mexico of {{the second half of the}} 20th century.|$|E

5|$|By 1957, {{the arms}} were redrawn by Alan Beddoe {{so as to}} have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more {{resembling}} St. Edward's Crown, as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II. To mark the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended {{the last vestiges of}} British authority over Canada, a McGill University student named Bruce Hicks proposed to Secretary of State Gerald Regan that the motto of the Order of Canada be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the Order of the Garter), the Scottish royal arms the Order of the Thistle, and the royalist arms of the French Regime the Order of the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Michael). While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a <b>journalist</b> <b>in</b> the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.|$|E
