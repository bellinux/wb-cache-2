25|$|As {{organic matter}} decays under low-oxygen (or hypoxic) {{conditions}} (such as in swamps, eutrophic lakes or <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> of oceans), sulfate-reducing bacteria {{will use the}} sulfates present in the water to oxidize the organic matter, producing hydrogen sulfide as waste. Some of the hydrogen sulfide will react with metal ions in the water to produce metal sulfides, which are not water-soluble. These metal sulfides, such as ferrous sulfide FeS, are often black or brown, leading to the dark color of sludge.|$|E
25|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and phosphorus}} (P) applied to agricultural land (via synthetic fertilizers, composts, manures, biosolids, etc.) can provide valuable plant nutrients. However, if not managed correctly, excess N and P can have negative environmental consequences. Excess N supplied by both synthetic fertilizers (as highly soluble nitrate) and organic {{sources such as}} manures (whose organic N is mineralized to nitrate by soil microorganisms) can lead to groundwater contamination of nitrate. Nitrate-contaminated drinking water can cause blue baby syndrome. Together with excess P from these same fertilizer sources, eutrophication can occur downstream due to excess nutrient supply, leading to anoxic areas called <b>dead</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|E
25|$|The nitrogen-rich {{compounds}} {{found in}} fertilizer runoff {{are the primary}} cause of serious oxygen depletion in many parts of oceans, especially in coastal zones, lakes and rivers. The resulting lack of dissolved oxygen greatly reduces the ability of these areas to sustain oceanic fauna. The number of oceanic <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> near inhabited coastlines are increasing. As of 2006, the application of nitrogen fertilizer is being increasingly controlled in northwestern Europe and the United States. If eutrophication can be reversed, it may take decades before the accumulated nitrates in groundwater can be broken down by natural processes.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the evolution of}} accretion discs that contain some turbulence within a disc <b>dead</b> <b>zone,</b> a region about the disc midplane of a disc that is not sufficiently ionised for the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) to drive turbulence. In particular, we determine whether additional sources of turbulence within a <b>dead</b> <b>zone</b> are capable of suppressing gravo-magneto (GM) disc outbursts that arise from a rapid transition from gravitationally produced to MRI produced turbulence. With viscous α disc models we consider two mechanisms that may drive turbulence within the <b>dead</b> <b>zone.</b> First, we examine a constant α parameter within the <b>dead</b> <b>zone.</b> This may be applicable to hydrodynamical instability, such as baroclinic instability, where the turbulence level is independent of the MRI active surface layer properties. In this case, {{we find that the}} disc will not become stable to the outbursts unless the <b>dead</b> <b>zone</b> turbulent viscosity is comparable to that in the MRI active surface layers. Under such conditions, the accretion rate through the <b>dead</b> <b>zone</b> must be larger than that through the MRI active layers. In a second model, we assume that the accretion flow though the <b>dead</b> <b>zone</b> is a constant fraction (less than unity) of that through the active layers. This may be applicable to turbulence driven by hydrodynamic waves that are excited by the MRI active surface layers. We find that the instability is hardly affected by the viscous <b>dead</b> <b>zone.</b> In both cases however, we find that the triggering of the MRI during the outburst {{may be due to the}} heating from the viscosity in the <b>dead</b> <b>zone,</b> rather than self-gravity. Thus, neither mechanism for generating turbulence within the <b>dead</b> <b>zone</b> can significantly stabilise a disc or the resulting outburst behaviour.

25|$|Oxygen is {{required}} by all aerobically respiring plants and animals and it is replenished in daylight by photosynthesizing plants and algae. Under eutrophic conditions, dissolved oxygen greatly increases during the day, but is greatly reduced after dark by the respiring algae and by microorganisms that feed on the increasing mass of dead algae. When dissolved oxygen levels decline to hypoxic levels, fish and other marine animals suffocate. As a result, creatures such as fish, shrimp, and especially immobile bottom dwellers die off. In extreme cases, anaerobic conditions ensue, promoting growth of bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum that produces toxins deadly to birds and mammals. Zones where this occurs are known as <b>dead</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|E

One of the RMPs, Cpl Miller was wounded by small arms fire as they ran for cover inside the police station.

The Iraqi policemen feared that they would be shot for being traitors and so decided to leave, but the RMPs decided the best policy was to stay behind and defend their position whilst awaiting help. They asked the Iraqis for a radio before they left, but the Iraqi policeman did not have one to give them. The area around Majar al-Kabir is very flat and as a result, HF and VHF radios don't work very well; even within close range, there are <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> where the signal cannot be accessed.

500|$|Nitrogen {{compounds}} constantly interchange {{between the}} atmosphere and living organisms. Nitrogen must first be processed, or [...] "fixed", into a plant-usable form, usually ammonia. Some nitrogen fixation is done by lightning strikes producing the nitrogen oxides, but most is done by diazotrophic bacteria through enzymes known as nitrogenases (although today industrial nitrogen fixation to ammonia is also significant). When the ammonia is taken up by plants, {{it is used to}} synthesise proteins. These plants are then digested by animals who use the nitrogen compounds to synthesise their own proteins and excrete nitrogen–bearing waste. Finally, these organisms die and decompose, undergoing bacterial and environmental oxidation and denitrification, returning free dinitrogen to the atmosphere. Industrial nitrogen fixation by the Haber process is mostly used as fertiliser, although excess nitrogen–bearing waste, when leached, leads to eutrophication of freshwater and the creation of marine <b>dead</b> <b>zones,</b> as nitrogen-driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die. Furthermore, nitrous oxide, which is produced during denitrification, attacks the atmospheric ozone layer.|$|E

500|$|Some {{of these}} changes were driven by {{developments}} in military technology. Before 1190 mining was used rarely and the siege engines of the time were largely incapable of damaging the thicker castle walls. The introduction of the trebuchet began to change this situation; {{it was able to}} throw much heavier balls, with remarkable accuracy, and reconstructed devices {{have been shown to be}} able to knock holes in walls. Trebuchets were first recorded in England in 1217, and were probably used the year before as well. Richard I used them in his sieges during the Third Crusade and appears to have started to alter his castle designs to accommodate the new technology on his return to Europe. The trebuchet seems to have encouraged the shift towards round and polygonal towers and curved walls. [...] In addition to having fewer or no <b>dead</b> <b>zones,</b> and being easier to defend against mining, these castle designs were also much less easy to attack with trebuchets as the curved surfaces could deflect some of the force of the shot.|$|E

Regionally, nutrient runoff to coastal waters not only creates <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> but also amplifies acidification. The excess nutrients cause more phytoplankton to grow, {{and as they}} die the added CO2 from their decay acidifies the water. We have to be smarter about how we fertilize fields and lawns and treat livestock manure and sewage [...] Locally, acidic water could be buffered with limestone or chemical bases produced electrochemically from seawater and rocks.

Larval mollusks such as clams and oysters {{appear to be more}} susceptible to acidification than adults, and recycling old clamshells into the mud may help buffer pH and provide better substrate for larval attachment. The drop in ocean pH is expected to accelerate in coming decades, so marine ecosystems will have to adapt.

[...] His script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg, who eliminated large portions of the novel's story, including plot points about Johnny Smith having a brain tumor. Cronenberg, Boam, and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay page by page. Boam's [...] "triptych" [...] in the screenplay surrounds three acts: the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after he awakes from a coma, a story about Smith assisting a sheriff track down the Castle Rock Killer, and finally Johnny deciding to confront the politician Stillson.

[...] "It was this theme that made me like the book, and I particularly enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece, a work of exploitation," [...] he said.
