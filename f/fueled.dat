40|$|On-board {{production}} of hydrogen for <b>fuel</b> cells for automotive applications is a challenging developmental task. The <b>fuel</b> processor must show long term durability and under challenging conditions. <b>Fuel</b> processor catalysts in automotive <b>fuel</b> processors {{will be exposed}} to large thermal variations, vibrations, exposure to uncontrolled ambient conditions, and various impurities from ambient air and from <b>fuel.</b> For the commercialization of <b>fuel</b> processors, the delineation of effects on catalyst activity and durability are required. We are studying <b>fuels</b> and <b>fuel</b> constituent effects on the <b>fuel</b> processor system {{as part of the}} DOE <b>Fuel</b> Cells for Transportation program. Pure <b>fuel</b> components are tested to delineate the <b>fuel</b> component effect on the <b>fuel</b> processor and <b>fuel</b> processor catalysts. Component blends are used to simulate ''real fuels'', with various <b>fuel</b> mixtures being examined such as reformulated gasoline and naptha. The aliphatic, napthenic, olefin and aromatic content are simulated to represent the chemical kinetics of possible detrimental reactions, such as carbon formation, during <b>fuel</b> testing. Testing has examined the <b>fuel</b> processing performance of different <b>fuel</b> components to help elucidate the <b>fuel</b> constituent effects on <b>fuel</b> processing performance and upon catalyst durability. Testing has been conducted with vapor <b>fuels,</b> including natural gas and pure methane. The testing of pure methane and comparable testing with natural gas (97 % methane) have shown some measurable differences in performance in the <b>fuel</b> processor. Major gasoline <b>fuel</b> constituents, such as aliphatic compounds, napthanes, and aromatics have been compared for their effect on the <b>fuel</b> processing performance. Experiments have been conducted using high-purity compounds to observe the <b>fuel</b> processing properties of the individual components and to document individual <b>fuel</b> component performance. The relative carbon formation of different <b>fuel</b> constituents have been measured by monitoring carbon via in situ laser optics, and by monitoring carbon buildup on the catalyst surface. The <b>fuel</b> processing performance of the individual components is compared with the <b>fuel</b> processing performance of blended <b>fuel</b> components and the reformulated gasoline to examine synergistic or detrimental effects the <b>fuel</b> components have in a real <b>fuel</b> blend...|$|R

25|$|Water in <b>fuel</b> {{can damage}} a <b>fuel</b> {{injection}} pump; some diesel <b>fuel</b> filters also trap water.

50|$|The nuclear <b>fuel</b> cycle, {{also called}} nuclear <b>fuel</b> chain, is the {{progression}} of nuclear <b>fuel</b> {{through a series of}} differing stages.
