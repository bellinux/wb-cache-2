The cell boundaries coincide approximately with the downward terminations and near convergence of conjugate pairs of normal faults. The pattern becomes less spatially ordered on higher horizons where faults still show a near-isotropic strike distribution. Maximum throws, c. 80 m, occur c. 400 m above the downward terminations of the faults. The faults have a systematic geometric relationship with folds, with anticlines in the mutual hanging walls of fault pairs and broader footwall synclines {{that define the}} shallow dish forms of the polygons. Polygon boundaries coincide with anticlinal ridges on the interface between the <b>faulted</b> <b>sequence</b> and an underlying 35 m thick low velocity, low density, overpressured layer. Although the pattern of ridges defining the polygon boundaries is strikingly similar to experimental spoke and hub patterns formed at the boundaries between viscous materials with density inversion, the data do not exclude the possibility of lateral extension...|$|E

Despite the complex interactions between geological input and bed-scale connectivity, the flow properties of a system are controlled by only three geometrical, rather than geological, variables describing connectivity, anisotropy and resolution.

40|$|Abstract: The {{structure}} {{and content of the}} Moab Fault zone are described for 37 transects across the fault zone where throws range from less than 100 m to c. 960 m. The 45 km long fault trace intersects a sedimentary sequence containing a high proportion of sandstones with good reservoir properties, interspersed with numerous mudstone layers. Typically, the fault zone is bounded by two external slip zones with the fault zone components separated by up to nine internal slip zones. Fault zone components are tabular lenses of variably deformed sandstones and sandstone cataclasites and breccia, with a wide size range, usually enclosed in a matrix of shaley fault gouge containing mm to m scale ntrained sandstone fragments. Neither fault zone structure nor content can be predicted by extrapolation over distances as little as 10 m. Although variable in thickness, haley gouge is always present except where the mudstone is <c. 20 % of the <b>faulted</b> <b>sequence.</b> The distribution of shaley gouge conforms with exis,ng algorithms for predicting {{the presence or absence of}} shaley gouge in subsurface fault zones.

40|$|In this {{research}} project 3 D seismic data are examined for {{the characterization of}} fluid flow expressions in Lower Tertiary sediments of the northern Dutch offshore. The study area is located in quadrants A-G, with focus on the D- and western E- quadrants. The availability of new 3 D seismic data in this region allowed accurate mapping and quantification of the fluid flow features present. These features might represent migration pathways for ascending hydrocarbons and can potentially be related to dry wells drilled in the study area. In total, a number of 135 mounded structures have been recognized on the Mid Miocene Unconformity. The focus of {{this research}} is to investigate the relationship between these mounded structures and the underlying polygonal fault system present in the Paleogene sediments. This relationship is examined via quantitative analysis on the polygonal faults, which include azimuth, throw and fault trace length measurements. Results show that areas where fault throw is largest, mounded structures are generally present. Furthermore, a positive relation exists between the mound height and magnitude of the underlying fault throw. These relationships combined with the characteristics found on 3 D seismic data, indicate that the mounds most likely originate from remobilized sediments. Fluids dewatering from the underlying polygonal <b>faulted</b> <b>sequence</b> resulted in the entrainment and expulsion of these sediments on the paleo seafloor. The lithology of the mounds however, is uncertain as no wells have been drilled through these structures. Finally this research discusses the implications for the petroleum industry, as the observed fluid flow features are known migration pathways and might represent drilling hazards...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Extensive {{polygonal}} {{networks of}} normal faults have reportedly been identified within layer-bound sequences in about 28 sedimentary basins worldwide. The gentle regional dips, passive tectonic settings and {{geometry of the}} fault networks {{have led to the}} conclusion that faulting must have resulted from gravity-driven mechanical compaction. The faulted sequences comprise very fine-grained sediments, with lithofacies that range from smectitic claystones to almost pure chalks. In most, if not all, cases it is clear that volumetric contraction has occurred with horizontal contraction of the sediments complementing the heave of the faults. One explanation which has previously been offered is that the fine-grained sediments have shrunk due to syneresis, a process that involves spontaneous contraction of the solid network with expulsion of the pore fluid. However, syneresis is an implausible mechanism because it does not explain the observed lithological variation in the sediments concerned, why the initiation of faulting occurs in the depth range 100 – 1000 m, and why faulting continues for millions of years. A much simpler explanation is that shear failure inevitably results from one-dimensional compaction if the coefficient of friction is sufficiently low; and there is some evidence from laboratory measurements that the coefficient of friction is likely to be exceptionally low in these fine-grained sediments. Qualitatively, low coefficients of friction also explain why these compaction faults preferentially dip towards the basin margin where the regional dip of the bedding is greater than 1. Furthermore, they help to explain the origin of a polygonal fault system in the Eromanga Basin, South Australia, where the situation is complicated by the presence of a low velocity, ductile layer {{at the base of the}} <b>faulted</b> <b>sequence...</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{structures}} and processes related to failure mode transition in normal faults inmechanically layered sediments. Dilatant, hybrid and shear mode faults {{are common in}} the uppercrust and associated with different deformation processes, fault and fracture geometries and transportproperties. Fault systems are of great importance for applications such as hydrocarbon explorationand production, groundwater flow, hydro-thermal systems, CO 2 sequestration and natural hazardassessment. However, our knowledge of faults still {{has room for improvement}} and here I addresssome issues more or less directly related to different failure modes and mechanical stratigraphy. To this end a variety of methods, including analogue modeling, field work and numerical flowsimulations are used to determine a general structural trend from dilatant to shear failure modeand later on to study details of fault zones in some of these settings. This failure mode transition isthe central theme of my thesis. While some experimental studies have been done on failure mode transition in experimentallydeformed samples and 2 -D discrete element models, we lack a good understanding of the effect offailure mode transition on 3 -D structures on normal faults. This is addressed in Chapter 3 of thisthesis. Here I present a series of scaled analogue models of normal faulting using cohesive powderembedded in cohesionless sand. By varying the overburden thickness, the failure mode changes fromtensile to hybrid and finally to shear. 3 -D investigation of the hardened and excavated cohesivelayers shows three structural domains: (1) The tensile domain is characterized by steep open fissuresand sharp changes in strike at segment boundaries and branch points; (2) the shear domain showsshallower fault dips, fault planes develop striations and map-view fault traces undulate with smallerchanges in strike at branches; (3) the hybrid domain shows characteristic features of dilatant andshear domain, alternating both laterally and vertically. These attributes can be recognized inmap-view, which is a useful tool in understanding and interpreting further work in this thesis. I study dilatant faults in the graben system of Canyonlands National Park, Utah, USA (Chap. 4). Here, I present results of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys in combination with fieldobservations and analysis of high-resolution airborne imagery. This study shows that Quaternarysediments at the flat graben floors are intensely faulted, implying a more complex fault structurethan visible at the surface. The presence of sinkholes gives insights in local dilatancy and showswhere water and sediments are transported underground. These field observations are later comparedwith a series of scaled analogue models using cohesive powder in a half-graben setting (Chap. 5). Pre-formed vertical, cohesionless joints in the upper 5 cm of the model vary in strike directionwith respect to a predefined basement fault, to cover a range of joint-fault angles observed inCanyonlands NP. The surface trace of faults follows the joints geometry to a certain extent andtherefore, fault geometry and amount of secondary fractures differ strongly from experiments withoutjoints. Map-view analyses show that with increasing angle between joint-set and basement-faultstrike the number of secondary fractures and the number of connected joints increases, while thearea fraction of massively dilatant fractures shows only a minor increase. The transition from dilatant to hybrid mode faulting in this thesis is explored by a ’proof-ofconcept’study on salt intrusion into underlying normal faults (Chap. 6). The motivation of thisproject is the deformation-rate depending lubricating effect of the rock salt on the fault movementand potential effects on induced seismic events in the Groningen gas field. We combine cohesivepowder as analog for brittle carbonates with different viscous salt analogs in two experiments. Using resin as salt analog shows the resulting geometry of salt in the faults which form in dilatantmode as result of low overburden stress. Using transparent silicone oil as salt analogue allowsdynamic observation of the developing fault geometry, where faults form in hybrid mode due tolarger overburden stress. I present a study on hybrid failure in clay smears with 3 -D structural investigation and flowmeasurements (Chap. 7). Despite numerous published outcrop and analogue studies, this structuraldomain is underrepresented in current research. Water saturated sandbox experiments with largeclay smear surfaces (500 cm²) are coupled with across-fault flow measurements to determine thedynamic permeability evolution. This is combined with structural analyses of excavated clay smears. We observe an initial hybrid failure of the clay with early breaching of the clay layer and increasedcross-fault flux, followed by subsequent phases of fault back-stepping, shearing and reworking. Wefind diagnostic relationships between fault structures and flow responses that allow a predictionof fluxes from observed structures or vice versa. In addition to simple single-layer experimentswe present experiments with two source clay layers, which show a different characteristic fluxresponse with a generally lower permeability at the same total clay volume in the <b>faulted</b> <b>sequence.</b> Experimental observations are then compared with numerical flow simulations using finite elementmethod (FEM) in 2 -D and 3 -D, showing a good fit between the measurements and flow simulations. The thesis concludes with an outcrop study on clay smears forming in shear mode in unlithifiedclay-sand sequences in lignite mines of the Lower Rhine Embayment (Chap. 8). This work focuseson 3 -D outcrops in freshly cut normal faults with shale gouge ratios of 0. 1 - 0. 3. Vertical profilesshow that fault zones are often layered, with sheared sand, sheared clay and tectonically mixedsand–clay gouge. 3 -D thickness data derived from sequential slicing in excavated fault zones areapproximately log-normal and show heterogeneous thickness distributions. The thinnest parts ofclay smears are often located close to source layer cut-offs rather than {{in the center of the}} smear asproposed in earlier studies. Profile and 3 -D data show, that clay smears are strongly affected by R- andR’-shears, which mostly form at the footwall side. These shears can locally cross and offsetclay smears, which we identify as prominent process in the formation of holes. On micro-scale, claysmear samples show that grain-scale mixing can lead to thickening of the low permeability smearsand intense mixing and amalgamation of parallel smears may lead to resealing of holes...|$|E
40|$|Aftershock hypocenters of the 1984 Devil Canyon, Idaho {{earthquake}} {{indicate the}} sequence {{was associated with}} conjugate normal faulting on two northwest-striking normal faults that bound the Warm Spring Creek graben. The ML 5. 8 mainshock occurred on August 22, 1984 and is considered a late aftershock of the MS 7. 3 Borah Peak earthquake of October 28, 1983, which ruptured portions of the Lost River and Lone Pine faults. Focal mechanisms {{and the distribution of}} aftershock hypocenters suggest that the seismogenic part of the Challis segment of the Lost River fault has a planar geometry which strikes N 25 ° W and dips 75 ° SW, and the Lone Pine fault has a planar geometry which strikes N 39 ° W and dips 58 ° NE. Focal mechanisms indicate that the earthquakes on the Challis segment and Lone Pine fault were caused by predominantly normal faulting with minor components of left-lateral strike-slip. Their T-axes are consistent with the northeast-southwest extensional direction of the local Basin and Range province. The mainshock nucleated at a depth of 12. 8 ± 0. 7 km on the Challis segment where the conjugate faults merge. The largest aftershock, ML 5. 0 on September 8, 1984, nucleated at a shallower depth of 7. 1 ± 1. 9 km on the Lone Pine fault. The Devil Canyon mainshock is interpreted to have ruptured unilaterally upward and to the northwest along the Challis segment of the Lost River fault system. Rupture dimensions inferred from the aftershock distribution indicate the mainshock had a static stress drop of 14 bars. The largest aftershock may have ruptured upward and to the northwest along the Lone Pine fault. It is suggested that stress changes resulting from the rupture of the ML 5. 8 mainshock along the Challis segment increased shear stresses on the Lone Pine fault which was probably close to its yield stress. This increase caused the ML 5. 0 primary aftershock and most of its subsequent aftershocks to occur along the Lone Pine fault. Characteristics of the conjugate normal faulting observed in the Devil Canyon sequence consist of normal faults that have their own orientations and sense of slip, but are mechanically coupled leading to a cause-and-effect relationship for contemporaneous slip along each fault. Similar characteristics are observed in other conjugate normal <b>faulting</b> <b>sequences,</b> as well as strike-slip and thrust conjugate <b>faulting</b> <b>sequences</b> worldwide.

Software testing approaches are divided into three parts i. e. code based testing, specification based testing and model based testing. In model based testing, the testing begins at design phase. So, early detection of faults can be achieved by using this approach further reducing time, cost and efforts of the developer to a large extent. In this paper we propose a technique for generating test cases using both UML sequence diagram and state chart diagram. Our approach is to convert Sequence Diagram into Sequence Graph and then to convert State Chart Diagram into State chart Graph. Finally System Testing Graph (SYTG) is formed by combining the two Graphs. From the graphs different control flow sequences also called test cases are identified and then optimized using evolutionary Algorithm, called Genetic Algorithm.

30|$|When {{there is}} a fault in the network, node {{voltages}} have no directionality according to <b>fault</b> <b>sequence</b> analysis. This is because that voltage drops occur at the nodes at or around the fault and low voltage protections will all act. The fault point has the lowest voltage and voltage increases {{with the increase of}} the electrical distance. Thus voltage information can reflect fault location to some extends, though when voltage data is only available at the key nodes, it is difficult to diagnose the fault. Obviously, when {{there is a}} fault, most power from the power sources will go to the fault point through a minimum impedance path, referred to as the fault power path in this paper. The fault power flow of this path is the biggest and direction is to the fault point. Based on the selection of the fault power path and search tree model, together with current information comparison, fault location can be identified effectively. Thus this paper proposes a MS protection based on centralized searching method, and based on that backup protection can be realized.|$|R

As a consequence, for design vali-dation, not only the functionality of a circuit has to be considered, but also its robustness properties have to be analyzed. In this work we propose a method to verify the strong fault-secureness by use of constrained SAT-based ATPG. Strongly fault-secure circuits {{can be seen as the}} widest class of circuits achieving the totally self-checking (TSC) goal, which requires that every fault be detected the first time it manifests itself as an error at the outputs. As the strongly fault-secure property guarantees to achieve the TSC goal even in the case of fault accumulation, the effects of all possible <b>fault</b> <b>sequences</b> have to be taken into con-sideration to verify this property. To speed up the complex analy-sis of multiple faults we develop rules to derive detectability or redundancy information for multiple faults from the respective information for single faults.

40|$|A {{control and}} {{protection}} system {{was developed for}} use with a paralleled 2. 5 -kWe-per-module static inverter-converter system. The control and protection system senses internal and external fault parameters such as voltage, frequency, current, and paralleling current unbalance. A logic system controls contactors to isolate defective power conditioners or loads. The system sequences contactor operation to automatically control parallel operation, startup, and fault isolation. Transient overload protection and <b>fault</b> checking <b>sequences</b> are included. The operation and performance of a control and protection system, with detailed circuit descriptions, are presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} an algorithm that compacts the Test Sequences {{generated by a}} GA-based ATPG program for sequential circuits. In this algorithm, from a set of test sequences, a properly selected subset of sequences is reordered and combined without {{reducing the number of}} detected faults. By introducing the metric of <b>fault</b> density <b>sequence</b> selection is guided towards sequences that have higher fault density. The identification and exploitation in the GA population of special sequences called essential sequences speeds up the compaction algorithm. Experimental results support the usefulness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|A method {{based on}} linear {{feedback}} shift registers over finite fields {{is presented to}} generate for a natural number n a pattern sequence with minimal length detecting each m-multiple stuck-open faults for M&# 8804;n. A hardware architecture is discussed generating this sequence, and for n= 1 a built-in self-test (BIST) approach is presented that detects all combinations of multiple combinational and single stuck-open <b>faults.</b> The <b>sequences</b> are of minimum length, and can be produced either by software, by an external chip, or be a BIST-structure. Using the latter, the hardware overhead would be of the same magnitude as a conventional pseudorandom architecture...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method for static compaction of sequential circuit tests that {{are divided into}} independent test sequences. We propose an exact method based on the branch-and-bound approach. The search space for the algorithm is efficiently pruned at each step by determining the set of essential vectors, removing <b>faults</b> and <b>sequences</b> implementing the domination relationships and identifying equivalent search states. The method is tested on {{a large number of}} benchmark test sets. Experiments show that, unlike previous approaches, this method is capable of finding and proving globally optimal results for all the compaction benchmarks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDiagnosability is an {{important}} system property that determines at design stage how accurate any diagnostic reasoning can be on a partially observed system. A fault in a discrete-event system is diagnosable iff its occurrence can always be deduced from enough observations. It {{is well known that}} centralized diagnosability approaches lead to combinatorial explosion of the search space since they assume the existence of a monolithicmodel of the system. This is why very recently the distributed approaches for diagnosability began to be investigated, relying on local objects. On the other hand, diagnosis objectives are generalized from fault event to fault pattern that can represent multiple <b>faults,</b> repeating <b>fault,</b> <b>sequences</b> of significant events, repair of faults, etc. For pattern case, most existing approaches are centralized. In this paper, we propose a new distributed framework for pattern diagnosability. We first show how to recognize patterns by incrementally constructing local pattern recognizers through extended subsystems. Then we propose a structure called regional pattern verifier that is constructed from the subsystem where the pattern is completely recognized before showing how to abstract just the necessary and sufficient diagnosability information to further save the search space. Then the global consistency checking is based on another local structure called abstracted local twin checker to analyze pattern diagnosability. In this way, we avoid constructing global objects both for pattern recognition and for pattern diagnosability. The correctness of our distributed algorithm is theoretically proved and its efficiency experimentally demonstrated by the results of the implementation...|$|R
