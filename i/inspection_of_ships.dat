25|$|The Pacific-class patrol {{boats are}} used {{primarily}} for maritime surveillance and fisheries protection. They {{are often the}} only surveillance capability the operating nation has access to, and their presence has often deterred foreign fishing fleets. The ability to patrol the waters has provided boosts to economies through both fishing fines and improved negotiation stances when discussing foreign fishing rights and fees. As part of the patrol role, the Pacifics {{have been used for}} customs <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships,</b> and have stopped some smuggling and drug-running operations. Some nations charter the vessels out to other government agencies or private companies for salvage work, hydrographic surveying, or even tasks like helping to establish aquaculture farms. Pacific-class patrol boats have also seen use in humanitarian roles such as search-and-rescue, towing of disabled vessels, sea safety checks on vessels, and inter-island transport, particularly for disaster relief operations.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-1930s the Government of Canada {{began to}} take a serious look at the defence of {{the west coast of}} Canada. [...] The Empire of Japan had a growing {{influence}} over the Pacific and the idea of a war between Canada’s allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, with Japan seemed a likely scenario. In 1936 Major B.C.D. Treatt of the Coast Artillery School in England was asked to make recommendations for the defence of the west coast of British Columbia from an attack by sea. [...] In his report Major Treatt made many recommendations including the creation of four new coastal artillery forts to guard the Port of Vancouver. [...] The forts were located {{in such a way as}} to stop any ship or submarine from passing into Burrard Inlet.

40|$|California is {{particularly}} fortunate from a plant quarantine enforce-ment angle, as this state is entirely bOUT mountains, deserts, or ocean, which have {{to a large}} degree, prevented pest spread into this state by natural means, and commerce has been limited to definite points of entry where quarantine control is possible. All highways leading into the state are now covered by plant quarantine stations where all vehicles and their contents are inspected. Quarantine inspectors are available at all railroad stations, express depots, and terminal post-offices for the inspection of plants and plant products moving by common carrier. Quarantine inspectors are stationed at all maritime ports of entry for the <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> and their contents. Regardless of this elaborate protective system, satisfactory pro-tection will not be forthcoming unless public support is secured. Any protective program based on "thou shalt " methods will fail. People must be tactfully educated {{to the importance of}} quarantine protection {{regardless of whether or not}} they are directly interested in agriculture. The securing of favorable public opinion rests in large part upon the fairness and necessity of the law, and plant quarantine officials alone are responsible for quarantine restrictions being founded upon these neces-sary factors. Public approval will result in willing compliance. With-out this willingness on the part of the public to observe quarantine regulations, the desired protection will be secured only with the greates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStructural and {{machinery}} {{failures in the}} day-to-day ship operations may lead to major accidents, endangering crew and passengers onboard, posing {{a threat to the}} environment, damaging the ship itself and having a great impact in terms of business losses. In this respect, this paper presents the INCASS (Inspection Capabilities for Enhanced Ship Safety) project which aims bringing an innovative solution to the ship inspection regime through the introduction of enhanced inspection of ship structures, by integrating robotic-automated platforms for on-line or on-demand ship inspection activities and selecting the software and hardware tools that can implement or facilitate specific inspection tasks, to provide input to the Decision Support System (DSS). Enhanced <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> will also include ship structures {{and machinery}} monitoring with real time information using ‘intelligent’ sensors and incorporating structural and machinery risk analysis, using in-house structural/hydrodynamics and machinery computational tools. Moreover, condition based inspection tools and methodologies, reliability and criticality based maintenance are introduced. An enhanced central database handles ship structures and machinery data. The data is available to ship operators and are utilized by the DSS for ship structures and machinery for continuous monitoring and risk analysis of ship operations. The development and implementation of the INCASS system is shown {{in the case of a}} machinery system of a tanker ship. In this way the validation and testing of the INCASS framework will be achieved in realistic operational conditions...|$|E
40|$|Background: Actions at European Union {{level for}} International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 {{implementation}} and maritime transport {{were focused on}} two European projects implemented between 2006 and 2011. Method: Situation analysis and needs assessment were conducted, a Manual including European standards and best practice and training material was developed and training courses were delivered. Ship-to-port and port-to-port communication web-based network and database for recording IHR Ship Sanitation Certificates (SSC) were established. Results: Fifty pilot inspections based on the Manual were conducted on passenger ships. A total of 393 corrective actions were implemented according to recommendations given to Captains during pilot inspections. The web-based communication network of competent authorities at ports in EU Member States was used to manage 13 events/outbreaks (dengue fever, Legionnaires' disease, gastroenteritis, meningitis, varicella and measles). The European information database system was used for producing and recording 1018 IHR SSC by 156 inspectors in 6 countries {{in accordance with the}} WHO Handbook for <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> and issuance of SSC. Conclusions: Implementation of corrective actions after pilot inspections increased the level of compliance with the hygiene standards in passenger ships sailing within the EU waters and improved hygiene conditions. The communication tool contributed to improvement of outbreak identification and better management through rapid sharing of public health information, allowing a more timely and coordinated response. After the implementation of actions on passenger ships, the European Commission co-funded a Joint action that will expand the activities to all types of ships and chemical, biological and radio-nuclear threats (deliberate acts/accidental). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract — Many {{important}} missions for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), such as undersea <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> hulls, require integrated navigation, control, {{and motion}} planning in complex, 3 D environments. This paper describes a SLAM implementation using forward-looking sonar (FLS) {{data from a}} highly maneuverable, hovering AUV performing a ship hull inspection mission. The Exactly Sparse Extended Information Filter (ESEIF) algorithm is applied to perform SLAM based upon features manually selected within FLS images. The results demonstrate the ability to effectively map a ship hull in a challenging marine environment. This provides a foundation for future work in which real-time SLAM will be integrated with motion planning and control to achieve autonomous coverage <b>of</b> a complete <b>ship</b> hull. I...|$|R
