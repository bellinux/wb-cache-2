5|$|After the Boston Massacre, Adams {{and other}} town leaders met with Bernard's {{successor}} Governor Thomas Hutchinson and with Colonel William Dalrymple, the army commander, {{to demand the}} withdrawal of the troops. The situation remained explosive, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Adams wanted the soldiers to have a fair trial, because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the victim of an unjust occupation. He convinced his cousins John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend the soldiers, knowing that those Whigs would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal. However, Adams wrote essays condemning the outcome of the trials; he thought that the soldiers should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> of murder.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{government}} introduced {{monetary and}} fiscal policies {{to help keep}} the banks afloat during the financial crisis in 2008, and as a result the United Kingdom's national debt increased dramatically. The Government took majority shareholdings in Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland, both of which experienced financial difficulties. Large amounts of money were injected into several other banks, including newly merged HBOS-Lloyds TSB, which received £17billion. Domestic policies focusing on education, employment and health were introduced by the administration. The Labour Party was persuaded to give Gurkhas settlement rights in Britain by the campaign of actress Joanna Lumley and attracted criticism for its handling of the Scottish Government's release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahithe only person to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Brown was also dogged by allegations of bullying.|$|E
5|$|Several Einsatzgruppen leaders, {{including}} Ohlendorf, claimed at {{the trial}} to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews. To date no evidence {{has been found that}} such an order was ever issued. German prosecutor Alfred Streim noted that if such an order had been given, post-war courts would only have been able to convict the Einsatzgruppen leaders as accomplices to mass murder. However, if it could be established that the Einsatzgruppen had committed mass murder without orders, then they could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> as perpetrators of mass murder, and hence could have received stiffer sentences, including capital punishment.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, {{less than}} 1% of federal habeas corpus {{petitions}} involved death penalty sentences, although 21% involved life sentences. At that time about 23% <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> of homicide, about 39% <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> of other serious violent crimes, about 27% <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> of serious non-violent crimes, and about 12% <b>were</b> <b>convicted</b> of other offenses. These are almost exclusively state offenses and thus petitions filed by state prisoners.|$|R

50|$|It needs be {{said that}} the offence of indecent assault is egregious. Mr Masiya {{assaulted}} a nine-year-old child. The offence arouses public indignation. The regional court is obliged, when considering an appropriate punishment, to apply its mind to the nature and gravity of the offence of which Mr Masiya <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> and not merely look at the legal definition thereof. The fact that he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> of indecent assault does not automatically mean that the sentence to be imposed upon him should be more lenient than if he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> of rape.|$|R

In times of public emergency, the Governor may exercise emergency powers, including the mobilization of these military forces. In the area of criminal justice, the Governor may grant pardons to criminals, commute the sentences of prisoners, or remit fines and forfeitures imposed on people who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted,</b> jailed, or fined for violations of state laws.|$|E

25|$|After {{a person}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> of capital murder, a {{separate}} penalty phase {{is carried out}} using the same jury.

25|$|Critics {{say that}} the LEOBR makes it {{impossible}} to discipline or remove bad officers, even after they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> of felonies in the courts.
