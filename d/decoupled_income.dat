This study empirically evaluates the United States ’ experience with direct payments using a partial equilibrium model of agricultural production and trade. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} extent to which direct payments affect production and trade depends on crop specific factors in addition to the degree of coupling. Policy makers and trade negotiators must consider the relative level of support made to and the unique market situation of agricultural products covered by <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> support policies...|$|E
40|$|Abolishing {{a nearly}} 50 -year-old policy for rice price support, Korea adopted a new direct payment program in 2005. Making the {{transition}} to <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> payments has been governed by the need for operative and effective income safety nets and the WTO disciplines on domestic support. The program aims to deal with over-supply of rice while guarding against the threat of income insecurity. Integrated into a target price mechanism, the fixed and variable payments compensate part of farm income loss arising from adverse market conditions. Besides, the government launched a public stockholding measure to ensure food security. A review of previous studies highlights the fixed payment has no or at most minimal effects on production while the variable payment carries a fairly large effect on production. The share of direct payments in agricultural budget accounts for only 8 percent in 2004 and thus the Korean government envisions greater use of <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> support. decoupled payments, direct payments, policy reform, rice, Korea, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E

However, the increase in milk production is restricted by nutrient and manure policies in the Netherlands.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the first SAM analysis of the agricultural sector in Italy. A SAM of the Italian economy has been properly modified in order to focus the analysis on agriculture. Two type of analysis have been carried out: (i) a multiplier analysis, and (ii) an assessment of the distributive impacts of different agricultural policies. This paper proposes also a new method for disaggregating the institutional sectors and production factors in order to analyze income distribution within the economy, with special emphasis on the agricultural sector. Main results are: (i) "fully" <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> supporting schemes (transfers to agricultural households) are the most equitable interventions and determine a perfect targeting of the distributive effect on the relevant institutional sectors; (ii) "partially" <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> supporting interventions, as the ones implemented under the current CAP, are more effective than others in indirectly (i. e., through multiplier effects) generating positive impacts on the income of agricultural households; (iii) agricultural price support interventions show less desirable effects in terms of their distributive impacts: they are less effective as agricultural income-increasing policies and their distributive impacts are biased against poorer households both in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} extent to which <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> support {{measures}} in agriculture can have production implications both at the extensive and intensive margins.

Results show that though lump sum payments are not fully decoupled in the presence of risk and uncertainty, their effects on agricultural production are likely to be of a very small magnitude.

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} an introductory chapter and four individual papers. The papers are {{held together by}} concepts associated with price formation in real estate markets, differentiated goods and the local character of land and housing markets. The first two papers focus on the markets for land and agricultural property and the two succeeding studies on housing markets. The first study examines regional variations of Swedish agricultural land prices. The associated empirical model follows the form of earlier literature in testing the influence of expected returns from the current agricultural use of land {{and the potential for}} non-agricultural use on prices. The use of market transacted land and the inclusion of <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> support to farmers, among a set of agricultural and non-agricultural factors, distinguishes this study from earlier empirical work. The second paper relates to the first by its focus on <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> support, but here the analysis extends to the micro level and to the study of price formation in the market for agricultural property. The study applies a spatial multilevel model to study variations in price determinants across and within local and regional markets. The third paper is devoted to the analysis of housing prices and their relation to open landscape amenities. The spatial analysis employs two geographical databases containing single-family home sales and preserved open spaces. In order to address the local character of urban housing markets and intraurban heterogeneity in amenity valuations the study applies a geographically weighted regression approach. The last paper focuses on the market for second homes with a particular emphasis on urban-rural interrelations. The paper is motivated by a growing demand for natural amenities and by the awareness that urban areas are becoming increasingly attractive markets for second homes...|$|E
40|$|The 2003 CAP Reform left EU {{member states}} {{much room for}} {{national}} implementation. The farm group model EU-FARMIS is applied to quantify {{the effects of the}} reform and the impacts of the options for national implementation. The analysis is done for France and Germany because their implementation schemes adequately reflect the broad range of options. It is found that cereal and fodder maize production is reduced both in France and Germany. In contrast, the acreage of other arable fodder crops, of set-aside and of non-food crops is expanded. While bull fattening is substantially reduced in both countries, suckler cow production is extended in France due to partial decoupling, but reduced in Germany due to full <b>decoupling.</b> Sectoral <b>income</b> effects measured in Farm Net Value Added are similar. The regional implementation of decoupling in Germany induces a significant redistribution of direct payments and therefore causes differences in income effects depending on farm type, location and size.

40|$|The CAP {{reforms that}} the EU {{accepted}} in June 2003 will partially <b>decouple</b> direct <b>income</b> payments to farmers from production and make these payments conditional on cross-compliance. The reforms {{are driven by}} enlargement of EU membership, budgetary constraints, mounting pressures from diverse animal welfare, consumer and conservationist non-governmental organisations, and by external pressure for a less distorting agricultural policy. The paper addresses the issue whether these CAP reforms will contribute to an agreement in the Doha Development Round that will liberalize world trade in agricultural products. The paper argues that the 2003 CAP reforms have enabled the EU to participate more constructively in the multilateral trade negotiations compared to the Uruguay Round. However, the reforms do not create room for improved access to EU agricultural markets for third country producers. These countries insist on substantial tariff reductions that, if realized, will force down the relatively high internal EU prices, which would mean a further restructuring of the sector.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to work out some fundamental dynamic effects on agricultural structure, farm incomes, and efficiency that result from <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> payments, the transfer of payments together with a progressive payment cut. To do so, we apply the agent-based model AgriPoliS (Agri-cultural Policy Simulator). AgriPoliS is a normative spatial and dynamic model of regional agricul-tural structures that takes account of actions and interactions between a large number of individually acting farms. The model is calibrated to the region 'Hohenlohe' in Baden-Württemberg which is char-acterised by intensive livestock farming on the plains and extensive cattle and dairy farming in more remote valleys. The policy simulations show that impacts on structural change, competitiveness, and income distribution vary greatly depending on how the policy scheme is implemented. If direct pay-ments are completely decoupled from land use (no obligation to farm land) this has significant and lasting effects on the competitiveness of agriculture, structural change, farmers’ incomes and land-use. agricultural policy analysis, agent-based models, decoupling...|$|E
30|$|The {{findings}} of this study can be interpreted {{in a number of different}} ways. One may conclude that the positive association between <b>decoupled</b> payments and <b>income</b> risk is welcome as decoupled payments appear targeted towards farms with a higher risk profile. However, under an expected utility framework, the results are somewhat concerning. In this framework, the positive relationship suggests that decoupled payments induce farmers to take on greater risks in their market activities and that those farms with the largest payments are given an advantage in terms of their scope to manage market risks. The results suggest that some degree of asset integration is present and that the value of the decoupled payments influence risk management behaviour.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{report the}} results of a study of Mexican farm {{households}} using 1991 survey data and a smaller resurvey of some of the same households in 1993. One study goal was to empirically examine the relationship between assets and the output supply function. Using a production model focusing on capital as a productive input, they found that both the supply level and the responsiveness (elasticities) to changing input and output prices tend to depend on the farmer's net assets and on how productive assets are used. Regression analysis using data from the surveys shows that farmers who use productive assets such as machinery tend to be positively responsive to price changes, while those with no access to such assets are not. Another study goal was to monitor the condition of Mexican farmers in a rapidly changing policy environment. The 1991 survey data suggest that farmers with more limited use of capital inputs (low-CI) to grow principally corn and to grow fewer crops, on average, than the others. They aso had more problems getting credit and were less likely to use purchased inputs, such as seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides, or to use a tractor to prepare the soil. They tended to be less well-educated, and their land tended to be of lower quality. Results from the panel data showed conditions generally improving for the average farmer in the sample area between 1991 and 1993, during a period when agricultural reforms were implemented. Cropping patterns were more diversified, the average size of landholdings increased, the average farmer received more credit (in real terms), more farm households earned income from off-farm work, and more farmers used purchased inputs. Asset ownership and educational attainment also improved modestly. The very small low-CI group in this sample fared as well as, or better than, the other goroups. True, their level of educational achievement fell, and fewer of them had off-farm income than in 1991. But their use of credit, irrigation, machinery, and purchased inputs increased more than for other groups. The limited data are not proof of a causal link, {{but the fact that the}} goals are being met should at least ensure that adverse conditions are not undermining reform. Farmers that lacked access to productive assets did not respond as well to incentives or take advantage of the opportunities presented by reform and may need assistance, particularly to get access to credit markets. There may be a good argument for <b>decoupling</b> <b>income</b> supports from pricesupports for farmers, since income payments that are independent of the vagaries of production could provide a more stable signal of creditworthiness than price supports do. Possibly reorienting research and extension services more to the needs of low-CI producers could also improve the efficiency with which the sector ajdusts to new incentives. Hypotheses and tentative conclusions from this study will be explored further when more data are collected in 1995.

30|$|To {{test whether}} {{decoupled}} subsidy payments increase income risk on farms, we model income variability over 9  years for 927 farms in Ireland. This model supports {{the argument that}} decoupled payments and market income risk are closely and positively related.

The positive relationship between <b>decoupled</b> payments and <b>income</b> risk in Irish farms is similar to the payments and risk relationship found by Enjolras et al. (2014) for Italian farms. The small farm sizes and relatively large payment levels in both Italy and Ireland contribute to their similar risk patterns. This model also paints a picture of Irish farms that are likely to have highly variable incomes. These farms are likely to be large dairy farms with large outputs in addition to large and increasing subsidy payments and lower stocking rates.|$|R

40|$|Our paper {{focuses on}} the key element of the 2003 CAP reform: on the single farm payment (SFP). The basic aim was to {{decouple}} direct payment from production decisions. Because of the widespread agricultural policy reforms (support producers with the least possible distortions) and of the on-going WTO negotiations, {{this is an issue}} attracting significant attention on behalf of agricultural economists. Different tools and different methodologies have been employed in the effort to better understand and rank policy measures in terms of their production and trade effects. Most of the literature classifies measures based on implementation criteria. Our paper assesses the decoupled nature of the single farm payment (SFP) based on WTO and OECD criteria. The EU argues that the payments do not distort trade and therefore should be placed in the WTO green box as a <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> support. Based on our analysis, this seems to be possible, as the SFP meets not only the current WTO (design based) criteria of decoupling, but can also be qualified as effective fully decoupled system using the OECD terminology.

40|$|A crucial {{element of}} the post- 2013 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform is the ‘greening’ payment. ‘Greening’ is a {{compulsory}} {{part of the new}} direct payment scheme, accounting for 30 per cent of national ceilings. To qualify, farmers must undertake compulsory agricultural practices that are ‘beneficial for the climate and the environment’, comprising crop diversification, maintenance of existing permanent grassland and establishing an ecological focus area or putting in place ‘equivalent measures’. The payment had a controversial legislative passage, with several environmental groups questioning its pro-environmental effects and alleging that it was merely a clever way of disguising product support to European Union (EU) farmers, even before several of the provisions were watered down by the European Parliament. Despite these difficulties, throughout the process all parties assumed the ‘greening’ payment was compatible with the Green Box exemption in the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), so that it would be exempt from the EU’s domestic support reduction commitments in that Agreement. Specifically, it was understood that the payment would be <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> support under paragraph 6 of Annex 2 to the AoA and as such the payment had ‘no, or at most minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production’ under paragraph 1 of the same Annex (the so-called ‘fundamental requirement’) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experiment that {{was carried out}} in order to examine the decision making process of farmers in the Alentejo dryland region of Portugal. Cumulative Prospect Theory allows modeling the Alentejo dryland farmers' decision process, because when they decide what crops and livestock activities will produce the different results are appraised relatively to the initial wealth, which permits its appraisal in terms of gains and of losses. An inquiry is developed to study the Alentejo dryland farmers' preferences, which intend to determine risk preferences through a set of games. A discrete sequential stochastic programming model is developed to examine farmers' decision-making process face to the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy. The objective function, that maximizes the total value of the game, portrays the farmers' behavior face to risk and it is constituted by the set of functions (value function and probability weighting function) ranked upward. The total value of the games will be given by the sum of the positive and negative components. Model results show that Cumulative Prospect Theory portrays the Alentejo dryland farmers' decision-making process quite well. All the farmers produce durum wheat as main agricultural production and choose the maximum of number of cattle heads and sheep herds. The full <b>decoupling</b> of <b>income</b> payment from agricultural production leads to the abandonment of the durum wheat production. The beef cattle farmers keep their production and the sheep farmers reduce their herds drastically. The introduction of 50 % of sheep premium, proposed by the Portuguese Government, raises sheep production, accompanied of the increase of the pasture area. These results permit to conclude that the Portuguese Government's proposal is sufficiently cautious because, on the one hand, when associating to 100 % of suckler cow premium allows the use of the shares negotiated with European Union in 2003 and when associating to 50 % of sheep premium permit the maintenance of sheep herd. On the other hand, the Portuguese Government's proposal of crop subsidies not linked to agricultural production forces the farmers to choose alternative agricultural activities in the bad soils. Finally, the introduction of the area crop-yield insurance program associated with the new Common Agricultural Policy is an interesting alternative for the Alentejo dryland farmers, because the new Common Agricultural Policy only secure a minimum farm income level, while the insurance program permits making face to agricultural production variability and avoids the abandonment of the agricultural activity.

40|$|An Economic Assessment of the June 2003 Common Agricultural Policy Reform. The main {{innovation}} of the June 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{reform is}} to replace most market aids {{by a single}} direct payment per farm disconnected from production choices and levels (decoupling process), conditional on the respect of statutory environmental, food safety, animal health and animal welfare standards as well as good agronomic and environmental practices (cross-compliance process). This decoupled payment will be progressively reduced up {{to a maximum of}} 5 % and funds saved through this modulation mechanism will be switched from the first pillar of the CAP to a consolidated and strengthened rural development regulation confirmed as the second pillar of the CAP. In application of the subsidiary principle, important degrees of freedom are given to Member States in terms of market aids which would remained coupled and in defining cross-compliance national criteria. The objectives of this paper are the following. In a first stage, it presents the reform and proposes a qualitative analysis of measures adopted in June 2003. In a second stage, it provides a quantitative assessment of the reform for the European agricultural sector: impacts on supply, demand, exports and imports, prices, agricultural incomes, budget costs and welfare. In a third stage, the same exercise performed at the French scale allows us to give first responses to some interrogations raised by the <b>decoupling</b> of the <b>income</b> support policy. Attention is focused on three issues, i. e., land abandonment, extensification and the process of specialisation of farms and regions. We conclude by presenting our point of view on necessary evolutions of the CAP. ce est utilisé pour apporter une première réponse à certaines interrogations que pose le découplage. L'attention est centrée sur les questions d'abandon de terres, d'extensification et de spécialisation productive des exploitations et des régions. En conclusion, nous présentons quelques pistes souhaitables d'évolution de la PAC. Butault Jean-Pierre, Gohin Alexandre, Guyomard Hervé, Barkaoui Ahmed.

40|$|The United States and Canada {{share the}} longest common border and largest {{bilateral}} trading {{relationship in the}} world. Recent trading agreements [...] CUSTA, NAFTA and WTO [...] have enhanced trade by encouraging elimination of many remaining trade barriers. However, one cause for concern {{about the effectiveness of}} these trade agreements has been the frequency of Canadian-U. S. trade disputes over bilateral wheat and barley trade arrangements and trade flows. To some extent, these disputes have arisen because of differences in and lack of harmonization between the domestic and trade policies implemented by the two countries, although other political factors have also clearly been important causes of these disagreements. Since 1986, many dimensions of the agricultural policies of both countries have undergone radical changes, perhaps especially with respect to small grains and oilseeds. Here we provide assessments of whether important aspects of the two countries' domestic and trade grains and oilseeds have converged toward harmonization since implementation of the Canada-U. S. Free Trade Agreement in 1989. It {{should also be noted that}} many of the changes in each countries' agricultural policies cannot be attributed to free trade agreements. Rather, they reflect government responses to budgetary pressures, commitments under international trade agreements, changes in the relative political importance of rural and urban voters, and other factors. Changes in General Levels of Support Producer Subsidy Equivalents are indicators of the proportion of total revenues from sales of a crop resulting from government subsidies and other income support policies such as tariffs. U. S. producer subsidy equivalents for wheat and other grains have declined substantially from their 1993 - 1995 average levels as a result of the <b>decoupling</b> of <b>income</b> support payments under the 1996 FAIR Act. Similarly, the average wheat, other grains and oilseeds producer subsidy equivalents reported for Canada over the same period overstate current producer subsidy equivalents because of the elimination of Canadian grain transportation subsidies in 1995. Thus, generally, levels of government support for wheat and small grains have fallen quite considerably both in the U. S. and in Canada, indicating some movement in the direction of policy harmonization for these commodities. Farm Income Supports Over the past twenty years, farm income support in Canada has been delivered throughseveral different programs. Increasing budgetary pressures and a greater focus on market orientation led to the elimination of the Gross Revenue Insurance Program and the western grain transportation subsidies by 1996. The only current direct income support program is the Net Income Stabilization Account (NISA), which provides modest subsidies on interest rates paid to farmers on moneys they themselves pay into an income stabilization account. In the United States during the 1980 s and early 1990 s, changes were made to the deficiency payment/loan rate farm income support programs for wheat and small grains that tended to reduce the size of government payments to wheat and barley producers. Then, in 1996, the FAIR Act changed the entire farm income support mechanism, largely decoupling direct government payments to producers of those crops from current production decisions. In summary, the distortionary effects of Canadian and U. S. income support programs for wheat and other grains have been substantially curtailed, especially over the past three years. Similarly, the distortionary effects of Canadian income support programs for oilseeds have also been reduced toward the relatively modest levels associated with the U. S. oilseeds program, which has changed relatively little over the past ten years. There has been convergence in this area of farm policy. Grain Marketing and Export Subsidy Programs To the extent that U. S. export subsidy programs have become subject to GATT disciplines and funding for the U. S. export enhancement program has been reduced, the U. S. has moved toward a less distortionary set of trade policies for grains and oilseeds. The removal of freight subsidies has also moved Canada's grains trade policy in a less distortionary direction. However, Canada's export marketing board policy for wheat and barley (operated through the Canadian Wheat Board) has not changed in recent years. With respect to export credit guarantees, both countries operate roughly comparable programs, although under the GSM- 103 program, the U. S. is able to offer somewhat longer term (3 - 7 year) lines of credit. These programs have been subject only to relatively modest changes over the past ten years. On balance, there has probably been less harmonization of U. S. and Canadian export policies than of the two countries' income support programs. Thus, export policies, particularly the existence of the U. S. export enhancement program and the marketing powers of the CWB, will continue to be part of bilateral trade issues. agricultural policy, harmonization and convergence, grains, oilseeds, International Relations/Trade, Q 1,...|$|R
