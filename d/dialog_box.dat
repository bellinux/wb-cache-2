5|$|The {{gear and}} dial {{in the bottom}} left of the game screen {{is related to the}} Kotarou's Rewrite ability. The dial moves forward {{whenever}} this ability is used, and the outcome of certain scenes is determined by how much the dial has moved. Throughout most of the game, the text is presented in a <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> on the lower portion of the game screen, but this is changed for the Terra scenario, where the text is overlaid across the entire screen.|$|E
25|$|In {{versions}} of Windows prior to Vista, updates requiring a reboot would pop up a <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> every number of specified minutes requesting that users reboot their machines. Microsoft changed this <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> {{to allow the}} user to select {{a longer period of}} time (up to 4 hours) before re-prompting.

40|$|Recent keyboard-based {{alternatives}} to WIMP interfaces {{do not have}} good support for commands that require multiple parameters. We remedy this by extending a previous design and mimicking <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> to provide good visual feedback while still keeping the advantages of keyboard input. A laboratory study showed the new technique to be competitive with <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> on speed and error rate, but strongly preferred over <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> by experienced command line users. This is a marked improvement over the previous design, which was also preferred by the target user group but did not compete with <b>dialog</b> <b>boxes</b> in terms of performance.

After burning a CD from a playlist, one can select that playlist and bring up a <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> with several print options. The user can choose to print either a single album cover (for purchased iTunes albums) or a compilation cover (for user-created playlists). iTunes then automatically sets up a template with art on one side and track titles on the other.|$|E
25|$|FreeHand 3.0 {{sold for}} $595 in 1991. New {{features}} included resizable color, style, and layer panels including an Attributes menu. Also tighter precision {{of both the}} existing tools and aligning of objects. FH3 created compound Paths. Text could be converted to paths, applied to an ellipse, or made vertical. Carried over from version 1.0, FreeHand 3 suffered by having text entered into a <b>dialog</b> <b>box</b> instead of directly to the page. In October 1991, a 3.1 upgrade made FreeHand work with Mac OS 7 but additionally, it supported pressure-sensitive drawing which offered varying line widths with a users stroke. It improved element manipulation and added more import/export options.|$|E
