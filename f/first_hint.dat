5|$|The {{discovery}} image {{gave the}} <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> that comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 {{was an unusual}} comet, as it appeared to show multiple nuclei in an elongated region about 50arcseconds long and 10arcseconds wide. Brian G. Marsden of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams noted that the comet lay only about 4degrees from Jupiter as seen from Earth, and that although this could of course be a line of sight effect, its apparent motion in the sky suggested that it was physically close to it. Because of this, he suggested that the Shoemakers and David Levy had discovered the fragments of a comet that had been disrupted by Jupiter's gravity.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> of a {{localization}} appeared {{when the}} Agito trademark filed for European territories in September 2013. Later, at TGS 2013, Tabata said that Agito {{would definitely be}} localized, although he refused to clarify whether this meant it would be released in western territories. An official western release was confirmed by Square Enix at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. The plan for the international release was to first release Final Fantasy Type-0 HD so players in the west could get accustomed {{to the world and}} characters, then release Agito as a separate experience rather than a parallel release. With its discontinuance in Japan, Agitos western release was consequently cancelled, however it was stated that Type-0 Online was being considered for international release in place of Agito.|$|E
5|$|The {{vascular}} (blood) {{system can}} be impacted by solid tumors. Between 15 and 25 percent of deep vein thrombosis is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing a vein), {{and it may be}} the <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> that cancer is present. It causes swelling and pain in the legs, especially the calf, and (rarely) in the arms. The superior vena cava (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, causing superior vena cava syndrome, which can cause chest wall pain among other symptoms.|$|E

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> of {{his death}} to the Soviet people came at 7:15 p.m. Moscow Time, when the usual {{television}} programs were altered and a pop music concert {{was replaced by a}} documentary on Vladimir Lenin. On Vremya, the Soviet Union's state television newscast, the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally informal dress code. At first, Soviet citizens believed it was Andrei Kirilenko who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the October Revolution a few days earlier (he died in 1990). Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an ice hockey game on Channel Two with Tchaikovsky's Pathétique symphony. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television hosts. The television announcement was read by Igor Kirillov with tears in his eyes at 11 a.m. Moscow Time.|$|E
5|$|Olympus had {{a market}} {{capitalisation}} of ¥673billion on 13 October 2011, immediately before Woodford was sacked. By {{the end of}} the next day, the valuation had fallen to ¥422billion ($5.5billion). Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Nomura Securities, concerned about corporate governance issues at the company as well as its balance sheet, all immediately downgraded their stock ratings. Goldman Sachs, who had only upgraded its rating in a report dated 12 October, suspended its coverage after Woodford was removed from office. Nomura and JPMorgan announced on 20 October that their coverage of the company was halted. It was reported that Government of Singapore Investment Corp., the Singapore sovereign wealth fund {{which was one of the}} principal shareholders, immediately disposed of its 2percent stake on the <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> of scandal. The share price plunged several days running upon market fears that the shares would be delisted as the company could not meet its reporting mandatory deadline for its quarterly results; in the week to 18 November Nippon Life announced that its stake had been reduced by one-third, from 8.18 percent to 5.11 percent, because of the uncertainty; Mitsubishi reduced its stake from 10 percent to 7.6 percent.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> of its {{existence}} became public when Square Enix trademarked the name in May 2013. The game was first announced in the second September issue of Famitsu Weekly, and was demoed during TGS 2013. Originally scheduled for release {{in the winter of}} 2013, it was delayed due to development problems concerning environment sizes, which needed to be scaled down. It was rescheduled for the first quarter of 2014, then was pushed forward to spring of that year. Street clothes for the characters were offered as a pre-registration bonus, while a code to download outfits inspired by Kurasame, a supporting character from Type-0, were included in the final volume of the spin-off manga Final Fantasy Type-0 Side Story: Reaper of the Icy Blade. Pre-registration closed on May 7, 2013. Chapter delivery began the day after the game's official release on May 14, 2014. The base game was a free download, but players had the option of buying items, restore health and speeding up re-spawn time via microtransactions. The original version also reset individual character experience levels {{at the end of a}} playthrough, while an update in 2015 allowed players to carry over experience levels between playthroughs.|$|E

5000|$|Troll-Hoard: The Troll theme mingles {{with the}} Weakness motif, quite {{possibly}} to denote the Troll Hoard. The music is <b>first</b> <b>hinted</b> as Bilbo stalls the Trolls and later during the Troll-hoard sequence.|$|R
50|$|Ghetto University was <b>first</b> <b>hinted</b> by Runtown in 2014 {{during an}} {{interview}} with Vanguard. On 23 October 2015, the official release date for the album was announced via online media followed by its cover art.|$|R
500|$|... 1864: German {{pathologist}} Rudolf Virchow {{published a}} three-volume work on tumours that described {{a child with}} cerebral tuberous sclerosis and rhabdomyoma of the heart.

500|$|On October 17, the Yankees hired Bob Shawkey as manager; he {{was their}} fourth choice. Ruth had politicked {{for the job of}} player-manager, but [...] Ruppert and Barrow never seriously {{considered}} him for the position. Stout deemed this the <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> Ruth would have no future with the Yankees once he retired as a player. Shawkey, a former Yankees player and teammate of Ruth, would prove unable to command the slugger's respect.|$|E
500|$|Janet Jackson {{collaborated with}} former Prince {{associates}} Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on her third studio album Control (1986); the album's second single [...] "Nasty" [...] {{has been described}} as the origin of the new jack swing sound, a genre innovated by Teddy Riley. Riley's work on Keith Sweat's Make It Last Forever (1987), Guy's Guy (1988), and Bobby Brown's Don't Be Cruel (1998) made new jack swing a staple of contemporary R into the mid-1990s. New jack swing was a style and trend of vocal music, often featuring rapped verses and drum machines. The crossover appeal of early contemporary R artists in mainstream popular music, including works by Prince, Michael and Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Anita Baker, and The Pointer Sisters became a turning point for black artists in the industry, as their success [...] "was perhaps the <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> that the greater cosmopolitanism of a world market might produce some changes in the complexion of popular music." ...|$|E
5000|$|Marvel {{announced}} in early 2010 that the company's [...] "Siege" [...] storyline would {{be followed by}} the [...] "Heroic Age" [...] story-line. This was <b>first</b> <b>hinted</b> at in the story by Athena to Amadeus Cho.|$|R
5000|$|Details of the {{character}} of Brendan were <b>first</b> <b>hinted</b> in April 2010, when Marquess referred to Brendan as a [...] "very nasty man" [...] appearing from Cheryl's past. Later in April, Brendan's casting was officially announced.|$|R
50|$|In 1286, Kopp had {{its first}} {{documentary}} mention. It was then held by Prüm Abbey. The <b>first</b> <b>hints</b> of {{settlers in the}} area, however, date from Roman times (the Roman road between Trier and Cologne was right nearby).|$|R
500|$|Lyon {{was born}} on February 5, 1875, in Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois. [...] His family {{included}} his father, Captain Marcus Ward Lyon Sr.; his mother, Lydia Anna Lyon; and his two brothers, Henry S. Lyon and James W. Lyon. [...] Because of his father's military career, Lyon's family moved across the United States throughout his childhood and adolescence. [...] The <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> of the young Lyon's future scientific interests came while they were stationed at Watertown Arsenal, near Boston, Massachusetts, where he began collecting insects and animals from the local area. [...] No other details of his early life were documented until 1893, when he graduated from Rock Island High School—his father had evidently been re-stationed at Rock Island Arsenal at about this time. [...] He attended Brown University and completed his Ph.B. in 1897, which included training in biology. [...] In 1898, he began his graduate studies at George Washington University, obtaining his M.S. in 1900, his M.D. in 1902, and his Ph.D. in 1913.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, {{developed}} the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's [...] "Death of a Clown". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, [...] "Autumn Almanac", in early October. Backed with [...] "Mister Pleasant", the single became another Top 5 success for the group. Andy Miller points out that, despite its success, the single marks {{a turning point in}} the band's career—it would be their last entry into the UK Top Ten for three years: [...] "In retrospect, 'Autumn Almanac' marked the <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> of trouble for the Kinks. This glorious single, one of the greatest achievements of British 60s pop, was widely criticised at the time for being too similar to previous Davies efforts." [...] Nick Jones of Melody Maker asked, [...] "Is it time that Ray stopped writing about grey suburbanites going about their fairly unemotional daily business? ... Ray works to a formula, not a feeling, and it's becoming rather boring." [...] Disc jockey Mike Ahern called the song [...] "a load of old rubbish". Dave's second solo single, [...] "Susannah's Still Alive", was released in the UK on 24 November. It sold a modest 59,000 copies, but failed to reach the Top 10. Miller states that [...] "by the end of the year, the Kinks were rapidly sliding out of fashion".|$|E
2500|$|... in evening dress, 1865. The skirt has an overlayer {{of sheer}} fabric called {{illusion}} and is noticeably fuller in back than in front, the <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> of the styles that would {{prevail in the}} next decade.|$|E

50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>hints</b> of the {{new game}} line came in the Changeling: The Lost core book. At {{the back of the}} book was a word search, and after finding all the words and {{removing}} several Xs, all that was left was a cryptic message: thehuntersarrivetwothousandeight.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Rebel" [...] {{name was}} {{introduced}} by AMC in 1957 as a special model with a big V8 engine: the Rambler Rebel, the first factory-produced lightweight muscle car, and the <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> that muscle cars {{would be part of}} the company's future.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> of the {{new name}} {{is found in the}} Cantino planisphere (1502), which draws {{extensively}} on the 1501 mapping expedition. [...] The label Rio D Brasil ("River of Brazil") is given near Porto Seguro, just below the São Francisco River, almost certainly an indicator of a river where ample brazilwood could be found on its shores. That label is repeated on subsequent maps (e.g. Canerio map of 1505).|$|E
2500|$|Suffering {{from what}} he would {{describe}} as [...] "the <b>first</b> <b>hint</b> {{of one of the}} nervous attacks which even then beset me", and later as [...] "the first serious manifestation of the nervous attacks which have pursued me through my life", Caine quit his job with Murray and, arriving unannounced, went to live with his uncle and aunt, James and Catherine Teare in Maughold on the Isle of Man.|$|E
5000|$|DYA|Infrastructure was <b>first</b> <b>hinted</b> at in a whitepaper {{published}} by Microsoft MSDN in 2005 (superseded {{by a new}} submission in 2007). After a short development period, it was described in a (Dutch) book titled [...] "DYA|Infrastructuur - Architectuur voor de fundering van de IT".|$|R
25|$|The {{second season}} was <b>first</b> <b>hinted</b> on Network Ten in 2007 {{promoting}} a Mother Energy drink, featuring the character, Sandra Sultry (played by Katrina Mathers) and unknown voice actor as a frog. Along {{the bottom of}} the screen scrolled a web address for the Mother energy drink.|$|R
50|$|Axiom: Overdrive started {{development}} in March 2006 and was <b>first</b> <b>hinted</b> at in May 2006 by Reflexive CEO Lars Brubaker who revealed {{in an interview}} with gaming website Gamasutra they had a new Xbox 360 game currently in-development. The game was officially announced on November 6, 2007.|$|R
