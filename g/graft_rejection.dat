25|$|One way of {{reducing}} the risk of rejection is to use a technique called deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK). In a DALK graft, only the outermost epithelium and the main bulk of the cornea, the stroma, are replaced; the person's rearmost endothelium layer and the Descemet's membrane are left, giving some additional structural integrity to the postgraft cornea. Furthermore, it is possible to transplant freeze-dried donor tissue. The freeze-drying process ensures this tissue is dead, so there is no chance of rejection. Research from two trials in Iran provide low to moderate evidence that <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> is more likely to occur in penetrating keratoplasty than in DALK, though the likelihood for graft failure were similar with both procedures.|$|E
25|$|After a liver transplantation, {{there are}} three types of <b>graft</b> <b>{{rejection}}</b> that may occur. They include hyperacute rejection, acute rejection and chronic rejection. Hyperacute rejection is caused by preformed anti-donor antibodies. It {{is characterized by the}} binding of these antibodies to antigens on vascular endothelial cells. Complement activation is involved and the effect is usually profound. Hyperacute rejection happens within minutes to hours after the transplant procedure. Unlike hyperacute rejection, which is B cell mediated, acute rejection is mediated by T cells. It involves direct cytotoxicity and cytokine mediated pathways. Acute rejection is the most common and the primary target of immunosuppressive agents. Acute rejection is usually seen within days or weeks of the transplant. Chronic rejection is the presence of any sign and symptom of rejection after 1 year. The cause of chronic rejection is still unknown but an acute rejection is a strong predictor of chronic rejections.|$|E
50|$|The {{role of the}} thymus in {{the immune}} {{response}} was also identified shortly after the discovery of bursa’s role in antibody responses. In thymectomized animals, the ability to reject allografts, and to mount delayed hypersensitivity responses, was drastically reduced. By the mid-1960s, immunologists were convinced that there were indeed two separate arms of the immune system: one dealing exclusively with the production of circulating antibodies (humoral immunity), and another that {{is involved in the}} delayed hypersensitivity-type reactions and <b>graft</b> <b>rejections</b> (cell-mediated immunity).|$|R
40|$|Murine class I major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) antigens are polymorphic ell-surface glyco-proteins originally described as transplantation an-tigens responsible for mediating allogenic skin <b>graft</b> <b>rejections</b> (Snell et al. 1976). These complex molecules have {{also been shown to}} play an important role in immune responses by presenting antigen to cytolytic T cells, allowing them to recognize foreign antigens in an MHC-restricted fashion (Zinkernagel and Doherty 1979). More current studies propose that foreign an-tigens in the form of peptidic fragments are presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in association with the class I molecule (Maryanski et al. 1986; Townsen...|$|R

Here we show that a major histocompatibility complex class I binding peptide, derived from the glycoprotein (GP 33 peptide) of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), specifically tolerized naive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) when administered three times intraperitoneally in incomplete Freund's adjuvants. However, {{in the presence of}} GP 33 -specific memory CTL in LCMV-primed mice, the same treatment had a general immunosuppressive effect on unrelated third-party antigen-specific T cell responses and caused severe immunopathological damage to the spleen...|$|R
25|$|Mehra, whose {{research}} has covered {{various aspects of}} histocompatibility and immunogenetics, started {{his work on the}} subjects during his post-doctoral days in Europe, and at John Hansen's laboratory in Seattle, where he used DNA-based technologies of HLA analysis to study the immunogenetic aspects of rheumatoid arthritis. Later, in India, he studied HLA-linked genes and identified that a subtype of HLA-DR2 carried on a unique class II haplotype made humans susceptible to diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis. He also differentiated the Indian rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients from the Western Caucasian patients by demonstrating that the former showed a pattern of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ association and these studies helped in characterizing the Indian population with regard to its genomic diversity. His group demonstrated that HLA genes with specific pockets in the peptide binding region controlled the severity of mycobacterial diseases, which was a first-time discovery. Together with Ajay Kumar Baranwal of AIIMS Delhi and Brian D. Tait of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, he carried out a research project, Antibody Repertoire and graft outcome following solid organ transplantation, which assisted in the prediction of <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> and had significance in organ and bone marrow transplantation. He also guided a team of scientists in a project based on polymorphic immunomodulatory genes for developing molecular medicine to combat infectious, autoimmune and rheumatological diseases. His {{research has}} been documented by way of several articles; ResearchGate an online repository of scientific articles has listed 287 of them. Besides, he has published a book, The HLA Complex in Biology and Medicine: A Resource Book, and has contributed chapters to books published by other researchers, including Textbook of Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Allied and Molecular Medicine. His researches have been cited by many authors, too.|$|E

40|$|Immune {{responses}} against pathogens {{require that}} microbial components promote the activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Autoimmune diseases and <b>graft</b> <b>rejections</b> {{occur in the}} absence of pathogens; in these conditions, endogenous molecules, the so-called ‘innate adjuvants', activate APCs. Necrotic cells contain and release innate adjuvants; necrotic cells also release high-mobility group B 1 protein (HMGB 1), an abundant and conserved constituent of vertebrate nuclei. Here, we show that necrotic HMGB 1 −/− cells have a reduced ability to activate APCs, and HMGB 1 blockade reduces the activation induced by necrotic wild-type cell supernatants. In vivo, HMGB 1 enhances the primary antibody responses to soluble antigens and transforms poorly immunogenic apoptotic lymphoma cells into efficient vaccines...|$|R
40|$|AIM—On {{the basis}} of {{finalised}} data from the Corneal Transplant Follow up Study to identify and quantify factors influencing corneal graft outcome in terms of <b>graft</b> survival, <b>rejection,</b> visual acuity, and astigmatism.  METHODS—Multifactorial analysis of 2777  grafts registered by the UK Transplant Support Service from July 1987  to June 1991.  RESULTS—Several recipient factors influencing <b>graft</b> survival, <b>rejection,</b> and visual acuity were identified, but no donor factors. Of the operative factors amenable to change, mixed suturing was associated with reduced graft survival, and larger grafts with increased risk of rejection but better visual acuity when surviving. There was increased risk of rejection with poor matching at HLA class I antigens, but mismatched HLA-DR <b>grafts</b> suffered less <b>rejection</b> than those with zero HLA-DR mismatches. Recipient age below 10  years was associated with increased risk of both <b>rejection</b> and <b>graft</b> failure. However, whereas increasing age above 10  years {{was not associated with}} differential graft survival, it was significantly associated with decreasing risk of rejection.  CONCLUSIONS—While confirming possible benefits of HLA-A and B matching, the expense and delay involved in awaiting matched HLA-DR tissue is unlikely to be justified. Other donor factors are unrelated to graft outcome following screening of tissue by eye banks. The highest rates of <b>graft</b> failure and <b>rejection</b> happen in the early postoperative period, and factors influencing visual outcome are also apparent at this stage. ...|$|R

2500|$|Historical {{perspective}} {{is important to}} an understanding of how the HLA were systematized. In organ transplant the goal was to explain <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> for recipients, and of course, to prevent future rejection.

In the same way bacterial antigens can cause inflammatory response, HLA antigens from the donor of the organ caused an inflammatory response when placed in a recipient. This is called allograft [...] rejection.|$|E

2500|$|A {{compatible}} donor is found by doing additional HLA-testing {{from the blood}} of potential donors. The HLA genes fall in two categories (Type I and Type II). In general, mismatches of the Type-I genes (i.e. HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C) {{increase the risk of}} <b>graft</b> <b>rejection.</b> [...] A mismatch of an HLA Type II gene (i.e. HLA-DR, or HLA-DQB1) increases the risk of graft-versus-host disease. [...] In addition a genetic mismatch as small as a single DNA base pair is significant so perfect matches require knowledge of the exact DNA sequence of these genes for both donor and recipient. [...] Leading transplant centers currently perform testing for all five of these HLA genes before declaring that a donor and recipient are HLA-identical.|$|E

40|$|Graft atheromatosis is {{the most}} {{important}} limiting factor on long-term survival after heart transplantation. Histologically it involves so-called myointimal proliferation occurring in either circumscribed or diffuse form. Endothelial dysfunction with impaired release of nitric oxide represents an early stage of graft atheromatosis. Progression of the disease typically leads to a diffuse narrowing of the coronary tree; however, focal stenoses may also occur. Endothelial dysfunction results in a decrease in physiological coronary flow reserve during exercise, whereas pharmacological flow reserve after papaverine or adenosine administration is maintained. This functional disturbance can be enhanced by transplantation-related (e. g., vascular <b>graft</b> <b>rejections,</b> cytomegalovirus infections, etc.) as well as by cardiovascular risk factors (e. g., hypercholesterolemia, hypertension). The occurrence of endothelial dysfunction and graft atheromatosis may be delayed, although probably not prevented, by elimination of risk factors and optimization of immunosuppressive treatment. Preliminary data suggest that long-term administration of the calcium-antagonist diltiazem may have a protective effect...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Vascular {{replacement}} in {{vital organs}} is sometimes necessary {{for human life}} for example because of atherosclerosis. Blood vessel tissue engineering is applied for autologous transplantations to avoid <b>graft</b> <b>rejections.</b> Stem cells are used for blood vessel tissue engineering {{because they are the}} origin of smooth muscle cells, endo-thelial cells and fibroblasts. This paper shows that bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be induced to differen-tiate into the early stage of smooth muscle cells by using 0. 01 µM retinoic acid. The differentiation of BMSCs to smooth muscle cells was detected by the expression of smooth muscle alpha actin (SM α-actin), the earliest smooth muscle cell marker. The SM α-actin marker expression was demonstrated using indirect immunofluorescence technique and Western blot analysis. The induction of BMSC to form early stages of smooth muscle cells in this study is appropriate for blood vessel tissue engineering because the early stage smooth muscle cells may be stimulated to develop vascular walls with endothelial cells using a co-culture system...|$|R

40|$|Background: Kidney {{transplantation}} (KT) is {{the treatment}} of choice for end-stage renal disease patients. The spouse is a major donor in living KT. Clinical outcomes of spousal donor KT are not inferior to those of living related donor KT. In this study, we compared clinical outcomes between ABO-compatible (ABOc) and ABO-incompatible (ABOi) spousal donor KTs. Methods: Thirty-two cases of spousal donor KT performed from January 2011 to August 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-one ABOc KTs and 11 ABOi KTs were performed. We investigated patient survival, <b>graft</b> survival, acute <b>rejection,</b> <b>graft</b> function, and complications. Results: During follow-up, patient and graft survival rates were 100 % in both groups.

40|$|Herbal {{medicines}} {{have been}} used for centuries to treat different illnesses. Among more than 20, 000 herbal medicines available for humans,a limited number have sufficiently been studied and numerous remained to be investigated for their efficacy in treating human diseases. A number of herbal products are in use for their immunosuppressive effects. This capacity of herbs may have useful applications in immune-mediated disorders including autoimmune diseases and organ transplant rejection. Plants such as Salvia miltiorrhiza and Tripterygium wilfordii has been shown to reduce inflammatory cytokines and mediators, indicating their value in the treatment of acute <b>graft</b> <b>rejections</b> and autoimmunity. Tanacetum parthenium inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory mediators from macrophages and lymphocytes and Curcuma longa down regulates the expression of cytokines and chemokines as well as the transcription factor NF-kappaB.

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} (TE) is {{a concept}} that was first emerged in the early 1990 s to provide solutions to severe injured tissues and/or organs [1]. The dream was to be able to restore and replace the damaged tissue with an engineered version which would ultimately help overcome problems such as donor shortages, <b>graft</b> <b>rejections,</b> and inflammatory responses following transplantation. While an incredible amount of progress has been made, suggesting that TE concept is viable, we are still not able to overcome major obstacles. In TE, there are two main strategies that researchers have adopted: (1) cell-based, where cells are been manipulated to create their own environment before transplanted to the host, and (2) scaffold-based, where an extracellular matrix is created to mimic in vivo structures. TE approaches for ocular tissues are available and have indeed come a long way, over the last decades; however more clinically relevant ocular tissue substitutes are needed. Figure 1 highlights the importance of TE in ocular applications and indicates the avenues available based on each tissue. [ [...] . ...|$|R

Better knowledge of the portion of the H- 2 antigen recognized by the different mAbs would be helpful in delineating epitope structures. Three external domains of MHC class I genes are encoded in separate exons of the gene.

40|$|Virus {{replication}} and progression {{to disease}} in transplant patients {{is determined by}} patient-, graft- and virus-specific factors. This complex interaction is modulated by the net state of immunosuppression {{and its impact on}} virus-specific cellular immunity. Due to the increasing potency of immunosuppressive regimens, <b>graft</b> <b>rejections</b> have decreased, but susceptibility to infections has increased. Therefore, cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains the most important viral pathogen posttransplant despite availability of effective antiviral drugs and validated strategies for prophylactic, preemptive and therapeutic intervention. CMV replication can affect almost every organ system, with frequent recurrences and increasing rates of antiviral resistance. Together with indirect long-term effects, CMV significantly reduces graft and patient survival after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The human polyomavirus called BK virus (BKV), on the other hand, only recently surfaced as pathogen with organ tropism largely limited to the reno-urinary tract, manifesting as polyomavirus-associated nephropathy in kidney transplant and hemorrhagic cystitis in hematopoetic stem cell transplant patients. No licensed anti-polyoma viral drugs are available, and treatment relies mainly on improving immune functions to regain control over BKV replication.
