5|$|Cagney's {{two films}} of 1938, Boy Meets Girl and Angels with Dirty Faces, both costarred Pat O'Brien. The former had Cagney {{in a comedy}} role, and {{received}} mixed reviews. Warner Bros. had allowed Cagney his change of pace, but was keen {{to get him back}} to playing tough guys, which was more lucrative. Ironically, the script for Angels was one that Cagney had hoped to <b>do</b> <b>while</b> with Grand National, but the studio had been unable to secure funding.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did {{this because he}} had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated over what to <b>do</b> <b>while</b> William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a {{potential}} Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since {{he was born in}} what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an era when political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choices than they are today, Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to <b>do.</b> <b>While</b> returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, he stopped in Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature. The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.|$|E
5|$|In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut {{for a large}} invited audience; it was {{remarked that}} his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his {{personal}} bearing was admirable {{for a man of}} eighty-six. He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to <b>do.</b> <b>While</b> there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921. His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the Cimetière de Montparnasse. Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Simović named Maček as Deputy Prime Minister {{once again}} in the new government, but Maček was {{reluctant}} and remained in Zagreb while he decided what to <b>do.</b> <b>While</b> he considered the coup had been an entirely Serbian initiative aimed at both Prince Paul and the Cvetković–Maček Agreement, he decided that he needed to show HSS support for the new government and that joining it was necessary. On 4 April he travelled to Belgrade and accepted the post, on several conditions; that the new government respect the Cvetković–Maček Agreement and expand the autonomy of the Banovina Croatia in some respects, that the new government respect the country's accession to the Tripartite Pact, and that one Serb and one Croat temporarily assume the role of regents. That same day exiled Croatian politician and Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić called for Croats to start an uprising against the government over his Radio Velebit program based in Italy.|$|E

25|$|St. James' Gate in Dublin was {{traditionally}} a main {{starting point}} for Irish pilgrims to begin their journey on the Camino de Santiago (Way of St. James).

25|$|JavaScript {{supports}} {{much of the}} {{structured programming}} syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, <b>do</b> <b>while</b> loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: JavaScript originally had only function scoping with var. ECMAScript 2015 added keywords let and const for block scoping, meaning JavaScript now has both function and block scoping. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allows the semicolons that would normally terminate statements to be omitted.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that {{transmitters}} with vacuum tubes are better able to survive lightning strikes than transistor transmitters <b>do.</b> <b>While</b> it was commonly believed that at RF power levels above approximately 20 kilowatts, vacuum tubes were more efficient than solid-state circuits, this is no longer the case, especially in medium wave (AM broadcast) service where solid-state transmitters at nearly all power levels have measurably higher efficiency. FM broadcast transmitters with solid-state power amplifiers up to approximately 15kW also show better overall power efficiency than tube-based power amplifiers.|$|E

25|$|The {{growth of}} eSports in South Korea {{is thought to}} have been {{influenced}} by the mass building of broadband internet networks following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It is also thought that the high unemployment rate at the time caused many people to look for things to <b>do</b> <b>while</b> out of work. Instrumental to this growth of eSports in South Korea was the prevalence of the Komany-style internet café/LAN gaming center, known as a PC bang. The Korean e-Sports Association, an arm of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, was founded in 2000 to promote and regulate eSports in the country.|$|E

25|$|While {{in command}} of the Jane, Rodgers' strong and {{determined}} character was made evident during one of his voyages navigating the North Sea. Adverse winter winds had carried the vessel off course, the ship's provisions were almost exhausted, and three of his crewmen had frozen to death in one night, while most of the others had lapsed into hopeless despair. When Rodgers ordered some of the crew to go aloft to secure the ice encrusted rigging, they refused. Outraged at their desolation, Rodgers stripped off his jacket and shirt and, before going aloft, told the insubordinate crew to watch what a man could <b>do.</b> <b>While</b> he climbed the frozen rigging bare-chested, the crew, awe struck, immediately rose to his aid and in little time they secured the faltering rigging. Under the grim circumstances of their situation Rodgers put the matter behind him and days later they safely reached port.|$|E

25|$|On June 23, 2010, President Obama {{announced}} that he would nominate Petraeus to succeed General Stanley A. McChrystal as the commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. The change of command was prompted by McChrystal's comments about the Obama administration and its policies in Afghanistan during an interview with Rolling Stone magazine. The nomination was technically a positional step down from his position as commander of Central Command, however the President said that he believed that he was the best man for the job. After being confirmed by the Senate on June 30, Petraeus formally assumed command on July 4. During the assumption of command remarks, Petraeus provided his vision and goals to NATO, the members of his command, and his Afghan partners. As he was known to <b>do</b> <b>while</b> the Commander in Iraq, Petraeus delivered his first Letter to the Troops on the same day he assumed command.|$|E
25|$|As {{children}} grow older they slowly grow into their roles within their society. Both genders learn from adults {{how to do}} certain things that later will help the tribe. For example, girls learn how to make doll clothing, which teaches them how to make real garments. Boys, on the other hand, are given miniature bows for them to practice hunting very small game with. Children at young ages are integrated into society evenly. They are given small tasks based on their age to follow. Boys practice hunting and follow men on some hunting events. Having little boys follow the men into hunting events lets them learn firsthand how to hunt, receive tips on what to <b>do</b> <b>while</b> hunting, and gain experience for when they do events when they are older. Girls learn the same way. They watch the women of the society do their daily routines and mimic them on smaller scales. Like the example given above with the doll making. Having a little girl make the clothes for themselves teaches them how to make clothing they would want in the future.|$|E
25|$|Assignment statements, in {{imperative}} paradigm, {{perform an}} operation on information located in memory and store {{the results in}} memory for later use. High-level imperative languages, in addition, permit the evaluation of complex expressions, which may consist {{of a combination of}} arithmetic operations and function evaluations, and the assignment of the resulting value to memory. Looping statements (as in while loops, <b>do</b> <b>while</b> loops, and for loops) allow a sequence of statements to be executed multiple times. Loops can either execute the statements they contain a predefined number of times, or they can execute them repeatedly until some condition changes. Conditional branching statements allow a sequence of statements to be executed only if some condition is met. Otherwise, the statements are skipped and the execution sequence continues from the statement following them. Unconditional branching statements allow an execution sequence to be transferred to another part of a program. These include the jump (called goto in many languages), switch, and the subprogram, subroutine, or procedure call (which usually returns to the next statement after the call).|$|E
