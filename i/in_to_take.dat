5|$|After Japan's {{surrender}} in 1945, China {{announced its}} intent to reclaim its {{rights to the}} Walled City. Refugees from mainland China because of the Chinese Civil War post 1945 poured <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of British protection (the Walled City is a Chinese territory but surrounded by British lands), and 2,000 squatters occupied the Walled City by 1947. After a failed attempt to drive them out in 1948, the British adopted a 'hands-off' policy in most matters concerning the Walled City.|$|E

5|$|Derrick then {{returned}} to his platoon, where he gathered his first and third sections in preparation for {{an assault on the}} three remaining machine gun posts in the area. Attacking the posts, Derrick personally rushed forward on four separate occasions and threw his grenades at a range of about , before all three were silenced. Derrick's platoon held their position that night, before the 2/48th Battalion moved <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Sattelberg unopposed the following morning. The battalion commander insisted that Derrick personally hoist the Australian flag over the town; it was raised at 10:00 on 25 November 1943.|$|E

5|$|In 281 BC, at {{the request}} of the Greek city of Tarentum, Pyrrhus, the King of the Greek state of Epirus, went with an army of 25,500 men and 20 {{elephants}} to Italy to help fight the Romans. The Romans had succeeded in conquering most of Italy and were now moving <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the Greek cities in Magna Graecia. After arriving in Italy in 280 BC, Pyrrhus defeated a Roman army at the Battle of Heraclea, near Tarentum. Pyrrhus repeated his success against Romans by defeating another army at the Battle of Asculum.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 July the Japanese {{attacked}} the main position Kokoda. There were only 80 men from 'B' Company left at that time, and armed only with small arms and a few Bren light machine guns, they were {{no match for the}} assaulting Japanese. Casualties on both sides were high as the Australians resorted to hand-to-hand combat, and the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel William Owen, who had flown <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over the battalion following Templeton's death, was killed while organising the withdrawal. It became clear that Kokoda was lost and the following morning, under the cover of a dense mist, with the PIB's commanding officer, Major William Watson, assuming temporary command, the survivors abandoned the position and fell back towards the village of Deniki, a mile or so back along the Kokoda Track towards Isurava.|$|E
5|$|The Devil Children {{titles are}} {{role-playing}} {{games in which}} the player battles against demons. While the player controls a devil child, that character does not directly fight themselves; instead, they send in their allied demons {{to fight against the}} opponents. This was changed in Book of Fire and Book of Ice, where the devil children are able to fight by using cards. If one of the player's demons falls in battle, another is automatically sent <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the first one's place. To recruit new demons to their party, the player needs to choose to talk to the demon instead of fighting it, with the demon's response mostly being based on chance. The player can trade demons with other players, which is required to be able to collect all demon types. While the player's character gains experience points, their allied demons do not; to increase their power, the player needs to fuse their demons with each other.|$|E

50|$|Jack: {{the first}} jack played in {{succession}} forces the next player <b>to</b> <b>take</b> two cards from {{the stock and}} forfeit their turn. A second jack in succession forces the next player <b>in</b> turn <b>to</b> <b>take</b> four cards; three jacks in succession force the next player <b>in</b> succession <b>to</b> <b>take</b> six cards, and four jacks in succession force the next player <b>to</b> <b>take</b> eight cards.|$|R
5|$|The {{next major}} {{incident}} was on 22 July, when the British administrative and military headquarters {{located in the}} King David Hotel were bombed. No members of the division were directly involved, but the Royal Engineers of the 9th Airborne Squadron were called <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> charge {{of the search for}} survivors and secure the part of the building left standing. Over the next three days they located six survivors and the bodies of ninety-one victims. To assist in the search for those responsible, the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions moved into Jerusalem on 23July.|$|E
5|$|While {{the weather}} was fine, the wind whipped up {{to such an extent}} at pitch level that the ball was taken out of its proper flight on occasion. In the third minute Sheffield United were nearly a goal up after Arsenal goalkeeper Wilson dropped the ball to the ground and fumbled at it trying to pick it up. United players Barclay and Dodds both charged <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage, but an Arsenal defender cleared the ball away before they could turn the {{opportunity}} into a goal. During the first fifteen minutes, United were the superior team with the work of their forwards only failing against the work of Arsenal's full backs and goalkeeper with Wilson continuing to looking not entirely safe. Arsenal's defenders eventually settled with Crayston and Copping stepping up for their team.|$|E
5|$|The Kinks' {{second wave}} of {{popularity}} remained at a peak with State of Confusion, but that success began to fade, a trend that also affected their British rock contemporaries the Rolling Stones and the Who. During {{the second half of}} 1983, Ray Davies started work on an ambitious solo film project, Return to Waterloo, about a London commuter who daydreams that he is a serial murderer. The film gave actor Tim Roth a significant early role. Davies' commitment to writing, directing and scoring the new work caused tension in his relationship with his brother. Another problem was the stormy end of the relationship between Ray Davies and Chrissie Hynde. The old feud between Dave Davies and drummer Mick Avory also re-ignited. Davies eventually refused to work with Avory, and called for him to be replaced by Bob Henrit, former drummer of Argent (of which Jim Rodford had also been a member). Avory left the band, and Henrit was brought <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his place. Ray Davies, who was still on amiable terms with Avory, invited him to manage Konk Studios. Avory accepted, and continued to serve as a producer and occasional contributor on later Kinks albums.|$|E

25|$|As {{the bison}} {{disappeared}} from the Canadian west, cattle ranches moved <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> their place. Ranchers {{were among the most}} successful early settlers.

Like most hired hands, Ware was American, but the industry was dominated by powerful British- and Ontario-born magnates such as Patrick Burns.|$|E
