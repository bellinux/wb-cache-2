50|$|<b>International</b> <b>reply</b> <b>coupons</b> (in French, Coupons-Reponse Internationaux) {{are printed}} in blue ink on paper {{that has the}} letters “UPU” in large {{characters}} in the watermark. The front of each coupon is printed in French. The reverse side of the coupon, which has text relating to its use, is printed in German, English, Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, or Russian. Under Universal Postal Union’s regulations, participating member countries {{are not required to}} place a control stamp or postmark on the <b>international</b> <b>reply</b> <b>coupons</b> that they sell. Therefore, some foreign issue <b>reply</b> <b>coupons</b> that are tendered for redemption may bear the name of the issuing country (generally in French) rather than the optional control stamp or postmark.|$|R
50|$|During this time, in {{the summer}} of 1919, he decided to stop working for other people and set up his own small office on 27 School street, Boston, coming up with ideas and writing to people he knew in Europe trying to sell them as opportunities. A few weeks later, Ponzi {{received}} a letter from a company in Spain asking about the advertising catalog. Inside the envelope was an <b>international</b> <b>reply</b> <b>coupon</b> (IRC), something which he had never seen before. He asked about the IRC and found a weakness in the system which would, in theory, allow him to make money.|$|E
5000|$|The Nairobi Model was an <b>international</b> <b>reply</b> <b>coupon</b> printed by the Universal Postal Union {{which is}} {{approximately}} 3.75 inches by 6 inches {{and had an}} expiration date of December 31, 2013. This model was designed by Rob Van Goor, a graphic artist from the Luxembourg Post. It was selected from among 10 designs presented by Universal Postal Union member countries. Van Goor interpreted {{the theme of the}} contest - [...] "The Postage Stamp: A Vehicle for Exchange" [...] - by depicting the world being cradled by a hand and the perforated outline of a postage stamp.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, {{official}} postcards {{have one}} side dedicated {{exclusively to the}} address, {{and the other side}} for the content, though commemorative picture postcards and private picture postcards also exist. In Japan today, two particular idiosyncratic postcard customs exist: New Year's Day postcards (nengajō) and s (ōfuku-hagaki). New Year's Day postcards serve as greeting cards, similar to Western Christmas cards, while return postcards function similarly to a self-addressed stamped envelope, allowing one to receive a reply without burdening the addressee with postage fees. Return postcards consist of a single double-size sheet, and cost double the price of a usual postcard - one addresses and writes one half as a usual postcard, writes one's own address on the return card, leaving the other side blank for the reply, then folds and sends. Return postcards are most frequently encountered by non-Japanese in the context of making reservations at certain locations that only accept reservations by return postcard, notably at Saihō-ji (moss temple). For overseas purposes, an <b>international</b> <b>reply</b> <b>coupon</b> is used instead.|$|E

5000|$|The use of {{specimen}} overprints is {{not restricted}} to postage stamps. It has also been used on revenue stamps and postal stationery, including <b>International</b> <b>Reply</b> <b>Coupons.</b> A unique use was by the Portuguese U.P.U. officials {{at the end of}} the 19th and early 20th centuries when they hand-stamped postal stationery from Cuba with the term [...] "ULTRAMAR" [...] (overseas) to prevent postal usage.|$|R
50|$|SASEs cannot {{easily be}} used for {{international}} mail, since senders rarely have supplies of mint foreign stamps.

50|$|The {{scheme is}} named after Charles Ponzi, who became notorious for using the {{technique}} in the 1920s. The idea, present in novels (for example, Charles Dickens' 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and 1857 novel Little Dorrit each described such a scheme), was performed in real life by Ponzi, and became well known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money he took in. Ponzi's original scheme {{was based on the}} arbitrage of <b>international</b> <b>reply</b> <b>coupons</b> for postage stamps; however, he soon diverted investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and himself.|$|R
5000|$|As this {{affected}} {{the cost of}} the delivery of periodicals, the UPU devised a new [...] "threshold" [...] system, which it later implemented in 1991. The system sets separate letter and periodical rates for countries which receive at least 150 tonnes of mail annually. For countries with less mail, the original flat rate is still retained. The United States has negotiated a separate terminal dues formula with thirteen European countries that includes a rate per piece plus a rate per kilogram; it has a similar arrangement with Canada. The UPU also operates the system of <b>International</b> <b>Reply</b> <b>Coupons</b> and addresses concerns with ETOEs.|$|R

Many shortwave listeners (known as [...] "program listeners") desire nothing more than music and news from a broadcaster; however, for DXers a QSL collection is tangible proof {{of what they have}} heard. Some listeners use pre-printed forms if they are unfamiliar with the language spoken by station personnel. While major international broadcasters have not required return postage for a QSL, the growing popularity of e-mailed reception reports and e-QSLs has largely eliminated the necessity for <b>international</b> <b>reply</b> <b>coupons</b> (IRCs), mint stamps from the verifying station's country or [...] "green stamps" [...] (US dollar bills).|$|R

The first 30 volumes are also available digitally, on DVD or USB flash drive. In particular, the magazine deals with Irish postal history. It encompasses, among others, old postal routes, the transport of mail on board overseas steamboats, national and international postal fees, and the Maltese Cross postmarks used in Ireland. Documentation of the postal history of the Irish independence movement {{is also an important}} field. Furthermore, the FAI researches the use of postmark machines, military postal history, postal censorship and post from prisoners of war, Irish postal stationery, <b>international</b> <b>reply</b> <b>coupons,</b> and revenue stamps.|$|R

[...] During the volatility of 1947 and 1948, British postal services deteriorated and were replaced by ad hoc interim services prior to the partition and the establishment of the State of Israel. Just before the formal end to the British Mandate over Palestine, the Mandatory government destroyed the existing stocks of postage stamps and had Palestine removed from the World Postal Union. A total of 104 stamps bearing the name [...] "Palestine" [...] were issued by the British between 1918 and 1942.|$|R
5000|$|In the meantime, Ponzi {{had hired}} a {{publicity}} agent, William McMasters.

50|$|Barron then {{noted that}} {{to cover the}} {{investments}} made with the Securities Exchange Company, 160 million postal <b>reply</b> <b>coupons</b> {{would have to be}} in circulation. However, only about 27,000 actually were. The United States Post Office stated that postal <b>reply</b> <b>coupons</b> were not being bought in quantity at home or abroad. The gross profit margin in percent on buying and selling each IRC was colossal, but the overhead required to handle the purchase and redemption of these items, which were of extremely low cost and were sold individually, would have exceeded the gross profit. Barron noted that if Ponzi really was doing what he claimed to do, he would effectively be profiting at the expense of a government—either the governments where he bought the coupons or the United States government. For this reason, Barron argued that even if Ponzi's operation was legitimate, it was immoral {{to take advantage of a}} government in this manner.|$|R
50|$|Undaunted, Ponzi {{set up a}} {{stock company}} to raise this money from the public. He also went to several of his friends in Boston and promised that he would double their {{investment}} in 90 days. He later shortened this to 45 days at 50% interest, thus doubling one's money in three months. This was in an environment when banks were paying 5% annual interest. The great returns available from postal <b>reply</b> <b>coupons,</b> he explained to them, made such incredible profits easy. Some people invested and were paid off as promised, receiving $750 interest on initial investments of $1,250.|$|R
