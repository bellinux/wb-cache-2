5|$|Il ritorno, says Carter, {{is clearly}} {{influenced}} by Monteverdi's earlier works. Penelope's lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from L'Arianna, while the martial episodes recall Il combattimento. Stile concitato is {{prominent in the}} fight scenes and in the slaying of Penelope's suitors. In L'incoronazione, Monteverdi represents moods and situations by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; stile concitato represents rage. There is continuing debate about {{how much of the}} extant L'incoronazione music is Monteverdi's original, and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> the work of others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).|$|E

5|$|Cyclotorna monocentra moths feed on meat ant broods. The larvae {{of these}} moths are parasites to leafhoppers and {{will move to}} meat ant colonies to {{complete}} their development, where they will proceed to consume the brood; the females lay many eggs near ant trails which {{are close to the}} leafhoppers tended by ants. Other observations show that the Iphierga macarista larvae are scavengers in meat ant nests, while Sphallomorpha beetles live in burrows near nests of meat ants, where the larvae capture and prey on workers passing by. The larvae of the spitfire sawfly and Pseudoperga guerini are able to regurgitate a fluid against the meat ant if they are getting attacked by them; depending on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> regurgitated, an ant will either walk away and clean itself or become fatally affected by it. Lizards such as the thorny dragon, which is a sit and wait predator, consume meat ants, but other lizards which eat Iridomyrmex ants usually reject this species.|$|E

25|$|Most of Paolo's {{music was}} {{published}} in modern editions in the 1970s, making it easily available, {{and as a result}} he has received more than the usual amount of critical attention.

25|$|Altruism is {{constantly}} referenced by proponents of organ gifting. Authors such as Sahlins (1972), incorporated Maussian concepts of gifting and reciprocity and expanded them to describe three {{different types of}} transactions: generalized reciprocity (system of giving without taking account of <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> given), balanced reciprocity (direct exchange, expectation of equal value), and negative reciprocity (obtaining something for nothing). Individuals engage in {{each one of these}} transaction depending on the person they are exchanging with and the social distance involved. Sahlins' (1972) work has pointed to the need to examine the different types of relationships behind gift-giving and the characteristics of the transaction. In the case of generalized reciprocity, altruistic relationships are present and the expectation of reciprocity is indefinite.|$|E

25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} conservation {{problem is that}} the area is the second most populated natural protected area in Mexico, with severe problems with poverty. This creates a need to balance conservation efforts with local subsistence needs. One important aspect of this is to manage forest resources so that local woodcutters can make a living while controlling <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> cut. However, mass migration out of the region has almost halved the population of the Querétaro biosphere to about 50,000 people since it was declared. This has taken pressure off of local natural resources, as agriculture, livestock production and logging lessen. Many {{of the people who have}} left are in the United States and send money back home. This money has spurred the building of larger homes and the proliferation of pick up trucks, many with U.S. license plates. It has also allowed for the change to gas over firewood for cooking, but garbage has become a problem. However, overall the depopulation has been positive for the recuperation of the biosphere.|$|E

Drug use in the first trimester is the most harmful to the fetus in terms of neurological and developmental outcome. The effects of PCE later in a child's life are poorly understood; there is little information about the effects of in utero cocaine exposure on children over age five. Some studies have found PCE-related differences in height and weight while others have not; these differences are generally gone or small by the time children are school age. Much is still not known about what factors may exist to aid children who were exposed to cocaine in utero. It is unknown if the effects of PCE are increased once children reach adolescence, or whether the neural rewiring that occurs during this developmental period attenuates the effects. A review of 27 studies performed between 2006 and 2012 found that cognitive development was mildly to moderately affected in PCE adolescents, but it was not clear how important these effects were in practical terms.|$|E

25|$|It is {{impossible}} to tell {{how much of the}} content of these traditional biographies is fiction and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> fact. Large parts clearly are mere deduction from Juvenal's writings, but some elements appear more substantial. Juvenal never mentions a period of exile in his life, yet it appears in every extant traditional biography. Many scholars think the idea to be a later invention; the Satires do display some knowledge of Egypt and Britain, and it is thought that this gave rise to the tradition that Juvenal was exiled. Others, however - particularly Gilbert Highet - regard the exile as factual, and these scholars also supply a concrete date for the exile: 93 AD until 96, when Nerva became emperor. They argue that a reference to Juvenal in one of Martial's poems, which is dated to 92, {{is impossible}} if, at this stage Juvenal was already in exile, or, had served his time in exile, since in that case, Martial would not have wished to antagonise Domitian by mentioning such a persona non grata as Juvenal. If Juvenal was exiled, he would have lost his patrimony, and this may explain the consistent descriptions {{of the life of the}} client he bemoans in the Satires.|$|E
