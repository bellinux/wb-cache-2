40|$|The use of Ibsen dramas in {{training}} theatre professionals in most cultures cannot be overlooked {{due to the}} nature, and impact of Ibsen s works on contemporary societies and his contribution {{to the development of}} modern drama. This thesis studies the educational use of Ibsen dramas in Ghanaian theatre institutions and considers ways in which Ibsen dramas could be promoted to Ghanaian audiences. With a blend of European, American and African theories coupled with interviews of key educators and analysis of themes in Ibsen dramas the research reviews the colonial roots of Ghana s educational system to examine how Ibsen has and is being taught in Ghana. Observing that Ibsen does not move outside the academic institutions, the research further proposes ways in which Ibsen dramas can be adapted for Ghanaian audiences by examining a Nigerian adaptation of A <b>Doll</b> <b>s</b> <b>House,</b> and indigenous Ghanaian performance forms of storytelling and concert party theatre...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Henrik Ibsen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} Western dramatists in China. It was he who inspired the Chinese to create a completely new style of art: the Spoken Drama. For the last few decades, however, Ibsen scholars in China have been only focused on the playwright s iconoclast impact, and the Ibsen after the 1980 s was seldom studied. My thesis intends to present the contemporary Ibsen in China, particularly on his intercultural traveling between the East and the West in the context of ideological confusion, globalization and cultural consumerism. Through the analyses of four Ibsen productions, I want to point out that nowadays Ibsen has been thoroughly Sinicized, not only Chinese in content, but also localized in style. The increased communications between cultures have not at all reduced the political importance of Ibsen. Surprisingly, this Intercultural Ibsen has become a strategic agent in power contests, not only between the Chinese intellectuals and the ruling Party, but also between the Oriental and the Occidental. The study consists of three chapters. After a literary review of Ibsen reception in the past one hundred years, the first chapter concentrates on the 1983 production of Peer Gynt, connecting this performance with the re-emergence of what the scholars later called, modern China s Second Enlightenment. The second chapter studies the 1998 <b>Doll</b> <b>s</b> <b>House.</b> Through the Norwegian Nora s imprisonment in a Chinese courtyard, the production reveals a power shifting between the West and the East. The third chapter compares the different fate between An Enemy of the People and Hedda Gabler in Ibsen Year 2006. By elaborating the performances back stage among scholars, government officials and ordinary audience, these productions mapped out a power counterbalance on domestic as well as international levels. The research illustrates that though influenced by cultural consumerism and information explosion, the culture-crossing Ibsen in contemporary China is still dominated by the political correctness...|$|E
40|$|This solo exhibtion {{presented}} a retrospective selection of works made between 1995 and 2004 that overall addressed {{the nature of}} perception and its cultural and psychological duality. The nature of perception, what is hidden and revealed, {{has long been a}} preoccupation of Boggon's, and this work was a manifestation of that cultural and psychological duality. ‘Within’, a Georgian grandfather clock, alluded to history, family and tradition, while a lower door and periscope allowed a view within that revealed an internal discord, as host to interior scenes that played with ideas of morality and deception, secrecy and make believe. ‘The White House’, an old 1970 <b>s</b> <b>dolls</b> <b>house,</b> was renovated on the outside and animated internally; looking in through the windows, scenes are enacted by way of moving images, providing glimpses of ordinary occurrences. The piece ‘Drive In, Check Out’, a wooden crate, contained a miniature drive in cinema, a barren, remote car park containing model cars. The small screen projected disjointed footage taken from films and newsreels, as set within a set. The process involved research into drive-in ciinemas, film, notions around escape through transportation (mentally and physically). Many components were needed and this resulted in research in terms of sourcing very particular items such as replica cars, LCD screen and also in learning new techinical skills in terms of editing and equipment. Other works shown in the exhibition include ‘Offshoot’, 2004, DVD; ‘Box’, 1995, cardboard box, model window; ‘If I could see through you’, 2004, wardrobe, mixed media; and a series of ’Drawings’, 2004, rotary pen on paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{existence}} of a U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> price bubble. Specifically, we focus on the time series statistical relationship between real U. <b>S.</b> and regional <b>house</b> prices and a number of fundamental economic variables related to house prices using quarterly data from the first quarter of 1975 through the second-quarter of 2005, the approximate end of the recent house price rise. We find that U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices and our fundamental economic variables are unit root variables that are not cointegrated, even after allowing for structural breaks. Thus our analysis confirms the existence of an interesting and important anomaly suggested by some prior research on this period. We then discuss the implications of our results for the common practice of using error correction models of house prices, and for the current policy debate regarding the causes of the recent U. <b>S.</b> <b>housing</b> market collapse.

40|$|Abstract: The U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> {{price boom}} {{has been linked}} to an {{unsustainable}} easing of mortgage lending standards. However, time series models of U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices ignore changes in mortgage lending standards and perform poorly in the 2000 s. We incorporate data on mortgage standards for first time buyers into a model of US house prices based on the (inverted) demand for housing services. Our first time buyer loan-to-value series is weakly exogenous. It captures shifts in the supply of mortgage credit and not expectations of future house price appreciation. Using this series, we estimate a U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> price equation that yields a stable long-run cointegrating relationship, plausible income and price elasticities and an improved fit. Our findings suggest that swings in credit standards played a major, if not the major, role in driving the recent boom and bust in U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices...|$|R

40|$|Housing {{and land}} prices in China have {{increased}} continuously and dramatically {{for the past}} two decades. In fact, housing price growth has significantly outstripped income growth.

40|$|The key aim of {{this project}} carried out by Terry Burke and Robin Zhakarov {{was to develop a}} small number of {{scenarios}} about the nature of Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing</b> system at a specified future date. As such, the project involved the development of a significant exercise in strategic foresight about alternative futures for Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing,</b> the conditions and policies which would support these futures, and the implications for research and policy. The project drew on the literature and experiences of the field of foresight studies, a creative field of investigation, analysis and postulation to develop scenarios that help prepare organisations and nations for possibilities and challenges. The project applied foresight methodology to the issues of Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> broader <b>housing</b> system, examining the effect of major economic, technological and social trends, and exploring alternative policy pathways on a future housing system. In analysing the implications of scenarios, questions of winners and losers, impact on ecologically sustainable communities and implications for and impacts of government interventions are explored. A secondary aim of the project was to run a collaborative dialogue across a wide range of players in housing policy in all sectors, particularly those within AHURI. Questions that emerged from this project are: What do we understand are the key trends and influences on Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing</b> system? What are the interrelationships between key trends and influences on Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing</b> system?
