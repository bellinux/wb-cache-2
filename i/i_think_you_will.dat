The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

Although {{the courts}} later confiscated the film {{based on a}} citizen's complaint, the initial {{audience}} reaction was positive. After seeing the film, director Sergio Leone {{wrote a letter to}} Deodato, which stated, [...] " [...] Dear Ruggero, what a movie! The second part is a masterpiece of cinematographic realism, but everything seems so real that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> get in trouble with all the world." [...] In the ten days before it was seized, the film had grossed approximately $2 million; in Japan it grossed $21 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of that time after E.T. the Extraterrestrial. Internationally, it grossed $200 million.|$|E

2500|$|Clarence said to Burbank: “I don’t {{think you}} will ever make a real success in the nursery {{business}} because your heart is not in it.

2500|$|Van Gogh {{arrived in}} Auvers {{in late spring}} as pea plants and wheat fields on gently sloping hills ripened for harvest. [...] The area bustled as migrant workers from France and Brussels descended on the area for the harvest. [...] Partial to rural life, Van Gogh {{strongly}} portrayed {{the beauty of the}} Auvers country side. [...] He wrote his brother, [...] "I have one study of old thatched roofs with a field of peas in flower in the foreground and some wheat, the background of hills, a study which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> like." ...|$|E

Sentiment is not a valid consideration in determining questions of national security. We have pride in ourselves and in our past, {{but we do not}} rest our case on any presumed ground of gratitude owing us from the Nation. The bended knee is not a tradition of our Corps. If the Marine as a fighting man has not made a case for himself after 170 years of service, he must go. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> agree with me that he has earned the right to depart with dignity and honor, not by subjugation to the status of uselessness and servility planned for him by the War Department." ...|$|E
