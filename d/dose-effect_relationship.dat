50|$|The only <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship</b> {{available}} {{are those}} of miners cohorts (for much higher exposures), exposed to radon. Studies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors are less informative (the exposure to radon is chronic, localized, and the ionizing radiations are alpha rays).Although low-exposed miners experienced exposures comparable to long-term residence in high-radon dwellings, the mean cumulative exposure among miners is approximately 30-fold higher than that associated with long-term residency in a typical home. Moreover, the smoking is a significant confounding factor in all miners' studies. It can be concluded from miner studies that when the radon exposure in dwellings compares to that in mines (above 1000 Bq/m3), radon is a proven health hazard; but in the 1980s very little was known on the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship,</b> both theoretically and statistical.|$|E

There were marked differences in <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships,</b> both {{as a function of}} drug and of behavioral measure. Amphetamine produced a linear increase in rotational behavior over a wide range of doses (the highest effective dose was 76. 8 times the lowest), but a linear increase in locomotor crossover activity over only a narrow dose range (the highest effective dose was only four times the lowest). In contrast, for cocaine, the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> for the two behaviors were very similar, but for both behaviors the effective dose range was quite narrow, the highest effective dose being only between two and four times the lowest.

30|$|Another {{possibility}} is {{to define the}} maximum deposition of Bt maize pollen on host plants in field margins at anthesis that can be tolerated without entailing adverse effects on the larvae. It requires that <b>dose–effect</b> <b>relationships</b> of Bt maize pollen on non-target Lepidoptera are known and that worst-case pollen depositions are taken into account. The <b>dose–effect</b> <b>relationships</b> should be species- and toxin specific and consider that the toxin content in the pollen of Bt maize events can vary just as the sensitivity of non-target lepidopteran larvae. The hereof calculated maximum pollen deposition which does not harm non-target Lepidoptera constitutes a LoC at the exposure level for a specific Bt maize event (Fig.  3 b).|$|R

50|$|Pantethine is {{available}} in the United States as a dietary supplement because of evidence of its health benefits for lowering elevated LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, and raising HDL-cholesterol (the 'good' cholesterol). In multiple clinical trials of patients with elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, total and LDL cholesterol were decreased by an average of 12%, triglycerides decreased by 19%, and HDL cholesterol was increased by 9%. These clinical trials were conducted with daily intakes ranging from 600 to 1200 mg/day. Within this dose range {{there is no evidence of}} a <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship,</b> i.e. changes in lipid concentrations overlapped across the range of doses. Direct dose-response evidence is not available because no trial tested more than one dose. A few trials conducted in Japan tested 300 mg/day and reported decreases in total cholesterol of about 4%, increases in HDL-cholesterol of 5% and inconsistent results for triglycerides. Most of the literature on pantethine and lipids is 20-30 years old, but recent carefully controlled trials of 600 and 900 mg/d doses have shown similar statistically significant lowering of LDL cholesterol in individuals with greatly or moderately elevated levels of blood lipids.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} whether {{inferior rectus muscle}} (IRM) thickness, the degree of adipose change in the IRM, smoking status, and the previous history of orbital radiotherapy can predict the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship</b> regarding unilateral IRM recession in thyroid eye disease (TED). Methods. Twenty-five patients were retrospectively reviewed. We calculated the largest IRM cross-sectional area and evaluated the degree of adipose change in the IRM using magnetic resonance imaging. The degree of adipose change and smoking status were classified using grading scales (0 – 3); previous orbital radiotherapy was graded as 0 when a history was not available and 1 when it was available. The correlation between the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship</b> and the hypothesized predictive factors was evaluated using stepwise multiple regression analysis. Results. The multiple regression model, {{with the exception of}} the history of the previous orbital radiotherapy, estimated a significant <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship</b> for the parameters evaluated (YDOSE-EFFECT = 0. 013 XIRM[*]AREA[*][*]− 0. 222 XADIPOSE[*][*]− 0. 102 XSMOKING + 1. 694; r = 0. 668; adjusted r 2 = 0. 367; P = 0. 005).

40|$|The present {{investigation}} validated a time-sampling {{method of scoring}} formalin-induced pain-specific behaviours. The method improves efficiency by at least a factor of five, and also provides measures of other aspects of behaviour, without the loss of statistical power of the results. Formalin-induced behaviours were examined over {{the entire range of}} commonly used formalin concentrations, for a prolonged period of time. The pain response increased dose-dependently up to 2 % formalin in the first phase and up to 10 % in the second phase if behaviour was scored for at least 90 minutes postformalin. Significant residual pain occurred only at 10 % formalin. When morphine <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> were examined at varying formalin concentrations, there was a systematic rightward shift in the morphine <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> up to about 2 % formalin, at which point, further increases in formalin concentration did not produce any further shift, and morphine appeared to noncompetitively antagonize formal in-induced pain.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{delineate}} the individual pelvic floor muscles {{considered to be}} involved in anorectal toxicity and to investigate <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> for fecal incontinence-related complaints after prostate radiotherapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 48 patients treated for localized prostate cancer, the internal anal sphincter (IAS) muscle, the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle, the puborectalis muscle (PRM), and the levator ani muscles (LAM) in addition to the anal wall (Awall) and rectal wall (Rwall) were retrospectively delineated on planning computed tomography scans. Dose parameters were obtained and compared between patients with and without fecal urgency, incontinence, and frequency. Dose-effect curves were constructed. Finally, the effect of an endorectal balloon, which was applied in 28 patients, was investigated. RESULTS: The total volume of the pelvic floor muscles together was about three times that of the Awall. The PRM was exposed to the highest RT dose, whereas the EAS received the lowest dose. Several anal and rectal dose parameters, as well as doses to all separate pelvic floor muscles, were associated with urgency, while incontinence was associated mainly with doses to the EAS and PRM. Based on the dose-effect curves, the following constraints regarding mean doses could be deduced {{to reduce the risk of}} urgency: </= 30 Gy to the IAS; </= 10 Gy to the EAS; </= 50 Gy to the PRM; and </= 40 Gy to the LAM. No <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> for frequency were observed. Patients treated with an endorectal balloon reported significantly less urgency and incontinence, while their treatment plans showed significantly lower doses to the Awall, Rwall, and all pelvic floor muscles. CONCLUSIONS: Incontinence-related complaints show specific <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> to individual pelvic floor muscles. Dose constraints for each muscle can be identified for RT planning. When only the Awall is delineated, substantial components of the continence apparatus are excluded...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the prevalence {{and severity of}} clinical adverse events (AEs) and treatment-related risk factors in childhood cancer survivors treated with cranial radiation therapy (CRT), {{with the aim of}} assessing <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships.</b> The retrospective study cohort consisted of 1362 Dutch childhood cancer survivors, of whom 285 were treated with CRT delivered as brain irradiation (BI), as part of craniospinal irradiation (CSI), and as total body irradiation (TBI). Individual CRT doses were converted into the equivalent dose in 2 -Gy fractions (EQD(2)). Survivors had received their diagnoses between 1966 and 1996 and survived at least 5 years after diagnosis. A complete inventory of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3. 0 AEs was available from our hospital-based late-effect follow-up program. We used multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses to examine the EQD(2) in relation to the prevalence and severity of AEs, correcting for sex, age at diagnosis, follow-up time, and the treatment-related risk factors surgery and chemotherapy. There was a high prevalence of AEs in the CRT group; over 80 % of survivors had more than 1 AE, and almost half had at least 5 AEs, both representing significant increases in number of AEs compared with survivors not treated with CRT. Additionally, the proportion of severe, life-threatening, or disabling AEs was significantly higher in the CRT group. The most frequent AEs were alopecia and cognitive, endocrine, metabolic, and neurologic events. Using the EQD(2), we found significant <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> for these and other AEs. Our results confirm that CRT increases the prevalence and severity of AEs in childhood cancer survivors.

40|$|AbstractThe {{function}} of A 1 - and A 2 a-adenosine receptors {{in the control}} of vascular resistance and in the modulation of light-evoked neuronal activity was investigated in the isolated perfused cat eye. The A 1 agonist CCPA, the A 1 antagonist CPT, the A 2 a agonist CGS 21680 and the A 2 antagonist DMPX were used. The agents were applied intra-arterially at concentrations in the low nanomolar to micromolar range during rod-selective photic stimulation. The flow rate of perfusate, reflecting vascular resistance and the light-evoked optic nerve response (ONR) were recorded. Our results show a vasodilating effect of both A 1 and A 2 agonists and a vasoconstricting effect of the respective antagonists. The <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> are suggestive, however, of an A 2 a receptor-mediated mechanism. The amplitude of the ONR-ON component was decreased during application of both adenosine-agonists. Analysis of the <b>dose–effect</b> <b>relationships</b> and the blockade of the CCPA-induced decrease by CPT suggests that inhibition is mediated by A 1 receptors. However, CGS 21680 -mediated inhibition cannot be explained by unspecific binding at A 1 receptors alone and suggests the involvement of inhibitory A 2 a receptors...|$|R
