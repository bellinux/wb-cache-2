5|$|A {{variety of}} microgenres have {{subsequently}} emerged, often labeling bands according to traits that deviate from regular grindcore, including goregrind, focused on themes of gore, and pornogrind, fixated on pornographic lyrical themes. Another offshoot is electrogrind (or cybergrind) which incorporates electronic music <b>elements</b> <b>such</b> as sampling and programmed drums. Although influential within hardcore and extreme metal, grindcore remains an underground form of music.|$|E
5|$|Another {{legacy of}} Sahure is his pyramid complex: its layout became the {{template}} for all subsequent pyramid complexes of the Old Kingdom {{and some of}} its architectural <b>elements,</b> <b>such</b> as its palmiform columns, became hallmarks of Egyptian architecture.|$|E
5|$|But {{theories}} of either complete independence of or complete {{dependence on the}} synoptics are largely rejected in current scholarship: on the one hand, <b>elements</b> <b>such</b> as distinctive Johannine language, the lengthy discourses, and the prologue on the Logos, are clearly unique to John; on the other, John clearly shares a multitude of episodes with the other three.|$|E

5|$|Derived {{mainly from}} heraldic traditions in France and the United Kingdom, Canadian {{heraldry}} also incorporates distinctly Canadian symbols, especially native flora and fauna, {{references to the}} First Nations and other aboriginal peoples of Canada, and uniquely Canadian <b>elements</b> <b>such</b> as the Canadian pale, derived from the Canadian flag. A unique system of cadency is used for daughters inheriting arms, and a special symbol for United Empire Loyalists.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{heavier than}} iron were {{produced}} in supernovae through the r-process and in AGB stars through the s-process, {{both of which}} involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei. <b>Elements</b> <b>such</b> as lead formed largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} how England was settled with Anglo-Saxon people between c. 450 and 1066 AD, making {{the country a}} land of villages. Estate boundaries from this period survive in features such as sunken lanes and banks. The Scandinavian conquest of much of England from the late 9th century added more villages, though many with Scandinavian placename <b>elements</b> <b>such</b> as -by ('village') may simply have been renamed Saxon settlements.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, {{the first}} report on {{attempted}} isolation of the element was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium (using its lighter homologs technetium and rhenium for comparison) and removing unwanted contaminating <b>elements</b> <b>such</b> as the trivalent actinides, the group 5 elements, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to dissolved gases, hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic <b>elements</b> <b>such</b> as mercury, arsenic, boron, and antimony. These chemicals precipitate {{as the water}} cools, and can cause environmental damage if released. The modern practice of injecting cooled geothermal fluids back into the Earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk.|$|E
5|$|Most ZnO has n-type character, even in {{the absence}} of {{intentional}} doping. Nonstoichiometry is typically the origin of n-type character, but the subject remains controversial. An alternative explanation has been proposed, based on theoretical calculations, that unintentional substitutional hydrogen impurities are responsible. Controllable n-type doping is easily achieved by substituting Zn with group-III <b>elements</b> <b>such</b> as Al, Ga, In or by substituting oxygen with group-VII elements chlorine or iodine.|$|E

5|$|Note: While {{the general}} plot of Invisible War follows a {{distinct}} path, many <b>elements</b> <b>such</b> as faction alliances and character interactions {{are subject to}} the player's decisions. The game also offers several subplots and explanations which the player may or may not encounter, depending on their actions within the game. This synopsis concentrates on the main, unavoidable plot thread of the game.|$|E
5|$|On {{the early}} Earth, {{reactive}} <b>elements,</b> <b>such</b> as iron and uranium, existed in a reduced form that would react with any free oxygen produced by photosynthesising organisms. Oxygen {{would not be}} able to build up in the atmosphere until all the iron had rusted (producing banded iron formations), and all the other reactive elements had been oxidised.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{requirements}} for the existence of life around a star is the ability of that star to produce a terrestrial planet of sufficient mass to sustain it. Various <b>elements,</b> <b>such</b> as iron, magnesium, titanium, carbon, oxygen, silicon, and others, are required to produce habitable planets, and the concentration and ratios of these vary throughout the galaxy.|$|E
