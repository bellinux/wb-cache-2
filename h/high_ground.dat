5|$|The placename Upminster {{is first}} {{recorded}} in 1062 as Upmynstre and is {{recorded in the}} 1086 Domesday Book as Upmunstra. It is formed from Old English upp and mynster, meaning the large church on <b>high</b> <b>ground.</b> The <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> of St Laurence's parish church being {{in relation to the}} valley of the River Ingrebourne and the Upminster Bridge over the river shares the name. An alternative explanation suggests the upp could refer to the geographical relationship to a church at Barking or Tilbury in Anglo-Saxon times.|$|E
5|$|Chetwode {{ordered the}} {{continuation}} of the XX Corps' attacks; the 10th Division was to capture Nablus, the 53rd Division was to advance towards the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> north and north east of Nablus, {{in the direction of the}} Wadi el Fara road, to capture and control this line of retreat to the Jordan Valley.|$|E
5|$|Hackett {{decided the}} brigade would advance between the railway {{line and the}} Ede–Arnhem road, in order to capture their three objectives, first the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> {{overlooking}} Johanna Hoeve farm, next the woods near to Lichtenbeek House and finally the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> at Koepel. The delay in England meant it was 17:00 before the brigade started moving. With {{the element of surprise}} gone and no intelligence on the German dispositions, 156 Para headed for the first objective. Followed by 10 Para slightly behind and to their left. Bringing up the rear was the brigade reserve 4th Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, acting in an infantry role.|$|E

5|$|That morning, September 5, after a 10-minute {{artillery}} preparation, the American troops {{moved out}} in their third day of counterattack. It was a day of rain. As the attack progressed, the marines approached Obong-ni Ridge and the 9th Infantry neared Cloverleaf Hill where they had fought tenaciously during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the month before. There, at midmorning, on the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> ahead, they could see North Korean troops digging in. The marines approached the pass between the two hills and took positions {{in front of the}} North Korean-held <b>high</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

5|$|An attack {{had been}} planned for 18 September but was {{postponed}} due to the poor weather. On 25 September, the attack went ahead. It was intended to extend the front to <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> that was known as Factory Corner. The <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> was undefended, and the 1st Brigade easily captured it {{under the cover of}} a creeping barrage. Two days later, Factory Corner formed the launchpad for a further attack by the brigade and the neighbouring 55th Division on two more trenchlines, designated Gird Trench and Gird Support. This time, the attack was not as straightforward and it took an extra day before the entire objective was in New Zealand hands. On 1 October, as a preliminary to the Battle of Le Transloy, 2nd Brigade's Otago and Canterbury battalions captured strongpoints near Eaucourt L'Abbaye, which fell to the 47th Division two days later.|$|E
5|$|Around daybreak, Pike's A Company, 2/17th Infantry Battalion, {{reached the}} village of Katika, {{which turned out to}} be a {{clearing}} with some dilapidated huts. His company came under fire from Katika Spur, the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> to the west, which was strongly held by the 9th Company, 80th Infantry Regiment and a company of the 238th Infantry Regiment. The Japanese attempted to outflank A Company on its left, but ran into Capitan L. Snell's D Company, 2/15th Infantry Battalion.|$|E

Other forces involved in the landing included artillery regiments, signals corps, and engineering units.|$|E

5|$|At 10:05, {{the leading}} {{troops of the}} 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade; not to be {{confused}} with the 7th Mounted Brigade near Ras Ghannam to the south of Beersheba), were seen approaching Tel el Sakaty. By 11:17, they reported their advance was increasingly difficult due to hostile units defending the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> south of Sakaty. An Ottoman convoy of 10 wagons was seen leaving Beersheba on the road to Jerusalem, and the regiment was ordered to cut the road before the convoy escaped. Through heavy shell and shrapnel bombardment and point-blank machine-gun fire, they galloped to a position just south of the road. While an artillery battery got into position to support the light-horse regiment's attack on Tel el Sakaty, at 11:40 the 5th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) was ordered to engage the Ottoman left flank. As they crossed the Wadi Khalil and the road to Jerusalem, the 5th Light Horse Regiment was also heavily shelled by artillery and fired on by machine guns from the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> north and northwest overlooking the area. Five minutes later, the 7th Light Horse Regiment cut the road and captured the convoy (47 prisoners, eight horses and eight wagons loaded with forage). However, the regiment was pinned down just beyond, in a small wadi in the rough country north of Wadi Khalil by the gun battery and machine guns located on Tel el Sakaty (above the road). With the arrival of the 5th Light Horse Regiment, by 13:30 the two regiments (supported by artillery) were advancing to attack the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> northeast of Sakaty. At 14:45, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade reported that three Ottoman guns appeared to have been put out of action by EEF artillery fire. While they continued to hold the road to Jerusalem, the 5th and 7th Light Horse Regiments found cover in the Wadi Aiyan (although targeted from the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> north of Sakaty by five Ottoman machine guns) where they remained until evening. The 1,100-strong Ottoman 3rd Cavalry Division defended this hilly area north of Beersheba.|$|E
5|$|At Khe Sanh, the U.S. Marines {{held the}} <b>high</b> <b>ground,</b> and their {{artillery}} forced the North Vietnamese {{to use their}} own artillery from a much greater distance. By contrast, at Điện Biên Phủ, the French artillery (six 105mm batteries and one battery of four 155mm howitzers and mortars) was only sporadically effective;Furthermore, by 1968, the American military presence in Vietnam dwarfed that of the French, and included numerous technological advances such as effective helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Both {{airborne}} divisions began {{landing at}} the same time, 10:00 on 24 March 1945. The 6th Airborne were to protect {{the northern part of}} the landing area; they had six drop zones around the town of Hamminkeln. The plan was for them to secure the town, the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> east of the village of Bergen, and bridges across the river IJssel. The 5th Parachute Brigade would land on the northernmost DZ, DZ-B, and hold the area east of the Wesel railway line.|$|E

5|$|Currie {{regarded}} {{control of}} either Hill 70 or Sallaumines Hill as tactically {{more important than}} control {{of the city of}} Lens. Merely to occupy the city while the Germans held the <b>high</b> <b>ground,</b> would place the attackers in an unfavourably lower and more exposed position than the ones they occupied. At a conference of corps commanders, Currie persuaded the First Army commander General Henry Horne to make Hill 70, not Lens, the main objective of the limited offensive. Controlling Hill 70 would provide excellent observation over the German lines, in preparation for more offensives. Currie believed the Germans would attempt to counter-attack if Hill 70 were captured, largely because of its observational importance. Nevertheless, Currie believed that the advantageous observational position of Hill 70 would permit well directed artillery to effectively deal with any counter-attacks. The plan was therefore to occupy the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> quickly, establish defensive positions and utilize combined small arms and artillery fire to repel expected counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British {{captured}} the fort in the Siege of Fort Mackinac, the first {{battle of the}} conflict, because the Americans had not yet heard that war had been declared. The victorious British attempted to protect their prize by building Fort George on the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> behind Fort Mackinac. In 1814, the Americans and British fought a second battle {{on the north side}} of the island. The American second-in-command, Major Andrew Holmes, was killed and the Americans failed to recapture the island.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of August 22–23, the North Koreans {{launched}} a weak attack against the 27th Infantry, which was quickly repulsed. Just before 12:00 on August 23, however, a violent action occurred some distance behind the front line when about 100 North Korean soldiers, undetected, succeeded in reaching the positions of K Company, 27th Infantry and of the 1st Platoon, C Company, 65th Engineer Combat Battalion. They overran parts of these positions before being driven off and suffering 50 killed. Meanwhile, as ordered by Walker, the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, after repelling several North Korean night attacks, counterattacked at dawn and seized the <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> overlooking the road at the artillery positions. At {{the same time the}} 3rd Battalion started an all-day attack that swept a stretch of <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> east of the road. This action largely cleared the North Koreans from the area behind and on the flanks of the 27th Infantry. At 13:35, Michaelis reported from the Bowling Alley to Eighth Army that the KPA 13th Division had blown the road to his front, had mined it, and was withdrawing.|$|E
