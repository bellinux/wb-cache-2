5|$|Within {{the scope}} of a popular {{comparison}} that draws parallels between House and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Wilson is equivalent to Doctor Watson. In two-parts episodes such as Euphoria, Part 1 and Euphoria, Part 2, and House's Head and Wilson's Heart, Wilson's voice is heard narrating the story, while Dr. Watson is the character who narrates the stories in most of Sherlock Holmes novels. Leonard has said that his character and House were originally intended to play roles similar to Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes, respectively, in the series although he believes that House's team has {{assumed the role of}} Watson since the show has begun. Producer Katie Jacobs believes that Wilson and House both hide from mature relationships, which brings the two closer together. She has said that {{the difference between the two}} characters is that Wilson <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> say no because he wants to please the other person. The similarities between Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson was also one of the reasons that made Leonard choose House over Numb3rs.|$|E

After he is discovered by the police, John wakes up with amnesia, and Marlena struggles to help John remember.

30|$|Against this, {{there are}} reasons why migration-innovation {{channels}} may be limited.

A journalist for Elle believes that her choices reflect the [...] "soul and attitude of a jobbing actress, trapped in the body of a movie star". Tom Perrotta, the author of Little Children, has said that Winslet “gravitates toward troubling roles in smaller films”, typically those of [...] "thorny, potentially unsympathetic" [...] women. The journalist Mark Harris writes that she specialises in [...] "unsentimentalized, restless, troubled, discontented, disconcerted, difficult women" [...] and John Hiscock of The Daily Telegraph has identified a theme of characters who are free-spirited with a sexual edge to them.

Pierre Chaplais, writing a few years later, had more reservations.
