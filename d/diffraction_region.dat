40|$|It {{is shown}} that some simple ideas of {{topology}} {{can be applied}} to the diffraction theory. As an example, the phase of the wave transmitted through the crystal is considered for the Laue diffraction geometry. When the angle of incidence varies across the <b>diffraction</b> <b>region,</b> the phase of the transmitted wave can be changed on 2 πN, where N is an integer. The number N is a topological invariant (topological charge) of the diffraction region: in the general case, this number does not change its value when any parameters of experiment are slightly varied, but it changes by unity for some fixed values of those parameters. Therefore, from the topological point of view, the regions of diffraction are analogous to the domain walls in ferroelectrics. Then, within this approach, the singular points are revealed inside the <b>diffraction</b> <b>region.</b> It is shown that the topological ideas are especially fruitful for those cases where the solution of diffraction problem is absent or formidable (for instance, the multiple-beam diffraction or diffraction in imperfect crystals). The topological charge is also important for the dispersion relations connecting the phase and the amplitude of the transmitted wave in the <b>diffraction</b> <b>region...</b>|$|E

40|$|The hybrid finite element-boundary integral-uniform {{geometrical}} {{theory of}} diffraction method with acceleration by the multi-level fast multi-pole method is extended {{in a way}} that allows the application of the hybrid method to problems, where the finite element-boundary integral-multi-level fast multi-pole method parts of the model can be directly connected to uniform geometrical theory of <b>diffraction</b> <b>regions.</b> This becomes possible by an appropriate utilization of Huygens' principle, together {{with the fact that the}} regions exterior to the introduced Huygens surface is free of any fields and can thus be filled with arbitrary materials. As such, the appropriate materials are chosen in order to obtain simple enough bodies, which can be treated by the uniform geometrical theory of diffraction. Since some of the boundary integral basis functions typically touch flat parts of these bodies, the image principle is employed for the accurate evaluation of the corresponding boundary integrals.

40|$|Optical {{amplifiers}} {{are essential}} devices for optical networks, optical systems, and computer communications. These amplifiers {{compensate for the}} inevitable optical loss in long-distance propagation (> 50 km) or splitting (> 10 x). Fiber amplifiers such as the erbium-doped fiber amplifier have revolutionized the fiber-optics industry and are enjoying widespread use. Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are an alternative technology that complements the fiber amplifiers in cost and performance. One obstacle to {{the widespread use of}} SOAs is the severity of the inevitable noise output resulting from amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Spectral filtering is often used to reduce ASE noise, but this constrains the source spectrally, and improvement is typically limited to about 10 dB. The extra components also add cost and complexity to the final assembly. The goal of this project was to analyze, design, and take significant steps toward the realization of an innovative, low-noise SOA based on the concept of ''distributed spatial filtering'' (DSF). In DSF, we alternate active SOA segments with passive free-space <b>diffraction</b> <b>regions.</b> Since spontaneous emission radiates equally in all directions, the free-space region lengthens the amplifier for a given length of gain region, narrowing the solid angle into which the spontaneous emission is amplified [1, 2]. Our innovation is to use spatial filtering in a differential manner across many segments, thereby enhancing the effect when wave-optical effects are included [3]. The structure quickly and effectively strips the ASE into the higher-order modes, quenching the ASE gain relative to the signal...|$|R
