5|$|There {{are several}} {{well-known}} drugs and toxins that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Although {{any one of}} these toxins <b>inhibits</b> only one enzyme in the electron transport chain, inhibition of any step in this process will halt the rest of the process. For example, if oligomycin <b>inhibits</b> ATP synthase, protons cannot pass back into the mitochondrion. As a result, the proton pumps are unable to operate, as the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome. NADH is then no longer oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because the concentration of NAD+ falls below the concentration that these enzymes can use.|$|E
5|$|Thermal {{pollution}} is the artificial reduction in water temperatures, especially {{in summer and}} autumn, caused when frigid water is released {{from the bottom of}} reservoirs for irrigation demands.

5|$|Eumenorrhea denotes normal, regular {{menstruation}} {{that lasts}} {{for a few}} days (usually 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal).

5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates fibrin from fibrinogen, and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, factor XI, factor V and factor VIII, TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which <b>inhibits</b> factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which <b>inhibits</b> factor Xa).|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which <b>inhibits</b> the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2.

40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{examined}} the effects of the antimicrotubule agent benomyl and several mutations on nuclear and mitochondrial movement in germlings of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. While, as previously reported, benomyl <b>inhibited</b> nuclear division and movement, it did not <b>inhibit</b> mitochondrial movement. To test the effects of benomyl more rigorously, we germinated two benomyl super-sensitive, ~-tubulin mutants at a benomyl concentration 50 - 100 times greater than that required to <b>inhibit</b> colony formation completely. Again nuclear division and movement were <b>inhibited,</b> but mitochondrial movement was not. We also examined conditionally lethal ~-tubulin mutations that disrupt microtubule function under restrictive conditions. Nuclear division and movement were <b>inhibited</b> but, again, mitochondrial movement was not. Finally we {{examined the effects of}} five heat-sensitive mutations that <b>inhibit</b> nuclear movement but not nuclear division at restrictive temperatures. These mutations strongly <b>inhibited</b> nuclear movement at a restrictive temperature but did not <b>inhibit</b> mitochondrial movement. These data demonstrate that the mechanisms of nuclear and mitochondrial movement in Aspergillus nidulans are not identical and suggest that mitochondrial movement does not require functional microtubules...|$|R
