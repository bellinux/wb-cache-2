30|$|The {{framework}} of object detection with HOG and color features {{is illustrated by}} the block diagram in Fig.  1 c. It consists of separate training and testing phases. In the training phase, we trained two separate SVMs to <b>detect</b> <b>cells</b> from background and to identify the <b>detected</b> <b>cells</b> as T-cells or B-cells. First using the dataset that is generated from the dual dyed images, a linear-kernel SVM is trained to <b>detect</b> <b>cells</b> from background. Then, the images that is dyed with only singe dye is exhaustively searched using sliding window method, finding HOG for each window and classified by the first SVM. Found cells then used for their color information to train a Radial Basis Function (RBF)-kernel SVM [21] to identify T-cells from B-cells. Although RBF-SVM is timewise costly, it gives better accuracy. In the testing phase, unseen images are scanned with sliding window and HOG features are generated from the position of each window in the image. These features are classified as cell or background with the linear SVM classifier, then classified cells are further processed to get the color information and classified as T-cells or B-cells using the RBF SVM.|$|R

We also annotated the cells in the initial dataset as T-cells and B-cells using the newly re-trained CNN. This finalized our dataset with three labels as Fig.  2 illustrates. Using the final dataset AlexCAN is re-trained to <b>detect</b> the <b>cells</b> from the background and this time also annotate them as T-cells and B-cells. Cross validation proved that using the final dataset for AlexCAN can achieve the same 99 % accuracy rate for classifying T-cells from B-cells using the color dataset.

40|$|Abstract. We study <b>detecting</b> <b>cell</b> {{events in}} phase-contrast {{microscopy}} sequences from few annotations. We first detect event candidates from the intensity differ-ence of consecutive frames, and then train an unsupervised novelty detector on these candidates. The novelty detector assigns each candidate {{a degree of}} sur-prise. We annotate a tiny number of candidates chosen according to the nov-elty detector’s output, and finally train a sparse Gaussian process (GP) classi-fier. We show that the steepest learning curve is achieved when a collaborative multi-output Gaussian process is used as novelty detector, and its predictive mean and variance are used together to measure the degree of surprise. Following this scheme, we closely approximate the fully-supervised event detection accuracy by annotating only 3 % of all candidates. The novelty detector based annotation used here clearly outperforms the studied active learning based approaches. ...|$|E

The lost myelin sheath can be replaced by remyelination, used in SCI treatment. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for efficient automated analysis of remyelination therapy.

Simulation results show that the model is capable of recognizing and discriminating multiple sequences stored in memory. The cell assemblies that represent the sequential association between two items are activated if these items occur in the input in the correct order.

Our fluorescent apoptosis/necrosis (FANAN) assay directly measures cell death and distinguishes between caspase-dependent apoptosis and caspase-independent necrosis of cells grown in any multiwell plate.
