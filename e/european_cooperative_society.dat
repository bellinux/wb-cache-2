Problems facing these <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> were identified and they include lack of necessary cooperative education, lack of business ventures, irregular attendance to meetings, and delayed approval of loans.

The legal form was created to remove the need for co-operatives to establish a subsidiary in each Member State in which they operate, and {{to allow them to}} move their registered office and head office freely from one Member State to another, keeping their legal identity and without having to register or wind up any legal persons. No matter where they are established, SCEs are governed by a single EEA-wide set of rules and principles which are supplemented by the laws on co-operatives in each Member State, and other areas of law.|$|E

Data were collected using well-structured pre-tested interview schedules, and analysed by means of descriptive statistics (frequency distribution, percentages and means).

The average land size of the respondents was 1. 3 hectare. Constraints to their development efforts included inadequacy of finance; lack of training of their members, inadequate farm implements and lack of suitable machines for Women farmer’s use. Government should provide soft and medium term loan to women <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies.</b> Extension staff should make women <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> as a target group for quick delivery of extension services.

40|$|Council Regulation (EC) No 1. 435 / 2003, of 22 July 2003, {{concerning}} the European Co-operative Statute (ECS), constitutes the legal {{basis for the}} creation of european cooperatives, facilitating the development of their cross-border activities and contributing to their economic development. So, the aim of this regulation is to enable the creation of European cooperatives by physical persons or legal entities resident or established under the laws of different Member States, but it also makes possible the establishment of European cooperatives by merger or transformation of existing cooperatives from different Member States. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show the specific features of formation of crossborder cooperatives by merger, covered by the ECS, with special attention to those aspects that distance them from the internal formation by merger, within the Spanish legal framework. For the purpose of comparison, Spain will be considered as regards the regulations governing mergers, depending on whether the ECS or the Spanish Cooperative Law is taken into consideration.

40|$|Community Supported Agriculture and <b>Cooperatives</b> <b>Societies</b> (CSACs) are envisioned as model {{vehicles}} to building and developing communities, especially in rural areas. They are models in preserving and developing local food production systems, {{protecting the environment}} and eradicating poverty {{in support of the}} notion and general understanding, especially in Kenya, that farming as a business should support a middle level lifestyle. Despite the fact that most rural communities in Africa, especially in Kenya, are the producers of products that are consumed by urban dwellers, these communities do not appear to fruitfully gain from their efforts and labour (World Development Indicators, 2009). Although rural communities are knowledgeable, they do not always put their tacit and explicit knowledge into practice to consciously communicate to, and share this knowledge with others and to economically support themselves. Effective knowledge management enables people to combine their efforts and knowledge to economically develop themselves without resorting to hand-outs and donations from the government and well wishers. This paper presents findings from a case study of a community-supported <b>cooperative</b> <b>society.</b> The paper describes how the Nyala Multipurpose <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> has successfully functioned as the vehicle for social and economic development in a rural community in Central Kenya using funds originally contributed by the members and later raised from milk sales. The <b>cooperative</b> <b>society</b> has also served as a civil society organisation. Data was collected through interviews with key members of the <b>cooperative</b> <b>society</b> and the youth. Families were visited, interviewed and their dairy activities observed. The Nyala Multipurpose <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> Centre and the cooling plant were visited and operations also observed. Their records were also inspected. The Nyala Multipurpose <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> has grown from a membership of 2700 in 2005 to 7000 in 2010. The <b>cooperative</b> <b>society</b> is democratically owned and managed by its members. Problems that the <b>cooperative</b> <b>society</b> has endeavoured to solve include poverty among members, youth idleness, poor transport system, lack of good market for their main agricultural product and exploitation by middlemen. The study established that the funds generated by the Nyala <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> were used to finance the development and installation of a milk cooling plant. The Nyala Multipurpose <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> is a model that offers useful insight and successful elements that have focused on milk production...|$|R

40|$|Establishment and {{termination}} of a {{membership in a}} cooperative society Membership in a cooperative society is a basic cooperative relationship {{due to the fact}} that a cooperative society is a corporation which cannot exist without personal substrate and which cannot have solely one member. The understanding of establishment and {{termination of}} a membership is hence essential for the mere existence of a cooperative society. The task of this thesis is to describe in detail the means of establishment and termination of a membership in a cooperative society. This thesis provides a comprehensive explanation of individual means, especially with respect to the terms and their legal consequences. My goal was to point out the problematic issues and describe how those issues are resolved in theory and how they are solved by legal practice. I also attempted to compare those issues with foreign regulation, especially with German and Austrian ones. It was necessary to compare the Czech regulation with international cooperative principles since the Czech understanding of a cooperative law is frequently challenged by misunderstanding of those principles.
