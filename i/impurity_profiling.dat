The pH of the CZE buffer was varied; but the two stereoisomers could not be separated. Moreover, CZE is not suitable for neutral compounds. In MEKC, two different types of surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), have been used and the effect of type and concentration modifier on the separation and the elution window was studied. In the SDS system, both the resolution and the elution window could be increased considerably by the addition of modifier.
