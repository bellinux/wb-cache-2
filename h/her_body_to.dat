5|$|On 13 July 2012, {{at around}} 09:00 local time (13:00 UTC), {{relatives}} of María José Reyes {{arrived at the}} Servicio Médico Legal (Legal Medical Service) of San Fernando, where an autopsy was done, and took <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> Vitacura, Santiago Metropolitan Region, where a wake over her body was held at Parroquia San Juan de Apóstol. A mass commanded by priest Osvaldo Fernández was held on 14 July 2012 at the Parroquia San Juan de Apóstol, attended by about one thousand people.

5|$|The US Immigration and Naturalization Service allowed <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> {{be brought}} back to the United States. She was buried in German Waldheim Cemetery (now named Forest Home Cemetery) in Forest Park, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago, among the graves of other labor and social activists {{including}} Ben Reitman and those executed after the Haymarket affair. The bas relief on her grave marker was created by sculptor Jo Davidson.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{to commemorate}} the fortieth anniversary of the {{formation}} of women's services in World WarII, Stevenson was asked to lead the female contingent in the Anzac Day parade in Sydney. She published The WAAAF Book, a collection of reminiscences by former members of the service, with Honor Darling in 1984. Stevenson was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 1988 Australia Day Honours for her services to the community and her welfare work with veterans. Her hobbies included reading, classical music and, in her younger days, surfing. Unmarried, Clare Stevenson died in Mona Vale on 22October 1988, leaving <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> the University of Sydney.|$|E

5|$|On January 3, 2014, Kesha {{checked into}} Timberline Knolls Residential Treatment Center, a rehab {{facility}} in Lemont, Illinois, for eating disorder treatment. Kesha's mother Pebe Sebert {{confirmed that the}} eating disorder Kesha was suffering with is bulimia nervosa {{and that she had}} been struggling with it since she was signed. She also alleged that Dr. Luke was partly the cause of Kesha's eating disorder, saying that Luke had allegedly told her to lose weight after he signed her, comparing the shape of <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> a refrigerator. Sebert asserted that this had caused Kesha's disorder to worsen. Kesha had completed her treatment on March 6, 2014, after spending two months in rehab.|$|E
5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot {{made her}} way to the village of Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, where she was either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken to one of the bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled her down to the harbour by her ankles, possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run from the top of the masthead on a ship back to the shore and she was dangled from it while the crowd threw stones at her as she swung backwards and forwards. When they took her down, she was covered by a door that had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> the home of her co-accused, Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E
5|$|Blank debuted for the ECW brand as Kelly Kelly. Originally, {{she was to}} {{be named}} just 'Kelly', but her ring name was {{expanded}} to 'Kelly Kelly' by WWE chairman Vince McMahon. She made her debut on the first episode of ECW on June 13, 2006, becoming the youngest Diva on the WWE roster at the age of 19. Her character, an exhibitionist, was introduced performing a striptease for the crowd. The next week, while performing another striptease, Kelly was interrupted by her on-screen boyfriend, Mike Knox, who came to the stage and covered her with a towel before dragging her backstage. Her stripping became a weekly segment known as Kelly's Exposé and usually followed the same routine; Kelly would dance and strip until she was interrupted by Knox, who was upset by her exhibitionism and showing off <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> others. Originally a solo segment, Kelly was joined by the villainous Candice Michelle on the July 11 edition of ECW.|$|E

5|$|Rachel Beck {{wakes up}} in a shallow grave {{in the woods with}} rope burns on her neck and no memory of how she got there. She hitchhikes to her house in Manson, Wisconsin, where her friends and family do not {{immediately}} recognize her. Her Aunt Johnny, who is a mortician, examines her and determines that Rachel should not be alive. With the help of Rachel's friend Jet, the three decide to find Rachel's attacker. Meanwhile, two other women in Manson are killed; one by Lilith, and one by a 10-year-old girl named Zoe who is possessed by the demon Malus. When Rachel's group coincidentally meets Zoe, Lilith causes a car accident that injures Aunt Johnny and kills Jet. Rachel accompanies Jet's body to the morgue, where Jet comes back to life in a condition similar to Rachel. Lilith traps Zoe and confronts Malus, whom she summoned 300 years prior to take revenge on the city of Manson for killing her followers during a witch-hunt. He tells her he is close to bringing about the End times, which will also destroy Manson. During their conversation, Zoe slits her wrists and Malus leaves <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> find another host. Zoe is taken to a hospital, where her life is saved and Rachel and Jet find her.|$|E
5|$|Stanton wanted EVE {{to be at}} {{the higher}} end of technology, and asked iPod {{designer}} Jonathan Ive to inspect her design. He was very impressed. Her eyes are modelled on Lite-Brite toys, but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar. Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing, relying on posing <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> express emotion. They also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature. Auto was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from , and the usage of Also sprach Zarathustra for the showdown between the captain and Auto furthers that. The manner in which he hangs from a wall gives him a threatening feel, like a spider. Originally, Auto was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots. The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations. The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their blubbery bodies, as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.|$|E
5|$|They {{argued that}} Bamber had then set about {{arranging}} {{the scene to}} make it appear that Sheila was the killer. He discovered that she could not have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> introduce a religious theme. He removed the kitchen phone from its hook, left the house via a kitchen window, perhaps after showering, and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26am to say he had just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter.|$|E

Other examples are women in bikini promoting trips to sunny places, commercials for alcoholic beverages (especially beers, like Corona and Modelo), or Victoria's Secret, which uses the body of the models to sell clothes and underwear.|$|R
