The results indicated the degradation rates of the five tested insecticides varied according to the chemical structure, time of exposure and wavelength of UV-rays used. Of all the five insecticides, methomyl was the most affected by UV-rays. Losses of ES-Fenvalerate, pirimicarb, imidacloprid, buprofenzin and methomyl within this period were 11. 30, 14. 80, 29. 03, 31. 83 and 39 %, respectively after one hour to UV-ray exposure. A significant increase in LC 50 value was obtained when ES-Fenvalerate in aqueous preparation was exposed to UV-light for 6 hr. The LC 50 values and their confidence ranges in aqueous preparations and <b>emulsifiable</b> <b>concentrates</b> were 107. 5 ppm (51. 7 â 199. 2) and 93. 10 ppm (48. 3 â 150. 4).

Insecticides could be arranged according to LC 50 values at zero-time as follow: ES-Fenvalerate, pirimicarb, imidacloprid, buprofenzin and methomyl. The corresponding values of LC 50 were 3. 40, 15. 4, 15. 6, 16. 2 and 23. 5 ppm for daylight storage. On the other hand, the dark storage exposure for the tested insecticides could be arranged ac-cording to LC 50 values as follow: ES-Fenvalerate, imidacloprid, pirimicarb, buprofenzin and methomyl.

40|$|Various {{formulations}} of agricultural chemicals, including solutions, wettable powders, and <b>emulsifiable</b> <b>concentrates,</b> contain adjuvants of solvents and surfactants {{in addition to}} active ingredients. Among these formulations, herbicides {{are among the most}} commonly used pesticides globally. Some pesticides have been demonstrated to cause severe circulatory failure in poisoned humans. To clarify the potential risk of herbicides and their adjuvants influence on the cardiovascular system, four technical grade (TG) herbicides and their end products (EP), including paraquat, glyphosate, glufosinate, and atrazine, as well as their formulated adjuvants isopropylamine (IPA), polyoxyethylene alkylether sulfate (AES), ethyl acetate (EA), xylene, petrolium- 170 (P- 170), and solvesso- 100 (S- 100), were assessed to determine their effects on isolated rat aorta and heart. The results revealed that the vasorelaxation effects of the herbicide EPs exceeded those of TGs, and atrazine produced more significant vasorelaxation in rat aortas than the other herbicides tested. The formulated adjuvants of IPA did not affect the aorta; however, AES, EA, xylene, P- 170 and S- 100 caused significant vasorelaxation. Herbicide EPs-induced vasorelaxation was generally endothelium-dependent. Furthermore, the TG and EP of paraquat, and the TG of glufosinate and glyphosate were found to have no effect on the isolated heart. However, the normal twitch tensions of the isolated heart were significantly inhibited by EPs of glyphosate and glufosinate, and by TG and EP of atrazine. Although, the adjuvants of IPA appeared unaffected, however, AES, EA, xylene, P- 170 and S- 100 caused complete inhibition and contraction on the isolated hearts. These results indicated that the adjuvants of herbicides might enhance hypotension and contributed to cardiovascular disorders during intoxication. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
