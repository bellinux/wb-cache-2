40|$|To {{generate}} a clinical prediction tool for stillbirth that combines maternal risk factors {{to provide an}} evidence based approach for the identification of women who will benefit most from antenatal testing for stillbirth prevention. Retrospective cohort study. Midwestern United States quaternary referral center. Singleton pregnancies undergoing second trimester anatomic survey from 1999 - 2009. Pregnancies with incomplete follow-up were <b>excluded.</b> <b>Candidate</b> predictors were identified from the literature and univariate analysis. Backward stepwise logistic regression with statistical comparison of model discrimination, calibration and clinical performance was used to generate final models for the prediction of stillbirth. Internal validation was performed using bootstrapping with 1, 000 repetitions. A stillbirth risk calculator and stillbirth risk score were developed for the prediction of stillbirth at or beyond 32 weeks excluding fetal anomalies and aneuploidy. Statistical and clinical cut-points were identified and the tools compared using the Integrated Discrimination Improvement. Antepartum stillbirth. 64, 173 women met inclusion criteria. The final stillbirth risk calculator and score included maternal age, black race, nulliparity, body mass index, smoking, chronic hypertension and pre-gestational diabetes. The stillbirth calculator and simple risk score demonstrated modest discrimination but clinically significant performance with no difference in overall performance between the tools [(AUC 0. 66 95 % CI 0. 60 - 0. 72) and (AUC 0. 64 95 % CI 0. 58 - 0. 70), (p = 0. 25) ]. A stillbirth risk score was developed incorporating maternal risk factors easily ascertained during prenatal care to determine an individual woman's risk for stillbirth and provide an evidenced based approach to the initiation of antenatal testing for the prediction and prevention of stillbirth...|$|E
40|$|Human {{genetics}} {{has provided}} a strong background for the identification of genes and gene variants associated with inherited single-gene disorders (i. e. Mendelian traits) in man contributing a lot in understanding the disease etiology and prognosis. Pakistani population has great potential for identification of novel genes and gene variants due to large inbred families. Mental disorder is a behavioral or psychological pattern associated with disability that occurs in an individual {{and is not a}} part of normal development or culture. Mental retardation (MR) is a complex phenotype syndromic with additional symptoms and non syndromic (NS) specified by MR without any additional features. The aim of this thesis is to analyze Pakistani families with autosomal recessive mental disorders to identify genes and allele variants involved in disease phenotype. Seven large consanguineous Pakistani families with autosomal recessive (AR) mental disorders were analyzed in this study. Clinical features including hearing loss, vision problem, muscular abnormalities and speech problems etc. were observed. All affected individuals showed psychomotor developmental delay with low IQ. In two families MR 5 and MR 6, detailed clinical examination was conducted for two affected in each that include physical examination, complete blood picture, biochemical analysis, echocardiography (ECG), Torch and thyroid profile, chest X-ray and brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Initially all families were excluded for already reported genes and loci using sequence tagged site (STS) markers. Genome wide scanning (GWS) was then performed for all families to find the regions carrying disease causing genes using linkage analysis approach. All affected individuals of MR 5 presented with NS-ARMR. The fragment analyses of the already reported genes for NS-ARMR using polymorphic STS markers excluded these as candidate genes. The ARMR locus was mapped to chromosomal region 11 p 15 (physical coordinates chr 11 : 1 - 5, 984, 667, hg 18) by linkage analysis using human SNP 6. 0 array and a maximum two point LOD score (Zmax) of 3. 58 was obtained. The 6 Mb region contains 180 genes which was subjected to the high throughput sequencing or next generation sequencing (Solexa). The data generated by Solexa sequencing revealed novel mutations in the 6 Mb region. Four genes; OR 52 I 2, OR 52 E 6, PGAP 2 and DRD 4 with novel mutations c. 867 T>A, c. 331 G>A, c. 713 G>C and c. 497 T>G respectively, were {{selected on the basis of}} their function. Mutations in the first three genes showed segregation with the disease trait in the family. In MR 7 family having ARMR, STS markers analysis showed exclusion to all reported genes. Four candidate homozygous regions: chr 14 : 30294526 - 32106658, chr 13 28, 552, 570 X 35, 416, 145, chr 3 : 79, 781, 359 - 81, 232, 140 and chr 7 : 101, 807, 854 102, 972, 615 were identified by Genome wide scanning (GWS) using SNP 6. 0 array. Region on chromosome 14, overlapping the already reported MRT 9 locus was subjected to Solexa sequencing. No potential disease causing mutation was found. The only novel mutation (T/G) having non damaging effect was identified in 3 ' UTR of PSMB 11 gene. In MR 8 family; presenting with ARMR, homozygosity mapping by fragment analyses using STS markers showed exclusion to already reported genes for ARMR. Two candidate homozygous regions: chr 14 : 65, 396, 965 - 67, 055, 399 and chr 15 79, 803, 172 - 82, 039, 702 were obtained by GWS using SNP 6. 0 array. HOMER 2 gene found in candidate region on chromosome 15 was sequenced but no disease causing mutation identified. Families MR 8, MR 4 and MR 10 showed exclusion to already reported genes and loci for ARMR using STS markers analysis. GWS was performed for MR 8 and MR 4 using SNP 6. 0 array and two and four candidate homozygous regions were obtained respectively. HOMER 2 gene found in candidate region on chromosome 15 was sequenced for family MR 8 but no disease causing mutation was identified. Genome Wide Scanning for family MR 10 was skipped because of having very less chance of getting common homozygous regions. For family MR 13 with ARMR, homozygosity mapping using microsatellite STS markers showed exclusion to all known genes for ARMR. Three candidate homozygous regions: chr 2 : 107, 989, 932 - 109, 282, 591, chr 3 : 107, 655, 837 - 115, 615, 874 and chr 7 : 138, 078, 167 140, 846, 938 were identified by GWS using SNP 6. 0 array. In another family; MR 4 having ARMR, STS markers analyses for already known ARMR genes <b>excluded</b> <b>candidate</b> genes for ARMR. Four candidate homozygous regions: chr 2 : 94, 705, 115 - 96, 924, 641, chr 3 : 108, 948, 507 - 110, 091, 735, chr 11 : 57, 745, 095 - 58, 810, 039 and chr 11 : 66, 162, 090 - 67, 419, 053 were obtained on GWS using SNP 6. 0 array. A large consanguineous Pakistani family MR 6 with Hallervorden Spatz Syndrome (HSS) was identified. HSS has characteristic phenotypes of movement abnormalities, pigmentary retinopathy, and iron accumulation in the brain usually in the basal ganglia. Five candidate homozygous regions: chr 1 : 15, 632, 403 - 17, 336, 107, chr 6 : 128, 285, 405 - 129, 535, 832, chr 10 : 44, 876, 072 - 47, 151, 671, chr 11 : 30, 641, 396 - 32, 047, 777 and chr 16 : 13, 983, 356 - 15, 793, 282 were obtained by GWS using SNP 6. 0 array. No common homozygous region was found in any of the three loops. PANK 2 gene was sequenced but no mutation was found. These results support the digenic nature of HSS. No genetic overlapping was observed among all families and affected individuals analyzed in this study. Marked inter and intra family phenotypic variation was observed. These findings indicate the genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic complexity of mental disorders. Efforts for gene identification are still underway. Use of high throughput robust technologies may facilitate identification of the disease causing mutations for establishing a definitive diagnosis of mental disorders for improved treatment strategies.

40|$|The {{means by}} which governments select bureaucratic {{officials}} {{are likely to be}} closely associated with the performance of state bureaucracies. Merit-based recruitment may yield more productive officials than other methods of selection. Yet the choice of appointment mechanism has been subjected to scant theoretical scrutiny in compara-tive politics. In this paper, I examine this choice by constructing a theoretical model wherein officials may be appointed either through patronage or by merit. Patronage, I argue, is characterized by skilled and unskilled candidates bidding for offices by offering political services in exchange for posts. Patronage is costly insofar as it may <b>exclude</b> qualified <b>candidates</b> from office if these candidates lack the means to secure a post.

We also present connections between our proposal and recent other proposals for condensed representations of frequent itemsets. Experiments on real-life datasets show {{the effectiveness of the}} NDI representation, making the search for frequent non-derivable itemsets a useful and tractable alternative to mining all frequent itemsets...|$|R
