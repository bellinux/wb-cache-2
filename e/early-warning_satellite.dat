25|$|The Missile Defense Alarm System, or MIDAS, was an American {{system of}} 12 <b>early-warning</b> <b>satellites</b> that {{provided}} limited notice of Soviet {{intercontinental ballistic missile}} launches between 1960 and 1966. Originally intended {{to serve as a}} complete early-warning system working in conjunction with the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System, cost and reliability concerns limited the project to a research and development role. Three of the system's 12 launches ended in failure, and the remaining nine satellites provided crude infrared early-warning coverage of the Soviet Union until the project was replaced by the Defense Support Program, which served as a successor program. MiDAS represented one element of the United States's first generation of reconnaissance satellites that also included the Corona and Samos series. Though MiDAS failed in its primary role as a system of infrared <b>early-warning</b> <b>satellites,</b> it pioneered the technologies needed in successor systems.|$|R

25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1980s, even as the FCC was {{publishing}} studies, the signals became less frequent, and in 1989, they disappeared altogether. Although {{the reasons for the}} eventual shutdown of the Duga systems have not been made public, the changing strategic balance {{with the end of the}} Cold War {{in the late}} 1980s likely had a major part to play. Another factor was the success of the US-KS <b>early-warning</b> <b>satellites,</b> which began entering service in the early 1980s, and by this time had grown into a complete network. The satellite system provides immediate, direct and highly secure warnings, whereas any radar-based system is subject to jamming, and the effectiveness of OTH systems is also subject to atmospheric conditions.|$|R
50|$|During 1960, Lockheed {{introduced}} the improved Agena B, {{which could be}} restarted in orbit and had longer propellant tanks for increased burn time/ It was equipped with a Bell 8081 engine, which could generate 71 kilonewtons of thrust, and be restarted in orbit.

These launched the SAMOS-E, SAMOS-F (ELINT Ferret), and MIDAS (Missile Defense Alarm System) military <b>early-warning</b> <b>satellites,</b> Ranger lunar probes, Mariner planetary probes, OGO, and Nimbus satellites. Agena B's maiden voyage was the (unsuccessful) launch of Discoverer 16 on October 26, 1960. The Agena B took months to be ready for Atlas launches and did not fly on there until Midas 3 on July 12, 1961. The final Agena B flight was the launch of OGO 3 on June 7, 1966. A total of 75 were launched.|$|R
5000|$|Post Cold War {{space militarisation}} seems to revolve around {{three types of}} {{application}}s. (The word [...] "seems" [...] is used because much of this subject matter is inconclusively verifiable, due to {{the high level of}} secrecy that exists among the great powers with regard to the details of space sensing systems.) The first application is the continuing development of [...] "spy" [...] or reconnaissance satellites which began in the Cold War era, but has progressed significantly since that time. Spy satellites perform a variety of missions such as high resolution photography (IMINT), communications eavesdropping (SIGINT), and covert communications (HUMINT). These tasks are performed on a regular basis both during peacetime and war operations. Satellites are also used by the nuclear states to provide early warning of missile launches, locate nuclear detonations, and detect preparations for otherwise clandestine or surprise nuclear tests (at least those tests or preparations carried out above-ground); this was the case when, in 1998, India and Pakistan both conducted a series of nuclear tests; in addition, a nuclear-detection satellite of the Vela type was also reported to have detected a nuclear detonation in the Indian Ocean in 1978 that was believed to be a South African nuclear test in what was famously called the Vela Incident. <b>Early-warning</b> <b>satellites</b> {{can also be used to}} detect tactical missile launches; this capability was used during Desert Storm when America was able to provide advance warning to Israel of Iraqi SS-1 SCUD missile launches.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{development}} of the Missile technology, {{there are more and}} more challenges for the technology of <b>early-warning</b> <b>satellite</b> detection. The <b>early-warning</b> <b>satellite</b> can compute the data of launch point and impact point of a missile by detecting the changing infrared radiation of the missile. Therefore, the research on the infrared radiation of ballistic missile in boost phase is important for developing the detecting technology of <b>early-warning</b> <b>satellite.</b> In this paper, the dynamical infrared radiation model has been constructed based on the characteristics of trajectory and infrared radiation of a ballistic missile in boost phase, and the model has been verified by simulation based on the data of a two stage ballistic missile...|$|E
