Complete {{stress and}} {{electric}} fields near {{the tip of}} a conducting crack between two dissimilar anisotropic piezoelectric media, are obtained in terms of two generalized bimaterial matrices proposed in this paper.

40|$|The dynamic {{constraints}} {{technique has}} been proposed for building geometrical models composed of rigid bodies, which are made to act naturally, according to Newtonian laws, by specifying constraints on their states. In computer animation, the dynamic constraints technique alleviates the work-load of animators who formerly had to plan animated sequences in detail by intuition alone. Nevertheless, for some real-world applications, it is desirable to have a mechanism that makes physically-based elements move according to a given scenario by providing some control states. The control states can be represented by transient constraints {{that are to be}} met and then released immediately. In this paper, a technique called the sequential-goal constraints technique is proposed to provide such a mechanism. With the sequential-goal constraints technique, it is easy to specify transient constraints according to a given scenario and derive proper forces and torques to drive an element to meet each transient constraint exactly at a specified time so that the whole motion of the element is continuous and <b>integral.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS Animation Dynamic constraints Inverse dynamics Physically-based model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the basics}} of {{calculus}} is the following proposition: If F and G are antiderivatives of two real functions f and g resp., then an antiderivative of λf + g is λF +G. It may be surprising that such systematic an integration formula exists for the inverse of a function f, a fact {{that seems to have}} been discovered for the first time by Laisant in 1905 ([2]), and seems to be still unsufficiently known. More precisely, if f is an invertible real function, and if F is an antiderivative of f, then the antiderivative of f− 1 is xf− 1 (x) − F ◦ f− 1 (x) + C. Laisant, and other authors after him (e. g. [3, 4]), assumes that f− 1 is differentiable, in which case the proof of this formula is immediate. Recently, it has been shown by Key that this additional assumption is unnecessary ([1]). In this paper, we give two different proofs of this result.

Furthermore, non-universal properties are recovered from the study of a series of functions which are generalizations of the so-called energy <b>integral.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Fractals, stochastic processes A number of the {{properties of}} fractals are associated with their Hausdorff, box-counting, or fractal dimensions. But further information of a universal character is also encoded in secondary (singular) dimensions, some of which may be complex. For example, a recurrent theme in the study of fractals is that of asymptotic or logarithmic periodicity [1, 2]. Most fractal objects and mathematical constructions thereof are not exactly scale invariant. Rather, they obey simple recurrence relations that relate an infinite but discrete set of scales. Recent physical examples include the appearance of complex exponents in diffusion-limited aggregation [3], crack propagation in two dimensions [4], and Boolean delay equations in the modelling of climate dynamics [5]. For instance, instead of the full scale invariance of a function of local variables, F(x) = λ D F(x/λ), (1...|$|E

40|$|Thanks to INTEGRAL’s long {{exposures}} of the Galactic Plane, the two brightest Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters, SGR 1806 - 20 and SGR 1900 + 14, {{have been}} monitored and studied in detail {{for the first}} time at hard-X/softgamma rays. SGR 1806 - 20, lying close to the Galactic Centre, and being very active in the past two years, has provided a wealth of new INTEGRAL results, which we will summarise here: more than 300 short bursts have been observed from this source and their characteristics have been studied with unprecedented sensitivity in the 15 - 200 keV range. A hardness-intensity anticorrelation within the bursts has been discovered and the overall Number-Intensity distribution of the bursts has been determined. The increase of its bursting activity eventually led to the December 2004 Giant Flare for which a possible soft gamma-ray (> 80 keV) early afterglow has been detected with INTEGRAL. The deep observations allowed us to discover the persistent emission in hard X-rays (20 - 150 keV) from 1806 - 20 and 1900 + 14, the latter being in quiescent state, and to directly compare the spectral characteristics of all Magnetars (two SGRs and three Anomalous X-ray Pulsars) detected with <b>INTEGRAL.</b> <b>Key</b> words: gamma-rays: observations; pulsars: individua...|$|E

The Swift/BAT data also show a long spin-down trend prior to the 2008 outburst. which is confirmed in archival INTEGRAL/ISGRI data.

40|$|The {{availability}} of L-band radio signals permanently transmitted by {{a fleet of}} satellites belonging to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) has opened a new dimension for ionosphere sounding. Whereas ground-based measurements of propagation effects, such as travel time delays and phase changes, have been well established since the mid-nineties, space based GNSS measurements onboard Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites are rather new. Immediately after the proof-of-concept GPS/MET experiment on Microlab- 1, flown within the years 1995 - 1997, has demonstrated the huge potential of the limb sounding technique on LEO satellites for atmosphere/ionosphere sounding, the development of improved inversion techniques, assimilation methods and powerful processing systems made a big progress in recent years. The radio occultation technique provides a rather simple and inexpensive tool for a global profiling of the entire vertical electron density structure from satellite orbit heights {{down to the bottom}} of the ionosphere, not achieved so far by any other technique. The reception of multi-satellite navigation signals, affected on their travel through the ionosphere, provides <b>integral</b> <b>key</b> information on the ionospheric state. Modern inversion and data assimilation methods allow a reliable reconstruction of the electron density structure if the amount of data is sufficient. Extensive information provided by current and future satellite missions with GNSS receiver onboard enables permanent monitoring of the Earth’s co-rotating plasma environment in near-real time. The obtained global data sets contribute to a comprehensive understanding of solar-terrestrial relationships, and are valuable for developing and improving global ionospheric models and provide operational space weather information. Consequently, accuracy and reliability of space based Communication/Navigation radio systems will take benefit from this knowledge. ...|$|E
