40|$|According to Ray Oldenburg in The Great Good <b>Place</b> (1989), <b>gathering</b> <b>places,</b> {{or third}} places {{are a key}} {{component}} of a prosperous community. He argues that these places, e. g. coffee shops, bowling alleys, and parks, are essential for the health of both the people in communities and for the communities themselves. Connecting Oldenburg to Putnam (1993, 1995, 2000), these <b>gathering</b> <b>places</b> serve as a source of social capital for communities. Using data from a study of community life in 99 small Iowa towns, I explore the role that <b>gathering</b> <b>places</b> play in the social and economic well-being of small communities. Findings indicate that eating establishments, city parks, and town squares most often form the core of small towns 2 ̆ 7 <b>gathering</b> <b>places</b> networks. Weighted densities of <b>gathering</b> <b>places</b> 2 ̆ 7 networks are significantly correlated to attitudinal measures of bridging and bonding social capital. However, the theory provided by Tolbert, Lyson, and Irwin (1998) that towns with richer <b>gathering</b> <b>places</b> 2 ̆ 7 networks have better socioeconomic outcomes is not supported...|$|R

5|$|Contrary to {{what many}} outsiders believed, most {{residents}} of the Walled City behaved similarly to other Hong Kong natives.

The main auditorium is a Grade 1 listed building. The inclusion of the adjacent old Floral Hall, previously {{a part of the}} old Covent Garden Market, created a large new public <b>gathering</b> <b>place.</b> In 1779 the pavement outside the playhouse was the scene of the murder of Martha Ray, mistress of the Earl of Sandwich, by her admirer the Rev.

5|$|Andrić {{was later}} {{transferred}} to a prison in Zenica, where Perčinlić regularly visited him. The Austro-Hungarian Army declared Andrić a political threat in March 1917 and exempted him from armed military service. He was thus registered with a non-combat unit until February of the following year. On 2 July 1917, Emperor Charles declared a general amnesty for all of Austria-Hungary's political prisoners. His freedom of movement restored, Andrić visited Višegrad and reunited with several school friends. He remained in the town until July, when he was mobilized. Due to his poor health, Andrić was admitted to a Sarajevo hospital and thus avoided service. He was then transferred to the Reservospital in Zenica, where he received treatment for several months before continuing to Zagreb. There, Andrić again fell seriously ill and sought treatment at the Sisters of Mercy hospital, which had become a <b>gathering</b> <b>place</b> for dissidents and former political prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Hyde Park {{was created}} for hunting by Henry Vlll in 1536 after he {{acquired}} the manor of Hyde from the Abbey. It was enclosed as a deer park and remained a private hunting ground until James I permitted limited access to gentlefolk, appointing a ranger to take charge. Charles I created the Ring (north of the present Serpentine boathouses), and in 1637 he opened the park to the general public. It quickly became a popular <b>gathering</b> <b>place,</b> particularly for May Day celebrations. At {{the start of the}} English Civil War in 1642, a series of fortifications were built along {{the east side of the}} park, including forts at what is now Marble Arch, Mount Street and Hyde Park Corner.

The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and been featured in hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles.

The Bahá'í laws also stipulate that only the holy scriptures of the Bahá'í Faith and other religions can be read or chanted inside in any language; while readings and prayers can be set to music by choirs, no musical instruments can be played inside. Furthermore, no sermons can be delivered, and there can be no ritualistic ceremonies practised.|$|E
5|$|On December9, 1964, Clarence13X {{was shot}} {{twice in the}} torso while at a popular <b>gathering</b> <b>place</b> in the {{basement}} of a Harlem tenement. He was brought to Harlem Hospital, where he was treated and released. He later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later. In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement, American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a Christ figure. The identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown; Knight notes that law enforcement and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence13X. Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts. Clarence13X's companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence. While recuperating from his wounds, Clarence13X sought to distinguish his movement from other Islamic movements, abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions.|$|E
