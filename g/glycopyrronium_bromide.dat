The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the studies evaluating the safety and clinical efficacy of inhaled <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide,</b> a novel long-acting muscarinic antagonist, in patients with COPD. Methods: This study was performed as a systematic literature review. Results: Inhaled <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> seems to be a safe and well tolerated long-acting muscarinic antagonist with a fast onset of action. In patients suffering from moderate to severe COPD, <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> has clinically important effects on level of forced expiratory volume in one second, use of relief medication, percentage of days with no use of rescue medication, daytime dyspnea scores, and probably also on health status.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (NVA 237) is an inhaled long-acting muscarinic {{antagonist}} {{in development}} {{for treatment of}} COPD. This study compared the efficacy and safety of once-daily (OD) and twice-daily (BID) <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> regimens, using a novel model-based approach, in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Methods Double-blind, randomized, dose-finding trial with an eight-treatment, two-period, balanced incomplete block design. Patients (smoking history ≥ 10 pack-years, post-bronchodilator FEV 1 ≥ 30 % and 1 /FVC 1 at Day 28. Results 385 patients (mean age 61. 2 [*]years; mean post-bronchodilator FEV 1 53 % predicted) were randomized; 88. 6 % completed. All OD and BID dosing regimens produced dose-dependent bronchodilation; at Day 28, increases in mean trough FEV 1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens, ranging from 51 [*]mL (<b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> 12. 5 [*]μg OD) to 160 [*]mL (<b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> 50 [*]μg BID). Pharmacodynamic steady-state was reached by Day 7. There was a small separation (≤ 37 [*]mL) between BID and OD dose–response curves for mean trough FEV 1 at steady-state in favour of BID dosing. Over 24 [*]hours, separation between OD and BID regimens was even smaller (FEV 1 AUC 0 - 24 h maximum difference for equivalent daily dose regimens: 8 [*]mL). Dose–response results for FEV 1 at 12 [*]hours, FEV 1 AUC 0 - 12 h and FEV 1 AUC 0 - 4 h at steady-state showed OD regimens provided greater improvement over placebo than BID regimens for total daily doses of 25 [*]μg, 50 [*]μg and 100 [*]μg, while the reverse was true for OD versus BID regimens from 12 – 24 [*]hours. The 12. 5 [*]μg BID dose produced a marginally higher improvement in trough FEV 1 versus placebo than 50 [*]μg OD, however, the response at 12 [*]hours over placebo was suboptimal (74 [*]mL). <b>Glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> was safe and well tolerated at all doses. Conclusions <b>Glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> 50 [*]μg OD provides significant bronchodilation over a 24 [*]hour period, {{and in terms of}} FEV 1 AUC 0 - 24 h is not significantly different than the same total daily dose administered BID. Importantly, OD dosing may confer better patient adherence. The results are consistent with previous <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> studies and support once-daily dosing of <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> 50 [*]μg in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.

DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled study with extended open-label phase. In this article a subanalysis of the open-label phase is presented. METHODS: We included psychiatric patients (18 - 65 year) treated with a stable dosage of clozapine, who were suffering from nocturnal sialorrhoea. In the double-blind phase, patients took once a day 1 mg <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> oral solution or an equal volume placebo solution before the night during 6 days, with a washout period after each treatment period. In the openlabel phase, patients could choose to continue with a double dosage (2 mg). The primary outcome in the open-label phase was the proportion of patients showing a clinically relevant improvement on the severity of complaints of clozapineinduced sialorrhoea (CIS). RESULTS: 10 patients participated in the open-label phase. 3 patients experienced a clinically relevant improvement and 4 patients experienced some improvement on the severity of complaints of CIS after using 2 mg <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide.</b> CONCLUSION: The results of the open-label phase show that <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> may potentially be a solution for patients with complaints of CIS.

The cornerstone of pharmacological treatment for COPD is bronchodilation. Inhaled <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist developed as a maintenance treatment for patients with COPD. Phase III trials have shown that glycopyrronium produces rapid and sustained bronchodilation with an efficacy similar to tiotropium and is well tolerated, with a low incidence of muscarinic side effects in patients with moderate to severe COPD. A combination of <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> with indacaterol maleate (QVA 149) has recently been approved as a once-daily maintenance therapy in adult patients with COPD. Phase III trials (the IGNITE program) with QVA 149 have demonstrated significant improvements in lung function versus placebo, glycopyrronium, and tiotropium in patients with moderate to severe COPD, with no safety concerns of note. Hence QVA 149 is a safe treatment option for moderate to severe COPD patients in whom long-acting muscarinic antagonist monotherapy is inadequate.

As of November 2014, more than 40 countries had approved this medication {{except for the}} USA. This is the first dual bronchodilator in one device. Now, the Breezhaler is the only device that can provide long-acting muscarinic antagonist (<b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide),</b> long-acting beta agonist (indacaterol), and {{a combination of the}} two medications (QVA 149). The choice among the three medications allows a patient to use the same inhalation device even when the regimen is changed from single-bronchodilator therapy to dual-bronchodilator therapy. In addition, the quick bronchodilation effect and once-daily administration can improve patient adherence to medical treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To our knowledge, as of November 2014, the safety and the efficacy of QVA 149 have been evaluated in 14 randomized controlled trials. The 14 trials generally showed good safety profiles, and there were better or not-inferior bronchodilator effects of QVA 149 when compared with placebo, or other inhaled medication. According to the Japanese Respiratory Society guidelines, QVA 149 is {{a combination of the two}} first-line bronchodilators. Our meta-analysis indicated that QVA 149 is superior to the salmeterol–fluticasone combination to treat COPD in respect of the frequency of adverse effects, exacerbation, pneumonia, and improvement of trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1). Thus, we believe that QVA 149 can be a key medication for COPD treatments.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of pulmonary muscarinic receptors with PET {{is still in}} its infancy. Because approximately 70 % of the lungs consists of air and pulmonary muscarinic receptor densities are low, ligands with high receptor affinity are required to obtain reasonable signal-to-noise ratios on PET images. Therefore, the potent C- 11 -labeled muscarinic antagonist N-methyl-piperidin- 4 -yl 2 -cyclohexyl- 2 -hydroxy- 2 -phenylacetate methiodide ([R]-VC- 002) was developed. We administered this radioligand to four healthy human volunteers to examine its suitability for studying pulmonary muscarinic receptors in vivo. Methods: [C- 11]VC- 002 (185 MBq, specific activity > 7. 4 TBq/mmol) was intravenously injected on 2 separate days, with an interval of at least 1 wk. On the first day the volunteers were not pretreated, but on the second day they received the anticholinergic <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Robinul; 2 x 0. 1 mg intravenous) 25 and 30 min before the injection of the radiopharmaceutical. C[O- 15]O scans (approximately 740 MBq [20 mCi] by inhalation) were acquired before the receptor scan to calculate pulmonary blood volume. Results: On PET images of the thorax, the lungs were clearly visible. After the volunteer was pretreated with <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide,</b> pulmonary uptake of the radioligand was reduced to 32 % +/- 12 % of the control value at 60 min postinjection and the lungs could no longer be seen.

The study of interaction between indacaterol and glycopyrronium by BI analysis evidenced an additive effect for FEV 1 between 5  min and 180  min post-inhalation, with synergistic interaction at 15  min post-administration, compared to the bronchodilation induced by these drugs administered alone. This study suggests that the combination ensures a broncholytic effect that is greater than that induced by the single monocomponents...|$|E

The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the clinical studies evaluating the clinical efficacy of the once-daily fixed-dose dual bronchodilator combination of indacaterol and <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> in patients suffering from COPD. Methods: This study comprised a systematic review of randomized controlled trials identified through systematic searches of different databases of published trials. Results: Nine trials (6, 166 participants) were included. Fixed-dose once-daily indacaterol/glycopyrronium seems to be safe and well tolerated in patients with COPD. Compared with single therapy with other long-acting bronchodilators (indacaterol, glycopyrronium, and tiotropium) and fixed-combination long-acting β 2 -agonist/inhaled corticosteroid (salmeterol/fluticasone twice daily), once-daily fixed-dose indacaterol/glycopyrronium has clinically important effects on symptoms, including dyspnea score, health status, level of lung function, and rate of moderate or severe exacerbations in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD (Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] spirometric criteria). Furthermore, a very recent study has shown that fixed-dose indacaterol/glycopyrronium improves exercise endurance time compared with placebo, although no significant difference was observed between fixed-dose indacaterol/glycopyrronium and tiotropium. Conclusion: Fixed-dose indacaterol/glycopyrronium has clinically relevant effects on important COPD outcome measures and is, in general, superior to therapy with a single long-acting bronchodilator (with or without inhaled corticosteroid) indicating long-acting dual bronchodilation as a potential important maintenance therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic COPD, possibly also for the treatment of naïve patients.

40|$|Despite current {{guidelines}} {{and the range}} of available treatments, over a half of patients with asthma continue to suffer from poor symptomatic control and remain at risk of future worsening. Although a number of non-pharmacological measures are crucial for good clinical management of asthma, new therapeutic controller medications will have a role in the future management of the disease. Several long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators are under investigation or are available for the treatment of respiratory diseases, including tiotropium bromide, aclidinium bromide, <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide,</b> glycopyrrolate and umeclidinium bromide, although none is yet licensed for the treatment of asthma. A recent Phase III investigation demonstrated that the once-daily long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator tiotropium bromide improves lung function and reduces the risk of exacerbation in patients with symptomatic asthma, despite the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta(2) -agonists (LABAs). This has prompted the question of what the rationale is for long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators in asthma. Bronchial smooth muscle contraction is the primary cause of reversible airway narrowing in asthma, and the baseline level of contraction is predominantly set by the level of 'cholinergic tone'. Patients with asthma have increased bronchial smooth muscle tone and mucus hypersecretion, possibly as a result of elevated cholinergic activity, which anticholinergic compounds are known to reduce. Further, anticholinergic compounds may also have anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, evidence suggests that long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators might offer benefits for the maintenance of asthma control, such as in patients failing to gain control on ICS and a LABA, or those with frequent exacerbations...|$|E
40|$|The use of muscarinic {{receptor}} antagonists in {{the treatment}} of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is well established. More recently, the potential for long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs) {{in the treatment}} of asthma has also been investigated. While LAMAs offer advantages over short-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists, in terms of a reduced dosing frequency, there remains a need for therapies that improve symptom control throughout both the day and night, provide better management of exacerbations and deliver improved health-related quality of life. Furthermore, the potential for unwanted anticholinergic side effects, particularly cardiovascular effects, remains a concern for this class of compounds. Novel LAMAs in clinical development for the treatment of respiratory disease include: aclidinium bromide, NVA 237 (<b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide),</b> GP-MDI, EP- 101, CHF- 5259, umeclidinium bromide, CHF- 5407, TD- 4208, AZD 8683 and V- 0162. These compounds offer potential advantages in terms of onset of action, symptom control and safety. In addition, a number of LAMAs are also being developed as combination treatments with long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABAs) or inhaled glucocorticosteroids, potentially important treatment options for patients who require combination therapy to achieve an optimal therapeutic response as their disease progresses. More recently, compounds such as GSK 961081 and THRX- 198321 have been identified that combine LAMA and LABA activity in the same molecule, and have the potential to offer the benefits of combination therapy in a single compound. Here, we review novel LAMAs and dual action compounds in clinical development, with a particular focus on how they may address the current unmet clinical needs {{in the treatment of}} respiratory disease, particularly COPD...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sialorrhea affects {{approximately}} 75 % {{of patients}} with Parkinson disease (PD). Sialorrhea is often treated with anticholinergics, but central side effects limit their usefulness. Glycopyrrolate (<b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide)</b> is an anticholinergic drug with a quaternary ammonium structure not able to cross the blood-brain barrier in considerable amounts. Therefore, glycopyrrolate exhibits minimal central side effects, which may be an advantage in patients with PD, of whom a significant portion already experience cognitive deficits. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of glycopyrrolate {{in the treatment of}} sialorrhea in patients with PD. METHODS: We conducted a 4 -week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with oral glycopyrrolate 1 mg 3 times daily in 23 patients with PD. The severity of the sialorrhea was scored on a daily basis by the patients or a caregiver with a sialorrhea scoring scale ranging from 1 (no sialorrhea) to 9 (profuse sialorrhea). RESULTS: The mean (SD) sialorrhea score improved from 4. 6 (1. 7) with placebo to 3. 8 (1. 6) with glycopyrrolate (p = 0. 011). Nine patients (39. 1 %) with glycopyrrolate had a clinically relevant improvement of at least 30 % vs 1 patient (4. 3 %) with placebo (p = 0. 021). There {{were no significant differences in}} adverse events between glycopyrrolate and placebo treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Oral glycopyrrolate 1 mg 3 times daily is an effective and safe therapy for sialorrhea in Parkinson disease. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that glycopyrrolate 1 mg 3 times daily is more effective than placebo in reducing sialorrhea in patients with Parkinson disease during a 4 -week study...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, {{crossover}} study aimed {{to determine the}} dose-response of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (GB) when added to beclometasone dipropionate plus formoterol fumarate (BDP/FF) in patients with COPD. Patients received extrafine GB 12. 5, 25 or 50  μg twice daily (BID) or placebo for 7 days via pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI), and extrafine BDP/FF via pMDI throughout the study. The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of GB plus BDP/FF versus BDP/FF in terms of FEV 1 area under the curve from 0 to 12  h (AUC 0 – 12 h) on Day 7. Secondary endpoints included: FEV 1 AUC 0 – 12 h on Day 1; peak FEV 1 and FVC on Days 1 and 7; and trough (12  h post-dose) FEV 1, FVC and inspiratory capacity (IC) on Days 1 and 7. Of 178 patients randomised (mean age 62. 7 years, post-bronchodilator FEV 1 48. 9 %), 172 (96. 6 %) completed. Mean FEV 1 AUC 0 – 12 h on Day 7 was significantly higher (p <  0. 001) for all GB doses plus BDP/FF compared to BDP/FF alone, with the difference for the 25 and 50  μg BID doses being clinically relevant (i. e., ≥ 100  mL). The results for the other spirometry endpoints {{were consistent with the}} primary endpoint. Adverse events were reported in 7. 4, 5. 7 and 8. 0 % of patients receiving GB 12. 5, 25 and 50  μg BID, respectively, versus 11. 0 % of patients receiving BDP/FF alone. This study confirms the value of adding GB to BDP/FF to improve lung function in COPD patients. The dose of extrafine GB 25  μg BID was associated with the best efficacy/safety profile.

40|$|AbstractThis study characterised the in vitro and in vivo {{profiles}} of two novel long-acting muscarinic antagonists, aclidinium bromide and <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide,</b> using tiotropium bromide and ipratropium bromide as comparators. All four antagonists had high {{affinity for the}} five muscarinic receptor sub-types (M 1 –M 5); aclidinium had comparable affinity to tiotropium but higher affinity than glycopyrronium and ipratropium for all receptors. Glycopyrronium dissociated faster from recombinant M 3 receptors than aclidinium and tiotropium but more slowly than ipratropium; all four compounds dissociated more rapidly from M 2 receptors than from M 3 receptors. In vitro, aclidinium, glycopyrronium and tiotropium had a long duration of action at native M 3 receptors (> 8  h versus 42  min for ipratropium). In vivo, all compounds were equi-potent at reversing acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction. Aclidinium, glycopyrronium and ipratropium had a faster onset of bronchodilator action than tiotropium. Aclidinium had a longer duration of action than glycopyronnium (time to 50 % recovery of effect [t½ offset] =  29  h and 13  h, respectively); these compare with a t½ offset of 64  h and 8  h for tiotropium and ipratropium, respectively. Aclidinium was less potent than glycopyrronium and tiotropium at inhibiting salivation in conscious rats (dose required to produce half-maximal effect [ED 50] =  38, 0. 74 and 0. 88  μg/kg, respectively) and was more rapidly hydrolysed in rat, guinea pig and human plasma compared with glycopyrronium or tiotropium. These results indicate that while aclidinium and glycopyrronium are both potent antagonists at muscarinic receptors with similar kinetic selectivity for M 3 receptors versus M 2, aclidinium has a longer dissociation half-life at M 3 receptors and a longer duration of bronchodilator action in vivo than glycopyrronium. The rapid plasma hydrolysis of aclidinium, coupled to its kinetic selectivity, may confer a reduced propensity for systemic anticholinergic side effects with aclidinium versus glycopyrronium and tiotropium...|$|E
40|$|Bronchodilators {{are central}} in the {{treatment}} of of airways disorders. They are the mainstay of the current management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are critical in the symptomatic management of asthma, although controversies around the use of these drugs remain. Bronchodilators work through their direct relaxation effect on airway smooth muscle cells. at present, three major classes of bronchodilators, β(2) -adrenoceptor (AR) agonists, muscarinic receptor antagonists, and xanthines are available and can be used individually or in combination. The use of the inhaled route is currently preferred to minimize systemic effects. Fast- and short-acting agents are best used for rescue of symptoms, whereas long-acting agents are best used for maintenance therapy. It has proven difficult to discover novel classes of bronchodilator drugs, although potential new targets are emerging. Consequently, the logical approach has been to improve the existing bronchodilators, although several novel broncholytic classes are under development. An important step in simplifying asthma and COPD management and improving adherence with prescribed therapy is to reduce the dose frequency to the minimum necessary to maintain disease control. Therefore, the incorporation of once-daily dose administration is an important strategy to improve adherence. Several once-daily β(2) -AR agonists or ultra-long-acting β(2) -AR-agonists (LABAs), such as indacaterol, olodaterol, and vilanterol, are already in the market or under development for the treatment of COPD and asthma, but current recommendations suggest the use of LABAs only in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid. In addition, some new potentially long-acting antimuscarinic agents, such as <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (NVA- 237), aclidinium bromide, and umeclidinium bromide (GSK 573719), are under development, as well as combinations of several classes of long-acting bronchodilator drugs, in an attempt to simplify treatment regimens as much as possible. This review will describe the pharmacology and therapeutics of old, new, and emerging classes of bronchodilator...|$|E

Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting &beta; 2 -agonists (LABAs) {{are the main}} classes of long-acting bronchodilators. To date, tiotropium is the only once-daily LAMA available for the treatment of COPD. Glycopyrronium is a novel LAMA, currently in development for COPD. Phase II studies have shown that glycopyrronium 50 &micro;g once daily provides clinically significant 24 -hour bronchodilation with a rapid onset of action, which is faster than that of tiotropium, and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The Phase III <b>GLycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> in COPD airWays (GLOW) program has now confirmed the long-term efficacy and tolerability of glycopyrronium 50 &micro;g once daily. The three studies included in this program have further shown that the effect of glycopyrronium versus placebo {{is similar to that of}} tiotropium in reducing dyspnea and the risk of exacerbations, as well as improving lung function, exercise tolerance, and health status in patients with COPD. The safety profile of glycopyrronium is also similar to that of tiotropium in terms of overall incidence of adverse events and muscarinic side effects. Glycopyrronium could be an alternative choice to tiotropium, and like tiotropium, has the potential to be used as a monotherapy or combination therapy. Phase II studies have shown that a fixed-dose combination of glycopyrronium and the 24 -hour LABA indacaterol, produces rapid and sustained bronchodilation compared with indacaterol monotherapy in patients with COPD. Phase III studies are currently ongoing to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of this combination.

40|$|Background: Clozapine is {{the only}} {{medication}} licensed {{for the treatment of}} resistant schizophrenia in the UK. Although efficacious, a common and unpopular side effect of clozapine treatment is clozapine-induced hypersalivation (CIH), which can contribute to non-adherence. The standard treatment for CIH in the UK is hyoscine hydrobromide but this may aggravate cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia while glycopyrrolate may be an effective alternative with a more tolerable side effect profile. There is currently no convincing evidence for hyoscine, or any other medication, as an effective treatment for CIH. Methods/design: This is a multicentre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled feasibility study of <b>glycopyrronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (glycopyrrolate) and hyoscine hydrobromide (hyoscine) in patients with clozapine-induced hypersalivation. We aim to recruit 42 patients who have been prescribed clozapine and are experiencing hypersalivation, and randomise them to one of three study arms (either hyoscine, glycopyrrolate or placebo). The primary outcome measures will be the participant recruitment and attrition rates, and the secondary outcome will be the metrics of the daytime hypersalivation measure. After a one-week washout period (discontinuing CIH medication, if any), there will be a four-week treatment period where participants will be titrated up to the maximum tolerated dose of hyoscine, glycopyrrolate or placebo. Measurements of daytime salivation, nocturnal salivation, cognition and side effects will be taken during home visits in Week 2 and Week 5. Information on salivation and side effects will also be taken through telephone calls in Week 3 and Week 4. To gather information on the experience of study participants, exit interviews will also be requested with all participants who drop out of the study and a sample of participants who complete the study. Discussion: There is currently no convincing evidence for hyoscine, or any other medication, as an effective treatment for CIH. There is promising evidence that glycopyrrolate may be more successful in the treatment of CIH causing fewer cognitive side-effects. We propose to conduct a randomised placebo-controlled feasibility study of glycopyrrolate and hyoscine in the treatment of clozapine-induced hypersalivation to inform the design of a future efficacy trial...|$|E
