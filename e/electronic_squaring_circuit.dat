INTRODUCIION The quarter square principle is a well known technique to realize a multiplier. Various multipliers based on this principle have been reported [l], [2], [3]. For signals in the form of currents the principle can be written as: So, in order to multiply the input currents I, and I, we can square both the sum and the difference of these currents and then subtract the results from eachother. In the next section a suitable current squarer will be described. In section III, two of these <b>squaring</b> <b>circuits</b> will be combined to realize the fourquadrant current multiplier. Section IV describes second-order effects. The results of simulations and measurements on both the <b>squaring</b> <b>circuit</b> and the complete multiplier are presented in section V. n. THE CURRENT-SQUARING CIRCUIT A schematic diagram of the <b>squaring</b> <b>circuit</b> is shown in fig. 1. All transistors are equal and operate in the saturation region. Using a simple square-law model, the drain current of an MOS transistor in the saturation region can be written as: MOS translinear loop [4]. From Kirchhoff s voltage law, it follows that: V,l+ v, 2 = v, 3 + v, 4 (4) (5) If the body-effect is represented as a change in threshold voltage {{as a function of the}} source-bulk voltage it is easily seen that the effect is equal for transistors Mi and M. I and transistors M 2 and Ms Therefore, +v;l will be equal to 6 4 and Vn will be equal to 6 3 and the threshold voltages can be dropped from eqn. (5). If we assume equal transistors and neglect the slight influence of the body-effect on ki, k 2, k 3 and k 4 these factors can also be dropped.
