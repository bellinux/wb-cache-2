40|$|In {{this work}} a {{mathematical}} model initially developed for a counter-current bubble column gas-liquid contactor was examined. The model was developed by a lumped parameter approach to mass transfer with chemical reaction occurring completely within the liquid phase. 2 ̆ 7 An extensive literature review was carried out on gas-liquid mass transfer and in particular ozone-water mass transfer in co-current down flow. There are large gaps {{in the literature on}} this phenomenon, which indicated the need for this kind of study. The mathematical model was applied to study the behaviour of a jet pump contactor. Limited experimentation was carried out to examine some of the important characteristics of the reactor. The co-current downflow reactor was found to operate completely in annular flow with very high gas to liquid volumetric flow ratios (9 to 19). Experimental and model of determination of volumetric mass transfer coefficient revealed an extremely high value (kLa= 230 sec 2 ̆ 2 ^), which was nearly independent of flows or flow ratios. Limited reactor flow pattern modelling, and mass transfer modelling have provided a large scope for future research. The flow pattern modelling of annular flow shows that velocities of the phases in the reactor are very high, and this leads to vastly decreased residence times. The velocities are 10 times those expected fi-om superficial velocity calculations. Modelling has shown that for the jet pump to become successful in microbiol disinfection in cooling tower water, that the residual liquid ozone concentration and/or the reactor residence time needs to be significantly increased to provide adequate CT disinfection criteria.

The formation of clusters of bubbles in a periodic domain and the effect thereof on the rise velocity and effective drag coefficient on the bubbles are studied. Using smaller bubble sizes than presented in our earlier work, we are also able to refine our correlation for the drag coefficient acting on bubbles rising in a swarm, such that it is applicable for a large range of bubble sizes. The simulations are performed with an advanced Front-Tracking model in which Lagrangian marker points are used to track the gas–liquid interface, while accounting for surface tension and substantial interface deformation. Simulations were performed using periodic domains to simulate rising air bubbles in water from 1. 0 mm up to 6. 0 mm in diameter. The effect of liquid phase viscosity was also studied to extend the range of validity of the drag correlation. For the 1. 0 and 1. 5 mm cases, strong horizontal clustering effects are observed. Especially, at high gas fractions, the bubbles tend to form rigid horizontal arrays, which {{have been shown to}} strongly increase the drag force acting on the bubbles in the cluster. For viscous liquids, the tendency to form horizontal clusters is lower, and even vertical clustering is observed. The bubble slip velocity was compared with the experimental results of Zenit et al., which agree very well taking into account the differences between simulations and experiments.

In this work, a fully resolved 3 D Front Tracking model (Van Sint Annaland et al., 2006) is used to derive closures for the drag coefficient in mono-disperse bubble swarms, extending the work by Dijkhuizen et al. (2005) on the drag coefficient on a bubble rising in an initially quiescent liquid. First, it was found that for bubble swarms in relatively viscous liquids, a single bubble in a domain with periodic boundary conditions in all three directions can accurately mimic an infinite swarm of equally sized bubbles. The time averaged drag force coefficient on a single bubble in a periodic domain (mimicking a structured array of bubbles) was equal to the time and number averaged drag force coefficient in case several bubbles were positioned in a periodic domain (mimicking a random array of bubbles). For less viscous liquids, such as water, simulations with several bubbles in a periodic domain are required to accurately determine the drag force coefficient. Front Tracking simulations have been performed for air bubble swarms in two different liquids: a water/glycerol mixture with a viscosity of 0. 10 Pa·s, and water, where the bubble size and void fraction (up to 15 %) were varied. In all cases studied, hindered rise was found (i. e. a higher drag force coefficient of a bubble in a bubble swarm in comparison with the drag force on a single bubble), explained by the increased liquid flow in between the bubbles (see Fig. 1). For bubbles with a larger diameter, the relative increase in experienced drag was lower, which is caused by bubble shape deformation: larger bubbles become more spherical, when they rise in a swarm...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 93 - 106). iv, 106 leaves, bound 29 cmNowadays, {{in order}} to relieve the environmental burden, more and more concerns are concentrated on how to maximally dispose the industrial organic waste. Meanwhile, {{it is expected to}} find a solution which can combine the waste treatment with the production of valuable products. In this way, the high cost of disposal procedures would be effectively cut down by adding extra value in it. The procedure of production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) provides such a beneficial waste treatment which can be applied In various industries, especially in food processing industry where high cost of high BOD wastes treatment is involved (Yu and 51 2001). By using different configurations of bioreactors, several new technologies have been developed demonstrating the feasibility of combining anaerobic digestion of food scraps with aerobic production of biodegradable thermoplastics, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). Yu and his coworkers (1999) reported the effects of superficial gas and liquid velocities on bed expansion, solid and <b>gas</b> <b>hold-ups</b> and specific oxygen mass transfer rate, kLa by using a type of porous glass beads for immobilization of microbial cells in a three-phase aerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) with an external liquid circulation. This is the first attempt to combine the anaerobic/aerobic treatment of wastewater to produce PHAs. Later on, Du and Yu (2002) developed a new technique to connect the anaerobic reactor and the aerobic reactor through a tubular module of silicone rubber membrane or dialysis membrane. Their efforts yielded 72. S% (wt) PHAs In PHA-producing cells which was the highest polymer content achieved in waste treatment since their work were reported. Although waste water process can get great benefits from PHAs production, the major barrier to widely apply the production of PHAs is their high price, which is more than 10 times higher than the price of synthetic counterparts, reported by Yu and 81 (2001). PHAs have attracted academic and industrial attention due to their potential use as biodegradable thermoplastics. The production cost can be Significantly reduced by raising the scale as well as the productivity of bioreactors. Based on this, we investigate a mini-pilot scale bioreactor (SOL), which is promising to be scaled up to 3000 L for PHAs production at a reduced production cost. In this work, a multiple airlifting membrane bioreactor (MAMBR) was designed, fabricated and investigated for operational hydrodynamics and mass transfers (as shown in Flg. 1. 1) ...|$|R

In late 2009, we installed a 0. 5 MWe-scale CO 2 capture pilot plant at Hadong coal-fired power plant in Korea. The pilot plant consists of a transport fluidized-bed carbonator for CO 2 sorption, cyclones for separating gas and solid, a bubbling fluidized-bed regenerator for sorbent regeneration, and a bubbling fluidized-bed sorbent cooler for sorbent cooling. The footprint of the pilot plant was 6 m x 10 m {{and the location of}} that was after Gas Gas Heater of the power plant. Until now, we have performed 100 -day operation campaigns to find out the optimum operating conditions and the scale-up factors for 10 MWe-scale capture process. In the operation campaigns, several operating variables such as the moisture content in the flue <b>gas,</b> the solid <b>hold-up</b> in a carbonator, the solid circulation rate between a carbonator and a regenerator, and the reaction temperatures have been changed in order to investigate the effect of those variables on CO 2 capture and to derive the scale-up factors. It has been proved that above 80 % of CO 2 removal for 50 -hour continuous operation was possible at the optimum operating conditions. At the same time, we set the small scale unit which consists of two bubbling beds for carbonation and regeneration in order to investigate the effect of the H 2 O partial pressure in the regenerator on CO 2 removal. The CO 2 removal in the carbonator increased as the steam mole fraction in the fluidization gas of the regenerator increased, although the content of H 2 O, which is a product component in the regenerator, increased. We proved that the K 2 CO 3 1. 5 H 2 O has been formed in the regenerator by the XRD analysis and TGA analysis of the regenerated sorbent. The formation of K 2 CO 3 1. 5 H 2 O makes the carbonation reaction more active so that the CO 2 removal increased. It is also verified that high-concentrated CO 2 can be recovered when 100 % of H 2 O has been introduced as a steam phase to the regenerator. Thus, we also install the steam injection line to the regenerator in the 0. 5 MWe-scale pilot plant.

The time-course of instantaneous oxygen delivery proportional to the dispersion capacity estimated as <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> is uncovered. The results are presented in the form of contour plots and radial profiles of the local <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> at different bed height positions. The oscillating behaviour of the <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> is illustrated and summarized into oxygen availability plot related to position. Based on the CFD analysis, clues for rational bioprocess performance time-course could be inferred...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{influence}} of elevated pressure and catalyst particle lyophobicity at particle concentrations up to 3 vol % on the hydrodynamics and the gas-to-liquid mass transfer in a slurry bubble column. The study was done with demineralized water (aqueous phase) and Isopar-M oil (organic phase) slurries in a 0. 15 m internal diameter bubble column operated at pressures ranging from 0. 1 to 1. 3 MPa. The overall <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up,</b> the flow regime transition point, the average large bubble diameter, and the centerline liquid velocity were measured along with the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient. The <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> and the flow regime transition point are not influenced by the presence of lyophilic particles. Lyophobic particles shift the regime transition to a higher gas velocity and cause foam formation. Increasing operating pressure significantly increases the <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> and the regime transition velocity, irrespective of the particle lyophobicity. The gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient is proportional to the <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> for all investigated slurries and is not affected by the particle lyophobicity, the particle concentration, and the operating pressure. A correlation is presented to estimate the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient {{as a function of the}} measured gas hold-up: k 1 a 1 / eg = 3. 0 v(Du¿ /d¿) s-...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{computational}} fluid dynamics-population balance model (CFD-PBM) for {{the simulation}} of gas mixing in activated sludge (i. e., an opaque non-Newtonian liquid) {{in a bubble}} column is developed and described {{to solve the problem}} of measuring the hydrodynamic behavior of opaque non-Newtonian liquid-gas two-phase flow. We study the effects of the inlet position and liquid-phase properties (water/activated sludge) on various characteristics, such as liquid flow field, <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up,</b> liquid dynamic viscosity, and volume-averaged bubble diameter. As the inlet position changed, two symmetric vortices gradually became a single main vortex in the flow field in the bubble column. In the simulations, when water was in the liquid phase, the global <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> was higher than when activated sludge was in the liquid phase in the bubble column, and a flow field that was dynamic with time was observed in the bubble column. Additionally, when activated sludge was used as the liquid phase, no periodic velocity changes were found. When the inlet position was varied, the non-Newtonian liquid phase had different peak values and distributions of (dynamic) liquid viscosity in the bubble column, which were related to the <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up.</b> The high <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> zone corresponded to the low dynamic viscosity zone. Finally, when activated sludge was in the liquid phase, the volume-averaged bubble diameter was much larger than when water was in the liquid phase...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> {{and liquid}} {{circulation}} velocity measurements were made using a 167 dm 3 external loop airlift reactor. The gas-separator {{was of the}} open channel configuration. The reactor height was 2. 5 m with riser and downcomer diameters of 0. 19 m and 0. 14 m respectively. The systems investigated were Newtonian air-water and air-glycerol with the superficial air velocity varying between 0. 02 and 0. 12 ms- 1. The ratio of the liquid volume in the gas-separator to the liquid volume in the reactor (volume-ratio) was varied from 0. 0 % to 37 %, to find its minimum critical value for optimum operation of the airlift reactor. For the air-water system, discernible effects of the volume-ratio on riser and, downcomer gas hold-ups and liquid circulation velocity were observed at volume ratios < 7 %. Beyond this value, the volume-ratio had no effect. For a viscous and foaming air-glycerol system the critical volume-ratio was increased to 19 %. New and simple correlations for predicting <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> in the riser, <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> in the downcomer, and liquid circulation velocity were developed with reasonable accuracy. <b>Gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> and liquid circulation velocity measurements were made using a 167 dm 3 external loop airlift reactor.

40|$|Time {{dependent}} <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> {{generated in}} the 0. 3 and 0. 6 m diameter vessels using high viscosity castor oil and carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) solution was compared {{on the basis of}} impeller speed (N) and gas velocity (V-G). Two types of hold-up were distinguished-the hold-up due to tiny bubbles (epsilon(ft)) and total hold-up (epsilon(f)), which included large and tiny bubbles. It was noted that vessel diameter (i. e. the scale of operation) significantly influences (i) the trends and the values of epsilon(f) and epsilon(ft), and (ii) the values of tau (a constant reflecting the time dependency of hold-up). The results showed that a scale independent correlation for <b>gas</b> <b>hold-up</b> of the form epsilon(f) or epsilon(ft) = A(N or P-G/V) (a) (V-G) (b), where "a" and "b" are positive constants is not appropriate for viscous liquids.
