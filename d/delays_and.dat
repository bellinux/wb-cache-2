Retiming is a very effective way for delay optimization for sequential circuits. In this paper we propose a unified framework for multi-level partitioning and floorplanning with retiming, targeting simultaneous <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> power optimization. We first discuss the importance of retiming <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> visible power as opposed to the conventional static <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> total power for sequential circuits.

In GEO-PD, we use retiming based timing analysis and visible power analysis to identify timing and power critical nets and assign proper weights to them to guide the multi-level optimization process. In general, timing and power analysis are done at the original netlist while a recursive multi-level approach performs partitioning and floorplanning on the sub-netlist as well as its coarsened representations.

40|$|We {{tested the}} current model of calcium influx and {{neurotransmitter}} release mechanisms by measuring changes in synaptic <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> amplitude of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs). Changes in calcium influx and neurotransmitter release were generated following {{the application of}} tetraethylammonium bromide (TEA) with 3, 4 -Diaminopyridine (DAP), post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), and temperature variation at the crayfish neuromuscular junction. Previous {{research has shown that}} TEA with 3, 4 -DAP broadens the pre-synaptic action potential, which increases synaptic <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> EPSP amplitude. PTP, however, has been found to increase the rate of calcium influx, thereby decreasing <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> increasing EPSP amplitude. Other research demonstrated that an increase in temperature narrowed pre-synaptic action potentials, which should decrease <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> decrease EPSP amplitude. We hypothesized that these independent variables would have the predicted effects based on the model for both dependent variables: TEA and decreased temperature would increase <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> EPSP amplitude, while PTP would decrease <b>delay</b> <b>and</b> increase EPSP amplitude. Using intracellular recording, we began and ended each trial under normal conditions to establish a baseline and to test the reversibility of each variable. Our results supported the current model that TEA and temperature would increase synaptic <b>delay,</b> <b>and</b> that TEA and PTP would increase EPSP amplitude. However, we found that a decrease in temperature decreased EPSP amplitude and PTP did not significantly decrease delay, signifying that these variables must affect different mechanisms involved in synaptic transmission...|$|R
