40|$|Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative, facultative <b>intracellular</b> <b>bacillus</b> and the {{etiologic}} agent of melioidosis, a severe disease in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Like other multidrug-resistant pathogens, the inherent antibiotic resistance of B. pseudomallei impedes treatment and highlights {{the need for}} alternative therapeutic strategies that can circumvent antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. In this work, we demonstrate that host prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) production plays a regulatory role in the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei. PGE 2 promotes B. pseudomallei intracellular survival within macrophages and bacterial virulence in a mouse model of pneumonic melioidosis. PGE 2 -mediated immunosuppression of macrophage bactericidal effector functions is associated with increased arginase 2 (Arg 2) expression and decreased nitric oxide (NO) production. Treatment with a commercially-available COX- 2 inhibitor suppresses the growth of B. pseudomallei in macrophages and affords significant protection against rapidly lethal pneumonic melioidosis when administered post-exposure to B. pseudomallei-infected mice. COX- 2 inhibition may represent a novel immunotherapeutic strategy to control infection with B. pseudomallei and other intracellular pathogens...|$|E

In a few patients, the {{signs and symptoms of}} the disease {{are similar to those of}} sarcoidosis, and this illness is referred to as sarcoidlike Whipple’s disease. This variant must be recognized because patients with sarcoidlike Whipple’s disease must be treated with antibiotics instead of corticosteroids, which would be indi-cated for patients with true sarcoidosis. We describe a 53 -year-old man who had sarcoidlike Whip-ple’s disease with polyvisceral granulomatous dissemination that was treated with procaine penicillin G and streptomycin followed by doxycycline. His condition initially improved. However, during his 4 -month course of treatment he developed a cerebral relapse; this relapse was successfully treated with ceftriaxone and cefixime. Whipple's disease was ®rst described in 1907 in a patient (calcium level, 3. 16 mmol/L) and an enlarged left inguinal lymph node (biopsy revealed granulomatous adenitis withoutwith polyarthritis, diarrhea, weight loss, and mesenteric lymph-adenopathy [1].

B. mallei is naturally resistant to multiple antibiotics {{and there is}} concern for its potential use as a bioweapon, making {{the development of a}} vaccine against B. mallei of critical importance. We have previously demonstrated that immunization with multivalent outer membrane vesicles (OMV) derived from B. pseudomallei provide significant protection against pneumonic melioidosis. Given that many virulence determinants are highly conserved between the two species, we sought to determine if the B. pseudomallei OMV vaccine could cross-protect against B. mallei. We immunized C 57 Bl/ 6 mice and rhesus macaques with B. pseudomallei OMVs and subsequently challenged animals with aerosolized B. mallei. Immunization with B. pseudomallei OMVs significantly protected mice against B. mallei and the protection observed was comparable to that achieved with a live attenuated vaccine. OMV immunization induced the production of B. mallei-specific serum IgG and a mixed Th 1 /Th 17 CD 4 and CD 8 T cell response in mice. Additionally, immunization of rhesus macaques with B. pseudomallei OMVs provided protection against glanders and induced B. mallei-specific serum IgG in non-human primates. These results demonstrate the ability of the multivalent OMV vaccine platform to elicit cross-protection against closely-related intracellular pathogens and to induce robust humoral and cellular immune responses against shared protective antigens...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Leprosy is {{a chronic}} {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} obligate <b>intracellular</b> <b>bacillus</b> Mycobacterium leprae. Because leprosy diagnosis is complex and requires professional expertise, new tools and methodologies are needed to detect cases in early stages and prevent transmission. The M. leprae genome contains mce 1 A, which encodes a putative mammalian cell entry protein (Mce 1 A). We hypothesised {{that the presence of}} Mce 1 A on the cell surface could be detected by the host's immune system. OBJECTIVE The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate antibody responses against the Mce 1 A protein in leprosy patients, household contacts of patients, and the general population to present an addition tool for leprosy diagnosis. METHODS A cross-sectional study involving 89 volunteers [55 leprosy cases, 12 household contacts (HHC) and 22 endemic controls (EC) ] was conducted at Couto Maia Hospital, in Salvador, Bahia (BA), Brazil. RESULTS The median anti-Mce 1 A IgA was significantly higher in multibacillary (MB) and paucibacillary (PB) cases than in EC (p < 0. 0001). A similar trend was observed in IgM levels, which were significantly higher in both MB (p < 0. 0001) and PB (p = 0. 0006) groups compared to in EC individuals. The greatest differences were observed for IgG class-specific antibodies against Mce 1 A. The median levels of MB and PB were significantly higher compared to both controls HHC and EC (MB or PB vs EC, MB vs HHC p < 0. 0001; PB vs HHC, p = 0. 0013). Among leprosy cases, IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay sensitivity and specificity were 92. 7 % and 97. 1 %, respectively.

However, the in situ evaluation of NFκB activity in leprosy has not been completed previously. The aim of this study was to determine whether NFκB activity correlates with susceptibility or resistance to Mycobacterium leprae infection in biopsies from skin lesions of 38 patients with the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of leprosy. Methods: The NFκB activation profile was evaluated in biopsies from skin lesions of 38 patients with the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of leprosy. NFκB activation was evaluated and quantified by Southwestern histochemistry, and its activation index (range, 0 – 4) was calculated according to the percentage of nuclear positivity by the histochemistry. Activation index > 1 was considered representative of activation of NFκB. Results: Fifteen patients (39. 5 %) demonstrated activated NFκB. Multibacillary leprosy was associated with activated NFκB (54. 5 %, P= 0. 028). Borderline leprosy was most strongly associated with NFκB activation (80 %), with an odds ratio of 32. 7 (P= 0. 016). These clinical forms are characterized by increased susceptibility to M. leprae and by immunological instability. Activation of NFκB was absent in the granulomas in tuberculoid leprosy, which represents an effective inflammatory reaction pattern against M. leprae. Conclusion: These results indicate that NFκB activation could favor susceptibility and immunological instability to M. leprae infection, potentially by the stimulation of phagocytosis and the regulation of apoptotic mechanisms of infected cells, leading to the proliferation of this <b>intracellular</b> <b>bacillus.</b> Further studies are needed to evaluate if inhibition of NFκB activation in multibacillary leprosy could favor resistance and an effective granulomatous immune response.

40|$|Pathogenic Mycobacteria {{are among}} the most unrelenting {{pathogens}} known to mankind as one-third of the world population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of pulmonary tuberculosis. Despite many species of mycobacteria elicits robust host T cell responses as well as production of cytokines like interferon-γ (IFN- γ) that are essential for the control of infection, the mounted immune response contain, but does not eliminate the infection. One potential mechanism by which mycobacteria may achieve a state of long-term persistence amid a robust host immune response is by modulating the signaling cascades leading to macrophage activation. Activation of proinflammatory responses by the host macrophages upon infection with mycobacteria requires the involvement of a variety of signaling events. Studies have indicated that macrophages infected with pathogenic mycobacteria produce significantly less tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and other proinflammatory molecules compared with infection with nonpathogenic mycobacteria, which likely play a role in enhancing mycobacterial survival in vivo. Furthermore, macrophages infected with mycobacteria become refractory to many cytokines including IFN-γ and modulation of host cell signaling responses is critical for the suppression of a generalized inflammatory response which might influence the persistence of mycobacteria within the host. In this context, Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 3, a member of SOCS family function as negative regulators of multiple cytokine and toll like receptor induced signaling. The SOCS 3 has been shown to specifically inhibit signaling by IFN-γ, IL- 6 family of cytokines and can act as a negative regulator of inflammatory responses. In this regard, many species of mycobacteria including M. bovis BCG triggers the inducible expression of SOCS 3. Further, {{it has been suggested that}} M. bovis BCG triggered SOCS 3 and SOCS 1 proteins leads to the inhibition of IFN- γ stimulated JAK/STAT signaling in macrophages. Albeit JAK/STAT signaling pathway is generally believed to be involved, STAT-independent signals are suggested to take part in the induction of SOCS proteins in many systems signifying the involvement of multiple signal pathways in regulation of SOCS expression. Further little is known about the early, receptor proximal signaling mechanisms underlying mycobacteria-mediated induction of SOCS 3. Albeit mycobacteria reside within phagolysosomes of the infected macrophages, many cell wall antigens like LAM, PIM, TDM, PE family antigens etc are released and traffic out of the mycobacterial phagosome into endocytic compartments as well as can gain access to the extra cellular environment in the form of exocytosed vesicles. In this context, PIM represent a variety of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIM) 1 - 6 containing molecules and are integral component of the mycobacterial envelope. PIM are suggested to be the common anchor of LM and LAM as PIM, LM, and LAM originate from identical biosynthetic pathway. PIM are present in virulent M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv as well as in M. bovis BCG and a number of biological functions have been recently credited to PIM 2. PIM 2 is suggested to trigger the activation of cells via Toll like receptor (TLR) - 2 and stimulation resulted in activation of NF-κB, AP- 1, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. PIM 2 induces proinflammatory stimuli such as TNF-α and IL- 12 in murine and human macrophages in a TLR 2 dependent manner. PIM exhibited pulmonary granuloma-forming activities as well as was shown to be responsible for the recruitment of NKT cells to granulomas. Accordingly, mycobacterial envelope antigen PIM 2 could initiate or affect the inflammatory responses similar to mycobacteria bacilli. In this perspective, we explored whether M. bovis BCG or novel cell surface antigens like PIM 2 or Rv 0978 c, a PE-PGRS protein with unknown function can contribute to M. bovis BCG triggered molecular signaling events leading to SOCS 3 expression in macrophages. Our studies clearly demonstrated that M. bovis BCG can trigger SOCS 3 expression in macrophages. The inception of signaling by M. bovis BCG is TLR 2 -MyD 88 dependent, but not TLR 4 dependent. The perturbation of TLR 2 signaling and the downregulation of MyD 88 resulted in significant decrease in SOCS 3 expression implicating the role of TLR 2 -MyD 88 axis in M. bovis BCG triggered signaling. Experiments with cycloheximide and neutralizing antibodies to IL- 10 evinced that M. bovis BCG triggered SOCS 3 expression is a primary response and requires direct activation of signaling cascades. In the current study, we show for the first time that infection of macrophages with M. bovis BCG activates NOTCH 1 signaling events, which leads to expression of SOCS 3. The perturbation of NOTCH signaling in infected macrophages either by siRNA mediated down regulation of NOTCH 1 or RBP-Jk or by inhibition with pharmacological inhibitor gamma secretase-I, resulted in the marked reduction in the expression of SOCS 3. Further, the enforced expression of the NOTCH 1 intracellular domain (NICD) in RAW 264. 7 macrophages induces the expression of SOCS 3, which can be further potentiated by M. bovis BCG. Furthermore, the inhibition of TLR 2 signaling by a TLR 2 dominant-negative construct resulted in inhibition of NOTCH 1 activation. Additionally, our results demonstrates for the first time that physical association of TLR 2 with both Phosphoinositide- 3 Kinase (PI 3 K) and NOTCH 1, which suggest the significant role of TLR 2 triggering by of M. bovis BCG in the activation of PI 3 K and NOTCH 1. More importantly, signaling perturbations data suggest the involvement of cross-talk among the members of PI 3 K and MAPK cascades with NOTCH 1 signaling in SOCS 3 expression. In addition, SOCS 3 expression requires the NOTCH 1 mediated recruitment of CSL/RBP-Jk and Nuclear Factor-B (NF-B) to the SOCS 3 promoter. A number of biological functions triggered by mycobacteria are often attributed to many of the cell wall antigens. As part of our current investigation, we explored whether two novel cell wall associated antigens namely PIM 2 and a PE-PGRS antigen, Rv 0978 c could play as significant or crucial cell wall ingredients which imparts ability to M. bovis BCG to trigger activation of NOTCH signaling leading to SOCS 3 expression. Akin to M. bovis BCG, PIM 2 activates NOTCH 1 signaling resulting NICD formation which leads to the expression of SOCS 3 in a TLR 2 -MyD 88 dependent manner. PIM 2 mediated NOTCH 1 activation, both directly influences the SOCS 3 expression by serving as coactivator in RBP-Jk complex and indirectly triggers SOCS 3 expression by activating PI 3 K-MAPK-NF-κB cascade. One important outcome of the genome sequencing project of M. tuberculosis was the discovery of two new multigene families designated PE and PPE, named for the Pro-Glu (PE) and Pro-Pro-Glu (PPE) motifs near the N-terminus of their gene products. Many PE and PPE proteins are composed only of PE or PPE homologous domains. However, in other proteins, the PE domain is often linked to a unique domain of various lengths that is rich in alanine and glycine amino acids, termed the PGRS domain (PE-PGRS subfamily). PE family genes were suggested to play roles in the virulence of the pathogen and many members of PE family proteins are reported be localized on the surface of M. tuberculosis bacilli. Some of the PE proteins may play a role in immune evasion and antigenic variation or may be linked to virulence. Additionally, it has been suggested that the PE-PGRS subfamily of PE genes is enriched in genes with a high probability of being essential for M. tuberculosis. The uniqueness of the PE genes is further illustrated by the fact that these genes are restricted to mycobacteria. However, despite their abundance in mycobacteria, very little is known regarding the expression or the functions of PE family genes. In this context, we have chosen to study Rv 0978 c as a typical member of PE-PGRS family based on the following observations. Rv 0978 c was upregulated in TB bacilli upon infection of macrophages. Rv 0978 c was demonstrated to be a member of a group of genes called in vivo-expressed genomic island, which were shown to be upregulated in M. tuberculosis bacilli during infection of mice. Rv 0978 c was also shown to be upregulated, at least eightfold, in human brain microvascular endothelial cell-associated M. tuberculosis infection, suggesting a role for endothelial cell invasion and intracellular survival. In the current investigation, we have demonstrated that Rv 0978 c is hypoxia responsive gene based on promoter analysis and upregulated in M. tuberculosis during the infection of macrophages. Further, Rv 0978 c is associated with cell wall and is exposed outside the surface of the bacterium suggesting the possible access to intracellular compartments of the infected macrophages. In this perspective, our results clearly demonstrate that Rv 0978 c triggers SOCS 3 expression by activating PI 3 K-ERK 1 / 2 -NF-B cascade in mouse macrophages. Additionally, Rv 0978 c elicited humoral antibody reactivities in a panel of human sera or in cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained from different clinical categories of tuberculosis patients. DNA immunizations experiments in mice clearly suggested that Rv 0978 c is an immunodominant antigen demonstrating significant T cell and humoral reactivites. These observations clearly advocate that Rv 0978 c protein is expressed in vivo during active infection with M. tuberculosis and that the Rv 0978 c is immunogenic. These results clearly describe the cross-talk of NOTCH 1 signaling with signaling pathways like PI 3 K and MAPK pathways during infection of macrophages with M. bovis BCG eventually resulting in regulation of specific gene expressions, such as SOCS 3. These observations lead to a possibility of differential effects of NOTCH 1 signaling activated upon infection by an <b>intracellular</b> <b>bacillus,</b> which could be involved in modulation of macrophage functions depending on a local immunological milieu. Taken together, our findings suggest that, induction of Suppressors of Cytokine Signaling 3 molecule by M. bovis BCG or by its cell wall antigens represents a crucial immune subversion mechanism in order to suppress or attenuate host responses to cytokines to generate the conditions that favor survival of the mycobacteria...|$|E
40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) {{plays an}} essential role in the immunologic maintenance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Although an increased rate of tuberculosis has been reported in humans treated with anti-TNF biological agents, disparate rates of disease have been observed between those treated with infliximab, an anti-TNF antibody, and etanercept, a TNF-neutralizing TNF receptor (TNFR) fusion molecule. We compared the effects of anti-TNF antibody and soluble TNFR fusion molecule in the murine model of tuberculosis. Systemic TNF neutralization was equivalent between these molecules, and both resulted in rapid morbidity at the initiation of infection. During chronic infection, administration of the receptor fusion molecule allowed the control of infection, whereas antibody treatment caused mice to die within a month. We provide evidence of decreased penetration into the granulomas by the receptor fusion molecule, compared with antibody. These findings begin to clarify the mechanistic difference between anti-TNF agents and their role in the exacerbation of tuberculosis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 58 -year-old man {{with a history of}} primary tuberculosis receiving adalimumab in combination with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis for almost 1 year consulted for a febrile inflammatory plaque on the left leg with a small central necrotic area. An enlarged left inguinal lymph node was present. Doxycycline has previously been prescribed for a tick bite. The lymphadenopathy gradually became enlarged resulting in skin fistulisation. After surgical excision, histopathology revealed epithelioid granulomas accompanied by giant cells and central necrosis. Mycobacterial cultures were negative. Positive tularaemia serology at significant titres suggested a diagnosis of tularaemia, with probable transmission via a tick bite. The diagnosis was confirmed by F. tularensis DNA amplification using PCR on a lymph node biopsy. Doxycycline was continued for a further 6 weeks. One year later, no relapse had occurred. DISCUSSION: A febrile adenopathy presenting the histological features of necrotic granulomas in a patient receiving anti-TNF alpha treatment initially suggested reactivation of tuberculosis. However, the history of tick bite and failure to isolate mycobacteria from different tissue specimens prompted screening for a tick-borne disease, finally leading to a diagnosis of tularaemia.

Loss of IFNγR 1 expression had no influence on the macrophage differentiation potential of patient-specific iPSCs. In contrast, lack of IFNγR 1 in iMSMD-cohet macrophages abolished IFNγ-dependent phosphorylation of STAT 1 and induction of IFNγ-downstream targets such as IRF- 1, SOCS- 3, and IDO.

Even in human cells, however, lysis of the DCs does not occur for at least 24 hours which may allow DCs time to participate in the transition from innate to adaptive immunity (145). The primary polyphenol in green tea extract is the catechin (-) -epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) which accounts for most of the numerous reported biological effects of green tea catechins, including anti-bacterial, anti-tumor, and neuroprotective effects. Primary murine bone marrow derived DCs from BALB/c mice were treated in vitro with Lp, or stimulated for comparison with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CD 11 c, considered an important marker of mouse DCs, and surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD 40, CD 80, CD 86, as well as class I/ II MHC molecules was determined by flow cytometry. Treatment of the cells with EGCG inhibited the microbial antigen induced up-regulation of CD 11 c, CD 40, CD 80, CD 86 and MHC I/ II molecules. EGCG also inhibited, in a dose dependent manner, induced production of the Th 1 helper cell activating cytokine, IL- 12, and the chemokines RANTES, MIP 1 a, and MCP- 1. However, EGCG upregulated TNFa production. In addition, EGCG inhibited both Lp and LPS induced expression of both TLR 2 and TLR 4 as well as LPS-induced NF-kB activation; all of which are important mediators of DC maturation.

Given the central role of DC in the initiation and regulation of the host immune response, the studies described in this dissertation examined the modulation of DC by M. paratuberculosis, and also the effects of M. paratuberculosis vaccination on the DC function upon M. paratuberculosis challenge.;M. paratuberculosis infected monocyte-derived DC showed some evidences of maturation, but infected DC were unable to present antigen via MHC II and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. Secondly, M. paratuberculosis subcutaneous infection model system was used to study DC function in M. paratuberculosis infection in vivo. Compared to M. paratuberculosis vaccine induced granulomas, CD 11 c+ DC-like cells were present in lower numbers and had an incomplete maturation phenotype within M. paratuberculosis induced granulomas. These DC-like cells induced antigen-specific CD 4 T cell response while providing poor co-stimulation and cytokine signals. Thirdly, the maturation status and function of DC in the lymph node draining M. paratuberculosis infection site (CLN) were determined. Greater numbers of CD 11 c+ cells and B cells were found in the CLN in vaccinated animals compared to the CLN in non-vaccinated animals. These DC-like cells had a mature phenotype and produced high levels of IL- 12 and IL- 10. Vaccinated animals CLN had high CD 4 T lymphocyte recall response upon antigen-loaded DC re-stimulation and produced high levels of IFN-gamma and IL- 4.;Taken together, the studies in this dissertation demonstrate that M. paratuberculosis infects DC and results in impaired or incomplete DC activation and maturation. M. paratuberculosis infected DC are unable to provide optimal co-stimulatory and cytokine signals to antigen-specific T lymphocytes, resulting in low IFN-gamma production.

Furthermore, IFNs {{have been used as}} immunoadjuvants for treatment of another intracellular pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We established a model of B. anthracis infection with the Sterne strain (34 F 2) which contains lethal toxin (LeTx). 34 F 2 was lethal to murine and human macrophages. Treatment with IFNs significantly improved cell viability and reduced the number of germinated intracellular spores. Infection with 34 F 2 failed to induce the latent transcription factors signal transducer and activators of transcription 1 (STAT 1) and ISGF- 3, which are central to the IFN response. Furthermore, 34 F 2 reduced STAT 1 activation in response to exogenous alpha/beta IFN, suggesting direct inhibition of IFN signaling. Even though 34 F 2 has LeTx, there was no mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 cleavage and p 38 was normally induced, suggesting that these early effects of B. anthracis infection in macrophages are independent of LeTx.
