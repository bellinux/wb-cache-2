It is found that midtropospheric <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> and quasigeostrophic vertical motions can be diagnosed from microwave temperature measurements of only two deep layers. The lower- (1000 - 400 hPa) and upper- (400 - 50 hPa) layer temperatures are estimated from limb-corrected TIROS-N Microwave Sounding Units (MSU) channel 2 and 3 data, spatial fields of which can be used to estimate the midtropospheric thermal wind and <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> fields. Together with Trenberth's simplification of the quasigeostrophic omega equation, these two quantities can be then used to estimate the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> advection by the thermal wind, which is related to the quasigeostrophic vertical velocity in the midtroposphere. Critical to the technique is the observation that <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> fields calculated from the channel 3 temperature features are very similar to those calculated from traditional, "bottom-up " integrated height fields from radiosonde data. This suggests a lack of cyclone-scale height features {{near the top of the}} channel 3 weighting function, making the channel 3 cyclone-scale "thickness " features approximately the same as height features near the bottom of the weighting function. Thus, the MSU data provide observational validation of the LID (level of insignificant dynamics) assumption of Hirshberg and Fritsch_ 1. Introduction an...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the numerical simulations of explosive cyclones using a very high resolution non-hydrostatic model with explicit precipitation physics. Two major aspects of the work are: (1) to explore the importance of various model parameters which lead to the rapid intensification of the surface cyclone through sensitivity tests, and (2) to unravel the cause-effect relations responsible for rapid surface pressure falls through a study of the heat budget, <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> budget, and a Lagrangian trajectory analysis of the simulated cyclone. The results from six experiments are presented. The main conclusions are: (a) By using analytic initial conditions based on typical wintertime conditions prior to explosive cyclogenesis, it is possible to obtain very realistic simulations of rapid cyclogenesis. (b) The use of high horizontal resolution is important in simulating the mesoscale features of rapidly deepening cyclones. In particular, the structure of the intense warm front observed ahead of the cyclone is very sensitive to changes in horizontal resolution. (c) The destabilization of the lower troposphere prior to the period of rapid deepening is essential in the formation of an extremely intense frontal structure, which in turn is instrumental in the rapid spinup of the storm. (d) In the presence of strong surface fluxes, the development of the simulated cyclone is affected by the depth of the planetary boundary layer. A detailed diagnosis of the control case is then presented. Quasi-Lagrangian heat budgets are calculated for several vertical columns about the vortex center. Very large variations in the heating were found to occur over a relatively small horizontal distance of 180 km. The reason for the mesoscale variations was traced to the intense warm front ahead of the cyclone and the bent-back warm front trailing behind the surface vortex. The results of the heat budget were then used in the interpretation of the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> budget. It was found that the primary mechanism for <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> growth at the surface is through horizontal variations in the horizontal potential temperature advection. In particular, the timing of the most rapid surface <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> growth coincided with the formation of the bent-back warm front. Although the forcing from diabatic heating is large, it is nearly cancelled by the forcing from vertical advection of potential temperature. Instantaneous surface fluxes of sensible heat provide very little direct generation of <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity.</b> The airflow {{in the vicinity of the}} intense warm front was diagnosed by a fully Lagrangian trajectory analysis. A schematic flow diagram is presented which illustrates the overturning of the air in the warm front. Calculations on the evolution of the circulation for closed loops of air parcels indicate that the warm front is responsible for the generation of large vorticity values at the surface...|$|E

40|$|The {{modification}} of near-surface near-inertial oscillations (NIOs) by the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> is studied globally from an observational standpoint. Surface drifter {{are used to}} estimate NIO characteristics. Despite its spatial resolution limits, altimetry is used to estimate the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity.</b> Three characteristics of NIOs are considered: the relative frequency shift {{with respect to the}} local inertial frequency; the near-inertial variance; and the inverse excess bandwidth, which is interpreted as a decay time scale. The geostrophic mesoscale flow shifts the frequency of NIOs by approximately half its vorticity. Equatorward of 30 °N and S, this effect is added to a global pattern of blue shift of NIOs. While the global pattern of near-inertial variance is interpretable in terms of wind forcing, it is also observed that the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> organizes the near-inertial variance; it is maximum for near zero values of the Laplacian of the vorticity and decreases for nonzero values, albeit not as much for positive as for negative values. Because the Laplacian of vorticity and vorticity are anticorrelated in the altimeter data set, overall, more near-inertial variance is found in anticyclonic vorticity regions than in cyclonic regions. While this is compatible with anticyclones trapping NIOs, the organization of near-inertial variance by the Laplacian of vorticity is also in very good agreement with previous theoretical and numerical predictions. The inverse bandwidth is a decreasing function of the gradient of vorticity, which acts like the gradient of planetary vorticity to increase the decay of NIOs from the ocean surface. Because the altimetry data set captures the largest vorticity gradients in energetic mesoscale regions, it is also observed that NIOs decay faster in large geostrophic eddy kinetic energy region...|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} tool DIONYSOS {{is presented in}} this paper. DIONYSOS is a diagnostic package specifically adapted to standard output from numerical weather prediction models that allows for the interpretation of significant parameters related to weather systems such as development (vorticity, <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> and height tendencies), vertical motion, divergence and temperature tendencies. It {{is based on a}} generalized omega equation, the full vorticity equation, the thermodynamic equation and a nonlinear balance equation. The current version of DIONYSOS computes the contributions of an extensive set of individual dynamical and thermodynamical forcings, which include vorticity and temperature advections, latent and sensible heatings, friction and orography to the parameters mentioned above. In addition, contributions from specific regions of the atmosphere can be computed separately. Because some of the forcings are not available from standard model output, they are parameterized using available fields. A complete description of the diagnostic equations set, the parameterization methods and the computational techniques are presented. To evaluate the diagnostic performance, statistical quantities are calculated for a pair of nine synoptic times from two 24 -hour simulations: a winter case (‘Lothar’) and a summer case.

40|$|The {{process of}} alignment, a new {{fundamental}} interaction between vortices in a stratified and rapidly rotating fluid, is defined and studied {{in detail in}} the context of the two-layer quasi-geostrophic model. Alignment occurs when two vortices in different density layers coalesce by reducing their horizontal separation. It is found that only vortices whose radii are comparable with or larger than the Rossby deformation radius can align. In the same way as the merger process (in a single two dimensional layer) is related to the reverse energy cascade of two-dimensional turbulence, <b>geostrophic</b> potential <b>vorticity</b> alignment is related the barotropic-to baroclinic energy cascade of geostrophic turbulence in two layers. It is also shown how alignment is intimately connected with the existence of two-layer doubly connected <b>geostrophic</b> potential <b>vorticity</b> equilibria (V-states), for which the analysis of the geometry of the stream function in the corotating frame is found to be a crucial diagnostic.

40|$|Abstract. Two extratropical marine {{cyclones}} {{and their}} associated frontal features are examined by computing surface pressure fields from NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) winds. A variational method solves {{for a new}} surface pressure field by blending high-resolution (25 kIn) relative vorticity computed along the satellite track with an initial <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> field. Employing this method with each successive pass of the satellite over the study area allows this surface pressure field to evolve as dictated by the relative vorticity patterns computed from NSCA T winds. The result is a high-resolution surface pressure field that captures features such as fronts and low-pressure centers in more detail than National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalyses. While using the actual relative vorticity to adjust the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> ignores the ageostrophy of surface winds, which can be significant {{in the vicinity of}} fronts and jet streaks, it is a necessary approximation given that the technique uses only surface data. The NSCAT surface pressure fields prove to be nearly as accurate as NCEP reanalyses when compared to ship and buoy observations, which is an encouraging result given that NCEP reanalyses incorporate a myriad of data sources and the NSCA T fields rely primarily on one source. In addition, the high-resolution relative vorticity fields computed from NSCAT winds reveal the location of surface fronts in great detail. These fronts are verified using NCEP analyses, in situ data, and satellite imagery. 1...|$|E
40|$|Separate vector {{expressions}} for {{the rate}} of change of direction of the potential temperature gradient vector resulting from the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> and geostrophic deformation, referred to as QVR and QDR, respectively, are derived. The evolution of the thermal structure and forcing for quasigeostrophic vertical motion in an occluded cyclone are investigated by examining the distributions of QVR and QDR and their respective convergences. The dynamics of two common structural transformations observed in the evolution of occluded cyclones are revealed by consideration of these separate forcings. First, the tendency for the sea level pressure minimum to deepen northward and/or westward into the cold air west of the triple point is shown to be controlled by the convergence of QVR, which is mathematically equivalent to thermal wind advection of <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity,</b> a well-accepted mechanism for forcing of synoptic-scale vertical motion. Second, the lengthening of the occluded thermal ridge and surface occluded front are forced by the nonfrontogenetic geostrophic deformation, which rotates the cold frontal zone cyclonically while it rotates the warm frontal zone anticyclonically. The net result is a squeezing together of the two frontal zones along the thermal ridge and a lengthening of the occluded thermal ridge. The associated convergence of QDR along the axis of the the thermal ridge also forces vertical motion on a frontal scale. This vertical motion accounts for the clouds and precipitation often observed to extend from the triple point westward to the sea level pressure minimum in the northwest quadrant of occluding cyclones. 1...|$|E

Comparisons with mean currents and sea surface temperature gradients confirm the identification of these features as jets, and confirm the existence of several Southern Ocean jets unresolved by drifter data.

40|$|Diagnostic {{studies of}} ocean {{dynamics}} {{based on the}} analysis of oceanographic cruise data are usually quite sensitive to observation errors, to the station distribution and to the synopticity of the sampling. Here we present an error analysis {{of the first two}} sources. The third one is evaluated in Part II of this work (J. Mar. Sys. (2005), this issue). For observed variables and those linearly related to them, we use the Optimal Statistical Interpolation (OI) formulation. For variables which are not linearly related to observed variables (e. g., the vertical velocity), we carry out numerical experiments in a consistent way with OI statistics. Best results are obtained when some kind of scale selection or spatial filtering is applied in order to suppress small scales that cannot be properly resolved by the station distribution. The formulation is first applied to a high resolution (SeaSoar) sampling aimed to the recovery of mesoscale features in a region of large spatial variability (noise-to-signal fraction of the order of 0. 002). Fractional errors (rms error divided by the standard deviation of the field) are estimated in about 2 % for dynamic height and between 4 % and 20 % for <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> and vertical velocity. For observed variables, observation errors and sampling limitations are shown to contribute in similar amounts to total errors. For derived variables, sampling errors are by far the dominant contribution. For less dense samplings (e. g., equally spaced CTD stations), fractional errors are about 6 % for dynamic height and between 15 % and 30 % for <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> and vertical velocity. For this sampling strategy, errors of all variables are mostly associated with sampling limitations. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

This pattern is present in daily tropospheric meridional cross-sections. The reasons for the disappearance of bifurcation in the time-and-longitude averaged distributions are discussed.

This vector {{form of the}} geostrophic forcing in the geopotential tendency equation {{is similar to the}} Q-vector form of thew equation. It is shown that the horizontal components of Pare the advection of geostrophic momentum, and the vertical component of P is the horizontal temperature advection. The P vectors are shown to be related to Q and C vectors, as well as the ageostrophic circulation. The three-dimensional pseudocurl of the P vector gives the C vector that equals the ageostrophic pseudovorticity in the quasigeostrophic model. The horizontal components of the pseudocurl of P are perpendicular and proportional to the Q. The horizontal divergence of the P vector is the <b>geostrophic</b> absolute <b>vorticity</b> advection while the three-dimensional divergence of the P vector is the <b>geostrophic</b> quasigeostrophic potential <b>vorticity</b> advection. The ageostrophic wind can be partitioned into the P vector (geostrophic advective) and isallobaric wind contributions. A numerical simulation of an idealized cyclone is used to characterize the distribution of the P vectors and P-vector diagnostics in order to demonstrate their potential application to the diagnosis of synoptic-scale circulations. The distribution of the P vectors clearly indicates the advections of geostrophic momentum and temperature that characterize cyclogenesis. An examination of the P vectors and the isallobaric wind demonstrates that the P vectors provide insight into the ageostrophic circulation of the cyclone. Diagnoses of the three-dimensional P-vector divergence and curl are shown to produce useful depictions of cyclonic vortex spinup and the propagation of both the large- and smaller-scale features of the system. These diagnostics can be interpreted from a variety of perspectives, including the height tendency and the advection of quasigeostrophic potential vorticity [...] The use of P vectors to diagnose synoptic-scale circulations appears to provide potentially useful insights into the dynamics of synoptic-scale disturbances not readily obtained from other diagnoses...|$|R

40|$|To {{identify}} oceanic mononuclear mesoscale eddies, a threshold-free {{splitting method}} was developed {{based on the}} watershed. Because oceanic eddies are similar to plateaus and basins in {{the map of the}} sea level anomaly (SLA) data, the natural divisions of the basins are the watersheds between them. The splitting algorithm is based on identifying these watersheds by finding the path of steepest descent. Compared to previous splitting methods, the proposed splitting algorithm has some advantages. First, there are no artificial parameters. Second, the algorithm is robust; the splitting strategy is independent of the algorithm and procedure and automatically guarantees that the split mononuclear eddies are simply connected pixel sets. Third, the new method is very fast, and the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of multinuclear eddy pixels; each pixel is scanned only once for splitting, regardless of how many extremes there are. Fourth, the algorithm is independent of parameters; the strategy can potentially be applied to any possible physical parameters (e. g.

The model is valid for large variations in the Coriolis parameter and layer thickness, typical of dynamics at the gyre scale and larger, {{as well as for}} mesoscale dynamics in which the advection of relative vorticity cannot be neglected. For length scales much larger than the deformation radius the dominant balances in the model equations are those of the planetary geostrophic equations, whereas for synoptic scales the dynamics of the model are asymptotically close to those of the quasigeostrophic equations. The model consists of the advection of a <b>geostrophic</b> potential <b>vorticity,</b> and is is therefore conceptually simple and numerically easy to implement, requiring the solution of just one linear elliptic equation each time step. It is compared to the shallow-water equations and various other approximate models in order to assess its validity for modeling meso- and large-scale dynamics. Simulations are performed in both a periodic channel and also in a closed domain with wind stress forcing. The formulation is found to yield a substantial improvement in the qualitative nature of the circulation patterns, and in quantitative accuracy, over the planetary geostrophic and (especially) the quasigeostrophic equations, while still retaining much of the conceptual simplicity of those equations. 1...|$|R

The adjustment {{rate of the}} boundary layer flow to the pressure gradient field {{is found to be}} proportional to the strength of the coupling between the flow and boundary stresses. The angle between the steady flow and geostrophic wind is also proportional to the strength of this coupling. The relationship of the transient component of the boundary layer wind to the “frictionless” transient wind component is found to be similar to the relationship of the steady boundary layer wind to the geostrophic wind. In flows characterized by transient Rossby number of order unity or greater, the production of cross-isobar mass transport is more sensitive to local accelerations than to typical variations of the surface drag coefficient. The transient portion of the vertical motion field, associated with the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>vorticity</b> tendency, is important when the time scale of the pressure gradient is comparable to or smaller than the boundary layer adjustment time scal...|$|E

Three typical paths (the looping path, the leaking path, and the leaping path) were identified {{based on the}} KSI derived from the weekly satellite Absolute Dynamic Topography from 1993 to 2008. The KSI has a near normal distribution. Using ± 1 standard deviation (σ) as the thresholds, the leaking path is the most frequent form with the probability of occurrence at 68. 2 %, while the probabilities of occur-rence for the looping path and the leaping path are 16. 4 % and 15. 4 %, respectively. Similar analysis is also conducted on the daily Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) Global Analysis from 2004 to 2008.

This eddy, which constitutes the strongest signal detected in the Baleanric basin since altimetric data are available, appeared in September 1998 to the northwest of Menorca Island and remained almost in the same location until its disappearance in March 1999. The paper focuses mainly on identifying the conditions {{that led to the}} eddy formation and on the description of its evolution and sudden disappearance. Derived variables such as <b>geostrophic</b> velocity or <b>vorticity</b> are computed to complement the hydrographic and dynamical information provided by observed variables. Also, meteorological data are examined related to the main hypothesis made for the origin of the eddy. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A multivariate (MV) optimal {{statistical}} {{interpolation method}} {{is applied to}} conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) and ship-mounted acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) data from quasi-synoptic oceanographic surveys. MV analysis aims to improve the spatial interpolation of any particular variable (e. g., dynamic height) by including in the analysis observations of other physically related variables (e. g., current). The version used in this work also provides estimates of the non-divergent and irrotational components of the flow. The method is tested in a sharp frontal region {{to the north of}} the Western Alboran gyre. After deriving the optimal analysis parameters, we first show that MV statistical dynamic height analysis errors are significantly smaller than those derived from univariate (UV) analysis. In our region, this translates in a more realistic shape for the <b>geostrophic</b> relative <b>vorticity</b> and the vertical velocity field. The latter peaks at about 45 m/day (as given by the quasi-geostrophic omega equation), with a tendency for light water to be upwelled upstream of the gyre while denser water is downwelled downstream of the gyre. For the horizontal velocity we show the existence of large (up to 40 cm/s) ageostrophic velocities. These are mainly non-divergent and can be explained by the cyclostrophic acceleration induced by the anticyclonic gyre. The irrotational velocity component is of the order of 10 cm/s towards the dense side of the front. The robustness of the method is checked by means of several tests that evaluate the sensitivity of results with respect to the synopticity of the data, the analysis parameters, the reference level and the presence of tidal or inertial currents.

The flow field during the Intensive Period is highly anisotropic in both vertical modes. The barotropic mode behaves as a propagating wave with significant rotation {{in the latter part}} of the period; its dynamical balances are substantially linear except at the time of the rotation, when there is also a transfer of energy from the first baroclinic mode. The baroclinic flow exhibits a fonotogenetic intensification into a strong jet due to straining of an initially large-scale baroclinic flow by the barotropic wave, together with some aspects of phase propagation as well. The baroclinic modal dynamical balance has identifiable linear contributions, but they are relatively weak compared to the nonlinear terms, in contrast with the barotropic model balance. Comparisons are made with MODE analyses and various calculations of homogeneous, geostrophic turbulence...|$|R
