Diamond-coated <b>drawing</b> <b>dies</b> are {{considered}} as ideal <b>drawing</b> <b>dies</b> for their unique characteristics, {{such as high}} hardness, wear resistance and low friction. In order to utilize the superior characteristics of diamond coatings towards improving the drawing performance, the nonlinear FEM simulation is used to simulate the whole low carbon steel tube hollow sinking process, with 2 D axi-symmetric elastic-plastic element. Based on the simulation results, the distributions of the axial stress and radial stress are analyzed, the influence of parameters of <b>drawing</b> <b>dies</b> on the diameter shrinkage is investigated.

40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) are increasingly used in {{sheet metal stamping}} in the automotive industry. In comparison with conventional steels, AHSS stampings produce higher contact pressures at the interface between <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> and sheet metal blank, resulting in more severe wear conditions, particularly at the <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> radius.

This paper investigates the effects of <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> geometry on the sheet metal tool wear distribution over the <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> radius using numerical and experimental methods. A numerical tool wear model is introduced and applied using the commercial software package Abaqus. Channel bend tests are carried out using an Erichsen sheet metal tester to verify the numerical model. Various geometries of radius arc profiles, including standard circular profiles, high elliptical profiles, and flat elliptical profiles, are numerically investigated, and the wear volume and contact pressure distribution along the radii are determined.

50|$|In China, the Cobalt {{content in}} {{cemented}} carbide <b>drawing</b> <b>die</b> {{is basically the}} same as that in the Soviet Union. The traditional grade for cemented carbide drawing dies in China is almost YG8, rarely YG15 and YG6X. Later, in order to obtain better wearing resistance, the Cobalt content has to be decreased. While with the decreasing of the Cobalt content, the impact toughness and flexural strength of the cemented carbide <b>drawing</b> <b>die</b> will dramatically decline. In recent years, the Cobalt content adopted in cemented carbide <b>drawing</b> <b>die</b> area in China is {{the same as that}} in Sweden Sandvik which is the leader of cemented carbide industry in the world. At the same time, researchers are trying to improve the performance of cemented carbide by adding rare metal carbides. For example, researchers in Tianjin Cemented Carbide Research Institute add 1% TaC into cemented carbide drawing dies to inhibit grain growth and refine grain size in the sintering process. In result, the service life of this kind of drawing dies is greatly longer than the general grade YG8. In Shanghai Material Factory, the Cobalt content is declined to 6% and a few TaC are added into cemented carbide drawing dies in the sintering process so that the production volume is two times of that of general grade when stretching A3 steel, YIF steel, copper, etc.|$|E

In comparison with conventional steels, AHSS stampings produce higher contact pressures at the interface between <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> and sheet metal blank, resulting in more severe wear conditions, particularly at the <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> radius. Developing the ability to accurately predict and reduce the potential tool wear during the tool design stage is vital for shortening lead times and reducing production costs. This thesis investigates the influence of <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> geometry on the wear distribution over the <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> radius for AHSS and develops a methodology for optimising the <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> geometry to reduce wear using numerical and experimental methods. Tool wear predictions on automotive sheet metal forming die and recommended protections of the tool surface under the initial production conditions were obtained from AutoForm simulation software. Effects of lubrication coefficients, binder pressure loads and die coating on tool wear distributions were investigated as well. It is concluded that the areas that are most sensitive to tool wear occurs at the locations corresponding to the large gradient of drawing depth. To study the tool wear distributions for more common stamping parts, a numerical tool wear model was developed and applied using the commercial software package Abaqus. Channel tests are carried out using an Erichsen sheet metal tester with high pressure prescale films to verify the numerical model results. Comparing the results obtained from the prescale film with {{the results from the}} simulation, it is concluded that the contact pressure distributions indicated by the prescale film are consistent with those from the simulation. Various geometries of radius arc profiles, including standard circular profiles, high elliptical profiles, and flat elliptical profiles, were numerically investigated using the tool wear model developed, and the contact pressure distribution and tool wear work along the radii were determined. The following conclusions were reached from the investigations: (1) The colour contour of the high contact pressure on the die radius can be divided into three distinct zones of high pressure and tool wear; (2) The dominant zone leading to maximum contact pressure and tool wear severity depends on the geometry of die radius profile under the same material and process conditions; (3) The geometry of <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> radius has a significant influence on the tool wear and standard circular and elliptical curves can lead to the achievement of reduced and uniform contact pressure distribution (wear distribution) along most of zones of the <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> radius arc. The results suggest that to minimise contact pressure and tool wear using this approach it would be necessary to optimise the shape for a particular combination of material type, thickness and forming process. Effects of control parameters, such as blank geometry, punch geometry, deep-drawing process parameters and tool material, on wear behaviour in deep-drawing for various shape of die radius were then investigated to provide guidelines for impacts of these parameters. A specialised software routine was then compiled for optimisation of die radius profiles to minimise and achieve uniform contact pressure (wear distribution) using Python programming language. The routine was fully integrated with Abaqus software and has the following functions: (1) To provide a user-friendly Graphical User Interface for pre-processing data input for users who have less experience and skill; (2) To optimise a die radius profile according to the control parameters that users input. The results obtained are relevant to the issue of reducing the high tool wear in automotive stamping tools by predicting the causes of such tool wear related to tool geometry and process parameters. They provide useful guidelines for enhancing the tool life of sheet metal processing in automotive industry...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the free drawing process of PE pipes in the aspect of timecharacteristics of the viscoelastic return. Design/methodology/approach: To determine the properties, drawing tests were conducted on chosen PE pipes, usinga testing machine station. Pipe samples were preheated to a set temperature and drawn by a fixed <b>drawing</b> <b>die.</b> Changesin the pipe diameter and length of the test section were recorded for the further analysis of the pipe sample. Findings: Obtained dependencies were assumed to be the basis for formulation of conclusions as to the choiceof essential process conditions for the technological sequence of PE lining deposition in the outer coating ofinstallation pipes or reconstruction of a transmission channel. Research limitations/implications: Conducted research and their conclusions have a methodological value. They factually correspond to chosen spatial parameters of pipes and dies.
