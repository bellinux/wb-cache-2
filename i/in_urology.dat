25|$|The {{last great}} Byzantine {{physician}} was John Actuarius, {{who lived in}} the early 14th Century in Constantinople. His works on urine laid much of the foundation for later study <b>in</b> <b>urology.</b> However, from the latter 12th Century to the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, there was very little further dissemination of medical knowledge, largely due to the turmoil the Empire was facing on both fronts, following its resurrection after the Latin Empire and the dwindling population of Constantinople due to plague and war. Nevertheless, Byzantine medicine is extremely important both in terms of new discoveries made in that period (at a time when Western Europe was in turmoil), the collection of ancient Greek and Roman knowledge, and its dissemination to both Renaissance Italy and the Islamic world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In Europe {{there are}} a lot of {{training}} centers for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) but a standardized MIS training program <b>in</b> pediatric <b>urology</b> doesn't exist at the moment. We performed a literature review with the last goals to propose a structured training curriculum <b>in</b> MIS <b>urology</b> for pediatric surgeons. Pediatric urologists have to obtain a valid MIS training curriculum completing the following 4 steps: (I) Theoretical part (theoretical courses, masterclass) to acquire theoretical knowledge; (II) experimental training (simulation on pelvic trainer, virtual reality simulators, animal models, 3 -D ex-vivo models) to acquire basic laparoscopic skills; (III) stages in European centers of reference for pediatric MIS urology to learn all surgery aspects; (IV) personal operative experience. At the end of the training period, the trainee would be expected to perform several MIS urological procedures independently, under supervision of an expert tutor. At the end of the training program, each center will analyze the candidate training booklet and release for each applicant a certification after an exam. We think that this MIS training program <b>in</b> pediatric <b>urology</b> may assure an integrated acquisition of basic and advanced laparoscopic skills during residency training <b>in</b> pediatric <b>urology.</b> Each European country should adopt this program so as to secure a standardized technical qualification <b>in</b> MIS <b>urology</b> for all future pediatric urologists...|$|R

2500|$|Robotic assistance: Some {{believe that}} {{in the hands of}} an {{experienced}} surgeon, robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) may reduce positive surgical margins when compared to radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) among patients with prostate cancer according to a retrospective study. The relative risk reduction was 57.7%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study (35.5% of patients had positive surgical margins following RRP), this leads to an absolute risk reduction of 20.5%. 4.9 patients must be treated for one to benefit (number needed to treat = 4.9). Other recent studies have shown RALP to result in a significantly higher rate of positive margins. Other studies showed no difference of robotic to open surgery. A 2009 French study comparing standard laparoscopic to robotic to open prostatectomy showed no difference in margin status or biochemical recurrence at 5 years. [...] The relative merits of RALP and potential benefit versus open radical prostatectomy is currently an area of intense research and debate <b>in</b> <b>urology.</b> [...] The only proven and accepted advantage to RALP is less intraoperative blood loss. Other suggested advantages beyond this lack definitive data and have not been widely accepted by the broader urological community.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} {{minimally}} invasive surgery the first laparoscopic surgeons were smiled at and the surgical community {{did not believe in}} this new technology. Today it is the gold standard for most surgeries. Starting with a simple appendectomy, partial kidney resections and partial liver resections, etc. The laparoscopic approach is expanding. The image quality, the possibility of imaging the patient in the surgical position and the guidance of the instruments facilitate this approach.(Efficacy of DynaCT for surgical navigation during complex laparoscopic surgery: an initial experience. Partial resection of the kidney, leaving as much healthy tissue, meaning kidney function to the patient has been described some time ago (Nephron sparing surgery for renal tumors: indications, techniques and outcomes.). The challenges the surgeons face is the loss of natural 3D vision and tactile sensing. Through small ports he/she has to rely on the images provided by the endoscope and is unable to feel the tissue. In a hybrid operating room the anatomy can be updated and imaged in real time. 3D images can be fused and/or overlaid on live fluoroscopy or the endoscope. (Real-time image guidance in laparoscopic liver surgery: first clinical experience with a guidance system based on intraoperative CT imaging.) Crucial anatomy like vessels or a tumor can be avoided and complications reduced. Further investigations are under trial at the moment.

40|$|Laparoscopy {{has raised}} great {{interest}} {{in the past few}} years in the field of pediatric urology. It has evolved from a simple diagnostic maneuver to complex operative procedures. The aim of this study was to review urologic laparoscopy literature and provide a critical review of this field to establish current indications for videosurgery <b>in</b> pediatric <b>urology.</b> <b>In</b> general, from an anatomic point of view, retroperitoneoscopy seems to be more suitable than the transperitoneal laparoscopic approach for reaching the upper urinary tract. It also is less invasive and complies with the criteria for open renal surgery. With respect to current indications for videosurgery <b>in</b> pediatric <b>urology,</b> the authors have identified several well-established clinical procedures, although no large series have been published for any of the procedures, except for the treatment of varicocele, nonpalpable testis, and nephrectomy. In conclusion, the data reviewed suggest that videosurgery is a safe and feasible technique <b>in</b> pediatric <b>urology</b> if performed by expert surgeons, and that it certainly will develop further in the next few years...|$|R
