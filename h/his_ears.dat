5|$|Ruffing {{suffered}} a stroke in 1974, {{at the age of}} 68, which left him paralyzed on his left side. As a result, he used a wheelchair for the remainder of his life.

5|$|Shearer {{was awarded}} a {{testimonial}} match by the club, against Scottish-side Celtic. All proceeds of the match went to charitable causes. Because of the injury he sustained three games earlier at Sunderland, Shearer was unable {{to play in the}} whole match; however he kicked-off the game and came off the bench to score a penalty, winning the game 3–2. The match was a sell-out, and saw Shearer perform a lap of honour at the end with his family, with his young son notably covering <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> due to the volume of noise produced by the crowd in tribute.|$|E
5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E
5|$|In Sri Lanka {{the belief}} of Riri Yaka (Blood Demon) can be found. According to mythology, he tore his mother's breast and emerged {{into the human}} world as a demon killing her. The demon is said to give a primary form and eight other manifestations. In most cases {{he is said to}} be a giant who towers over his human victims. In the primary form, his face is blue and splotched with blood. Red rays radiate from his bloodshot eyes. Blood pours from his {{nostrils}} and smoke billows from <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> His mouth is filled with decomposing human flesh and his breath is foul. His entire body is coloured scarlet with dripping blood. He is closely associated with Mara, the demon king of death.|$|E

When Peter Rabbit wiggled <b>his</b> right <b>ear,</b> <b>his</b> baby brother wiggled <b>his</b> right <b>ear.</b> When Peter Rabbit scratched <b>his</b> left <b>ear,</b> <b>his</b> baby brother scratched <b>his</b> left <b>ear.</b> Whatever Peter Rabbit did, his baby brother did too.|$|R

5|$|In {{the same}} year, Naismith entered McGill University in Montreal. Although {{described}} as a slight figure, standing 5 foot 10 ½ and listed at 178 pounds, he was a talented and versatile athlete, representing McGill in Canadian football, lacrosse, rugby, soccer and gymnastics. He played centre on the football team, and made himself some padding to protect <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> It was for personal use, not team use. He won multiple Wicksteed medals for outstanding gymnastics performances. Naismith earned a BA in Physical Education (1888) and a Diploma at the Presbyterian College in Montreal (1890). From 1891 on, Naismith taught physical education {{and became the first}} McGill director of athletics, but then left Montreal to become a physical education teacher at the YMCA International Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{at peace}} with Parthia, Rome still {{interfered}} in its affairs. The Roman emperor Tiberius (r.14–37AD) became involved in a plot by Pharasmanes I of Iberia to place his brother Mithridates on the throne of Armenia by assassinating the Parthian ally King Arsaces of Armenia. Artabanus III {{tried and failed to}} restore Parthian control of Armenia, prompting an aristocratic revolt that forced him to flee to Scythia. The Romans released a hostage prince, Tiridates III of Parthia, to rule the region as an ally of Rome. Shortly before his death, Artabanus managed to force Tiridates from the throne using troops from Hyrcania. After Artabanus' death in 38AD, a long civil war ensued between the rightful successor Vardanes I and his brother Gotarzes II of Parthia. After Vardanes was assassinated during a hunting expedition, the Parthian nobility appealed to Roman emperor Claudius (r. 41–54AD) in 49AD to release the hostage prince Meherdates to challenge Gotarzes. This backfired when Meherdates was betrayed by the governor of Edessa and Izates bar Monobaz of Adiabene; he was captured and sent to Gotarzes, where he was allowed to live after having <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> mutilated, an act that disqualified him from inheriting the throne.|$|E
5|$|Gaius instructs Merlin {{to deliver}} elixirs to Morgana and Lady Helen; in the latter's room {{he finds the}} poppet, but bluffs {{his way out of}} discovery. Later, Helen kills a handmaiden who glimpses her true form in a mirror. At the feast, Mary sings an enchantment as Lady Helen, causing all the guests to fall asleep. Merlin, {{realising}} what is going on, covers <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> Mary attempts to kill Arthur, but Merlin drops a chandelier on her with magic before she releases the dagger. As she has stopped singing, the enchantment is lifted and her true appearance is revealed. In a last effort she throws the dagger at Arthur, but Merlin slows time to pull him out of the way. Mary dies from her injuries, having failed in her attempt to avenge her son. Uther rewards Merlin by making him Arthur's servant, though neither boy is thrilled with the idea. The next day, Gaius gives Merlin a book on magic, under condition that he keep it hidden.|$|E

5|$|The Master and Mistress buy {{a female}} collie puppy named Lady to be Lad's {{companion}} and mate. Lad becomes her protector and slave, as she bullies {{him from his}} food and {{the best places to}} lie, and endures the flashes of nasty temper that lead her to bite <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> and paws. As she grows older, she becomes a generally well-behaved house dog, but when she is eight months old, she tries to attack a beloved mounted bald eagle belonging to the Master. He whips her and then locks her in a shed for the night as punishment; however, during the night it catches on fire. Lad desperately tries to break down the door to free her, then howls in agony, before jumping through its high window to join Lady inside. The Master, awakened by Lad's howl, arrives in time to free them both, though both have badly burned coats.|$|E
5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed {{because it was}} {{dangerous}} to {{attempt to create a}} film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of <b>his</b> <b>ears,</b> it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E
25|$|Mickey's {{circular}} {{design is}} most noticeable in <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> In animation in the 1940s, Mickey's ears were animated {{in a more}} realistic perspective. Later, they were drawn to always appear circular no matter which way Mickey was facing. This made Mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> an unofficial personal trademark. The circular rule later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a three-dimensional Mickey.|$|E

50|$|Gautama Buddha, {{an aristocratic}} and wealthy prince, had long {{stretched}} ears. He wore heavy gold earrings or precious stones as a status symbol, {{and the weight}} stretched <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> lobes dramatically. When he finally renounced his wealth and discarded <b>his</b> jewelry, <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> lobes were permanently stretched. As a way of remembering Buddha's act of personal self-sacrifice in walking away from his wealth, all succeeding images of Gautama Buddha show <b>his</b> stretched <b>ear</b> lobes without jewellery.|$|R

25|$|Arizona Court of Appeals Judge Philip Espinosa sued Manilow {{over the}} volume of a December 23, 1993, concert he {{attended}} with his wife.

In July 1997, to settle the suit it was reported that Manilow donated $5,000 to American Tinnitus Association, an ear-disorder association.|$|E
