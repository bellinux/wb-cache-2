A general chemical pattern‐matching engine using this graph has been implemented whereby assignment of molecular mechanics atom types, charges, and force field parameters are achieved by comparison against a customizable list of chemical fragments. While initially designed to complement the CHARMM simulation package and force fields by generating the necessary input topology and atom‐type data files, MATCH can be expanded to any force field and program, and has core functionality that makes it extendable to other applications such as fragment‐based property prediction. In this work, we demonstrate the accurate construction of atomic parameters of molecules within each force field included in CHARMM 36 through exhaustive cross validation studies illustrating that bond charge <b>increment</b> <b>rules</b> derived from one force field can be transferred to another.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the liquid metal with the plasma confinement magnetic field constitutes a challenge {{for the design of}} fusion reactor blankets, due to the arise of MHD effects: increased pressure drops, heat transfer suppression, etc. To overcome these issues, a dielectric fluid can be employed as coolant for the breeding zone. A typical configuration involves pipes transverse to the liquid metal flow direction. This numerical study is conducted to assess the influence of pipe conductivity on the MHD flow and heat transfer. The CFD code ANSYS CFX was employed for this purpose. The fluid is assumed to be bounded by rectangular walls with non-uniform thickness and subject to a skewed magnetic field with the main component aligned with the cylinder axis. The simulations were restricted to Re = (20, 40) and M = (10, 50). Three different scenarios for the obstacle were considered: perfectly insulating, finite conductivity and perfectly conducting. The electrical conductivity was found to affect the channel pressure penalty due to the obstacle insertion only for M = 10 and just for the two limiting cases. A <b>general</b> <b>increment</b> of the heat transfer with M was found due to the tendency of the magnetic field to equalize the flow rate between the sub-channels individuated by the pipe.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{estimate}} the impact of general inflation on prices paid and received by farmers. Specific objectives are: (1) to test the hypothesis that the farm commodity domestic demand function at the farm level is homogeneous of degree zero in price and income; and (2), conditional on not rejecting the hypothesis in (1), to test the hypothesis that general inflation changes the ratio of prices received to prices paid by farmers because of impacts unevenly on prices and income in the demand function versus the supply function for farm output. Empirical results provided no basis to reject the hypothesis that economic functions determining demand for output at the farm level are homogenous of degree zero in income and prices. A truly <b>general</b> <b>increment</b> in overall price level appears to increase nominal prices received and farm demand in proportion to the general price level but leaves real farm demand and hence real demand price unchanged. This hypothesis could not be rejected based on the domestic components of demand for farm output examined in this study. Given demand and supply functions homogeneous of degree zero in all prices and income, the second hypothesis that general inflation impacts evenly on all prices and income was rejected for the 1963 - 77 period. In that period, national inflation moved upward the supply curve through prices paid by farmers proportionately more than it moved upward the demand curve and prices received by farmers, contributing to a cost-price squeeze.

All the bilingual children used both languages daily and were learning to read in both languages. The children solved decoding and phonological awareness tasks, and the bilinguals completed all tasks in both languages. Initial differences between the groups in factors that contribute to early literacy were controlled in an analysis of covariance, and the results showed a <b>general</b> <b>increment</b> in reading ability for all the bilingual children but a larger advantage for children learning two alphabetic systems. Similarly, bilinguals transferred literacy skills across languages only when both languages were written in the same system.

Initially, and after 15 and 30 day samples were taken, oil was extracted with a laboratory scale milling plant. Before milling, respiration rate was measured with the static system. The following quality attributes were measured on oil samples: acidity (related {{to the presence of}} free fatty acid), peroxide value (peroxides are the first products of oxidation), coefficients of specific extinction at 232 nm (related to the presence of products of primary oxidation) and 270 nm (related to the presence of products of secondary oxidation), and oil stability (Rancimat test). ‘Leccino’ and ‘Ogliarola leccese’ olives showed a high incidence of decay after 30 days of storage in room conditions. Cold storage and controlled atmosphere had a significant effect on slowing down the respiration rate, and therefore, the metabolic activity of the drupes for all cultivars.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the railway system in terms of dynamic loading is depending mainly on the track support conditions. Usually, the track stiffness is used as the main parameter to describe the support conditions and {{is defined as the}} ratio of the load applied to the rail over the vertical rail deflection. Ideally that parameter is constant, but in reality this condition is very unlikely to happen. Therefore, there is non-uniform track loading and non-uniform track deterioration, generally known as differential settlement, leading to a <b>general</b> <b>increment</b> of maintenance and renewal costs. Even if it {{plays a major role in}} the system dynamics, it is very difficult to derive a measure of the actual variability of the track stiffness along the railway. There are many techniques to experimentally acquire those values, for example using the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) equipment or the Swedish Rolling Stiffness Measurement Vehicle (RSDV) measuring train. However, these measures are usually very costly and limited in extension. The measuring data may not be long enough to be statistically representative, and thus it is not possible to have a clear correlation between the physical properties of the railway system and its long-term behaviour without running simulations with extended track data. The main aim of the present study is to assess the role of longitudinal variability of the vertical track stiffness in the long-term behaviour of the track degradation. In particular, new sets of track stiffness data which can appropriately reproduce the statistical properties of the real ones will be simulated. Then, the variability of the outputs of the vehicle dynamic model depending on the variability in the inputs will be statistically analysed. This is inspired in past research that highlighted the role of vertical stiffness in track deterioration, but not looking at the actual longitudinal variability of vertical stiffness as a contributing factor...|$|R
