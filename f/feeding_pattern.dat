40|$|Feeding is an {{essential}} behaviour for body maintenance in pigs and closely related to their growth and productivity performance. Mechanisms underlying feeding behaviour in pigs are still unclear. Understanding these mechanisms can provide valuable insights into the complex interactions among various factors affecting feeding behaviour and help to improve growth and productivity of pigs. The {{aim of this study}} was to increase our understanding of internal causation and development of short-term <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> in a pig, and the relation between <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> and productivity of a pig during the growth period. We developed a mechanistic simulation model that represents an individually housed growing pig. The model integrates knowledge from physiology and ethology, and combines growth with a behavioural decision model based on motivation. Combining growth with behaviour allowed exploring the development of a pig over time, in particular the causation of growth and <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> over a 24 h period and during the entire growing period. Physiological factors, affected by pig and feed characteristics, are important internal factors controlling feeding behaviour. Model output included short-term feeding behaviours in pigs (e. g. meal size, meal frequency and meal duration), and growth characteristics (e. g. energy use, body weight gain). The model yielded <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> that were validated against empirical data. This modelling study provided insight in how growth and motivation explain the development of <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> of an individually housed pig over time. Pig and feed characteristics affected the motivation to reach a desired level of daily feed intake. Without feeding restrictions, pigs adapted <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> to reach this daily feed intake without affecting growth. The developed model is suitable to further study mechanisms underlying feeding behaviour and performance of group-housed pigs...|$|R

Interestingly, the A.pallens are usually the initial wasps present at the site of an animal carcass trap set by Silveira in an experiment conducted to study the wasps feeding patterns. The wasps also tend to collect nectar, prey and pulp in almost equal percentages. Other social wasps tend to focus on the collection of glucidic kinds of foods.

50|$|When active, juveniles feed {{primarily}} on zooplankton such as mysid shrimp, euphausiids, mesopelagic and benthopelagic fish, amphipods, and other crustaceans; mature adults consume smaller fish, predominantly of the Chaetodontidae and Myctophidae families, and squid {{which make up}} to 20% of their diet. The diet of the orange roughy is depth-related, with adult diets inversely related to that of juveniles. For example, juvenile consumption of crustaceans is lowest at 900 m but increases with depth while crustaceans in the adult diet peaks at 800 - 1000 m and decreases with depth. The consumption of fish is the opposite, juvenile consumption decreases with depth while adult consumption increases. This inverse <b>feeding</b> <b>pattern</b> may {{be an example of}} resource-partitioning to avoid intraspecific competition for the available food at depths where prey is less abundant. The orange roughy's metabolic phases are thought to be related to seasonal variations in prey concentrations. The inactive phase conserves energy during lean periods.

5000|$|The <b>feeding</b> <b>pattern</b> of {{the wood}} frog, {{basically}} {{similar to that of}} other ranids, is triggered by prey movement and consists of a bodily lunge that terminates with the mouth opening and an extension of the tongue onto the prey. The ranid tongue is attached {{to the floor of the}} mouth near the tip of the jaw, and when the mouth is closed, the tongue lies flat, extended posteriorly from its point of attachment. In the feeding strike, the tongue is swung forward as though on a hinge, so some portion of the normally dorsal and posterior tongue surface makes contact with the prey. At this point in the feeding strike, the wood frog differs markedly from more aquatic Lithobates species, such as the green frog, leopard frog, and bullfrog. The wood frog makes contact with the prey with just the tip of its tongue, much like a toad. [...] A more extensive amount of tongue surface is applied in the feeding strikes of these other frog species, with the result that usually the prey is engulfed by the fleshy tongue and considerable tongue surface contacts the surrounding substrate.|$|E

50|$|Round {{whitefish}} {{are considered}} benthivores, feeding on benthos and plankton. In {{addition to the}} previous list, the generalized <b>feeding</b> <b>pattern</b> of the round-fish diet includes amphipods, gastropods, isopods, chironomid larvae and pupae, and various aquatic insects, such as spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimarus). Round whitefish are stable generalized feeders due {{to the majority of}} their food are found in the deeper parts of the water. They are considered opportunistic feeders in that round-fish feed on the kind of prey is available. Among different populations, the main food source each group preys upon may differ from one another in relation to what kind of food is available. Other factors that influence food availability are location, neighboring species, and time of year. In different bodies of water at different times of the year, the kind and amount of prey change, and round-fish are adapted to be able to feed on what is seasonally available. This capability allows them to migrate periodically to and from spawning sites. Food availability is also influenced by the abundance of other species sharing and/or around the range of the round-fish. When species return to their non-spawning body of water after spawning and winter, round-fish diet consists of more of chironomids, isopods, and gastropods. During the migration to spawning sites, they mostly feed on spiny water fleas, black fly larvae, and other aquatic insects. These species do not feed during spawning, so it is important for them to increase their food intake to accumulate energy for storage to survive through spawning.|$|E
50|$|The newly hatched {{caterpillars}} {{initiate the}} construction of a silk tent soon after emerging. They typically aggregate at the tent site throughout their larval stage, expanding the tent each day to accommodate their increasing size. Under field conditions, the caterpillars feed three times each day, just before dawn, at midafternoon, and in the evening after sunset. During each bout of feeding, the caterpillars emerge from the tent, add silk to the structure, move to distant feeding sites en masse, feed, and then return immediately to the tent where they rest until the next activity period. The exception to this <b>feeding</b> <b>pattern</b> occurs in the last instar, when the caterpillars feed only at night. The insect has six larval instars. At the last stage, the caterpillars disperse and each constructs a cocoon in a protected place. The adult moths, or imagoes, emerge about two weeks later. They are strictly nocturnal and start flying after nightfall, coming to rest within a few hours of dawn. Mating and oviposition typically occur on the day the moths emerge from their cocoons; the females die soon thereafter.Tent caterpillars, like many other species of social caterpillars, vigorously thrash the anterior part of their bodies when they detect predators and parasitoids. Such bouts of thrashing, which may be initiated by a single caterpillar, radiate rapidly through the colony and may result in group displays involving dozens of caterpillars. Such displays create a moving target for tachinid flies, wasps, and other small parasitoids that would lay eggs on or {{in the body of the}} caterpillar. They also clearly deter stink bugs and other timid predators. Groups of caterpillars resting on the surface of the tent constitute aposematic displays. Few birds other than cuckoos find the hairy caterpillars palatable. Cherry leaves are cyanogenic and the caterpillars regurgitate cyanide-laden juices when disturbed.|$|E
