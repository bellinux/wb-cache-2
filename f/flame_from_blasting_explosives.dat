This model incorporates both particle ignition time delay as well as cloud concentration effects on ignition. The total mass of aluminum that burns is found to depend on the model, with shorter ignition delay times resulting in increased burning of the cloud. A new mass-averaged ignition parameter is defined and is observed to serve as a useful parameter to compare cloud ignition behavior. Investigation of this variable reveals that both peak ignition as well as time required to attain peak ignition are sensitive to the model parameters. Overall, this study demonstrates that the new ignition model developed captures effects not included in other combustion models for the investigation of shock-induced ignition of aluminum particle clouds. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} of closed-cell polyethylene foams to blast loading was studied by systematically exposing foam sheets to <b>blasts</b> <b>from</b> <b>explosive</b> charges. It {{has been found}} that depending on the blast strength, foam type, and foam sample thickness, that the transmitted pressure felt beneath the foam could be either attenuated or amplified. A distinctive feature of the foams' response, when impacted by a relatively strong blast, is a pressure plateau. To compliment the experiments, a model of the foams under blast loading has been developed. This was achieved by first characterizing the stress-strain behavior of the foams over a range of strain rates, using both a hydraulic testing machine and a drop weight impact tester. The results of this testing was then used to create a rate-dependent constitutive model of the foams. In order to simulate blast loading, the model was implemented into a finite difference wave propagation code. Simulations show many of the features apparent in the experiments, including the amplification and attenuation of the transmitted pressures and the observed pressure plateau...|$|R

The work concentrates on the performance of ordinary civilian buildings, with particular emphasis on multi-storey buildings framed in either reinforced concrete or structural steelwork. At the time, some of the data was used to enhance conventional building construction, principally on Government buildings, and some was used to aide post-war hardened building construction. The two main UK researchers whose work is the basis of this paper (Professor Sir Dermot Christopherson and Professor Lord Baker) identified a number of building weaknesses that led to local or progressive collapse, including connections in steel framed buildings, as well as detailing weaknesses in reinforced concrete constructions.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the growing {{military}} conflicts over the past eight years, the focus on traumatic brain injuries sustained <b>from</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>blasts</b> in wartime scenarios has gained tremendous attention in the scientific and medical communities. During previous warfare conflicts in history, military armor was not as technologically advanced as it is today. As a result, the understanding of traumatic brain injuries is limited since previous blast occurrences typically resulted in higher fatalities due to non-primary blast effects. It is, therefore, the intent of this work to advance the knowledge on traumatic brain injuries <b>from</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>blasts.</b> The study focuses on two aspects. The first focus is on surrogate modeling of the human anatomy subjected to blast loading conditions and the resulting behavior that occurs which provides insight into injury mechanisms and needed model validation data. The second focus is on preventive protection against <b>explosive</b> <b>blasts</b> by studying various materials and the effectiveness of each material to attenuate blast profile characteristics. ^ The physical modeling aspect of the study was accomplished by varying surrogate materials, geometric configuration, and blast loading conditions {{in order to determine the}} measurable behavior variations. Quantitative results were obtained through pressure, acceleration, strain, and displacement measurements. These results suggested large initial amplification of pressures at anterior locations near the shell/gel interface. Material property effects and geometric features effects were seen by larger responses with the material of lower stiffness and more severe responses with the facial feature shell models over the solid shell models. Extreme accelerations were experienced with oscillatory behavior over the duration of the blast. In addition, significant relative displacement was observed between the shell and the gel material suggesting large strain values. Further quantitative results were obtained through shadowgraph imaging of the blast scenarios. The shadowgraph imaging confirmed the approximation that global movement of the target was minimal during the blast occurred on a different time scale. The complete results then provided a means of comparison to actual measured behavior from surrogate models to injury mechanisms in computational and clinical trials. Furthermore, the data obtained can be used in computational validation. ^ The blast mitigation aspect of the study was accomplished by applying blast loading conditions to various mitigant materials. Composite structures were constructed using various filler materials which varied density, porosity, viscosity, and particle size. Quantitative results were then obtained by measuring transmitted wave profiles behind the respective samples and comparing to free-field loading conditions. Attenuation effectiveness was then determined by the reduction of blast profile characteristics (peak overpressure, pulse duration, and impulse). The results of these experiments showed that lower density, porous materials caused blast profile resembling scaled air blasts. Specifically shorter wave front rise times and negative overpressure values were observed. The higher density materials exhibited the greatest attenuation by lowering the overall peak pressure, lengthening the duration, and slowing the rise to peak amplitude. This resulted in lower overall impulse values. Furthermore, significant frequency distribution was observed surpassing the effectiveness of the solid foam control sample and the lower density materials. ...|$|R

Four of the five veterans with early-stage chronic traumatic encephalopathy were also diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder. Advanced chronic traumatic encephalopathy has been found in veterans who experienced repetitive neurotrauma while in service and in others who were accomplished athletes. Clinically, chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, memory loss, and cognitive impairments that begin insidiously and progress slowly over decades. Pathologically, chronic traumatic encephalopathy produces atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, thalamus, and hypothalamus; septal abnormalities; and abnormal deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau as neurofibrillary tangles and disordered neurites throughout the brain. The incidence and prevalence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and the genetic risk factors critical to its development are currently unknown.

Objective assessment of brain function in this population may clarify the issue. To this end, twelve Iraq war Veterans (32. 0 ± 8. 5 [mean±standard deviation (SD) ] years of age) reporting one or more blast exposures meeting American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine criteria for mTBI and persistent PCS and 12 cognitively normal community volunteers (53. 0 ± 4. 6 years of age) without history of head trauma underwent brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and neuropsychological assessments and completed PCS and psychiatric symptom rating scales. Compared to controls, Veterans with mTBI (with or without PTSD) exhibited decreased cerebral metabolic rate of glucose in the cerebellum, vermis, pons, and medial temporal lobe. They also exhibited subtle impairments in verbal fluency, cognitive processing speed, attention, and working memory, similar to those reported in the literature for patients with cerebellar lesions. These FDG-PET imaging findings suggest that regional brain hypometabolism may constitute a neurobiological substrate for chronic PCS in Iraq combat Veterans with repetitive blast-trauma mTBI.

We estimate the total NOx emission rate from AN-based explosives as 0. 05 Tg (i. e., 5 × 104 t) N per annum, compared to the total global annual anthropogenic NOx emissions of 41. 3 × 106 t N y− 1. Although minor in the global sense, the large localised plumes <b>from</b> <b>blasting</b> exhibit high NOx concentration (500 ppm) exceeding up to 3000 times the international standards. This emission has profound consequences at mining sites and for adjacent atmospheric environment, necessitating expensive management of exclusion zones.
