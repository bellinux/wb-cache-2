5|$|<b>In</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> Australia, two of {{the three}} centers of species diversity, the natural {{habitats}} of these plants are undergoing a high degree of pressure from human activities. Expanding population centers (such as Queensland, Perth, and Cape Town) threaten many such habitats, as does the draining of moist areas for agriculture and forestry in rural areas. The droughts that have been sweeping Australia over the last 10 years also pose a threat to many species by drying up previously moist areas.|$|E
5|$|A 5 hours, 9 {{minutes long}} biographical {{documentary}} film, , made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures {{the history of}} those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader. Gandhi was a central figure in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values {{as a metaphor for}} the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal.|$|E

5|$|After a {{slow start}} to the {{historic}} campaign, Loxton struck form midway through the English summer and forced {{his way into the}} team for the last three Tests. He played a prominent role in the Fourth Test, scoring an aggressive and counterattacking 93 that helped Australia pry the initiative from England; the tourists eventually won the match. In 1949–50, Loxton cemented his position in the national team, playing in all five Tests <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> scoring his only century at international level. He remained a regular member of the Test team until a form slump during the 1950–51 home season; he was dropped after three Tests against England and never played for Australia again. Loxton continued to play for Victoria in domestic competition until retiring {{at the end of the}} 1957–58 season.|$|E
5|$|At the 20th century's end, Gaddafi—frustrated by {{the failure}} of his Pan-Arab ideals—increasingly {{rejected}} Arab nationalism in favour of Pan-Africanism, emphasising Libya's African identity. From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa,</b> <b>and</b> the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa. He became {{one of the founders of}} the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU; at the opening ceremonies, he called for African states to reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President Thabo Mbeki.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Rhodesian capital Salisbury, Beadle read law <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> England before commencing {{practice}} in Bulawayo in 1931.

Appointed Huggins's Parliamentary Private Secretary in 1940, he retained that role until 1946, when he became Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice; the Education and Health portfolios were added two years later. He retired from politics in 1950 to become a judge of the Southern Rhodesian High Court. In 1961, he was knighted and appointed Chief Justice; three years later he became president of the High Court's new Appellate Division and a member of the British Privy Council.|$|E

5|$|Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's {{government}} of doing little {{to stem the}} HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive. Mandela later {{admitted that he had}} personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing issues surrounding sex <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa,</b> <b>and</b> that he had instead left the issue for Mbeki to deal with. Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa had one of the world's highest crime rates, and the activities of international crime syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade. Mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed {{to deal with the problem}} of corruption.|$|E
