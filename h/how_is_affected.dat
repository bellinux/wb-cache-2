The results from the analysis were compared with different curves provided from the company Vestas and with theoretical terms. Moreover, it was shown <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> the power curve of the wind turbine by the wake effect of the other turbines. The different ways of plotting these curves based on wind speed either from the anemometer of the wind turbine or through Windcube v 2, a device that provides information about the wind conditions of the location, were discussed...|$|E

40|$|The current project {{consists}} on {{the design}} of a numerical model to solve the steady streaming that is produced when an oscillating flow faces solid cylinders. This model was created by using finite element modelling techniques through the use of Freefem++ software. The development of the code to solve the flow involves the implementation of the Navier-Stokes equations {{and the creation of a}} mesh, which define the geometry of the problem. Three different geometries are presented. The first one consisting on one single cylinder in the middle of the microdevice, the second geometry consists of two cylinders positioned side by side separating by a distance ga, and the last one consist of four cylinders, two of them positioned in the x axis and the other two positioned in the y axis. In this last geometry some parameters, that define the geometry, are modified, to see <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> the resultant flow. Ingeniería Aeroespacia...|$|E

40|$|Multifractal {{techniques}} {{are applied to}} the study of rainfall daily time series over 14 stations from Ebro river Basin over the second half of XX century. The aim is to determine how climate change affects the evolution of the probability distribution of daily precipitation, through the values of universal multifractal parameters: C 1;; H y s for different periods of time. These will offer direct explanations of the shape of the distribution, especially about the extreme events: C 1 is the mean intermittency codimension. When C 1 increases the precipitation becoming less continuous and more sporadic in time. Therefore there is an increase of extremes.; is a mesure of multifratility so an increase of it corresponds to a larger variation of the range of precipitation intensity, and thus also of extremes. H is the degree of non-conservation of the ﬁeld, which measures the scale dependency of the average ﬁeld. s; the maximal probable singularity that can be observed on a unique sample. It’s directly related to the ratio of the range and the mean of ﬁeld. From the data collected, we perceive a decline in average rainfall, from 1980. But <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> the global parameters in this situation?. Results vary according to different rainfall stations...|$|E
40|$|Succession {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied {{processes}} in ecology and succession theory provides strong predictability. However, few attempts have been made to influence the course of succession thereby testing the hypothesis that the passage of one stage is essential to enter a next one. At each stage of succession ecosystem processes may be affected by the diversity of species present, but there is little empirical evidence showing that plant species diversity may affect succession. The main objective in the present study is to test if there is any effect of plant species diversity on the functioning of artificially-created grassland communities. We were mostly interested in how successful is the sowing of meadow species into newly abandoned land and how long do the effect of initial sowing persist, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> the set of natural colonizers, which includes both the weed species and also the later successional species arriving naturally into the zone. One of the main questions concerning succession is to which extent the trajectory may be predictable or not. What will be the consequence of the different succession pathways for ecosystem processes, such as productivity and resource utilization, as well as species composition of both above and belowground communities? What will be the subsequent effects of feed back to vegetation development through initial manipulation of vegetation after land abandonment? And, finally, how general may results b...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA numerically {{efficient}} {{methodology for}} the optimal design of monitoring networks aiming at the surveillance of accidental atmospheric release is proposed in this paper. In a realistic context, {{the design of}} such a network requires the knowledge of a database of potential dispersion accidents occurring {{in the domain of}} the study. An objective function measures the ability of a potential network to provide measurements in order to reconstruct any accidental plume taken from the database. In the optimisation of such cost functions with respect to networks, most of the computational time is spent in the evaluation of the function, especially if the accidents database is large. In this paper we show how to optimally reduce this database and how this affects the design via a mathematical expansion in the cost function. We introduce methods based on principal component analysis, which are rigorous when the cost function is of least-squares type. These methods are then tested and validated with success on the design of a radionuclides monitoring network to be deployed over France. This is the so-called Descartes network which will be operated by the French Institute for Radiation and Nuclear Safety. These techniques are then applied on Descartes to solve several issues that are computationally demanding, but are also of more general interest, such as: how should one sequentially deploy the stations of the network? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> the optimal network when other European potential radiological sources are taken into account...|$|E

These impose three main problems: (i) terrestrial habitats have large fluctuations in temperature and humidity; (ii) the internal concentration {{of water is}} higher than the external environment in spiders, which exposes them continually to water loss; and (iii) their small body size determines a large surface/volume ratio, affecting energy exchange and influencing the life strategy. In this review we focus on body design, energetic, thermal selection, and water balance characteristics of some spider species present in Chile and correlate our results with ecological and behavioral information. Preferred temperatures and critical temperatures of Chilean spiders vary among species and individuals and may be adjusted by phenotypic plasticity. For example in the mygalomorph high-altitude spider Paraphysa parvula the preferred temperature {{is similar to that of}} the lowland spider Grammostola rosea; but while P parvula shows phenotypic plasticity, G. rosea does not. The araneomorph spiders Loxosceles laeta and Scytodes globula have greater daily variations in preferred temperatures at twilight and during the night, which are set to the nocturnal activity rhythms of these species. They also present acclimation of the minimum critical temperatures. Dysdera crocata has a low preferred temperature adjusted to its favorite prey, the woodlouse. Spider metabolic rate is low compared to other arthropods, which may be associated with its sit and wait predatory strategy particularly in primitive hunter and weavers. In mygalomorph spiders the respiratory system is highly optimized with high oxygen conductance, for example G. rosea needs only a difference of 0. 12 - 0. 16 kPa in the oxygen partial pressure across the air-hemolymph barrier to satisfy its resting oxygen consumption demands. Water loss is a significant stress for spiders. Paraphysa parvula shows an evaporative water loss 10 times more than usual when the temperature approaches 40 degrees C and the participation of book lungs in this loss is about 60 %. This species and others show seasonal changes in water loss accounted for by changes in cuticle permeability. The case of Chilean spiders shows how the ecophysiology in spiders is associated to their design and body size and <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> by fluctuating Mediterranean environments, suggesting that the adaptive process can be seen as a route of optimizing the use of energy to cope with environmental restrictions imposed by the interaction with the terrestrial environment and lifestyle.
