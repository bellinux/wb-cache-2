5|$|Ann soon arrives, {{discovering}} Gil cowering in {{the cellar}} {{in a state of}} shock. Believing that he is beyond help, Gil at first refuses to see Dr. Hoffman, but after Ann's tearful pleading, Gil reluctantly agrees. During the examination, Dr. Hoffman orders Gil to remain in the house at all times as a precaution until he can return with help. Feeling guilty for leaving Trudy, Gil returns to the bar but is brutally beaten by George and his gang. Gil regains consciousness the next morning and discovers that Trudy, having <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> brought him home to her apartment. George soon arrives and, upon seeing Gil, forces him at gunpoint out into the daylight. Transforming into the creature, Gil murders George in front of the horrified Trudy before fleeing into the hills. Returning to the house, Gil finds Ann, Dr. Hoffman and Buckell waiting there and returns to his normal human state. A disturbed Gil later admits to the murder, with the others assuring him that he acted in self-defense, but when the police arrive with an arrest warrant, the hysterical Gil flees from the grounds in his car and accidentally hits a police officer.|$|E
500|$|I <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{because he}} must really {{be stuck in}} the past. Not only has his music not evolved, but also homeboy is still obsessed with my wife, the same female that wouldn't let him get to second base from eight years ago. What type of grown ass man lies about getting with a chick? Only Slim Lamey! LOL! I’m putting this out there now. Marshall Mathers, you need to holler at me... Man to man, let’s meet up and deal with this like adults. So, Miss Marshall, I'm {{going to make you}} wish you never spoke my name and regret the ungodly things you said about my wife. Your legacy has now been tainted from this day forth! You will now be known as the rapper who lost to corny-ass Nick Cannon! ...|$|E
500|$|In 1984, Steiger starred as {{a detective}} {{assigned}} {{to investigate the}} murder of a Chicago psychoanalyst (Roger Moore), a man whom he detests from a previous case, in Bryan Forbes's The Naked Face. Richard Christiansen of the Chicago Tribune referred to it as a [...] "wimpy suspense movie shot in Chicago in the fall of 1983, [...] doesn't do much good for the city or for anyone connected with it", and considered Steiger to be [...] "acting in his high hysteria gear", who [...] "snarls and whines and overacts". Steiger took a break from cinema in the mid-1980s, during which he appeared in the Yorkshire Television mini-series The Glory Boys (1984) with Anthony Perkins, and Hollywood Wives (1985) with Angie Dickinson. Steiger and Perkins were at loggerheads during the production of The Glory Boys. Perkins resented the fact that Steiger insisted on a bigger trailer and felt that Steiger was trying to steal scenes from him, while Steiger had thought Perkins [...] "so jittery and jinxed by the chemicals he was taking" [...] that he <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and believed that he was jeopardizing the success of the film. Steiger also performed on Joni Mitchell's 1985 album Dog Eat Dog, where he provided the voice of an evangelist in the song [...] "Tax Free".|$|E

60|$|She <b>felt</b> so <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He looked such a boy, {{with the}} angry {{tears in his}} clear blue eyes, and that little childish quivering of the kind, strong, sulky mouth.|$|R
500|$|After {{the end of}} the Lord's Test, Miller {{attended}} a concert and party, before returning to the team hotel after dawn the next morning, just before breakfast. Bradman noticed this and addressed him as [...] "Keith", rather than his nickname [...] "Nugget". Australia was due to play Surrey at The Oval on the same day. Bradman won the toss and elected to field. Instead of deploying him to his usual slips position, the Australian skipper sent Miller to field on the fine leg boundary as a punishment for his late night out. Between overs, the banished player had to walk to {{the opposite end of the}} ground to be in position for the bowler from the other end. One of the spectators <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and lent his bicycle, which the Australian used to cycle around the edge of the ground between overs. Soon after, Bradman brought his all rounder into a fielding position closer to the centre. Miller eventually scored nine in his only innings and was asked to bowl just one over in the second innings, as Australia completed victory by ten wickets. He had a quiet period on the field during July; his cricket generated fewer media stories than his celebrity appearances at social functions and classical music concerts during this time. The match against Surrey was immediately followed by a match against Gloucestershire in Bristol, where Miller scored 51, featuring in a partnership of 136 with Morris (290). Australia piled on 7/774 declared, its largest score of the season, before proceeding to victory by an innings and 363 runs. Acting captain Hassett allowed Miller to rest and he did not bowl during the match.|$|E
500|$|Konami {{video game}} {{developer}} Tomm Hulett described Kefka as a pure villain, stating [...] "Unlike most Japanese stories, Kefka {{did not have}} shades of gray. He didn't have a tragic past that {{turned him into a}} sadistic clown that you <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> over. He didn't have some greater purpose that he lost sight of. Yet, at the same time, he wasn't 'evil for evil's sake.' There was something twisted and nasty inside him that MADE him that way... and you could feel it... but you also knew there wasn't any good in there." [...] That he is a central villain of the entire game also serves to intensify a players negative fixation on him. In a review of Final Fantasy VI Advance, IGN stated [...] "it's the game's maniacal nihilist Kefka that really stands out. The most evil and destructive villain in the entire Final Fantasy franchise, Kefka's brutality and ruthlessness is unmatched and he has to be seen to be believed." [...] IGN also noted his ability to [...] "tap into primal, instinctive fears", including fears of clowns. CNet in their own review described him as [...] "the unrivaled star of the show...he's the kind of villain that you will love to hate", comparing him to Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker and calling his laugh one of the greatest sound effects in any video game. Kotaku has called Kefka the greatest video game villain of all time, and attempted to explain players' lasting fascination by noting that he inspires such hatred that when his evil plans are finally thwarted, the sense of joy from victory is so much the greater. GameSpy compared Kefka's final form as a representation of Lucifer, highlighted by his powerful [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] attack. Another theory posited by GameSpot is that the intense reaction to Kefka {{stems from the fact that}} he is one of the few villains in Final Fantasy, or any game, that succeeds at his master plan before he is defeated.|$|E
2500|$|Spike Milligan commented in 1989: [...] "Very {{difficult}} man {{to get on}} with. He used {{to drink}} excessively. You <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He ended up on his own. I thought, he's got rid of everybody else, he's {{going to get rid}} of himself and he did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] replied Orcutt, {{and marched}} off. Janet <b>felt</b> rather <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> {{though she had}} to admit that his manner was exasperating. But Ditmar's anger, instead of cooling, increased: it all seemed {{directed}} against the unfortunate superintendent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes he did; and I {{remember}} it by your speaking about my tormenting you. Oh! I <b>felt</b> very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and Deerslayer took all so quietly and without noise! Deerslayer {{is not as}} handsome as Hurry Harry, Judith, but he is more quiet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you know,' he said, 'I {{think that}} between you, you fellows have about worked a cure,' {{and he turned}} and walked away, and I <b>for</b> one <b>felt</b> very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Ah, if the moths would always {{carefully}} avoid the candle, how few burnt wings there would be! ...|$|R
2500|$|He was {{recalled}} to the Australian one day {{team for}} the WSC finals series in 1988–89, as a third spinner. However he bowled poorly, going for 0-62 off 7 overs. [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{in a lot of}} ways", said Alan Border, [...] "because I gave him a pretty tough task, bowling in that first 15 overs, and then he had to bowl towards the end when their guys were wacking out." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 5 Then Pharaoh’s {{daughter}} {{went down}} to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it. 6 She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "This is one of the Hebrew babies", she said. [...] 7 Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don’t {{think it}} {{ever came to}} much after all, nobody being really hurt, an’ the skipper being so much upset they <b>felt</b> sort o’ <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>’im.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "He {{looked like}} Lucifer: {{white in the}} face, his eyes like black coals. I <b>felt</b> profoundly <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and said to the people sitting near me: 'This {{is more than the}} man can endure'. ... It was the unique {{intensity}} of his interpretative art that enabled him to create two such miracles in one day without destroying himself".|$|R
60|$|The fatuousness of {{all this}} made me stare. If the man had not been somehow a {{sympathetic}} personality I would have resented it like an insult. As it was, I <b>felt</b> only <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Something remarkably earnest in his gaze prevented me from laughing in his face. Neither did I yawn at him. I just stared.|$|R
60|$|Prescott smoked {{in silence}} for a while. Jernyngham had made a costly sacrifice, chiefly on the woman's account, and Prescott <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was a pause. I {{looked at}} his big {{twitching}} face, {{and listened to the}} heavy wheezing of his breath, and I <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Blake <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He {{imagined}} that Benson {{had made a}} hard fight, but he was being beaten by his craving. Still, it seemed unwise to show any sympathy.|$|E
60|$|The knight {{stood in}} the doorway, his face expressing the most lively astonishment. His bulging eyes were fixed upon the {{necklace}} in Jimmy's hand. Jimmy could see him struggling to find words to cope with so special a situation, and <b>felt</b> rather <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Excitement of this kind was bad for a short-necked man of Sir Thomas's type.|$|R
60|$|When {{he told me}} this he put {{his hand}} to his cheek as though he still felt the smart of the blow, and in his eyes was a pain that was heartrending and an amazement that was ludicrous. He looked like an overblown schoolboy, and though I <b>felt</b> so <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> I could hardly help laughing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, {{he gave me}} a slip {{of paper}} with his name and address written on it," [...] {{answered}} Dora. [...] "You see, I asked him to do that because I <b>felt</b> so <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and I thought that possibly {{you might be able to}} get him something to do;" [...] and she handed the slip of paper over to her husband.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thet put {{the crowd}} right an' nobody moved. Riggs turned green then. I almost <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He {{began to shake}} so he'd dropped a gun if he had pulled one.|$|E
60|$|They {{sat down}} and she glanced at him unobtrusively. She was now very cool and free from embarrassment, while the man seemed to be {{suffering}} from constraint. Moreover, he looked disappointed, and she <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Beaton. [...] "If I could paint {{pictures}} for righteousness' sake, I {{should have been}} glad to do Conrad Dryfoos for his father. I <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Did the rest seem very much broken up? You saw them all?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{of course}} absurd of Corporal Cotton, but I <b>felt</b> very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> when he laid his head down with a groan, and I {{subsequently}} surmised that Sally had overheard part, at least, of the conversation, for when the lad, who had perhaps not wholly recovered from {{the weakness of the}} shock, sank into sleep, she called me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{there in}} the water, at the very last, when he kep' goin' down, I liked him. Yes, I must have. But all along, I <b>felt</b> more like <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He seemed so miser'ble, all the time, and so--well--scared." ...|$|R
60|$|Holmes {{had taken}} out his watch, and as minute {{followed}} minute without result, {{an expression of}} the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his emotion, that I <b>felt</b> sincerely <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he had met.|$|R
60|$|At Buffalo {{the others}} {{separated}} from Nat Poole, {{who said he}} was going to take the early morning train home. Nat felt very bad over the outcome of his joke, and to a certain extent Dave and his chums <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was then, Mr Powell told me, that he {{discovered}} in himself an already old-established liking for Captain Anthony. He also <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{without being able}} to discover the origins of that sympathy of which he had become so suddenly aware.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce {{found him}} tying his white tie. She had plucked the first rosebud from her garden; she had plucked {{it because she}} <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> {{and because of the}} excuse it would give her to go to his dressing-room at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's gone down!" [...] {{said the}} captain, {{and then he}} said no more for a long time. I <b>felt</b> very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Even if he should be saved, he had lost his ship,--had seen it burn up and sink before his eyes. Such a thing must be pretty hard on a captain. Even I felt as if I had lost a friend. The old [...] "Tigris" [...] seemed so well known to us.|$|R
6000|$|... "A very grim man," [...] said Lawrence, when he narrated what happened; [...] "but I <b>felt</b> most cruelly <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Didn't {{say very}} much--his sort never do; {{but he was}} in mortal anguish, and I knew how he would miss the girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{secretary}} frowned. [...] "Ah, Pippin! We {{asked you}} to come on his account. Pippin is giving {{us a lot of}} trouble.

It makes it very awkward; I call it personal to me." ...|$|R
