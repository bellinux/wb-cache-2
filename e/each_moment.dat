25|$|In a {{conventional}} 12-lead ECG, ten electrodes {{are placed on}} the patient's limbs and {{on the surface of}} the chest. The overall magnitude of the heart's electrical potential is then measured from twelve different angles ("leads") and is recorded over a period of time (usually ten seconds). In this way, the overall magnitude and direction of the heart's electrical depolarization is captured at <b>each</b> <b>moment</b> throughout the cardiac cycle. The graph of voltage versus time produced by this noninvasive medical procedure is referred to as an electrocardiogram.|$|E
25|$|The Stations of the Cross {{represent}} the stages {{leading up to}} Jesus' death. They consist of 14 specific events that occurred before Jesus was crucified and later rose from the dead. These 14 events are shown through 14 pictures that represent <b>each</b> <b>moment.</b> They are a way to relive and remember what happened. At the Cross in the Woods Parish, the Stations of the Cross are located outside, incorporated into the pine forest on the Shrine grounds. The main emphasis {{in this area is}} a statue of the resurrected Jesus or the fifteenth Station of the Cross.|$|E
25|$|Even when {{a system}} is entirely {{isolated}} from external influences, its microstate is constantly changing. For instance, the particles in a gas are constantly moving, and thus occupy a different position at <b>each</b> <b>moment</b> of time; their momenta are also constantly changing as they collide with each other or with the container walls. Suppose we prepare the system in an artificially highly ordered equilibrium state. For instance, imagine dividing a container with a partition and placing a gas {{on one side of}} the partition, with a vacuum on the other side. If we remove the partition and watch the subsequent behavior of the gas, we will find that its microstate evolves according to some chaotic and unpredictable pattern, and that on average these microstates will correspond to a more disordered macrostate than before. It is possible, but extremely unlikely, for the gas molecules to bounce off one another in such a way that they remain in one half of the container. It is overwhelmingly probable for the gas to spread out to fill the container evenly, which is the new equilibrium macrostate of the system.|$|E

500|$|One scholar {{has called}} Wollstonecraft the [...] "complete passionate traveler". Her desire {{to delve into}} and fully {{experience}} <b>each</b> <b>moment</b> in time was fostered by the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, particularly his Reveries of a Solitary Walker (1782). Several of Rousseau's themes appear in the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, such as [...] "the search {{for the source of}} human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding". However, while Rousseau ultimately rejects society, Wollstonecraft celebrates both domesticity and industrial progress.|$|E
500|$|While deconstructionists have {{concluded}} that we must abandon any further attempts to create a comprehensive vision of the world, Cobb and other constructive postmodernists believe that metaphysics and comprehensive world-models are possible and still needed. [...] In particular, they have argued for a new Whiteheadian metaphysics based on events rather than substances. [...] In this formulation, it is incorrect {{to say that a}} person or thing ("substance") has a fundamental identity that remains constant, and that any changes to the person or thing are secondary to what it is. [...] Instead, <b>each</b> <b>moment</b> in a person's life ("event") is seen as a new actuality, thus asserting that continual change and transformation are fundamental, while static identities are far less important. [...] This view more easily reconciles itself with certain findings of modern science, such as evolution and wave-particle duality.|$|E

Nay, who could tell what was best for him after all? Even Phoebe's faithful acceptance of her on his word had undergone sundry severe shocks, and she had rising doubts whether Lucy, such as she saw her, could be what would make him happy.|$|R

500|$|The {{sequences}} where Superman utilizes close-combat fight {{scenes with}} the other Kryptonians {{proved to be a}} major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew. Desjardin explained, [...] "When we do these fights and these hyper-real things, we don’t want to do the traditional, 'OK I’m a cameraman, I'm shooting a clean plate, I'm going to pan over here to follow the action that’s not really there yet but we'll put the action in later. Because that's us animating the characters to the camera. So we would do that animation with the characters—grappling, punching or flying away—and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and we'd cut. Then we'd put an environment camera there and take the environment. And then a camera for reference of the actors and get <b>each</b> <b>moment.</b> So then we had a set of high-res stills for the environment and the characters. Then, in post, we take the digi-doubles and animate them according to the speeds we want them to move in our digital environment." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} drummer Questlove's off-beat, cross-snare clicks {{on the two}} and four beat with a messy kick. Music critic Steve McPherson noted that its first two {{measures}} sound [...] "like a disaster", contrasting its solid groove. While most musical compositions rely on tension and release, which can be produced by factors such as soft verses and loud choruses, gradual buildup, sublte tension within verses or {{over the course of}} the bridge, or harmonic tension in chords that provides space for improvisation, D'Angelo's arrangements subdivide the tension into <b>each</b> <b>moment</b> of the song. According to McPherson, this results in [...] "no linear way to measure how far off things slide before they pull themselves back ... can't be measured in beats or fractions of beats in a meaningful way. For lack of a less cliched word, it's entirely 'feel'". Similar to most of the song's album, Voodoo, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] has this syncopation style as its center. D'Angelo's casual vocal style follows the same concept, applying it to melody, harmony, and phrasing, and is accompanied by falsetto climbs and skittery phrasing similar to Prince's singing.|$|E
500|$|Whitehead {{pointed to}} the {{limitations}} of language {{as one of the}} main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking, and acknowledged that {{it may be difficult to}} ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech. [...] After all, <b>each</b> <b>moment</b> of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago. [...] Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that [...] "material substances" [...] or [...] "essences" [...] are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular, concrete processes. [...] No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next.|$|E

500|$|Wilde did {{not meet}} Walter Pater until his third year, but had been enthralled by his Studies in the History of the Renaissance, {{published}} during Wilde's final year in Trinity. Pater argued that man's sensibility to beauty should be refined above all else, and that <b>each</b> <b>moment</b> should be felt to its fullest extent. Years later, in De Profundis, Wilde called Pater's Studies... "that book that has had such a strange influence over my life". He learned tracts of the book by heart, and carried it with him on travels in later years. Pater gave Wilde his sense of almost flippant devotion to art, though it was John Ruskin who gave him a purpose for it. Ruskin despaired at the self-validating aestheticism of Pater, arguing {{that the importance of}} art lies in its potential for the betterment of society. Ruskin admired beauty, but believed it must be allied with, and applied to, moral good. When Wilde eagerly attended Ruskin's lecture series The Aesthetic and Mathematic Schools of Art in Florence, he learned about aesthetics as simply the non-mathematical elements of painting. Despite being given to neither early rising nor manual labour, Wilde volunteered for Ruskin's project to convert a swampy country lane into a smart road neatly edged with flowers.|$|E
500|$|The manga {{has also}} earned praise: a {{reviewer}} for Children's Bookwatch noted that Into the Woods [...] "ends on a tense cliffhanger, leaving the reader in anxious anticipation for more. Suitable for readers age ten {{to one hundred}} and ten, Warriors Tigerstar & Sasha #1: Into the Woods is especially recommended for cat lovers everywhere". Its sequel, Escape from the Forest, was also well reviewed: a reviewer for Publishers Weekly believed that girls would benefit from reading about Sasha leaving the powerful Tigerstar due to his [...] "growing violence". The art was also praised, with the reviewer writing that [...] "Hudson's artwork brings Sasha's emotional journey to life, showing <b>each</b> <b>moment</b> of fear, anxiety, contentment and joy. The cat's-eye perspective {{of many of the}} panels, in addition, add [...] a dramatic, energizing element to the book". The reviewer also wrote that [...] "a twist at the end will leave fans eager for the next installment of Sasha's saga", and that the book would appeal to young adults trying to find their place in the world. Lisa Goldstein for School Library Journal also gave the book a positive review, writing that the plot would attract new fans and appeal to old fans. The reviewer also wrote that [...] "though the cover claims that this is a 'manga,' the straightforward illustrations are drawn in a simple, realistic style".|$|E
