5|$|Common names include Jersey cow mushroom, bovine bolete, and euro cow bolete. One {{proposed}} origin <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> name is that medieval knights—who revered Tricholoma equestre—considered this mushroom fit {{only for}} cattle-drovers {{as it was}} not highly valued.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{took their}} {{findings}} to Tizard {{in his capacity}} as the chairman of the Committee <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Scientific</b> Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW). He in turn passed them to Thomson, to whom the CSSAW had delegated responsibility for uranium research. After discussions between Cockcroft, Oliphant and Thomson, CSSAW created the MAUD Committee to investigate further.|$|E

5|$|Between 1973 and 1978, {{together}} with Dutch researcher Stan Tempelaars (1938–2010), Kaegi developed the VOSIM program. VOSIM, {{which stands for}} VOice SIMulator, is a system based on the digital sound synthesis of simple, sinusoidal square waves, allowing the modeling of vowel sounds, vocal fricatives and quasi-instrumental tones. It complemented, and was used in conjunction with, Gottfried Michael Koenig's own computer-generated music programs Project 1 (1964), Project 2 (1966) and SSP (1971). Werner Kaegi summed up the VOSIM system in 1986 in a presentation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> journal Interface.|$|E

5|$|The {{books were}} {{relatively}} expensive to print, {{because of the}} Corbould and Finden illustrations, the images <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> volumes, {{and the use of}} Spottiswoode's printing house. In order to cut costs, the publishers decided to use small print and narrow margins. An estimated 4,000 copies of the first edition of the early volumes were printed, but the print run would probably have fallen to 2,500 since the sales did not pick up after 1835. As {{it became clear that the}} series was not going to take off, fewer review copies were sent out and advertisements became smaller. Lardner's interest in the project may also have waned, as he paid less attention to its business dealings. However, some volumes of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia remained in print until 1890.|$|E
5|$|The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is {{responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> {{operation of the}} telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers. STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) and is physically located in Baltimore, Maryland on the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University, one of the 39 US universities and seven international affiliates {{that make up the}} AURA consortium. STScI was established in 1981 after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large. NASA had wanted to keep this function in-house, but scientists wanted it to be based in an academic establishment. The Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF), established at Garching bei München near Munich in 1984, provided similar support for European astronomers until 2011, when these activities were moved to the European Space Astronomy Centre.|$|E
