40|$|Charisma, {{the ability}} to command {{authority}} {{on the basis of}} personal qualities, is more difcult to dene than to identify. How do charismatic leaders such as Fidel Castro or Pope John Paul II attract and retain their followers? We present results of an analysis of subjective ratings of charisma from a corpus of American political speech. We <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> be- tween charisma ratings and ratings of other personal attributes.

40|$|International audienceWe {{show through}} a {{simulation}} study how the joint {{analysis of data}} from phase I and phase II studies enhances the power of pharmacogenetic tests in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. PK profiles were simulated under different designs along with 176 genetic markers. The null scenarios assumed no genetic effect, while under the alternative scenarios, drug clearance was associated to 6 genetic markers randomly sampled in each simulated dataset. We compared penalised regression Lasso and stepwise procedures to detect the associations between empirical Bayes estimates of clearance, estimated by nonlinear mixed effects models, and genetic variants. Combining data from phase I and phase II studies, even sparse, increases the power to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> between genetics and PK due to the larger sample size.

40|$|Nine body {{measurements}} and seven testicular measurements {{were obtained from}} 41 Awassi fat tailed ram lambs at seven months of age. Canonical correlation analyses were run to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> between testicular and body measurements as two sets of variables. Nine body and seven testicular measurements were used as predictor variables and criterion variables, respectively. For the first four canonical variate pairs, the canonical coefficients ranged from 0. 95 to 0. 74, and all significant at the 1 % level. According to analyses, heart girth circumference (HG), width at pinbones (WP) and width at hip joint (WHJ) {{can be regarded as}} the main factors in the generation of body dimensions. On the other hand, width of right testis (WRT) and width at distance between two testes (DPT) did not have pronounced effects on the emerged criterion variables.

40|$|Objectives: Few {{longitudinal}} studies have investigated how cyberbullying interacts with traditional bullying among young people, who are increasingly using online environments to seek information, entertainment and to socialise. This study aimed to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> between the relative contribution of cyberbullying victimisation and traditional bullying victimisation {{on social and}} emotional antecedents and outcomes among adolescents. Methods: Participants were a cohort of 1, 504 adolescents from 16 Australian schools followed from age 13 to 15 years. Results: Adolescents experiencing social and emotional difficulties {{were more likely to}} be cyberbullied and traditionally bullied, than traditionally bullied only. Those targeted in both ways experienced more harm and stayed away from school more often than those traditionally bullied only. Conclusions: These findings suggest a high coexistence of cyber and traditional bullying behaviours and their antecedents, and higher levels of harm from a combination of these behaviours for adolescents over time. Future research should engage students as co-researchers to enhance school and parent strategies to support adolescents experiencing difficulties, and to reduce the likelihood of both cyber and traditional bullying...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> among {{quality of}} life (QoL), social {{determinants}} and psychological distress in primary care in two cities in Brazil. Methods: A cross-sectional study with 1, 466 patients from 2009 to 2010. The statistical analysis used the t-test to compare the variables {{of interest to the}} study. Results: The prevalence of Common Mental Disorders (CMD 3), severe forms of Common Mental Disorders (CMD 5), anxiety and depression were 20. 5 %, 32 %, 37 % and 25. 1 % respectively. Thes presence of psychological distress is associated with worse QoL among the patients studied, especially those older than 40 years of age. In cases of CMD 3, those with higher income and educational levels presented higher QoL in the psychical and psychological domains. For the cases of probable anxiety, those with higher educational levels presented lower scores on the physical and social relationship scores. Conclusion: Psychological distress can be associated with a worse QoL among those studied and can be influenced by socioeconomic conditions. Therefore, it is important to structure patient-centered help, which should also include patients&# 8217; social contexts...|$|E

Methods This was a retrospective observational study from January 2009 to November 2014 of all adult patients who had non-neurologic critical illness, required endotracheal intubation and were referred for videofluoroscopic swallowing study. Demographic information, intensive care unit (ICU) admission diagnosis, severity of critical illness, duration of endotracheal intubation, length of stay in ICU, presence of PEA and severity of dysphagia were reviewed. Results Seventy-four patients were enrolled and their PEA frequency was 59 %. Patients with PEA had significantly longer endotracheal intubation durations than did those without (median [interquartile range]: 15 [9 – 21] vs. 10 [6 – 15] days; p= 0. 02). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the endotracheal intubation duration {{was significantly associated with}} PEA (odds ratio, 1. 09; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 01 – 1. 18; p= 0. 04).

40|$|Neuroimaging {{genetics}} is {{an emerging}} field {{that aims to}} <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> between genetic variants (e. g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) and quantitative traits (QTs) such as brain imaging phenotypes. In recent studies, in order to detect complex multi-SNP-multi-QT associations, bi-multivariate techniques such as various structured sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) algorithms have been proposed and used in imaging genetics studies. However, associations between genetic markers and imaging QTs identified by existing bi-multivariate methods may not be all disease specific. To bridge this gap, we propose an analytical framework, based on three-way sparse canonical correlation analysis (T-SCCA), to explore the intrinsic associations among genetic markers, imaging QTs, and clinical scores of interest. We perform an empirical study using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort to discover the relationships among SNPs from AD risk gene APOE, imaging QTs extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans, and cognitive and diagnostic outcomes. The proposed T-SCCA model not only outperforms the traditional SCCA method in terms of identifying strong associations, but also discovers robust outcome-relevant imaging genetic patterns, demonstrating its promise for improving disease-related mechanistic understanding...|$|E
40|$|As {{the most}} common type of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder initially manifested by impaired memory performances. While the diagnosis information indicates a dichotomous status of a patient, memory scores have the potential to capture the continuous nature of the disease progression and may provide more insights into the underlying mechanism. In this work, we performed a targeted genetic study of memory scores on an AD cohort to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> between a set of genes highly expressed in the hippocampal region and seven cognitive scores related to episodic memory. Both main effects and interaction effects of the targeted genetic markers on these correlated memory scores were examined. In addition to well-known AD genetic markers APOE and TOMM 40, our analysis identified a new risk gene NAV 2 through the gene-level main effect analysis. NAV 2 was found to be significantly and consistently associated with all seven episodic memory scores. Genetic interaction analysis also yielded a few promising hits warranting further investigation, especially for the RAVLT list B Score...|$|E
