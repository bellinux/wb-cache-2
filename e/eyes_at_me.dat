6000|$|... "But I have, {{after my}} fashion. I am not tumultuous, {{as he calls}} himself. Since he began to make <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> when he was nineteen--" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{directed}} his <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in that sidelong glance again, {{and he made}} his face very lantern-jawed, for the greater convenience of scraping, as he answered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha!" [...] {{said the}} stranger, quickly, and cocking his <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "The lonely church, right {{out on the}} marshes, with graves round it!" ...|$|R
60|$|G. Once only. He squelched like a mussuck, and the Troop-Sergeant-Major {{cocked his}} <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> You know old Haffy's eye. I {{was afraid to}} do it again.|$|R
60|$|My friend {{threw out}} the {{information}} in a very offhand way, but I saw that he cocked his <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> to see if I had followed his reasoning.|$|R
60|$|Potatoes! I {{had managed}} to forget them. In a moment I felt plunged into {{corruption}} up to my neck. Mr. Burns was making <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> behind the pilot's back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Please, boss," [...] said Priscilla, {{rolling her}} <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like an {{innocent}} calf, [...] "wont you buy dese roses fur missy? They's the puttiest roses I ever brought her yit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{shall have}} to go to church in a coach, and come back in another, and all the people will smell sweet, and make <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> behind my back, and wonder among {{themselves}} how the tailor will behave himself." ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. Once Only. He squelched like a mussuck, and the Troop--Sergeant-Major {{cocked his}} <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> You know old Haffy's eye. I {{was afraid to}} do it again.|$|R
6000|$|... "On occasion, sir; on occasion!" [...] He {{cocked his}} <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as if to}} gauge whether I were worthy of his confidence. [...] "The fact is, sir, that my wife is coming back to me to day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Keep {{under the}} sharpest thorns, {{no matter how}} badly your coat may be torn,' I whispered, and the Professor cocked his <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{in a way that}} told he was {{figuring}} how he could best get his claws in my back." ...|$|R
60|$|MISS WILLOUGHBY. A soldier? (Nervously) I wish {{it may not}} be that impertinent {{recruiting}} sergeant. I {{passed him}} in the street to-day. He closed one of his <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and then quickly opened it. I knew what he meant.|$|E
60|$|She made small <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> to {{discover}} if I was angry. She {{seemed to have}} an invincible faith in the virtuous dispositions of young men. And as I had spoken in measured tones and hadn’t got {{red in the face}} she let herself go.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're not in {{the past}} tense," [...] {{retorted}} Aunt Jamesina. [...] "I've got them yet. There are three old widowers at home who have been casting sheep's <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for some time. You children needn't think you own all the romance in the world." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was a pause}} {{after the}} stock-broker's clerk had {{concluded}} his surprising experience. Then Sherlock Holmes cocked his <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> leaning back on the cushions with a pleased and yet critical face, like a connoisseur who has just taken his first sip of a comet vintage.|$|R

60|$|Her fingers {{dropped from}} the {{frilling}} of her nightgown, and her fierce black <b>eyes</b> flashed <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|The old {{man with}} the cough jerked his head back so {{suddenly}} that it startled me, and shot another glance of his red <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from under the shade; but no one answered me. I waited a minute, glancing {{from one to the}} other.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a cert!" [...] Miss Montressor affirmed. [...] "The old woman's {{been playing}} the respectable all day, turning up the whites of her <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> because I did a high kick in the hall, and groaning at Flossie {{because she had a}} few brandies; ain't that so, Flossie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The thing's worth {{a million}} at least," [...] he said. [...] "A sixth share {{is a great}} fortune. Don't waste any time turning up the whites of your <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I've named my terms and I shan't budge from them. You can lay your bottom dollar on that." ...|$|E
60|$|Grosse's <b>eyes</b> glared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{through his}} {{spectacles}} with a dignity and gravity worthy of Mr. Finch himself.|$|R
60|$|My {{impressive}} ruffian drank {{what remained}} of his beer, while his black, sunken <b>eyes</b> looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> over the rim.|$|R
60|$|She swayed for {{a moment}} as though she would have fallen, and her <b>eyes</b> looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> full of fear.|$|R
6000|$|THE DANE. My dear friend! it is dhe plusquam perfectum, no, no--dhat {{is a great}} lie; are is dhe plusquam perfectum--and art is dhe plasquam plue-perfectum--(then {{swinging}} my hand to and fro, and cocking {{his little}} bright hazel <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> that danced with vanity and wine)--You see, my dear friend that I too have some lehrning? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You made <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> looking {{soft and}} kind, playing {{up all the}} time the fact that you wore skirts instead of pants--and all the time with your foot on the bell under the table. Well, there's some consolation. I'd sooner be poor Hughie Luke, doing his ten years, than be in your skin. Ma'am, hell is full of women like you." ...|$|E
60|$|The old {{man with}} the cough jerked his head back so {{suddenly}} that it startled me, and shot another glance of his red <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{from out of the}} darkness under the shade, but no one answered me. I waited a minute, glancing from one to the other. The old woman stared like a dead body, glaring into the fire with lack-lustre eyes.|$|E
60|$|I {{could only}} {{stare at her}} in stupid surprise. Her <b>eyes</b> blazed <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.|$|R
60|$|She gave a {{start and}} I felt her large <b>eyes</b> look <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> but I {{went on with}} it and with my needlework.|$|R
6000|$|Her <b>eyes</b> flashed <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{a sort of}} frightened merriment, and {{suddenly}} she exploded into a clear burst of laughter. [...] "Ha, ha, ha!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the fellow}} is mad, too. He {{tried to be}} sociable for a bit, and could find nothing else but to make big <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and ask me if I {{believed}} 'in communication beyond the grave.' Communication beyond--I didn't know what he meant at first. I didn't know what to say. 'A very solemn subject, Mr. Bunter,' says he. I've given {{a great deal of}} study to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's HER doin', then," [...] {{returned}} Arthur, with a laugh. [...] "She's always lookin' {{round the}} corners of her <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> when she passes. Why, John Rogers was joking me about her only yesterday, and said McGee would blow a hole through me some of these days if I didn't look out! Of course," [...] he added, affectedly curling his moustache, [...] "that's nonsense! But you know how they talk, and she's too pretty for that fellow McGee." ...|$|E
60|$|Instinct prevailed. Just as I {{could not}} bring myself to {{complete}} Tom o' Bedlam with Miss Bullace looking out of her <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> so I {{could not bring}} myself to offer money to Lady Pollacke's nice prim parlourmaid. Instead I hastily scrabbled up in tissue paper a large flat brooch--a bloodstone set in pinchbeck--a thing of no intrinsic value, alas, but precious to me {{because it had been}} the gift of an old servant of my mother's. I hastened out and lifting it over my head, pushed it into her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Absolutely, entirely sure.' I had {{a vision}} of two large <b>eyes</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> out of a photograph. It came and went in a flash.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I don't believe I'd care {{to trust}} Bunny {{in such a}} job as that,' Mr. Turtle said, looking {{out of the corner}} of his <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as if to say that I was to keep my paws out of his pies, which I was {{perfectly}} willing to do. 'If you'd turn around, Mr. Hedgehog, so's I could see just which quill I wanted it wouldn't take me long to get what I needed.' ...|$|R
60|$|Her <b>eyes</b> laughed <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> There was {{something}} softly provocative in them--a new and kinder light. I bent {{over her and}} kissed her. She sat quite still.|$|R
