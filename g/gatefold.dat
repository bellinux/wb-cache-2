5000|$|... 101 Billionaires, 2nd edition. Utrecht: Borotov Photography, 2009. [...] A cheaper edition (no <b>gatefolds)</b> with {{slightly}} updated text, whose publication {{was prompted by}} {{the news that the}} number of billionaires had plummeted to 49. Referred to by Hornstra and in reviews and notices as the 2009 Crisis Edition.|$|R
50|$|The <b>gatefold's</b> {{exterior}} was modelled in plasticine and, on its front, {{showed the}} logos or punning {{representations of the}} featured bands, whose album covers were depicted in the interior. The rear features the track listing scratched into a flattened layer of plasticine. The design is credited to Hamish & Gustav.|$|R
50|$|The centerfold or centrefold of a {{magazine}} refers to a <b>gatefolded</b> spread, usually a portrait such as a pin-up or a nude, inserted {{in the middle of}} the publication, or to the model featured in the portrait. In saddle-stitched magazines (as opposed to those that are perfect-bound), the centerfold does not have any blank space cutting through the image.|$|R
5|$|In 1969, Waters {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart Judy Trim, a successful potter; she was {{featured on the}} <b>gatefold</b> sleeve of the original release of Ummagumma, but excised from subsequent CD reissues. They had no children together and divorced in 1975. Trim died in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{back cover}} and inside sleeve by Paul Postle depict sulphur fields in Iceland, {{where much of}} the album was recorded. Postle also took photos of the band rehearsing for the <b>gatefold.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two LP {{versions}} of A Weekend in the City were released: a standard black vinyl copy in a <b>gatefold</b> sleeve and a limited edition picture disc version {{that has the}} album cover printed on Side A and the track listing printed on side B.|$|E
50|$|The non-pictorial covers {{used in the}} Music Band series {{continued}} on this, and the previous volume, The Best of the Music Band (1982) which has a blue cover. Unlike earlier volumes, the last two were not made with elaborate printing methods, but were manufactured using normal four colour printing, without metallic print, embossing, <b>gatefolds</b> or innersleeves.|$|R
5000|$|In double <b>gatefolds</b> {{there are}} three {{parallel}} folds. The left and right edges of the paper fold and meet in the middle, without overlapping, along a center fold. The outer panels (the ones that fold in to the middle) are usually 1/32" [...] to 1/8" [...] smaller than the inner panels (the ones covered by the panels that fold in) to allow for proper folding and nesting.|$|R
5000|$|The World We Live In was {{introduced}} to Lifes readership as [...] "the greatest series of science stories we have ever produced". It promised a [...] "unified, understandable picture story of the planet Earth" [...] authored by Lincoln Barnett, [...] "one of the most literate authors {{in the field of}} science". The series itself started two issues later. Each of the chapters sported art and photos, often presented in large <b>gatefolds</b> which showed two sides of a scenario.|$|R
5|$|Act I {{peaked at}} #27 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart. It was {{followed}} by the double album Acts II & III in November. The <b>gatefold</b> of Acts II & III featured collages taken from a medical journal, while the cover for Acts II & III featured a makeup artist applying blackface makeup to Zappa's face. Acts II & III peaked at #53 on the Pop Albums chart.|$|E
5|$|Artwork for Arthur {{was created}} by Bob Lawrie. The album was {{packaged}} in a <b>gatefold</b> sleeve, and included a shaped insert depicting Queen Victoria (holding a house containing Arthur Morgan), with lyrics on the reverse. Liner notes in the UK were written by Geoffrey Cannon and Julian Mitchell; in the US, notes by rock critic John Mendelsohn replaced Cannon's.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} October 28, 1997 in Europe through City Slang on compact disc, {{and received a}} standard vinyl LP pressing in Germany in conjunction with EFA distribution, {{as well as a}} limited edition pressing, featuring a <b>gatefold</b> cover and a promotional poster. The album was not released officially in the United States, although it was imported for sales in American retail stores and released December 10, 1997.|$|E
5000|$|George Brown Petty IV (April 27, 1894 - July 21, 1975) was an American pin-up artist. His pin-up art {{appeared}} {{primarily in}} Esquire and Fawcett Publications's True {{but was also}} in calendars marketed by Esquire, True and Ridgid Tool Company. Petty's Esquire <b>gatefolds</b> originated and popularized the magazine device of centerfold spreads. Reproductions of his work, known as [...] "Petty Girls," [...] were widely rendered by military artists as nose art decorating warplanes during the Second World War, including the Memphis Belle.|$|R
50|$|William Figge (1919? - 1976) was a {{professional}} photographer who, {{along with his wife}} Melba, ran a photography studio in Glendale, California. Figge was a combat photographer in World War II. After the war, he failed to find work as a cinematographer, so he stayed with photography and specialised in portraiture, shooting weddings and contributing to Playboy Magazine. Notably, he discovered many Playmates at weddings. Bill Figge, as he is sometimes called, shot 48 <b>gatefolds</b> and 3 covers. The couple ceased contributing to Playboy when the magazine became more risqué in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The 1970 album Hau-RUK {{contained}} two 20-minute-plus improvisations recorded {{live in a}} German bar {{earlier that}} year. Xhol's last LP, Motherfuckers GmbH & Co. KG, consists of several pieces recorded more or less live in the studio. Recorded in 1970, the album would not be released until 1972 due to creative differences between Xhol's members and Ohr label boss Ralf-Ulrich Kaiser. These differences even influenced the packaging of the album: although Ohr/Metronome usually lavished great care on the sleeves for its records—commissioning custom artwork with glossy lamination and <b>gatefolds</b> for even single LPs—the sleeve for MF consisted merely of hand-scrawled text on a box containing the master recordings of the album.|$|R
5|$|The {{cover for}} Thriller {{features}} Jackson {{in a white}} suit that belonged to photographer Dick Zimmerman. The <b>gatefold</b> sleeve reveals a tiger cub at Jackson's leg, which Zimmerman reported the singer mostly kept away from his face fearing he would be scratched. Another picture from the shoot, with Jackson embracing the cub, {{was used for the}} 2001 special edition of Thriller.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack {{album was}} {{released}} on vinyl album (with a <b>gatefold</b> sleeve), 8-track tape and audio cassette by Arista Records in 1977, with a total running time of 41 minutes (it was later released on compact disc in 1990). The soundtrack album was a commercial success, peaking at #17 on the US Billboard album chart in February 1978 and was certified Gold by the RIAA for 500,000 copies shipped. It also peaked at #40 in the UK album charts.|$|E
5|$|The user {{interface}} and menus {{were created by}} Joe Kowalski, who had previously worked on similar game elements for Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, and the Rock Band series. Much of the game's interface elements used a medieval woodcut art style, and were designed to contrast well against the world's graphics. The introductory menu is presented as an interactive movie created from live action clips of Jack Black manipulating a prop <b>gatefold</b> vinyl record album, using Adobe After Effects to provide the on-screen text, controls handling, and stitching of separate scenes into a seamless movie.|$|E
500|$|The <b>gatefold's</b> inner left panel, {{opposite}} the album's production credits, showed Harrison {{and his fellow}} musicians – Starr, Horn, Voormann, Hopkins, Keltner and Wright – at a long table, laden with food and wine. A deliberate parody of da Vinci's The Last Supper, the picture was taken in California at the mock-Tudor home of entertainment lawyer Abe Somers, by Hollywood glamour photographer Ken Marcus. As with the US coinage used on the back cover, various details in the photo represent what Harrison termed the [...] "gross" [...] aspects {{of life in the}} material world. Clayson has speculated about the symbolism and hidden messages within the photo: whether the nurse with a pram, set back from and {{to the left of the}} table, was a reference to Boyd's inability to conceive a child; and the empty, distant wheelchair in memory of Harrison's late mother. Theologian Dale Allison observes the anti-Catholic sentiment within this inner-gatefold photo, following on from Harrison's lyrics to his 1970 song [...] "Awaiting on You All". Harrison is dressed as a priest, all in black, sporting an Old West six-shooter – [...] "a slam at the perceived materialism and violence of the Roman church", Allison writes.|$|R
5|$|Early {{pressings}} of {{the sleeve}} {{were presented in}} a six-panel <b>gatefold</b> cover, with one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, no text was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E
5|$|Tetragrammaton {{issued the}} album in a stark <b>gatefold</b> sleeve, wrapped {{around with a}} {{segmented}} illustration from Hieronymus Bosch's painting The Garden of Earthly Delights. The label ran into difficulty {{over the use of}} the Museo del Prado-owned painting, which was incorrectly perceived in the US as being anti-religious, featuring immoral scenes, and was thus rejected or poorly stocked by many record shops. The original painting is in colour although it appeared on the LP in monochrome due to a printing error for the original layout and the band opted to keep it that way. Another section of the same Bosch painting (in colour) had previously been used as an album cover two years before by Pearls Before Swine on their debut One Nation Underground.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} released as a two-LP set with a <b>gatefold</b> {{jacket and a}} booklet containing lyrics, a text version of the story, and photographs taken by Ethan Russell illustrating it. MCA Records re-released the album as a two-CD set in 1985 with the lyrics and text story line on a thin fold-up sheet {{but none of the}} photographs. The album was reissued as a remastered CD in 1996, featuring a reproduction of the original album artwork. The original mix had been criticised in particular for Daltrey's vocals being buried, so the 1996 CD was completely remixed by Jon Astley and Andy Macpherson.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the United Kingdom on vinyl in mid-December 1979, and in the United States on vinyl and 8-track tape two weeks later. A <b>gatefold</b> cover design of the LP was only released in Japan. Though London Calling was released as a double album it was only sold for {{about the price of}} a single album. The Clash's record label, CBS, at first denied the band's request for the album to be released as a double. In return CBS gave permission for the band to include a free 12-inch single that played at 33⅓ rpm. Ultimately, the planned 12-inch record became a second nine-track LP.|$|E
25|$|Beatles for Sale was {{presented}} in a <b>gatefold</b> sleeve – a rare design feature for a contemporary pop LP and {{the first of the}} Beatles' UK releases to be packaged in this way. Part of the inner <b>gatefold</b> spread showed the band members in front of a photo montage of celebrities, including film stars Victor Mature, Jayne Mansfield and Ian Carmichael, all of whom the Beatles had met during 1964. Wilson comments that the adventurousness of this inner <b>gatefold</b> image anticipated Peter Blake's revolutionary cover design for the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gatefold</b> {{photograph}} inside KISS' album, Alive II, {{was shot}} here in 1977.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} UK vinyl {{release was}} in a <b>gatefold</b> sleeve featuring a black-and-white photo of the band, posed outdoors on a grassy hill, and was their first appearance on album artwork. To spread the original picture over the <b>gatefold,</b> Ozzy Osbourne was separated from {{the other members of}} the band and a section of the grass was copied and dropped into the gap.|$|E
25|$|A double vinyl {{edition of}} the remaster was {{released}} through Tonefloat on 8 July 2008, in memory of Michael Piper, {{a member of the}} Porcupine Tree crew, founder of the Gates Of Dawn record label, who died in April 2008. It was available in a limited run of 1,000 numbered copies on 180grams coloured vinyl in <b>gatefold</b> picture sleeve and a regular edition on 180grams black vinyl in <b>gatefold</b> picture sleeve.|$|E
25|$|Remastered vinyl The albums {{will also}} be {{available}} on special <b>gatefold</b> vinyl editions (vinyl editions include a download card).|$|E
25|$|The 30-year {{anniversary of}} C86 saw the {{original}} compilation issued in a deluxe <b>gatefold</b> sleeved double-LP edition for Record Store Day 2016.|$|E
25|$|The cover art and <b>gatefold</b> is a {{photograph}} of Ludlow Street (as shot from 99 Rivington Street), credited to Nathanial Hörnblowér, but shot by Jeremy Shatan.|$|E
25|$|Bowie {{collaborated with}} English pop artist Derek Boshier {{on the cover}} design. The {{original}} <b>gatefold</b> album sleeve featured a full-length shot of Bowie by photographer Brian Duffy as an accident victim, heavily made up with an apparently broken nose. For effect, the image was deliberately of low resolution, taken with a Polaroid SX-70 type camera. The inside of the <b>gatefold</b> included pictures of Che Guevara's corpse, Andrea Mantegna's Lamentation of Christ and Bowie being readied for the cover photo. These images were not reproduced in the Rykodisc CD reissue in 1991.|$|E
25|$|The {{album cover}} artwork was {{designed}} by Eve Babitz and featured photographs taken by Nancy Chester of The Byrds upon the steps of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, with the view of L.A. that originally made up the background being replaced by a desert scene. When the double album <b>gatefold</b> sleeve was opened up, {{the front and back}} cover photographs were mirrored symmetrically in a style reminiscent of the work of graphic artist M. C. Escher. The inside <b>gatefold</b> sleeve featured four individual black & white photographic portraits of the band members, along with liner notes written by Jim Bickhart and Derek Taylor.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the <b>gatefold</b> sleeve of the progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer's third studio album Trilogy features a photomontage showing multiple images of the band in the forest carpeted with autumn leaves.|$|E
