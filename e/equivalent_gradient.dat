This follows {{from the fact that}} an optimal receiver can be obtained in closed-form solution for any power vector. However, an efficient implementation of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>gradient</b> projection algorithm is notoriously difficult to achieve in decentralized wireless networks. Thus, we decompose the problem into two coupled subproblems and propose an alternating algorithm that converges to a stationary point. If we confine our attention to utility functions whose relative concavity is larger than that of the logarithmic function, numerical experiments suggest that then the proposed algorithm may converge to a global maximum for a large set of initial SIRs.|$|E

40|$|Gradient coil {{temperature}} {{is an important}} concern {{in the design and}} construction of MRI scanners. Closely spaced gradient coil windings cause temperature hot spots within the system as a result of Ohmic heating associated with large current being driven through resistive material, and can strongly affect the performance of the coils. In this paper, a model is presented for predicting the spatial temperature distribution of a gradient coil, including the location and extent of temperature hot spots. Subsequently, a method is described for designing gradient coils with improved temperature distributions and reduced hot spot temperatures. Maximum temperature represents a non-linear constraint and a relaxed fixed point iteration routine is proposed to adjust coil windings iteratively to minimise this coil feature. Several examples are considered that assume different thermal material properties and cooling mechanisms for the gradient system. Coil winding solutions are obtained for all cases considered that display a considerable drop in hot spot temperature (> 20 %) when compared to standard minimum power gradient coils with <b>equivalent</b> <b>gradient</b> homogeneity, efficiency and inductance.

40|$|The present work {{originates}} by {{a recent}} study on the uncovering of a scalar trend for the spectral characteristics related to the oxidation/crosslinking in an artificially aged resin film. It {{has been found that}} by moving {{from the surface of the}} aged resin towards its interface with the paint layer, crosslinking decreases. In the present work, the existence of this trend is tested on original samples, three 19 th century Byzantine icons covered with natural aged varnish layers of different type and thickness. The varnish layers have representative problems due to aging and preservation. The verification of the deterioration trend was possible by measuring the solubility of the material at subsequent depth-steps created within the same varnish layer. The realization of a number of satisfactory homogenous depth-steps, with enough space to perform the necessary solubility tests, has been possible through UV photo-ablation using a KrF excimer laser. The results of the chemical tests revealed that there is, indeed, an exponential gradient of the deterioration across the film thickness, which is directly related with an <b>equivalent</b> <b>gradient</b> in the solubility within the same varnish layer. Consequently, the deeper one goes into a varnish layer, progressively more dilute solutions of the appropriate solvent in an inert medium are required to remove it.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{difficult}} Venezuelan cementing challenges occur when zones with low fracture gradients or lost circulation problems are encountered. As more wells are drilled through depleted reservoirs, these problems are becoming more common. For PDVSA GAS Anaco in Venezuela, managed-pressure drilling (MPD) is of value when drilling through formations of this type, such as Merecure and San Juan sands in the San Joaquin field. MPD demonstrates its value by minimizing the loss of expensive oil-based mud and by increasing the typical drilling penetration rates up to three-fold. Formation damage may be further minimized when cementing these production strings with special zonal isolation procedures and cementing materials. With MPD, the intent is to apply proven underbalanced (UB) drilling technology and tools to precisely manage and control the annular fluid pressures safely within the wellbore to fit the given mud window. Before cementing, the well is typically close to balanced or slightly underbalanced and must be controlled with a UB choke manifold. The cementing fluid densities and pumping rates are designed so {{that at the end of}} the job, the resulting equivalent circulating density (ECD) is also near-balanced or slightly underbalanced. The liner hanger packer is set as soon as possible after checking the valves on the cementing float system to reduce the time any gas could migrate up through this specially designed new light or ultra-lightweight cement system. With these new light and ultra-lightweight cementing techniques, MPD-drilled wells can now be cemented with minimal formation damage, providing useful zonal isolation when subsequent well intervention is required.
