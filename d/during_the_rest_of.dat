5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the decade, {{the club}} won the league just {{once more in}} 1966–67. However, the 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their strong {{position}} in Italian football. Under former player Čestmír Vycpálek, they won the scudetto in 1971–72 and 1972–73, with players such as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio and José Altafini breaking through. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the decade, they won the league twice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The later win was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title (the UEFA Cup) in 1977 and helped the club's domination continue on into {{the early part of}} the 1980s. During Trapattoni's tenure, many Juventus players also formed the backbone of the Italy national team during Enzo Bearzot's successful managerial era, including the 1978 World Cup, UEFA Euro 1980 and 1982 world champion squads.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{initially}} the ice trade in Norway made do without ice houses, taking the ice {{directly from the}} lakes to the ships for transport during the winter and spring; between the 1850s and 1870s, however, numerous ice houses were constructed, allowing exports to take place <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the year as well.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt where she underwent a three-year refit that strengthened her armament. She was fitted with mine rails in 1914 and laid one minefield during World War I that damaged two German light cruisers. She was reconstructed beginning in late 1915 to further strengthen her armament, but played no part <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the war as her crew became involved in revolutionary activities in 1917. She was taken over by the Bolsheviks in late 1917, but was put into reserve in 1918 and sold for scrap in 1922.|$|E

5|$|Alec Coxon took match {{figures of}} 4/113 for Yorkshire against Australia, taking four middle-order wickets, and scored 21 and 16 not {{out in the}} middle-order. He came into the team as an all-rounder, even though his {{performances}} <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the English season had been mediocre; he had a batting average of 20.25 for the summer and took only ten wickets in seven matches prior to the county fixture against Australia. Bowes saw him as an attacking bowler compatible with Robins's strategic thinking.|$|E
5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Because of his father's latest prison break {{deception}} (a faked heart attack), Michael {{decides to}} leave his family and move to Phoenix, Arizona with George Michael, but discovers that he cannot leave the state, due to the Bluth Company being under investigation and him having to go jail {{as a replacement for}} his father. Lucille appoints Gob the new Bluth Company president, but since Gob proves utterly incompetent, the position's real duties revert to Michael. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the season Gob serves as figurehead president; Michael is still under scrutiny for George Sr.'s illegal activity.|$|E
50|$|In Moscow, space {{limitations}} forced a switch to 9 or 12-story buildings; the last 5-story Khrushyovka was completed there <b>during</b> 1971. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USSR continued building Khrushyovkas {{until the end}} of socialism; millions of such units are now past their design lifetime.|$|R

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the morning, an {{infantry}} battalion {{from the}} 22nd Armoured Brigade group, took up defensive {{positions in the}} town; the troops at Point 213 had been cut off and a force was assembled to extricate them. The relief force was unable to advance on the ridge, and when more German forces arrived between 11:00 and 13:00 the trapped squadron surrendered. More German troops had arrived, and engaged the 22nd Armoured Brigade group along the road back to Livry.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{gradually}} {{tightened the}} grip of Norwegian society, and the Parliament became defunct <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the German occupation of Norway. In 1941 Meisdalshagen became a prominent figure in the Norwegian resistance movement against German rule, {{in the position of}} district leader of Milorg in Valdres. In 1944 he left Norway and fled to Sweden, where he was a secretary at Flyktningskontoret in Stockholm until 1945. Briefly in 1945 he served as an advisor in London for the coordination of Milorg cells.|$|E
5|$|HMS Repulse was one {{of seven}} Royal Sovereign-class pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the 1890s. Assigned to the Channel Fleet, where she often served as a flagship, after {{commissioning}} in 1894, the ship participated {{in a series of}} annual manoeuvres, and the Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Fleet Review <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the decade. Repulse was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1902 and remained there until December 1903, when she returned home for an extensive refit. After its completion in 1905, Repulse was assigned to the Reserve Fleet until she was sold for scrap in 1911.|$|E

50|$|The Arch {{was planned}} for the world {{exhibition}} of 1880 and was meant to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the independence of Belgium. In 1880, only the bases of the columns were completed and, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> exhibition, <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arch was constructed from wooden panels.

50|$|Sphincterochila boissieri {{is active}} {{for a few}} days only after {{rainfall}} <b>during</b> <b>the</b> winter season, from November to March.

5|$|On April 4, {{he started}} against the Lotte Giants. He pitched 7 innings, while {{allowing}} 3 earned runs, but no run support and poor defence {{caused him to}} take the loss. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> April, Hacker had a lot of trouble in dealing with runners on base, because his pitching motion was vulnerable to stolen bases. So, by the end of April, Hacker was forced to make changes his pitching delivery.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch stage show {{featured}} DeLange and Waylon using a specially-designed microphone {{stand to}} allow them to face each other, both playing guitars, while a bassist, a drummer and a cellist performed in the background. Low lighting was used throughout the performance, with large swooping camera shots {{at the beginning and end}} of the song implemented along with several close-ups <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the performance. On the floor of the stage LED screens simulated road markings, while further screens on the background showed a rainy forest scene, transforming into a dry forest scene towards the end of the song's performance.|$|E
5|$|The first {{fortification}} at Camber {{may have}} been built shortly after 1486 by Sir Richard Guldeford, the Master of the Ordnance, who was given the manor of Higham by King Henry VII in exchange for Richard constructing a tower to protect the anchorage. There is no surviving evidence, however, to show if a tower was in fact built as Guldeford had promised, and Henry VII did not invest much in his coastal defences <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> his reign. Many castles across England were left in poor repair, often considered to be outdated and too expensive to maintain.|$|E

5|$|Voroshilov was {{withdrawn}} from active operations, however, {{after the loss}} of three destroyers that were attempting to interdict the German evacuation of the Taman Bridgehead to air attack on 6 October 1943. This loss caused Stalin to forbid the deployment of large naval units without his express permission which was not granted <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the war. The ship was transferred to Novorossiysk on 18 August 1944 and to Sevastopol on 5 November. She was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 8 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Although Blažević {{continued}} his tenure {{in spite of}} failure to qualify for Euro 2000, he resigned in October 2000 following draws against Belgium and Scotland {{in the first two}} games of the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. His successor at the helm of the national team was Mirko Jozić, who previously led the Yugoslavia under-20 team to a World Cup triumph in 1987. Despite the retirement of many Golden Generation players, Croatia went unbeaten <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the qualifiers. They opened their 2002 World Cup campaign with a narrow loss to Mexico before producing a surprise 2–1 victory over Euro 2000 finalists Italy in the next fixture, giving life to hopes of passing through to the knockout stage. However, they lost their final group fixture to Ecuador and were eliminated. Jozić then resigned, and was replaced in July 2002 by Croatian-Austrian Otto Barić, the team's first manager born outside the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1066 Norman {{conquest of}} England, {{the land and}} {{properties}} of Aldermaston formed part of the estates of Harold Godwinson, the Earl of Wessex, who later became King Harold II of England. Harold's assessment of Aldermaston valued the village's 15 hides at £20 a year. As {{with much of the}} land seized by William the Conqueror after his arrival in England in 1066, Aldermaston was held in demesne. His Domesday Survey of 1086 identified the existence of a mill, worth twenty shillings, and two fisheries, worth five shillings. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> William's reign, and that of his son William Rufus, Aldermaston was owned by the Crown.|$|E
