40|$|Introduction Strains of Shiga-toxin {{producing}} Escherichia coli O 157 (STEC O 157) {{are important}} foodborne pathogens in humans, and outbreaks of illness {{have been associated}} with consumption of undercooked beef. Here, we determine the most effective intervention strategies to reduce the prevalence of STEC O 157 contaminated beef carcasses using a modelling approach. Method A computational model simulated events and processes in the beef <b>harvest</b> <b>chain.</b> Information from empirical studies was used to parameterise the model. Variance-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using the Saltelli method identified variables with the greatest influence on the prevalence of STEC O 157 contaminated carcasses. Following a baseline scenario (no interventions), a series of simulations systematically introduced and tested interventions based on influential variables identified by repeated Saltelli GSA, to determine the most effective intervention strategy. Results Transfer of STEC O 157 from hide or gastro-intestinal tract to carcass (improved abattoir hygiene) had the greatest influence on the prevalence of contaminated carcases. Due to interactions between inputs (identified by Saltelli GSA), combinations of interventions based on improved abattoir hygiene achieved a greater reduction in maximum prevalence than would be expected from an additive effect of single interventions. The most effective combination was improved abattoir hygiene with vaccination, which achieved a greater than ten-fold decrease in maximum prevalence compared to the baseline scenario. Conclusion Study results suggest that effective interventions to reduce the prevalence of STEC O 157 contaminated carcasses should initially be based on improved abattoir hygiene. However, the effect of improved abattoir hygiene on the distribution of STEC O 157 concentration on carcasses is an important information gap—further empirical research is required to determine whether reduced prevalence of contaminated carcasses is likely to result in reduced incidence of STEC O 157 associated illness in humans. This is the first use of variance-based GSA to assess the drivers of STEC O 157 contamination of beef carcasses...|$|E

With the growth of population, demand for wood products is increasing tremendously. Prices have gone up manyfold. One way to meet this demand is to increase productivity by reducing the wastage of wood and by saving time on various operations. The present tools and equipment are no longer adequate to achieve this goal so we should introduce new machines in timber <b>harvesting.</b> <b>Chain</b> saws, the first step toward mechanization, was introduced successfully, about 40 years ago in Europe and Northern iuerica.

40|$|Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) {{systems are}} special mirror {{assemblies}} that track {{the sun and}} concentrate its radiation, converting thus solar energy to medium- to high-temperature heat and through that to electricity. CSP power plants that employ air as the heat transfer fluid can benefit from commonalities in materials and design requirements within the entire spectrum of solar energy <b>harvesting</b> <b>chain,</b> namely capture, transformation and storage-related processes. Such commonalities can be exploited with the synergistic use of the gas-solid heat exchange functionality of ceramic porous structures like honeycombs and foams and the thermochemical activity of redox pair oxides. Honeycombs or foams capable of absorbing concentrated solar irradiation and therefore operating as volumetric receivers in the solar energy capture module, when coated or made entirely of redox oxide systems that can react with water or carbon dioxide, can be employed as chemical reactors {{for the production of}} the so-called solar fuels like hydrogen and syngas. In this case, the harvested solar energy is not converted directly to electricity, but into chemical bonds (chemical substances). With a similar rationale, chemically inert porous solid materials operating as regenerative recuperators during off-sun operation of air-operated Solar Tower Power Plants, if coated with or manufactured of, other oxide systems, capable of redox operation within this temperature range accompanied by significant heat effects, can render the storage concept from “purely” sensible to “hybrid” sensible/ thermochemical one within the same volume. The construction modularity of such systems provides for the design of the entire reactor/heat exchanger module as a structure with rational spatial variation of redox oxide materials chemistry and solid materials porosity in three dimensions, tailored to the local temperature and flow conditions.

40|$|The aim of our {{research}} was to compare the N fertilizer value of different clover-grass (CG) based fertilizers. A pot trial was set up with 8 treatments with Lolium perenne: fresh CG, ensiled CG, compost from CG, solid manure and liquid manure from dairy cows fed with CG, biogas digestate, an unfertilized and a mineral fertilizer control. Our hypothesis was that compared to composting, and to other treatments (e. g. silage) biogas digestates allow for a more efficient N fertilization due to a lower C/N ratio and a higher share of NH 4 +. Dry matter yield, C/N ratio, N concentration, N release and Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) were examined. The results show the highest overall NUE, N release and yield in the treatment with biogas digestate and {{the lowest in the}} compost treatment. The overall efficiency of a treatment approach was also influenced by the N transfer rates during the entire treatment chain. The short-term N fertilizer efficiency was mainly influenced by the characteristics of the amendments used, while the long-term N fertilizer efficiency is mainly influenced by the transfer factors during the <b>chain</b> <b>harvesting</b> treatment fertilization. In conclusion, any approach for a more efficient N use from the clover grass biomass-N should focus on reduction of N-losses while the chemical characteristics of the obtained fertilizer product is less relevant...|$|R

Fine-grained analyses of feedstock availability are an important precursor to increased investment in these systems in Australia. This study presents estimates of the potential biomass for energy supply from hardwood plantations within the Sunshine Coast Council region of southeast Queensland. The region’s 1, 120 ha of private farm forestry, corporate-owned and joint venture hardwood plantations are predominantly small-scale (> ha) Gympie Messmate (Eucalyptus cloeziana) monocultures. Plantation age-class and corresponding area, productivity and management history findings and informed harvest-related assumptions underpin a 20 -year forecast of biomass yields from a suggested plantation harvest schedule. The biomass yields are underbark stem-wood quantities assumed to be unmerchantable for higher-value solid-wood products. Future thinning (at age 12 years) and clearfell harvests (age 25 years) could provide minimum woody biomass yields of 30 and 108 GMt/ha respectively. Closer to 200 GMt/ha may be available from clearfell harvests of poorly-managed farm forestry plantations. The forecast annually available biomass supply is highly variable and mostly of small quantities. Biomass energy plants seeking a sustainable supply of feedstock must therefore access additional locally-available waste biomass. Further research is required to identify and quantify these sources. Field trials are also required to understand better the likely product mixes and available volumes of biomass for energy from the region’s various hardwood plantations and to test for efficient integrated biomass <b>harvest</b> and supply <b>chain</b> systems for the sizes and terrains that are characteristic of these plantations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of {{increasing}} energy demand, forest timber residues and leaves are a potential resource for fuel. How renewable are these resources? What are their qualities as a fuel? These issues can be answered through parallel works in two research fields: forest sciences considering nutrients cycles between plants and soil and growth and yield dynamics of the trees, and energy sciences considering the qualities of fuel such as heating value, and ash content. This interdisciplinary interaction leads to the balanced thinking between nutrient dynamics (harvesting forest residues while maintaining soil fertility and wood production) and energy interests. In a previous work, a study was presented that intended to bridge the two research fields by predicting the ash content and higher heating value in trees from a model developed by biogeochemists for predicting elemental composition distributed in several tree compartments. The models developed were applied on predictions of characteristics of forest products. These characteristics were outputted from a growth and yield simulator developed by forest research.

This manuscript includes a literature review of the maize production chain in Guatemala, a survey about agricultural practices used {{in the region of}} study, as well as a characterization of the analyzed maize regarding its mycoflora, nutritional composition, and insect infestation. To better understand the current situation regarding agricultural practices and maize consumption, a survey was carried out. Sample consisted of 280 families representing 14 rural communities distributed in the townships of Todos Santos and Chiantla, Huehuetenango, Guatemala. In addition, 25 farms from the same region were sampled for maize, which was evaluated for fungal count, fumonisin and aflatoxin, and insect analysis. Among surveyed farmers, 13 grew and <b>harvested</b> maize (denominated <b>Chain</b> 1, C 1) while 12 had no land available to plant and consequently acquired maize by other means (denominated Chain 2, C 2) such as local markets. Due to a clear diversity in the phenotype of the corn samples, proximate analyses of the various cultivars was conducted. Most Guatemalan farmers from the rural area have low income and large families, thus the economic aspect is a key factor for farmers desiring to improve in their lives. By the implementation of a metal silo, farmers who have the means to acquire this technology would improve their grain quality and safety and, with that, their livelihoods. A financial analysis was conducted to evaluate the economic feasibility of the farmers on purchasing the storage technology and either obtaining revenue (C 1) or saving money (C 2) in the process would be able to afford such a vessel.

40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{application}} of Markov Chain theory for rice yield forecasting. Yield forecasts {{are based on the}} eco-physiological process of rice growth given measurable rice crop characteristics and weather data at intermediate times in the growing season of the rice crop. The ORYZA 1 model is used to simulate a database containing rice yields and rice crop conditions at specified times during the growing season. The model was ran on 32 years of historical weather data (1959 - 1990) from the meteorological station at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Los Baños(121 15 E Latitude: 14 11 N Altitude: 21. 0 m), Laguna, Philippines. As input to the model, the study adopted the parameters on one of the representative yield potential field experiments at IRRI during the 1992 dry season for the IR 72 variety planted on a 15 x 15 m 2 plot. Based on the output of ORYZA 1, a Markov Chain (matrix of transition probabilities) was constructed to provide forecast distributions of rice yield for various rice condition classes at different rice phenological stages prior to <b>harvest.</b> This Markov <b>Chain</b> can provide several statistics of interests. This ranges from mean, percentile (median) and standard error of the forecasts to probability interval forecasts and predicted probabilities of exceeding (or falling bellow) target yields.

Lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks costs were estimated using both corn stover and switchgrass {{as part of}} the feedstock supply <b>chain.</b> <b>Harvest</b> and transport cost for multi-pass biomass harvest operations using multiple feedstocks were analyzed and the optimal number of machines for all unit operations were estimated for each supply chain. This dissertation calculated and compared the biomass harvest and transport cost for single pass biomass harvest with bulk and bale collections of biomass. The objective of the research was to find the optimal number of machines, and least cost biomass harvest and transportation costs based on the harvest window, machine capacity, farm sizes and yield of the biomass. The least cost model was developed using the mixed integer non-linear programming model developed in General Algebraic Modeling System. The cost of harvest and transport using the bulk stover collection method was estimated about $ 25 Mg- 1 ($ 23 ton- 1) considering a transport distance of 3. 2 km (2 miles) for primary storage from the field with the harvestable stover yield of 4. 4 Mg ha- 1 (2 ton ac- 1) for the farm size of 2, 000 ha.

40|$|Mechanical {{damage of}} {{agricultural}} products {{is one of}} the main problems in the <b>harvest</b> and postharvest <b>chain</b> due to the large economic loss that the shelf life reduction could generate. Measurements of change in the chemical components of highly perishable products and microbial growth under different static and dynamic loads is the first step in the development of intelligent logistic units that could help in predicting the residual shelf life in order to minimize losses along the supply chain. In our research, the effects of vibration along the supply chain of a case study were analyzed on strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) and woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) in terms of microbiological and quality assessment. Fruits were subjected to vibration in a temperature-controlled environment, simulating the transport conditions. Microbiological and quality analyses were conducted in three different positions along the column of the crates. The results were compared with the nonvibrated strawberries stored in the same environmental conditions along the whole cold chain, showing that vibrations cause a significant decrease in the qualitative characteristics of both fruits. Practical Applications: The practical application obtainable from our research is the development of ad hoc economically affordable sensors based on the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the microorganisms showing the most rapid increase. The measurement of the VOCs of the dominant microorganisms could be implemented in a smart logistic unit as it provides information on the microbial evolution in real time. The research proposed configures as a first step to achieve such objective, and toward the development of a supply chain monitoring and control infrastructure relaying on the correlation of vibration phenomena with the VOCs originated by the microbiological activity.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}}. The {{aim of the}} article is {{deepening}} the theoretical and methodological foundations for the formation and development of economics of ecosystem services. The results of the analysis. Economics of ecosystem services is the sphere of natural and social development, which implies reproduction (production), exchange, distribution and consumption of different ecosystem goods and services, and formation of mechanisms and instruments of their evolving in the system of economic relations {{that is based on}} ecosystem management in the nature economy and various resources using. Economics of ecosystem services is based on application of the ecosystem approach to managing the nature economy, rational use, reproduction and protection of natural resources and the environment. Ecosystem approach represents a methodological framework to justify management decisions made by economic actors in development strategies and formation of methods of planning. This approach does not replace other strategies of environmental management and programs that are aimed to protect the environment preserve individual species of living organisms. It rather should facilitate the integration of all existing international and national programs and methods. The core of the process of the ecosystem approach forming for economic systems managing is ecosystem services. Ecosystem functions are the physical, chemical, and biological processes or attributes that contribute to the self-maintenance of an ecosystem; in other words, they show what the ecosystem does. Some examples of ecosystem functions are provision of wildlife habitat, carbon cycling, or the trapping of nutrients. Thus, the processes, or functions, that occur within them, such as wetlands, forests, or estuaries can characterize ecosystems,. Ecosystem services are the beneficial outcomes, for the natural environment or people that result from ecosystem functions. Some examples of ecosystem services are such as: support of the food <b>chain,</b> <b>harvesting</b> of animals or plants, and the provision of clean water or scenic views. In order for an ecosystem to provide services to humans, some interaction with humans is required. Thus, functions of ecosystems are value-neutral, while their services have value to society. Thus, the term «ecosystem servicers» is determined as the flows of economic benefits and values that economic actors and other stakeholders receive from the use of existing ecosystem functions, as well as those resulting from the generation, reproduction, regulation of ecosystem processes and which are formed as a result of targeted activities of various entities with different types of the ownership and hierarchical levels of management. Conclusions and directions of further researches. Definition of ecosystem services as an economic category is the central element of a comprehensive system of relationships between the functioning of natural ecosystems, economic activities and prosperity of society. The interrelation between concepts, ecosystem services and natural capital, natural resources, ecosystem functions deepen the essence-conceptual apparatus of the environmental economics. It is expedient to use some individual criteria and groups of determinants during the classification of ecosystem servicers such as: functional and regulatory features, ecosystem features, time features and group of organizational and economic features. Further researches should be addressed to the management, reproduction and protection of ecosystems and ecosystem services from the perspectives of implementation of the mechanism of nature management at different hierarchical levels...|$|R
