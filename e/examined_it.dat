During that time, in Paris, German scholar Johann Leonhard Hug (1765–1846) saw it. Hug <b>examined</b> <b>it,</b> together with other worthy treasures of the Vatican, {{but he did not}} perceive the need of a new and full collation.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library {{publications}} such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which <b>examined</b> <b>it</b> only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices, which pointed out the complexity, depth and consistency of the world Rowling had built) {{attracted the attention of}} reviewers in major newspapers. Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book, they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.|$|E

5|$|The Rasi Salai Dam was {{completed}} in 1994, {{around the same time}} as the Pak Mun Dam, and received similar local complaints. The dam's central reservoir was occupied for two years by villagers, until a July 2000 decision opened the sluice gates. From 2003 to 2004, Living River Siam coordinated Thai Baan research in three districts: Amphoe Rasi Salai, Amphoe Rattanaburi, and Amphoe Phon Sai. The report examined village culture, ecology, biodiversity, agriculture, and food and water management. The impact of the closing and opening of the sluice gates was also <b>examined.</b> <b>It</b> was concluded that the dam reduced fish populations, but more importantly, flooded natural salt pits and spread them into rice and vegetable fields, destroying trees and crops. The government has not made a commitment to keep the Rasi Salai Dam out of commission, but as of 2008 the gates have not yet been closed.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Walgreens {{senior vice}} {{president}} of supply chain and logistics Randy Lewis began a program aimed at providing opportunity to the disabled to work side by side with non-disabled workers. The result was the development and opening of two distribution centers whose staff is approximately 40% disabled. The model was so successful that other companies such as Clarks Companies NA, Glaxo Smith Kline, Best Buy, and Costco have either <b>examined</b> <b>it</b> or placed it under consideration.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} later, another Maya codex was found possessed by another collector, which {{became known as}} the Codex Cortesianus (in the belief that {{it had been in the}} {{possession}} of Hernán Cortés). When Léon de Rosny <b>examined</b> <b>it</b> later, he determined that it was actually a part of the Troano codex, the two parts having been separated at some indeterminate time during the past. The two parts were later rejoined and are known collectively as the Codex Madrid or Tro-Cortesianus; they remain displayed in Madrid.|$|E

All of his records of orders and shipments of arms from 1859 to 1860 were <b>examined.</b> <b>It</b> is recorded that in response to John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, he bolstered the Federal arsenals in some Southern states by over 115,000 muskets and rifles in late 1859. He also ordered heavy ordnance to be shipped to the Federal forts in Galveston Harbor, Texas, and the new fort on Ship Island off the coast of Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|James Maybrick died at {{his home}} in Aigburth on 11 May 1889. His brothers, {{suspicious}} as to the cause of death, had his body <b>examined.</b> <b>It</b> was found to contain slight traces of arsenic, but not enough to be considered fatal. It is uncertain whether this was taken by Maybrick himself or administered by another person. After an inquest held in a nearby hotel, Florence Maybrick was charged with his murder and stood trial at St George's Hall, Liverpool, before Mr. Justice Stephen, where she was convicted and sentenced to death.|$|E

When the monolith is excavated and <b>examined,</b> <b>it</b> {{is found to be}} a black cuboid whose sides extend in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (1² : 2² : 3²). However, in the novel, Clarke suggests that this sequence or ratio extends past the three known spatial dimensions into the much higher dimensions, like this: 16 : 25 : 36...|$|E

25|$|Carl Peters {{collected}} a ceramic ushabti in 1901. Flinders Petrie <b>examined</b> <b>it</b> and identified a cartouche on its chest {{as belonging to}} the 18th Dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III and suggested {{that it was a}} statuette of the king and cited it as proof of commercial ties between rulers in the area and the ancient Egyptians during the New Kingdom (c. 1550 BC–1077 BC), if not a relic of an old Egyptian station near the local gold mines. Johann Heinrich Schäfer later appraised the statuette, and argued that it belonged to a well-known group of forgeries. After having received the ushabti, Felix von Luschan suggested that it was of more recent origin than the New Kingdom. He asserted that the figurine instead appeared to date to the subsequent Ptolemaic era (c. 323 BC–30 BC), when Alexandria-based Greek merchants would export Egyptian antiquities and pseudo-antiquities to southern Africa.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} library, Harris and Klebold entered the science area, where they threw {{a small fire}} bomb into an empty storage closet. It caused a fire, which was put out by a teacher hidden in an {{adjacent}} room. The duo proceeded toward the south hallway, where they shot into an empty science room. At approximately 11:44a.m., Harris and Klebold were captured on the school security cameras as they re-entered the cafeteria. The recording shows Harris kneeling on the landing and firing a single shot {{toward one of the}} propane bombs he and Klebold had earlier left in the cafeteria, in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate it. He took a sip from one of the drinks left behind as Klebold approached the propane bomb and <b>examined</b> <b>it.</b> Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the propane bomb. As the two left the cafeteria, the Molotov cocktail exploded, partially detonating one of the propane bombs at 11:46a.m. Two minutes later, approximately one gallon of fuel ignited in the same vicinity, causing a fire that was extinguished by the fire sprinklers.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 2012, Darchinyan lost to WBC bantamweight {{champion}} Shinsuke Yamanaka in Yamanaka's {{home country}} of Japan. The fight {{was not without}} controversy. Darchinyan was slightly ahead on one card {{and the other two}} were even after the fourth round. In the fourth, a clash of heads opened a bloody cut on Darchinyan's eyebrow and nose. Yamanaka hit Darchinyan with an elbow on the same eyebrow in round five, severing the cut. The referee was not in line of sight to see this. Blood was pouring more rapidly out of Darchinyan's eyebrow afterward and the ringside doctor <b>examined</b> <b>it.</b> A fight would usually be stopped and given a technical decision at this point, but the cut was controversially ruled to have been caused by a punch by the ringside doctor, who examined the cut in the sixth round, when Darchinyan was ahead on points. Darchinyan, fighting with blood in his eyes {{for the rest of the}} fight, lost via decision. The headbutt and elbow thrown by Yamanaka had raised much controversy, as Darchinyan was winning the fight beforehand and his performance seemed to slow down as consequence. The result is currently being protested by Team Darchinyan with photographic proof Yamanaka used an illegal headbutt and elbow.|$|E
