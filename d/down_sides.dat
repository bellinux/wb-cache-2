25|$|Gable {{and colleagues}} have {{delineated}} four basic types of responses individuals may exhibit when a relationship partner shares a positive event with them. Active-constructive responses clearly communicate {{enthusiasm for the}} positive event, passive-constructive responses express support in a quiet, understated way, active-destructive responses squash the event and the partner's enthusiasm (e.g., by pointing out potential <b>down</b> <b>sides</b> of the positive event), and passive-destructive responses ignore and/or communicate disinterest in the event. Only active-constructive responses are associated with emotional and relationship well-being.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} station had goods facilities on both up and <b>down</b> <b>sides</b> {{but these}} were eventually closed by 17 January 1965. This area is now a car park on the down side and industrial units on the up side. The large goods shed next to the station master's house was also demolished in the early 1990s. The up side station building was burnt down in a fire in September 1986 but was rebuilt in a more basic style coupled with flats above it. The station masters house survived {{and is the only}} surviving structure left.|$|E

50|$|Private equity firms {{characteristically}} make longer-hold {{investments in}} target industry sectors or specific investment {{areas where they}} have expertise. Private equity firms and investment funds {{should not be confused}} with hedge fund firms which typically make shorter-term investments in securities and other more liquid assets within an industry sector but with less direct influence or control over the operations of a specific company. Where private equity firms take on operational roles to manage risks and achieve growth through long term investments, hedge funds more frequently act as short-term traders of securities betting on both the up and <b>down</b> <b>sides</b> of a business or of an industry sector's financial health.|$|E
5000|$|The Cleopatra {{mandarin}} fruit {{belong to}} the [...] "acidic" [...] group of mandarins, which are too sour to be edible. When they are grown {{it is for the}} rootstock or for juice production. The rootstock can handle multiple soil conditions including tolerance to the presence of limestone, salinity and soil alkalinity along with being suitable for shallow soils. It is resistant to citrus tristeza virus and exocortis but is sensitive to root asphyxia and Phytophthora. One of the <b>down</b> <b>sides</b> to using the rootstock is it grows slow in the early years. In the right conditions it can induce high productivity and excellent fruit quality, although these are usually somewhat smaller than with others.|$|E
5000|$|CatChum {{was made}} within the {{limitations}} of Kaypro's early text-only computers. As a result, the maze is made {{from a series of}} dashes and other punctuation marks.

The four ghosts are letters [...] "A" [...] (which turn to [...] "M"s when the CatChum Pac-Man chomps a power-pellet), and the [...] "fruits" [...] are represented by a dollar signs. One of the major <b>down</b> <b>sides</b> of this clone is that Kaypros of that era did not have the ability to flip the text characters. As a result, even when the character is chomping pellets on his left, for example, his chomping mouth is still on the right.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} here survived through nationalisation and was demolished in 1980, {{leaving no}} shelter for waiting passengers. The former goods platform is still distinguishable on the westerly {{side of the}} railway station, the siding itself being long-since lifted. Until 1991 the pointwork was still {{in place at the}} northerly end of the railway station but this was removed when remedial works were carried out at this time. In 1991 the shelter from Braddan Bridge on the long-abandoned line to Peel was refurbished and moved here, but since the railway station received platforms on both up and <b>down</b> <b>sides</b> of the loop in conjunction with an all-island sewerage network in 2002, the waiting shelter is no longer at platform height, being left in-situ at a lower point giving it an unusual appearance in respect of the actual platforms.|$|E
5000|$|Jason White of AllGame {{gave the}} PlayStation version 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "The {{characters}} and bosses are average {{as far as}} appearance goes and the game itself isn't very inventive. Hardcore gamers will find this okay to rent but most diehard Xena fans will love this game." [...] White noted that the [...] "gameplay is extremely basic. While you can wander anywhere on the screen, the game itself is a strict linear adventure. If you don't beat all the enemies nor complete whatever task is asked of you, then you can't move on. Xena walks along a paved path throughout the adventure, sort of 'yellow brick road-ish.' You walk down the path, fight the bad guys, get a key and go through a gate. This is pretty much how the game plays the whole time. There are painfully long load times between levels. A bit of slow down occurs when Xena fights too many enemies at once which lets {{one or two of}} them get in a free shot while you're left trying to face them." [...] White also wrote, [...] "There are only two real <b>down</b> <b>sides</b> to the game. There are so many moves to use that you need a few extra fingers to press all the buttons so you can see all her moves. ... The other is that in order to perform simple tasks like jumping, you need to use a certain button combination, otherwise you'll end up going past or coming up just short of your mark. The one thing missing is that you can only attack one enemy at a time, very un-Xena like." ...|$|E
50|$|Re-potting: Potting Terrestrial Orchids Good {{drainage}} is important. Mix 3 parts fibrous peat, 3 parts coarse grit, 1 part perlite, and 1 part charcoal. Select a pot {{that will}} accommodate roots and about 2 years growth, but no more. Make {{sure that it}} has a drainage hole. Hold the orchid over the pot so that the crown is just below the rim of the pot. With your other hand, fill pot with moistened soil mix, tamping to firm. There really is no need to add crockery {{to the bottom of the}} pot, but you may want to add a small square of wire mesh or other permiable fabric over hole in bottom of pot. Potting Epiphytic Orchids Epiphytes prefer conditions where roots can be exposed, therefore, tight pots and close-contact soil mixes do not work well and will induce rot. Mix 3 parts dust-free, medium-grade bark, 1 part coarse grit or perlite, 1 part charcoal, and 1 part peat moss together, OR use a commercial orchid mix. As with the terrestrial orchid, select a pot that will accommodate roots and about 2 years growth, but no more. Make sure {{that it has a}} drainage hole. Even better, select an orchid pot, which has vertical slits <b>down</b> <b>sides.</b> Hold orchid over pot so that crown is just below the rim of the pot. With other hand, fill pot with moistened bark mix, tamping to firm. Some epiphytes do not need to be potted and prefer to grow on a mound or slab of bark. Until roots attach, tie orchid in place with fishing line. Constant humidity is a must. Support Orchids that have long flower stalks will need staking. Staking is best done as stem grows and before buds open. Many growers prefer to insert stake when potting orchid, but it is up to you.|$|E
