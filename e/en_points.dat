40|$|Complexes of {{aluminum}} and gallium trihalides with ethylenediamine (en) and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (tmen) of 2 : 1 composition have been synthesized and structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In contrast to known molecular complexes of hydrido and methyl-substituted analogs, these solid complexes adopt ionic {{structures of the}} general type [M 1 X 2 LL]+[M 2 X 4]− (X = Br, I; M 1, M 2 = Al or Ga; LL = en, tmen). Quantum chemical computations at B 3 LYP/LANL 2 DZ(d,p) level of theory showed that molecular complexes M 1 X 3 LLM 2 X 3 are more stable in the gas phase compared to the [M 1 X 2 LL]+[M 2 X 4]− ion pairs. Ionic complexes of metal halides with en and tmen are predicted {{to exist in the}} solid state due to strong X− affinity of MX 3 and favorable crystallization energy. Considerably lower H− and CH 3 − affinity of MH 3 and M(CH 3) 3 favors molecular structures for complexes of hydrides and methyl derivatives both in the gaseous and condensed state. Comparative case study between complexes of AlCl 3 with ammonia and <b>en</b> <b>points</b> out that AlCl 3 NH 3 adduct exist in molecular form due to strong intermolecular Hcdots, three dots, centeredCl interaction. Molecular structure of GaBr 3 NH 3 adduct was experimentally confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis...|$|E
40|$|Mothers with {{untreated}} phenylketonuria (PKU) have {{an increased}} risk of bearing children with congenital malformations. PKU causes accumulation of phenylalanine (PHE) and its metabolites in urine and blood, and this condition may contribute to the developmental problems. In the present study we investigated the embryotoxicity of these compounds in the rat postimplantation embryo culture system. Whereas PHE was ineffective, phenylpyruvic acid and phenylacetic acid induced general growth retardation. Phenylacetic acid and O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid were also growth retarding and in addition affected yolk sac circulation. Phenylethylamine was the most embryotoxic compound tested, with a lowest effective concentration of 0. 03 g/l. It induced various anomalies including incomplete flexion and neural tube defects. The effects of a mixture of phenylketones in culture did not reveal synergism between compounds. In the presence of maternal hepatocytes PHE was metabolized in culture without leading to embryotoxic effects. Extending culture duration from 26 to 48 hours did not increase sensitivity to phenylpyruvic acid. No changes in osmolarity or pH of media were observed that might have been responsible for the embryotoxicity observed. Analysis with HPLC of media after culture revealed no biotransformation of added compounds into other metabolites, except for phenylpyruvic acid. In addition, in the presence of maternal hepatocytes, metabolism was observed that was not accompanied with embryotoxic effects. Embryo culture in human PKU sera, either or not supplemented with 5 % (v/v) rat serum, was not detrimental to development. Rather, embryo's tended to thrive better on PKU sera versus control sera. Analysis of human PKU sera revaled lower glucose levels and increased levels of PHE and PKU-related metabolites. The results suggest that the embryotoxicity of PKU-related phenylketones may contribute to teratogenicity of maternal PKU in man. However, in view of the relatively high concentrations necessary for embryotoxicity to occur in vitro, other factors yet unknown may play a significant role. Alternatively, the absence of embryotoxicity of human PKU sera in culture may be interpreted to suggest that the rat postimplantation embryo culture technique may not contain the developmental <b>en</b> <b>points</b> that are most vulnerable in maternal PKU. ...|$|E
