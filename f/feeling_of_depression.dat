40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{associations}} of both positive and problematic aspects of social support with depression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In a hierarchical multiple regression analysis we found that stressors such as functional limitations and pain are strongly related to depression. Positive and problematic support each explain an additional {{significant portion of the}} variance in depression. More positive support is associated with fewer <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and more problematic support is associated with more <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> An interaction effect between positive and problematic social support indicates that the negative aspects of problematic support may be partly diminished by positive support (buffering effect).

40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} the World Health Survey, {{conducted}} in Brazil in 2003, indicate a high frequency of self-perceived problems related to state of animus. The main objective {{of the present study}} is to investigate the hypothesis that material deprivation and job insecurity are important determinants of self-reported mental problems, such as <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and anxiety. Analysis of factors associated with self-perceived problems related to state of animus was performed with multivariate logistic regression models. Among females, key factors associated with <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and anxiety were level of education and unemployment after controlling for age, presence of long duration disease or disability and of body injury limiting everyday activities. Among males, <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> were most strongly associated with unemployment, followed by poverty (as measured by a household asset indicator), with being married (or cohabiting) showed a protector effect. With regard to severe <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> anxiety, only unemployment contributed significantly. These findings highlight the influence of social and economic contexts, beyond strictly individual characteristics, on the health of Brazilians...|$|R

6000|$|Sunrise is a gladsome event {{almost at}} all times; we say [...] "almost," [...] {{because there are}} times when sunrise is not {{particularly}} gladsome. In the arctic regions of Norway, for instance, we have seen it rise only twenty minutes after it set, and the rising and setting were so much mingled, that no very strong feelings of any kind were awakened. Moreover, we were somewhat depressed at the time, in consequence of having failed to reach those latitudes where the sun does not set at all for several weeks in summer, but shines night and day. To the sick, sunrise brings little comfort; too often it is watched for with weariness, and beheld, at last, with a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> at the thought that another day of pain has begun. But to the healthy, and especially to the young, sunrise is undoubtedly, on most occasions, a gladsome event.|$|E

There was not one from the colonel down to the youngest drummer-boy but felt that he had been deprived of the chance of taking part in a stirring campaign, and that he was going into a sort of exile. The baggage had been sent on the previous day, and the regiment on arriving at the harbor was speedily transferred in large lighters to the two transports.|$|E
40|$|Background: Relationships among <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> smoking behavior, and {{educational}} level during pregnancy have been documented. <b>Feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> {{may contribute to}} persistent smoking during pregnancy. No longitudinal studies assessing <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in women with different antepartum and postpartum smoking patterns are available. Objectives: The aim was to determine relationships between depressive symptoms, sociodemographic characteristics, and smoking pattern during and after pregnancy. Methods: An observational, prospective, noninterventional study was conducted. Data were collected during two stages of pregnancy (T 0 : 6 weeks) in 523 Flemish women. <b>Feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> (measured using the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]), smoking behavior, and sociodemographic variables were analyzed using a general linear mixed model implemented in SAS Proc MIXED. Results: Smokers and initial smokers reported significantly more depressive symptoms at all time points compared with recent ex-smokers, nonsmokers, and initial nonsmokers (p <;. 001). The three-way interaction among time point, smoking pattern, {{and educational}} level was significant (p =. 02). Evolution of mean BDI over time differed by educational level. Among participants with a secondary school certificate or less, differences were observed between smokers and nonsmokers, recent ex-smokers and initial nonsmokers, and nonsmokers and initial nonsmokers. Among participants with a college or university degree, no differences were observed. Discussion: A wide variety of smoking patterns were observed during pregnancy and early postpartum. Smoking patterns were associated with depression and showed complex interactions with educational level. Assessment and intervention for both smoking and depression are needed throughout the perinatal period to support the health of mothers, their infants, and families...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{relationship}} between various collegiate experiences including substance use, religiosity, campus climate, academic life, social life, self-concept, satisfaction with college, and perceived <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> among Asian American college students compared to other racial groups. Employing Astin’s (1993) I-E-O model, the study utilized the 2008 Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) the Freshman Survey (TFS) and the follow up College Senior Survey (CSS) in 2012 with the final sample of 10, 710 students including 951 Asian American students. Descriptive analysis, cross-tabulations, blocked hierarchical multiple regression analysis, the equality of the unstandardized beta coefficients from the regression analyses, and a one-way ANOVA were conducted for the data analysis. 			 			 		Asian American students who are female, from low SES backgrounds, academically less achieved, frequent substance users, less religiously involved, and less satisfied with overall college experiences showed higher levels <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> depressed. For the rate <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> depressed across racial groups, Asian American college students showed the highest rate <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> depressed while White students reported the lowest rate <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> depressed. For Asian American college students, feeling depressed in high school, hours spent per week on studying and homework, and self-confidence in intellectual ability were the most significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> while drinking beer, drinking liquor, spirituality, failing to complete homework on time, hours spent per week on socializing, self rated self-confidence in social ability, and satisfaction with overall college experiences were significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> Asian American college students spent the longest hours on studying and homework, reported the highest GPA, but showed the lowest self-confidence on intellectual ability. For all four racial groups, feeling depressed in high school and self-confidence in intellectual ability were significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in common. Implications for practice and directions for future research emphasize the need for better understanding the unique cultural background and impact of academic life associated with <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> among Asian American college students and developing customized psycho-educational and outreach programs to meet unique needs for psychological well-being for each racial group on campus...|$|R
60|$|The first {{impressions}} {{of such a}} place as ALBARO, the suburb of Genoa, where I am now, as my American friends would say, 'located,' can hardly fail, I should imagine, to be mournful and disappointing. It requires a little time and use to overcome the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> consequent, at first, on so much ruin and neglect. Novelty, pleasant to most people, is particularly delightful, I think, to me. I am not easily dispirited when I have the means of pursuing my own fancies and occupations; and I believe I have some natural aptitude for accommodating myself to circumstances. But, as yet, I stroll about here, in all the holes and corners of the neighbourhood, in a perpetual state of forlorn surprise; and returning to my villa: the Villa Bagnerello (it sounds romantic, but Signor Bagnerello is a butcher hard by): have sufficient occupation in pondering over my new experiences, and comparing them, very much to my own amusement, with my expectations, until I wander out again.|$|E
60|$|That day the captives {{were far}} more restless {{than they had been}} since they were taken prisoners. At first there had been a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> too great to admit even of {{conversation}} with each other. The defeat of their fleet, the danger that threatened Venice, and the prospect of imprisonment in the gloomy dungeons of Genoa, combined to depress them {{on the first day of}} their imprisonment. On the second, their success in getting out the bolts had cheered them, and they had something to look forward to and talk about; but still, few of them thought that there was any real prospect of their obtaining their freedom. Now, however, that success seemed to lie ready to hand; now that they could, that very evening, remove the sacks, effect a junction with their crew, arm themselves with the weapons lying in sight, and rush up and overpower the Genoese; it seemed hard to remain longer in confinement. Several of them urged Francis to make the attempt that night, but he refused.|$|E
60|$|The old, half-ruined {{house in}} the midst of the dusky desolation began to assume in the {{moonlight}} a singularly weird and ghost-like appearance. Near me on one side was an irregular row of poplar-trees, and the long, dark lines cast from them by the moon fell across a wide, open space where the rank-growing thorn-apples predominated. In the spaces between the broad bands made by the poplar-tree shadows, the foliage appeared of a dim, hoary blue, starred over with the white blossoms of this night-flowering weed. About these flowers several big, grey moths were hovering, suddenly appearing out of the black shadows and when looked for, noiselessly vanishing again in their mysterious ghost-like manner. Not a sound disturbed the silence except the faint, melancholy trill of one small night-singing cicada from somewhere near--a faint, aerial voice that seemed to be wandering lost in infinite space, rising and floating away in its loneliness, while earth listened, hushed into preternatural stillness. Presently a large owl came noiselessly flying by, and, perching on the topmost boughs of a neighbouring tree, began hooting a succession of monotonous notes, sounding like the baying of a bloodhound at a vast distance. Another owl by and by responded from some far-off quarter, and the dreary duet was kept up for half an hour. Whenever one bird ceased his solemn boo-boo-boo-boo-boo, I found myself with stilled breath straining my sense to catch the answering notes, fearing to stir lest I should lose them. A phosphorescent gleam swept by close to my face, making me start at its sudden appearance, then passed away, trailing a line of faint light over the dusky weeds. The passing firefly served to remind me that I was not smoking, and the thought then occurred to me that a cigar might possibly have the effect of relieving me from the strange, indefinable <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> that had come over me. I put my hand into my pocket and drew out a cigar, and bit the end off; but when about to strike a vesta on my matchbox, I shuddered and dropped my hand.|$|E

60|$|There is {{something}} mournful in the breaking up of an agreeable party, and few are the roofs {{in which one}} has sojourned, which are quitted without some <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> The sudden cessation of all those sources of excitement which pervade a gay and well arranged mansion in the country, unstrings the nervous system. For a week or so, we have done nothing which was not agreeable, and heard nothing which was not pleasant. Our self-love has been respected; {{there has been a}} total cessation of petty cares; all the enjoyment of an establisnment without any of its solicitude. We have beheld civilization only in its favoured aspect, and tasted only the sunny side of the fruit. Sometimes there are associations with our visit of a still sweeter and softer character, but on these we need not dwell: glances that cannot be forgotten, and tones that linger in the ear; sentiment that subdues the soul, and flirtation that agitates the fancy. No matter, whatever may be the cause, one too often drives away from a country-house, rather hipped. The specific would be immediately to drive to another, and it is a favourite remedy. But sometimes it is not in our power; sometimes for instance we must return to our household gods {{in the shape of a}} nursery; and though this was not the form assumed by the penates of Lord Marney, his presence, the presence of an individual so important and so indefatigable, was still required. His Lordship had passed his time at Mowbray to his satisfaction. He had had his own way in everything. His selfishness had not received a single shock. He had lain down the law and it had not been questioned. He had dogmatised and impugned, and his assertions had passed current, and his doctrines been accepted as orthodox. Lord Mowbray suited him; he liked the consideration of so great a personage. Lord Marney also really liked pomp; a curious table and a luxurious life; but he liked them under any roof rather than his own. Not that he was what is commonly called a Screw; that is to say he was not a mere screw; but he was acute and malicious; saw everybody's worth and position at a glance; could not bear to expend his choice wines and costly viands on hangers-on and toad-eaters, though at the same time no man encouraged and required hangers-on and toad-eaters more. Lord Marney had all the petty social vices, and none of those petty social weaknesses which soften their harshness or their hideousness. To receive a prince of the blood or a great peer he would spare nothing. Had he to fulfil any of the public duties of his station, his performance would baffle criticism. But he enjoyed making the Vicar of Marney or Captain Grouse drink some claret that was on the wane, or praise a bottle of Burgundy that he knew was pricked.|$|E
