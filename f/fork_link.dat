5000|$|At the 1939 Ulster GP, {{the last}} GP before the War, the two bikes {{led from the}} start against Nortons and a {{supercharged}} four-cylinder Gilera, but halfway round {{the first of the}} 14 mi laps, already timed at 135 mi/h km/h on one section, A R (Bob) Foster retired with plug trouble. Rusk completed the first lap at a record breaking average of 100.03 mi/h km/h and a lead of 34 seconds. On the third lap a <b>fork</b> <b>link</b> broke forcing retirement. [...] It is believed that this was caused by mistaken fitment of a 7R <b>fork</b> <b>link</b> instead of the stronger V4 part during servicing.|$|E
50|$|Prototypes were raced in late 1949 and {{the last}} model was {{produced}} in 1952. The small numbers produced mean that {{there was plenty of}} variation of the specification. Earlier models were finished with chrome on the fuel tank and lower <b>fork</b> <b>link</b> but towards the end of production in 1952 this was replaced by grey paint. As well as the Burman BAR gearbox, Vincent also experimented with AJS 7R gearboxes but used Albion gearboxes for most of the machines produced.|$|E
50|$|A leading <b>link</b> <b>fork</b> suspends {{the wheel}} on a link (or links) with a pivot point aft {{of the wheel}} axle. Russian Ural {{motorcycles}} still use leading <b>link</b> <b>forks</b> on sidecar equipped motorcycles, and aftermarket leading <b>link</b> <b>forks</b> are often installed today on motorcycles when they are outfitted with sidecars. They are also very popular with trikes, improving the handling while steering or braking. The most common example of a leading <b>link</b> <b>fork</b> is that found on the Honda Super Cub.|$|R
50|$|The AJS Silver Streak was a British {{motorcycle}} {{launched in}} 1938 and {{described in the}} sales brochure as the 'aristocrats of the motor-cycle world'. Produced {{with a choice of}} 250 cc, 350 cc and 500 cc engines, the Silver Streaks were super sport machines with a special polished finish and hand tuned engines. As many parts as possible were specially chrome plated, including the mudguards, headlamp, <b>fork</b> <b>links,</b> front and rear chain cases, oil and petrol tanks and even the tool-box.|$|R

50|$|In 1943, the XA's leading <b>link</b> <b>fork</b> was {{replaced}} with Harley-Davidson's first telescopic fork.|$|R
50|$|Experimental/Enhanced Links (ELinks) is a <b>fork</b> of <b>Links</b> led by Petr Baudis. It {{is based}} on Links 0.9. It has a more open {{development}} and incorporates patches from other Links versions (such as additional extension scripting in Lua) and from Internet users.|$|R

50|$|There were {{no further}} changes until 1959, when all models were fitted with Armstrong leading <b>link</b> <b>forks,</b> and the Villiers 2T twin was dropped.|$|R
60|$|Opposite Chiricahua, {{where the}} road <b>forked,</b> <b>Link</b> Stevens headed the car {{straight}} south and gradually increased speed. Madeline faced another endless gray incline. It was the San Bernardino Valley. The singing of the car, the stinging of the wind warned her to draw the hood securely down over her face again, {{and then it was}} as if she was riding at night. The car lurched ahead, settled into that driving speed which wedged Madeline back as in a vise. Again the moments went by fleet as the miles. Seemingly, there was an acceleration of the car till it reached a certain swiftness--a period of time in which it held that pace, and then a diminishing of all motion and sound which contributed to Madeline's acute sensation. Uncovering her face, she saw Link was passing another village. Could it be Bernardino? She asked Link--repeated the question.|$|R
50|$|The {{front fork}} {{utilized}} a leading <b>link</b> <b>fork,</b> suspended by two leaf spring assemblies. The brakes were considerably enlarged and improved from those furnished {{on the production}} motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|Loading of the DnaB helicase {{is the key}} step in {{replication}} initiation. As a replicative helicase, DnaB migrates {{along the}} single-stranded DNA in the 5'â†’3' direction, unwinding the DNA as it travels. The DnaB helicases loaded onto the two DNA strands thus travel in opposite directions, creating two potential replication forks. All other proteins at the replication <b>fork</b> are <b>linked</b> directly or indirectly to DnaB.|$|R
50|$|The MAC Scrambler {{was also}} the {{beginning}} of the VanTech Leading <b>Link</b> <b>Fork.</b> In addition to giving 6+ inches of travel, the fork was approximately four pounds lighter than any telescopic fork then available.|$|R
5000|$|The {{confluence}} of the Middle and North Forks marks {{the start of the}} Stanislaus River proper. It flows southwest through a canyon to the 12500 acre New Melones Lake reservoir in the Sierra Nevada foothills, and forming the boundary of Calaveras County (west) and Tuolumne County (east). At the reservoir, it is joined by the smaller South Fork, which descends for 42 mi from the Sierra Nevada to the east. Much of State Route 108 (the Sonora Pass Highway) runs parallel to the South Fork, as well as {{the upper part of the}} Middle <b>Fork,</b> <b>linking</b> a number of small communities in the upper Stanislaus basin. [...] At the lower end of New Melones Lake is the 625 ft tall New Melones Dam, the sixth tallest dam in the U.S., completed in 1979 for flood control, irrigation, hydropower generation and fisheries management. Below New Melones, the river flows through the smaller Tulloch Reservoir before reaching Goodwin Dam, the oldest dam on the river (completed 1913) where large volumes of water are diverted for irrigation.|$|R
5000|$|A {{trailing}} <b>link</b> <b>fork</b> suspends {{the wheel}} on a link (or links) with a pivot point {{forward of the}} wheel axle. Most famously used by Indian it was also used by BMW for its early bikes.|$|R
50|$|The 1928 DeLuxe engine {{had higher}} compression, and hardened, {{polished}} steel valve guides. The front end {{was changed to}} leading <b>link</b> <b>forks</b> and a front brake was added. The wheels were also changed to drop center rims (may have happened mid year).|$|R
50|$|In 1956, Mustang {{discontinued}} the slow-selling DeliverCycle {{and introduced}} a new Colt as a budget model. This second Colt model was a stripped-down version of the Pony, with an undamped leading <b>link</b> <b>fork,</b> a centrifugal clutch, and no transmission. The Colt was discontinued in 1958.|$|R
50|$|The Lynx browser remains {{popular for}} Unix shell users and with vision {{impaired}} users {{due to its}} entirely text-based nature. There are also several text-mode browsers with advanced features, such as w3m, Links (which can operate both in text and graphical mode), and the <b>Links</b> <b>forks</b> such as ELinks.|$|R
2500|$|Indian {{introduced}} the 221cc single cylinder two-stroke Model K [...] "Featherweight" [...] in 1916. The Model K had an open cradle frame {{with the engine}} as a stressed member and a pivoting front fork {{that had been used}} earlier on single-cylinder motorcycles but had mostly been replaced on other Indian motorcycles by a leaf-sprung trailing <b>link</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|R
50|$|Harris, with others, {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} Reynolds tube leading <b>link</b> <b>forks</b> for sidecar racing, a design still used to this day. Reynolds also manufactured the framework for the new BMW engine that was used in one of the Harris combinations, a design also taken up for the works BMW of World Sidecar Champion Max Deubel.|$|R
50|$|The {{springer}} fork is {{an early}} type of leading <b>link</b> <b>fork.</b> A springer fork {{does not have the}} suspension built into the fork tubes, but instead has it mounted externally, where it may be integrated into the triple tree. This style of fork may be found on antique motorcycles or choppers, and is available today on Harley-Davidson's Softail Springer.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] engine {{producing}} [...] {{became available}} in May 1954. The front suspension was later {{changed from a}} telescopic fork to an Earles-type leading <b>link</b> <b>fork</b> with a single suspension unit on {{left side of the}} fork. Later Bella scooters also had 12 V electricals powered by two 6 V batteries. Electric starters also became available on the Bella.|$|R

50|$|Edoardo Bianchi was an Italian motorcycling pioneer {{who began}} by {{building}} bicycles in 1885. He built a motorised bicycle in 1897, {{and a car}} in 1900. In 1903 he fitted engines in the centre of strengthened bicycle frames, and by 1905 also fitted Truffault leading <b>link</b> <b>forks.</b> In 1910 Bianchi built a 498 cc single that was very successful and established the Bianchi motorcycle name.|$|R
50|$|The first Austel 1000 MK1 {{prototype}} {{was built}} in 1981 for Chris's own use and this was closely by the MK2 which was built for local businessman John Kemp. These bikes had 1000cc Mini engines with foot operated automatic gear boxes (including reverse), side mounted radiators, chain drive, Yamaha alloy wheels, Austel leading <b>link</b> <b>forks</b> and were named Lotec due to the simplicity of design.|$|R
25|$|In {{motorcycles}} with {{telescopic fork}} tubes, fork offset {{can be implemented}} by either an offset in the triple tree, adding a triple tree rake (usually measured in degrees from 0) to the fork tubes as they mount into the triple tree, {{or a combination of}} the two. Other, less-common motorcycle forks, such as trailing link or leading <b>link</b> <b>forks,</b> can implement offset by the length of link arms.|$|R
50|$|The moped chassis is {{constructed}} from two pressed-steel halves welded together down the centre-line, with pressed steel leading <b>link</b> <b>fork</b> front, and swingarm rear suspension with telescopic dampers. The under seat 3 litre petrol tank is single sided {{on the left}} of the machine. A plastic toolbox takes the position of a dummy fuel tank on the right hand side. Behind the single seat is a useful pressed steel carrier rack.|$|R
50|$|The C75 was the 305cc {{version of}} the C70. It had a square head-light and shock absorbers, leading <b>link</b> <b>forks,</b> pressed-steel {{handlebars}} and were somewhat unusual in appearance. The engine was dry sumped, and had six-volt electrics. The design of both the frame and engine was heavily influenced by bikes built by NSU Motorenwerke AG, which Soichiro Honda had seen on his visit to Europe in 1955, including the Isle of Man TT races.|$|R
50|$|The Harley-Davidson Model W, {{also known}} as the Sport Twin, is a {{motorcycle}} made by Harley-Davidson from 1919 to 1923. Unusually for a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, the Model W had a flat-twin engine and a trailing <b>link</b> <b>fork.</b> The Model W set speed records on runs from New York City to Chicago and from the Canada-United States border to the Mexico-United States border. Slow home market sales led to the end of production after four years.|$|R
50|$|The Model O had {{a cradle}} frame {{supporting}} the engine {{at the bottom}} of the crankcase, while the gearbox was mounted under the frame, below the rear cylinder. The rear wheel was rigidly mounted to a subframe bolted to the frame. The front suspension was initially a pivoting fork used on the Indian Single from 1906 to 1910 and on the Model K Featherweight. This was replaced during 1917 by a leaf-sprung trailing <b>link</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Prince was {{designed}} by Charles B. Franklin and began production in 1925. It was a single-cylinder motorcycle for beginners and for export. The 1925 Prince had its gearbox attached to the engine and had a wedge-shaped fuel tank. The Prince was redesigned for 1926 with a separate gearbox and a fuel tank similar in shape {{to that of the}} contemporary Scout. Both versions used coil-sprung girder forks instead of the leaf-sprung trailing <b>link</b> <b>forks</b> used on the contemporary Chief and Scout. A front brake was added in 1928, the last year of production.|$|R
5000|$|The Softail model {{line has}} {{included}} {{a number of}} choices in front fork configurations. Historically, they have also offered the Springer leading <b>link</b> <b>forks</b> that are reminiscent of the sprung front-ends that were used prior {{to the introduction of}} the Hydra-Glide in 1949. The FXST designation is used for 21" [...] Front Wheel Bikes or when the Springer fork is used with a 21 inch wheel, while the FLST designation is used for 16" [...] Front Wheel Bikes or when the Springer fork is used with a 16 inch wheel.|$|R
5|$|Colorado held several {{meetings}} to convince reluctant Utah officials they {{would benefit from}} a freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City. Utah officials expressed concerns that, given the terrain between these cities, this link {{would be difficult to}} build. They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a higher priority. Colorado officials persisted, presenting three alternatives to route I-70 west of Denver, using the corridors of US40, US6 and a route starting at Pueblo, proceeding west along US50/US285/US24. In March 1955, Colorado officials succeeded in convincing Utah officials with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver. The two states jointly issued a proposal to the U.S. Congress that would extend the plans for I-70 along the US6 corridor. Under this proposal the freeway would terminate at I-15 near Spanish <b>Fork,</b> Utah, <b>linking</b> the Front Range and Wasatch Front metropolitan areas.|$|R

40|$|Proper DNA {{replication}} and well-timed {{cell cycle}} progression {{are vital to}} the normal functioning of a cell. Precise coordination between these mechanisms' constituent proteins ensures their processivity while safeguarding against DNA damage. The Ctf 4 protein is a central member of the replication <b>fork</b> and <b>links</b> the replicative MCM helicase and polymerase [alpha]-primase. In addition, it has been implicated {{as a member of}} a complex that promotes replication fork stability, the Fork Protection Complex (FPC). Â Â This investigation represents the first phenotypic analysis of the function of the Ctf 4 protein within a multicellular organism model. We show that Ctf 4 interacts with Polymerase [alpha], MCM 2, Psf 1, and Psf 2. We also demonstrate that knockdown of this central replication fork component via a GAL 4 -UAS RNAi system results in a lower frequency of mitosis due to an S-phase delay, endoreplication defects, as well as mitotic bridging in early embryonic development.

50|$|By 1962 {{there were}} eleven {{models in the}} Greeves range. The offroad {{motorcycles}} were also developed through an association with Queen's University Belfast producing the later Greeves QUB model. The last of the Challenger models was produced in 1968, replaced by the 250 and 380 cc Griffon motocrossers in 1969. The original leading <b>link</b> <b>fork</b> was no longer fitted, having been replaced by standard telescopic forks as the leading link design could not match the travel of forks. Also abandoned was the original cast alloy front down beam, replaced with a new frame of Reynolds 531 chrome molybdenum with a conventional down tube.|$|R
