5000|$|For {{practical}} applications, {{the efficiency}} of the <b>infrared</b> <b>heater</b> depends on matching the emitted wavelength and the absorption spectrum of the material to be heated. For example, the absorption spectrum for water has its peak at around [...] This means that emission from medium-wave or carbon infrared heaters is much better absorbed by water and water-based coatings than NIR or short-wave infrared radiation. The same is true for many plastics like PVC or polyethylene. Their peak absorption is around [...] On the other hand, some metals absorb only in the short-wave range and show a strong reflectivity in the medium and far infrared. This makes a careful selection of the right <b>infrared</b> <b>heater</b> type important for energy efficiency in the heating process.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>infrared</b> <b>heater</b> or {{heat lamp}} {{is a body}} with a higher {{temperature}} which transfers energy to a body with a lower temperature through electromagnetic radiation.

No contact or medium between the two bodies is needed for the energy transfer. Infrared heaters can be operated in vacuum or atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of an <b>infrared</b> <b>heater</b> is {{a rating of}} the total energy consumed by the heater compared {{to the amount of}} infrared energy generated. While there will always be some amount of convective heat generated through the process, any introduction of air motion across the heater will reduce its infrared conversion efficiency.

Surface tension causes the molten solder to hold the package in alignment with the circuit board, at the correct separation distance, while the solder cools and solidifies, forming soldered connections between the device and the PCB.|$|E

The study includes the theoretical overview which concentrated on the mathematical modelling of the far <b>infrared</b> ceramic <b>heater,</b> as well as mathematical modelling of infrared gasifier. Secondly, the study presents {{an overview of the}} manufacturing process of the ceramic <b>infrared</b> <b>heaters.</b> Testing of the manufactured heaters has been performed to validate the efficacy of the heaters. The model includes non-grey radiative heat transfer between the different parts of the heaters, conduction in ceramic material, convective cooling of the surface, surface balances, and blackbody radiation theories. Using infrared module voltage as input, model predictions of temperature and wavelengths using Fourier equations were found to agree well with experimental data. The ceramic <b>infrared</b> <b>heaters</b> developed in this research are fully functional and all intended test results were obtained. The spectral analyses of different plastics (Polyethylene terephthalate, Polypropylene, Low-density polyethylene and High-density polyethylene) have been performed. ‘Heat rate’ and ‘cool rate’ of the <b>infrared</b> ceramic <b>heaters</b> have also been characterised. Gasification of plastic waste as carbonaceous material, basic reactions during gasification of plastics, and gasification products have also been discussed, including gasifier properties. The results obtained from the experiments show that using <b>infrared</b> <b>heaters</b> in gasification is practically sound because of the ability of infrared radiation to gasify waste plastics and production of syngas. This project recommended the infrared radiation because of its high efficiency in gasification of waste plastic and the production of syngas.

The paper mainly identified the short-term influences of experimental warming, nitrogen fertilization, and their combination on growth and physiological performances of Picea asperata seedlings. These seedlings were subjected to two levels of temperature (ambient; <b>infrared</b> <b>heater</b> warming) and two nitrogen levels (0; 25 g m(- 2) a(- 1) N) for 6 months. We used a free air temperature increase of overhead <b>infrared</b> <b>heater</b> to raise both air and soil temperature by 2. 1 and 2. 6 A degrees C, respectively. The temperature increment induced an obvious enhancement in biomass accumulation and the maximum net photosynthetic rate, and decreased AOS and MDA level under ambient nitrogen conditions. Whereas, negative effects of experimental warming on growth and physiology was observed under nitrogen fertilization condition. On the other hand, nitrogen fertilization significantly improved plant growth in unwarmed plots, by stimulating total biomass, maximum net photosynthetic rate (A (max)), antioxidant compounds, as well as reducing the content of AOS and MDA. However, in warmed plots, nitrogen addition clearly decreased A (max), antioxidant compounds, and induced higher accumulation of AOS and MDA. Obviously, the beneficial effects of sole nitrogen on growth and physiology of Picea asperata seedlings could not be magnified by artificial warming.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} global climatic change on belowground {{ecological}} processes of terrestrial ecosystems {{are still not}} clear. We therefore conducted an experiment in the subalpine coniferous forest ecosystem of the eastern edges of the Tibetan Plateau to study roots of Picea asperata seedlings and rhizosphere soil responses to soil warming and nitrogen availability from April 2007 to December 2008. The seedlings were subjected to two levels of temperature (ambient; <b>infrared</b> <b>heater</b> warming) and two nitrogen levels (0 or 25 g m(- 2) year(- 1) N). We used a free air temperature increase from an overhead <b>infrared</b> <b>heater</b> to raise both air and soil temperature by 2. 1 and 2. 6 A degrees C, respectively. The results showed that warming alone significantly increased total biomass, coarse root biomass and fine root biomass of P. asperata seedlings. Both total biomass and fine root biomass were increased, but coarse root biomass was significantly decreased by nitrogen fertilization and warming combined with nitrogen fertilization. Warming induced a prominent increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) and NO(3) (-) -N of rhizosphere soil, while nitrogen fertilization significantly decreased SOC and NH(4) (+) -N of rhizosphere soil. The warming, fertilization and warming x N fertilization interaction decreased soil microbial C significantly, but substantially increased soil microbial N. These results suggest that nitrogen deposition combined with warmer temperatures under future climatic change possibly will {{have no effect on}} fine root production of P. asperata seedlings, but could enhance the nitrification process of their rhizosphere soils in subalpine coniferous forests.
