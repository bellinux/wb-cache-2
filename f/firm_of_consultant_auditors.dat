40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 185 {{companies}} in 2007, this paper investigates whether the mapping of earnings quality into intrinsic value for Malaysian companies differs {{as a function of}} ownership concentration type. It is hypothesized that compared with widely-held companies, the positive relation between earnings quality and intrinsic value is stronger (weaker) for companies dominated by the family of the Chief Executive Officer (Government-dominated companies). Intrinsic value was calculated from stock ratings produced by a <b>firm</b> <b>of</b> Malaysian investment <b>consultants.</b> Three measures <b>of</b> earnings quality are used: two approaches from the journal literature and sub-ratings for earnings and dividend stability produced by the <b>firm</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultants.</b> The results support the second hypothesis (Government-related investors) but not the first hypothesis (family-dominated companies). There is reasonable support for the theoretical predictions about the two earnings quality metrics from the journal literature. However, the consultant’s sub-ratings appear to provide a more accurate measure of earnings quality of Malaysian companies.

40|$|Background: The Activity-Based Costing {{model has}} its {{origin in the}} Manufacturing Industry and has since its origin become more usual. The ABC-method is {{beginning}} to break through in several others businesses than just the Manufacturing Industry, but there are insufficient information about how the ABC-model can be developed in Trading Company for instance. These companies often use simple and stereotyped calculations in their organizations and assume the cost price by calculating, which give rise to an inappropriate allocation of the costs. ABC could therefore be a solution to these problems and therefore would it be interesting to investigate how this model can be designed in a trading company. Purpose: The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the design and usage of the Activity-Based Costing in a Trading Company. Method: The paper has a sign of a case study. A more deep study has also been made at Materialservice in Nässjö, while the study at ICA, Hall. miba and Svenskt Papper has been of a more supplementary nature. We have also made interviews with two <b>firms</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultants,</b> Prodacapo and SAM in purpose to make our study/investigation more general. Result: We have found that the result the customer has a more important role in the Trading Company than the Manufacturing Industry and that the Trading Company use more activities and cost drivers in their ABC-model. The result also shows that the main area of use of ABC in the trading company is to guide the behaviours of the company and the customers...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{the way in which}} 'places' are consumed. It is also about the way in which places are 'produced' in order to be consumed, by tourists, with the aim of accruing {{economic}} benefits. The particular place which features in this paper is the City of York. This is a city whose historic built environment has largely escaped the effects of industrial development and war. For this reason it satisfies a salient characteristic of some of the newer forms of tourism which have proliferated in the last twenty years, which involve the visitation of unspoiled environments of both the built and natural kinds: representing, one might say, a postmodern yearning for a pre-modern past. The supply-side response to this demand has become known as the 'heritage industry' and involves the commodification of 'the past', in its natural, built and symbolic forms, in order to make such environments consumable. In 1994, the York City Council commissioned a report from a <b>firm</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultants</b> to advise on action needed to secure the city's future as a tourist destination. Their report recommended that a new major visitor attraction be created, referred to variously as an 'icon' and a 'must-see' attraction, in order to secure the future of the already-healthy tourist industry in the city (Touche Ross 1994). I had doubts as to whether this proposal would benefit York's tourism in the way intended. To explore these doubts, I embarked on an examination of the theoretical background behind the kind of advice offered by the consultants. I also looked at what social science could reveal about the nature of consumption of tourist sites. The findings were published in Leisure Studies (Voase 1999) ...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{consultants}} often accept work {{based on}} {{good relations with}} the clients without evaluating them. This may affect their performance on construction sites. Consultants need to understand quantitative methods to avoid client-generated risk. The aims of this study are to examine the dominant risk factors generated by the clients, to identify their influential level on consultants, and to examine the actions of management level to handle the risks. The instrument was adopted from Kometa, et al (1995). Ninety-one respondents working in several <b>firms</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultants</b> in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta were sampled. Relative Important Index calculated from the sub-factors and Relative Important Index from the group were adopted to analyze the importance of the factors. The overall risk exposure index was adopted to examine the actions of management level to handle the risks. The concerned factors were client's project feasibility, client's duties, client's financial feasibility, clients past performance, client's project characteristics, client's organizational quality, clients past experience, quality of management clients and client characteristics. The results of this research indicate the opinion <b>of</b> <b>consultant</b> from the classification of A-level that client's organizational quality was the most influential risk factor. This factor is influenced by client's coordination of project interphase. The management of action suggested no danger be anticipated in the near future from this client, client quite satisfactory and monitor client slighty. The consultant from the classification of B-level perceived that client's project characteristics was the most influential risk to consultant's performance. Characteristic project client was influenced by project's complexity. The management of action suggested no danger be anticipated in the near future from this client, client quite satisfactory and monitor client slighty. The consultant from the classification of C-level perceived that client's project characteristics was the most influential risk to consultant's performance. Client's roject characteristics were influenced by the cost of project. The management of action suggested no danger be anticipated in the near future from this client, client quite satisfactory and monitor client slighty. Based on the results of this analysis, it could then be conclude that the number is in the range of 60...|$|R
