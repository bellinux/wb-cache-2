500|$|Matheos {{originally}} intended the first OSI album as a [...] "project" [...] which would never produce a second album. For Free, Matheos and Moore {{wanted to use}} a different musician lineup to focus OSI on primarily being Matheos and Moore. They {{did not want to}} give the impression that the guests on the first album were part of the band. Matheos stated that the music on Free was [...] "focused less on the progressive elements or the metal elements that were on the first record. We thought we could do something <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> groove oriented." [...] Matheos and Moore had both worked with bassist Joey Vera in the past and considered him [...] "perfect" [...] for the album. Moore was pleased with Vera's bass parts: Vera sent them to Moore in a state such that they required very little editing or enhancement for the final mix of the album.|$|E

Writing for Mania.com, critic Stephen Lackey thought Anna Torv's {{performance}} [...] "felt forced", but heaped praise on John Noble. Lackey believes Torv and Joshua Jackson have good chemistry, and consequently partly disliked the episode {{because they had}} few scenes together. He also thought {{the case of the}} week was [...] "fairly entertaining," [...] but the storyline was [...] "just...passable", as he wanted the show [...] "to be done with all of the introductions and get more into the mystery of the pattern". He concluded his review, [...] "Hopefully, next week the story will be <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> concise, Olivia and Peter back working together and maybe at some point Astrid will actually have something important to do". The Los Angeles Times thought the episode was [...] "solid if unexceptional", as he liked Walter but disliked the [...] "vacuum of personality" [...] that is Astrid.|$|E

VideoGamer.com reviewer Jamin Smith said, [...] "With HeartGold and SoulSilver the Pokémon series has reached a point where it can't get any better." [...] Eurogamer's Keza MacDonald gave the games a 9/10, stating [...] "They combine everything that was best about the older Pokémon games", citing the Pokémon designs and improved graphics and battle system. GamePros McKinley Noble stated that [...] "it's clear that this is a perfect experience for both old-school trainers and the newest generation of Pokémon fans." [...] GameZone's Cliff Bakehorn III said, [...] "There is not a doubt in my mind: Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are the pinnacle of the entire series." [...] Nathan Meunier of GameSpot gave the games one of the lower scores, criticizing them for a lack of innovation. GamesRadar attributed the game's success to being a remake of classic games.|$|E
500|$|The Honda Juno {{had been}} the first scooter to use {{polyester}} resin, or fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP), bodywork, and even though production of the Juno had stopped in 1954 as a result of Honda Motor's financial and labor problems at the time, Fujisawa continued to encourage research in polyester resin casting techniques, and these efforts bore fruit for the Super Cub. The new motorcycle's fairing would be polyethylene, the most widely used plastic, which reduced weight over FRP, but Honda's supplier had never made such a large die cast before, so the die had to be provided by Honda. The Super Cub was the first motorcycle ever to use a plastic fairing. Motorcycling historian Clement Salvadori wrote that the plastic front fender and leg shields were, [...] "perhaps the Cub's greatest contribution; plastic did the job just as well as metal at considerably lower cost." [...] The technology developed in the Isle of Man TT racing program was equally vital to the new lightweight motorcycle, making possible [...] from a 50cc four-stroke Honda engine, where the first engine the company built a decade earlier, a [...] "fairly exact copy" [...] of the 50cc two stroke war-surplus Tohatsu engine Honda had been selling as motorized bicycle auxiliary engine, had only a [...] output.

In support of the album, she embarked on the Let's Get to It Tour in October. She later expressed her opinion that she was stifled by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, saying, [...] "I was very much a puppet in the beginning. I was blinkered by my record company. I was unable to look left or right." [...] Her first Greatest Hits album {{was released in}} August 1992. It reached number one in the United Kingdom and number three in Australia.

500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Doo Rags" [...] contemplates Nas' youth and society's {{cyclical}} nature. It features a contemporary piano loop and jazz tones. Richard Hazell from HipHopDX describes the song as [...] "a piano propelled painting {{of time and}} space as seen through the third eye of Nas, which can easily be envisioned by any New York City dweller." [...] On [...] "My Way", he meditates over his rise out of poverty to the [...] "life of a rich thug", recalls the death of his childhood friend Ill Will, and concedes that he [...] "still feels broke with millions in the bank." [...] On [...] "U Gotta Love It", Nas makes reference to the [...] "'86 crack blitz" [...] and discusses his own significance: [...] "This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment / Now back in the , certain cats they wanna kill me / They ice-grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me." [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever" [...] advises to appreciate life's small epiphanies and be optimistic about the future. On [...] "No Idea's Original", Nas notes the similarities of people in life and views other rappers as creatively derivative, while distinguishing himself from them: [...] "No idea's original, there's nothin new under the sun / It's never what you do, but how it's done / What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper / That means you inferior, not major." [...] He references the line [...] "there's nothing new under the sun" [...] from the Book of Ecclesiastes in the song's chorus. [...] "No Idea's Original" [...] samples Barry White's 1973 song [...] "I'm Gonna Love You <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>More</b> Baby", a frequently sampled recording in hip hop music.|$|E
