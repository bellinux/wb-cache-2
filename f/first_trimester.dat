5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who become pregnant, {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The <b>first</b> <b>trimester</b> normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E
5|$|The average net {{household}} income (after social, pension {{and health insurance}} contributions) in Paris was €36,085 for 2011.

5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the <b>first</b> <b>trimester.</b> Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare high hCG levels in the <b>first</b> and second <b>trimester</b> in {{predicting}} small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants. This is the first study that compares hCG levels of <b>first</b> and second <b>trimesters.</b> Methods. Patients with both <b>first</b> and second <b>trimester</b> Down syndrome screening tests were investigated retrospectively and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) values were recorded. Patients were divided into groups as SGA and non-SGA. High hCG values (≥ 2 MoM) were compared with low hCG values (< 2 MoM). Results. There was no significant difference in the hCG levels in women delivering SGA and non-SGA infants. Sensitivity and specificity of both tests were the same (9. 09 and 89. 95 respectively). Conclusions. Neither <b>first</b> nor second <b>trimester</b> hCG values were predictive in detection of SGA infant...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: In placentas from {{uncomplicated}} pregnancies, Hofbauer cells either disappear {{or become}} scanty after the fourth to fifth month of gestation. Immunohistochemistry though, reveals {{that a high}} percentage of stromal cells belong to Hofbauer cells. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the changes in morphology and density of Hofbauer cells in placentas from normal and pathological pregnancies. METHODS: Seventy placentas were examined: 16 specimens from normal term pregnancies, 10 from <b>first</b> <b>trimester's</b> miscarriages, 26 from cases diagnosed with chromosomal abnormality of the fetus, and placental tissue specimens complicated with intrauterine growth restriction (eight) or gestational diabetes mellitus (10). A histological study of hematoxylin-eosin (HE) sections was performed and immunohistochemical study was performed using the markers: CD 68, Lysozyme, A 1 Antichymotrypsine, CK- 7, vimentin, and Ki- 67. RESULTS: In normal term pregnancies, HE study revealed Hofbauer cells in 37. 5 % of cases while immunohistochemistry revealed in 87. 5 % of cases. In <b>first</b> <b>trimester's</b> miscarriages and in cases with prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal abnormalities, both basic and immunohistochemical study were positive for Hofbauer cells. In pregnancies complicated with intrauterine growth restriction or gestational diabetes mellitus, a positive immunoreaction was observed in 100 and 70 % of cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hofbauer cells are present in placental villi during pregnancy, but with progressively reducing density. The most specific marker for their detection seems to be A 1 Antichymotrypsine. It is remarkable that no mitotic activity of Hofbauer cells was noticed in our study, as the marker of cellular multiplication Ki- 67 was negative in all examined specimens...|$|R
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the <b>first</b> <b>trimester.</b> Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of disease}} {{can be reduced}} by {{preventing}} mosquito bites {{through the use of}} mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the <b>first</b> <b>trimester</b> of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no effective vaccine exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing. The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes an artemisinin. The second medication may be either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Quinine along with doxycycline may be used if an artemisinin is not available. It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance. Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant P.falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the plasma {{levels of the}} renal functional markers creatinine, urate, cystatin C, beta(2) -microglobulin and beta-trace protein in samples from the first, second, early third and late third trimesters of 398 healthy women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies. Material and methods. Plasma samples from 58 healthy non-pregnant women served as controls. The creatinine levels were significantly lower at all time-points in pregnancy, whereas the urate levels were lower during the <b>first</b> and second <b>trimesters</b> but increased in the late third trimester. The cystatin C, beta(2) -microglobulin and beta-trace protein levels displayed similar changes with increased levels in the third trimester but unaltered levels during the <b>first</b> and second <b>trimesters.</b> Results. The results indicate an increased filtration of low-molecular weight molecules during pregnancy, particularly during the <b>first</b> and second <b>trimesters,</b> whereas filtration of 10 - 30 kDa molecules is decreased in the third but unaltered in the <b>first</b> and second <b>trimesters.</b> The levels of albumin and alpha(2) -macroglobulin were measured in the same samples. Conclusions. The albumin levels decreased {{in the second and}} third trimesters, whereas the levels of alpha(2) -macroglobulin were unchanged, which is compatible with a virtually unaltered transfer of alpha(2) -macroglobulin between the intra-and extravascular space during pregnancy and a significantly increased extravascular fraction of albumin...|$|R
40|$|Several viral infections {{have been}} {{reported}} to result in more severe disease in pregnant than non-pregnant women, but the relative risks have not been well characterised. This has now been done for Lassa fever in a prospective study of 68 pregnant and 79 non-pregnant women who were admitted to hospital in Sierra Leone with confirmed Lassa fever. Lassa fever was the main cause of maternal mortality in the hospital, accounting for 25 % of maternal deaths. Twelve of 40 patients in the third trimester died, compared with two of 28 in the <b>first</b> two <b>trimesters</b> and 10 of 79 non-pregnant women. The odds ratio for death in the third trimester compared with the <b>first</b> two <b>trimesters</b> was 5. 57 (95 % confidence intervals 1. 02 to 30. 26). The condition of the mother improved rapidly after evacuation of the uterus, whether by spontaneous abortion, evacuation of retained products of conception, or normal delivery; 10 of 26 women without uterine evacuation died, but only four of 39 women with evacuation died (p = 0. 0016). The odds ratio for death with pregnancy intact was 5. 47 (95 % confidence interval 1. 35 to 22. 16). Fetal and neonatal loss was 87 %. The risk of death from Lassa fever in the third trimester is significantly higher than that in the <b>first</b> two <b>trimesters</b> and higher than that for non-pregnant women, but evacuation of the uterus can significantly improve the mother's chance of survival...|$|R
