50|$|Products within {{scope of}} the RoHS2 {{directive}} must display the CE mark, the manufacturers name and address and a serial or batch number. Parties needing to know more detailed compliance information can find this on the EU Declaration of Conformity for the product as created by the manufacturer (Brand owner) responsible for the design or the EU representative. The regulation also requires most actors in the supply chain for the product (importer and distributors) to keep and check this document, as well as ensuring a conformance process has been followed and the correct language translation for instructions are provided. The manufacturer must keep certain documentation to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>conformity,</b> known as a technical file or technical records. The directive requires the manufacturer to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>conformity</b> {{by the use of}} test data for all materials or by following a harmonised standard (EN50581:2012 is the only standard at the time of writing). Regulators may request this file or, more likely, specific data from it as it will likely be very large.|$|E
50|$|The key {{difference}} in the recast {{is that it is}} now necessary to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>conformity</b> in a similar way to the LVD and EMC directives. Not being able to show compliance in sufficiently detailed files, and not ensuring it is implemented in production is now a criminal offence. Like the other CE marking directives it mandates production control and traceability to the technical files. It describes 2 methods of achieving presumption of conformity (Directive 2011/65/EU Article 16.2), either technical files should include test data for all materials or a standard accepted in the official journal for the directive, is used.

50|$|Questions {{have been}} raised about the {{external}} validity of deindividuation research. As deindividuation has evolved as a theory, some researchers feel that the theory has {{lost sight of the}} dynamic group intergroup context of collective behavior that it attempts to model. Some propose that deindividuation effects may actually be a product of group norms; crowd behavior is guided by norms that emerge in a specific context. More generally, it seems odd that while deindividuation theory argues that group immersion causes antinormative behavior, research in social psychology has also shown that the presence of a group produces conformity to group norms and standards. Certain experiments, such as Milgram’s obedience studies (1974) <b>demonstrate</b> <b>conformity</b> to the experimenter’s demands; however the research paradigm in this experiment is very similar to some employ in deindividuation studies, except the role of the experimenter is usually not taken into account in such instances.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the requirement to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>conformity</b> is the requirement to know the exemption use of each component, otherwise {{it is not possible to}} know compliance when the product is placed on the market, the only point in time the product must be 'compliant'. Many do not understand that 'compliance' varies depending on what exemptions are in force and it is quite possible to make a non-compliant product with 'compliant' components. Compliance must be calculated on the day of placing on the market. In reality this means knowing the exemption status of all components and using up stock of old status parts before the expire date of the exemptions (Directive 2011/65/EU Article 7.b referring to Decision 768/2008/EC Module A Internal production control). Not having a system to manage this could be seen as a lack of diligence and a criminal prosecution could occur (UK Instrument 2012 N. 3032 section 39 Penalties).|$|E

The convection term that represents transport of particles is calculated by time step integration of velocity. To exercise the capability of the method in handling complex flows, we carried out simulation of flow field around a flapping wing.

40|$|Sludge {{is often}} {{generated}} from the treatment of wastewater and {{it is essential to}} reduce its volume before disposal into the environment through dewatering. This helps to reduce the cost of final sludge disposal. This study was therefore aimed at developing a model for the draining time of sludge through the application of vacuum pressure. A vacuum filtration experiment was performed on sewage sludge collected from the wastewater treatment plant situated at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. The sludge sample was poured into Buchner funnel apparatus and the volume of the filtrate collected was noted at a certain time interval {{until the end of the}} experiment.

Since the 1990 s they {{have sought to}} <b>demonstrate</b> <b>conformity</b> with intersubjectively accepted understandings of nuclear responsibility within the global nuclear order, and have also sought recognition {{on the basis of}} particularistic practices of nuclear restraint. This article addresses two puzzles. First, nuclear restraint is at the centre of the pursuit of global nuclear order, so why have China and India not received recognition from influential members of the nuclear order for the full spectrum of their restraint-based behaviours? Second, why do China and India nonetheless persist with these behaviours? We argue that the conferral of status as a nuclear responsible is a politicised process shaped by the interests, values and perceptions of powerful stakeholder states in the global nuclear order. China’s and India’s innovations are not incorporated into the currently accepted set of responsible nuclear behaviours because, indirectly, they pose a strategic, political and social challenge to these states. However, China’s and India’s innovations are significant as a lens into their identity-projection and preferred social roles as distinctive rising powers, and as a means of introducing new, if nascent, ideas into non-proliferation practice and governance...|$|E

40|$|Heavy {{vehicles}} emit emissions {{at different}} rates than passenger vehicles. They may behave differently on the road as well, yet they are often treated similarly to passenger vehicles in emissions modeling. Although not frequently considered in calculating emission rates, differences in the operating speeds of passenger vehicles and heavy trucks may influence emissions. The main goal of this research project was to evaluate whether heavy trucks typically travel at significantly different operating speeds than passenger vehicles and what impact differences in on-road speeds would have on emissions. Average speeds and spot speeds were collected for heavy trucks and passenger vehicles for four arterial segments and spot speeds were collected for two freeway segments in Des Moines, Iowa. Average and spot speeds were collected for four arterial segments and three freeway segments in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota metropolitan area. The results of this research show that heavy trucks and passenger vehicles operate differently on the road. Average and spot speeds were compared for heavy trucks and passenger vehicles by facility. Average and spot speeds for heavy-duty trucks were lower than for passenger vehicles for all locations. Differences could have consequences for project level and regional emissions modeling particularly since the ability to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>conformity</b> {{is based on the}} ability to correctly estimate and model vehicle activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{approach}} {{described in}} this paper relies on a radical and innovative approach to enable a management system to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>conformity</b> {{to the requirements of}} an unlimited number of management system standard requirements, at the cost of performing a single mapping exercise. This unique approach relies on interposing a 'process reference model' between the process evidence of the enterprise management system and the normative requirements of various management systems standards of interest. This approach requires that the process evidence of the enterprise management system is mapped to the process reference model elements - a once-off exercise. The mapping of the process reference model elements to the various management system requirements is also performed as a 'once off exercise, and is completely independent of the enterprise management system. By quantifying the judgements made when creating these various links, and by appropriately aggregating the data to derive quantitative results for the extent of the coverage of process reference model (by the management system process evidence) we can derive the extent of the coverage of the requirements of the various management system standards of interest. This leads to a novel result that the question 'how much ISO 9001 have you got?' can be expressed in meaningful, quantifiable and accurate terms, based on objective evidence...|$|E
40|$|Exploring {{the idea}} of student protests as an {{autonomous}} object of research and discussion, this paper leads to the understanding that the transforming role of the university and its governance defines the possibilities for the political role of students. In this perspective, there is a particular constellation of the different forms of higher education governance that provides students with the right and even the responsibility of protesting as politically engaged citizens of the university and of the state. Approaching {{the transformation of the}} models of university governance as a set of archaeologically organised states this paper identifies the sequential roles provided to the students and the meaning of their protests and demonstrations. After visiting some antecedents of more contemporaneous student movements and protests, this paper focuses on the UK to explore three manifestations of university governance that can be roughly differentiated as the enduring democratic period that extends from the late 1960 s to the late 1980 s, the globalisation period that extends from the early 1990 s to the mid- 2000 s and as the post-millennial turn.

Despite this potential, many challenges remain before the full value of this emerging field can be realized. The characterization of input material for cell-based therapy bioprocesses from multiple donors is necessary to identify and understand the potential implications of input variation on process development. In this work, we have characterized bone marrow derived human mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) from multiple donors and discussed the implications of the measurable input variation on the development of autologous and allogeneic cell-based therapy manufacturing processes. The range of cumulative population doublings across the five BM-hMSC lines over 30 days of culture was 5. 93, with an 18. 2 % range in colony forming efficiency {{at the end of the}} culture process and a 55. 1 % difference in the production of interleukin- 6 between these cell lines. It has been demonstrated that this variation results in a range in the process time between these donor hMSC lines for a hypothetical product of over 13 days, creating potential batch timing issues when manufacturing products from multiple patients. All BM-hMSC donor lines <b>demonstrated</b> <b>conformity</b> to the ISCT criteria but showed a difference in cell morphology. Metabolite analysis showed that hMSCs from the different donors have a range in glucose consumption of 26. 98  pmol cell− 1  day− 1, Lactate production of 29. 45  pmol cell− 1  day− 1 and ammonium production of 1. 35  pmol cell− 1  day− 1, demonstrating the extent of donor variability throughout the expansion process.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{a design}} for a communication platform for distributed railway applications is presented. A strict separation of fail-safe and non-fail-safe functionalities and a decoupling to the greatest possible extent of communication functions from the railway applications {{permit the use of}} standardised communication infrastructures and technologies from the field of distributed communications. Through the service integration of the preceding gateway functionality the utilisation of the limited transmission capacity of the existing communication infrastructure can be considerably increased. The stringent demands made on the reliability of the overall system are satisfied by the use of special failure-tolerant link protocols and the creation of redundant gateway clusters. The advantage of using the special link protocols lies in the reduced complexity on the fail-safe signalling & safety side. For the implementation of the switching and protocol functionalities of the preceding gateway entity, a framework running in user space with special resources was created within the communication platform. For the validation of the communication platform the following hardware-in-the-loop strategy was applied:Communication scenarios are stimulated by a test environment and tested automatically. Besides the verification of the correctness of the exchanged data and consistency of the protocol primitives received at the user interface of the unit under test, the transfers can also be observed at the interfaces between the protocol layers.

40|$|One of {{the three}} key {{regulatory}} requirements in Europe for transfer of storage site liability is to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>conformity</b> between predictive models of reservoir performance and monitoring observations. This is a challenging requirement because a perfect and unique match between observed and modeled behavior is near impossible to achieve. This study takes the time-lapse seismic monitoring data from the Sleipner storage operation to demonstrate that as more seismic data becomes available with time, predictive models can be matched more accurately to observations and become more reliable predictors of future performance. Six simple performance measures were defined: plume footprint area, maximum lateral migration distance of CO 2 from the injection point, area of CO 2 accumulation trapped at top reservoir, volume of CO 2 accumulation trapped at top reservoir, area of all CO 2 layers summed, and spreading co-efficient. Model scenarios were developed to predict plume migration up to 2008. Scenarios were developed for 1996 (baseline), 2001, and 2006 conditions, with models constrained by the information available at those times, and compared with monitoring datasets obtained up to 2008. The 1996 predictive range did generally encompass the future observed plume behavior, but with such {{a wide range of}} uncertainty as to render it of only marginal practical use. The 2001 predictions (which used the 1999 and 2001 seismic monitoring datasets) had a much lower uncertainty range, with the 2006 uncertainties somewhat lower again. There are still deficiencies in the actual quality of match but a robust convergence, with time, of predicted and observed models is clearly demonstrated. We propose modeling-monitoring convergence as a generic approach to demonstrating conformance...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of a}} Quality Management System (QMS) as {{specified}} in ISO 9001 and AS 9100 is to assure the end product meets specifications and customer requirements. Measuring devices, often called measuring and test equipments (MTE), provide the evidence of product conformity to the prescribed requirements. Therefore the processes which employ MTE can become a weak link to the overall QMS if proper attention is not given to development and execution of these processes. Traditionally, calibration of MTE is given more focus in industry standards and process control efforts than the equally important proper usage of the same equipment. It is a common complaint of calibration laboratory personnel that MTE users are only interested in "a sticker. " If the QMS requires the MTE "to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>conformity</b> of the product," then {{the quality of the}} measurement process must be adequate for the task. This leads to an ad hoc definition; measurement assurance is a discipline that assures that all processes, activities, environments, standards, and procedures involved in making a measurement produce a result that can be rigorously evaluated for validity and accuracy. To evaluate that the existing measurement processes are providing an adequate level of quality to support the decisions based upon this measurement data, an understanding of measurement assurance basics is essential. This topic is complimentary to the calibration standard, ANSI/NCSL Z 540. 3 - 2006, which targets the calibration of MTE at the organizational level. This paper will discuss general measurement assurance when MTE is used to provide evidence of product conformity, therefore the target audience of this paper is end item users of MTE. A central focus of the paper will be the verification of tolerances and the associated risks, so calibration professionals may find the paper useful in communication with their customers, MTE users...|$|E
