5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E
25|$|I {{used to have}} {{to punch}} a time clock at Columbia. Every day of my life. That's what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> under {{exclusive}} contract, like they owned me… I think he had my dressing room bugged… He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E
500|$|The {{favourite}} for the race, Bjorn Daehlie of Norway won {{the gold}} medal, but {{instead of going to}} the podium to collect it, he was informed that Boit was still racing – the only competitor left on the course, down in 92nd place. Daehlie waited for Boit to finish, welcoming him as he passed the finish line. Boit was amazed by the crowd's reaction as he arrived, [...] "They were shouting 'Kenya GO!, Philip GO!' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> winning a medal even though I was last." [...] As he crossed the line some 20 minutes after Daehlie, the Norwegian hugged the Kenyan – while Boit later said that he immediately thanked Daehlie, the gold medallist insisted that Boit instead remarked that he would beat him at the next Olympics. The incident received worldwide attention.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{pleasant}} sort of face, I think; but I was so startled I don't {{quite know}} what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> wish we had a curtain there,' said Tilly.|$|R
5000|$|Johnny's {{comment about}} {{his return to}} the {{business}} was, [...] "My fans are unbelievable. They pushed me to do this. When I got on that stage again, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> never left Sha Na Na." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm half American myself, you know. I {{used to live}} in New York when I {{was very}} small, but I've almost {{forgotten}} what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> remember a sort of overhead railway that made an awful noise...." ...|$|R
500|$|Kim Manners later {{noted that}} [...] "Theef" [...] was {{difficult}} to shoot because {{the cast and crew}} had inadequate time to prepare. He explained, [...] "It was kind of a rush thing and we got the script very late. We were totally winging it while we were shooting it". Manners later stated that the episode [...] "came together" [...] in the editing room: [...] "When I looked at the footage, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking at somebody else's film. But it cut together real nice and the end result was that 'Theef' {{turned out to be a}} decent little episode". Manners later admitted that the episode was his only credit for the series during which he experienced illness. With Manners out for a day due to his sickness, Rob Bowman took over directing duties for a day.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{director}} Stanley Kubrick's {{death and}} the Columbine High School massacre occurred within months of each other; Ledonne credited the two events with changing his life. After seeing A Clockwork Orange, Ledonne discovered that film could comment on culture; after the Columbine shootings, {{he realized he was}} headed down the same path as the shooters. [...] "It was a bit scary, once I learned more about these boys, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking in the mirror and I didn't want the same fate for myself," [...] Ledonne said. He began taking martial arts, studying film, and saw a therapist. By the time he graduated from Alamosa High School, Ledonne had a 4.0 grade point average and was voted [...] "most likely to succeed" [...] by his peers. He studied film at Emerson College and moved back to Colorado to form his own production company, Emberwild Productions, which mostly edits wedding videos.|$|E
500|$|Oakley, Inc. {{provided}} the red-lensed glasses worn by Cyclops, a customized {{version of the}} company's own X-Metal Juliet. Wolverine's claws required no cast of Hugh Jackman's hands, and were built so he could easily put them on and take them off for safety reasons. Production had insisted that they be attached at all times under a full prosthetic sleeve but designer Gordon Smith refused to do it. Production also insisted on real metal blades, which Smith also refused to do, making injection-moulded plaster blades instead. Hundreds of pairs were built for Jackman and his stunt doubles. Rebecca's wore 110 individual silicone prosthetic, Only the edges were glued, the rest were self-sticking. The prosthetics were built flat and wrapped her body. They were internally colored with food coloring and needed additional makeup or paint. The original agreed to and tested design was, to color her skin with cosmetic grade food coloring as well, which looked remarkable, says Gordon Smith, {{but at the last}} minute Bryan Singer insisted on painting her skin to look opaque, as in the comic book, which added 6 hours to the makeup, making the ordeal very difficult for her. [...] There were also no facilities provided to exhaust paint fumes, during one of Canada's colder winters. Romijn reflected, [...] "I had almost no contact {{with the rest of the}} cast; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making a different movie from everyone else. It was hell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I didn't know, Mely, child," [...] {{said the}} old woman. [...] "I didn't know what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> hain't never <b>been</b> to one, and you can't be too keerful where you go, {{in a place like}} New York." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Zane Lowe, he said 'I just wanted to beat [...] "Thinking Out Loud" [...] because I know that song was going to define me...With [...] "Perfect", <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> need to write the best love song of my career'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a chance," [...] was {{the gloomy}} reply. [...] "It {{was put on}} two covered trucks and sent up to London by the first train. Captain Griffiths {{can tell you what}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> dare say. You were down there, weren't you, sir?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In a July 1995 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, Gibson said President Bill Clinton was a [...] "low-level opportunist" [...] and someone was [...] "telling {{him what to}} do". He said that the Rhodes Scholarship was established for {{young men and women}} who want to strive for a [...] "new world order" [...] and this was a campaign for Marxism. Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, [...] "It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'...so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I believed in it." [...] In the same 1995 Playboy interview, Gibson argued against ordaining women to the priesthood.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Canadian tech-metal band Out of Your Mouth {{released}} a cover version of [...] "Music" [...] as their debut single. Vocalist Jason Darr commented, [...] "I absolutely love her, I've bought her records {{and when she}} came out with that song <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hit over the head with it". In 2007, The Dynamics {{released a}}n eight-minute soul cover on their album Versions Excursions. French metal band Eths added a cover of the song as a bonus track on their third studio album III (2012). In addition, remixed eurodance cover versions of the song have appeared on the Dancemania series albums, including an uptempo cover remix by Nancy And The Boys on the 2001 album Dancemania Speed 6.|$|E
2500|$|Slug also dislikes some of {{the songs}} that he wrote before and does not perform them live, such as [...] "Vampires" [...] from 2002 album God Loves Ugly. Daley has stated, [...] "when I did get my phase of trying to figure myself out, {{there was a lot}} of tug-of-war inside of me between wanting to hate a {{particular}} woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I’m at". Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to prove to myself that I was a rapper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, madam," [...] {{said the}} Prince, [...] "I {{wish you would}} leave off {{mentioning}} my nose. It cannot matter to you what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite satisfied with it, and have no wish to have it shorter. One must take what is given one." ...|$|R
50|$|Next to the Foundation {{is another}} {{monument}} which honors Captain Roberto Rodriguez, known as “El Vaquerito” (little cowboy), a young soldier {{who died in}} the Battle of Santa Clara. When notified of his death, revolutionary leader Che Guevara said: “Today <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> have lost 300 men”.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The New York Times, Williams stated: [...] "I didn't even know {{if we were going}} to make another record...There was a moment when I didn't even want it to happen. Then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> want <b>it</b> to happen, but I don't know how we're going to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I Certainly {{should not}} have volunteered for this work, Bullen, if I had known what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mad at {{not being able to}} go out to the Cape, and as my {{regiment}} was, like yours, stationed in India, there was no chance of getting away from there, if I had once returned. Of course, I knew all about the expeditions of Wolseley and Scott; but I forgot that these were carried on in the dry season, and that we should have to campaign in the wet season, which makes all the difference in the world. We are wet through, from morning till night--and all night, too--and at our camping places there is no shelter. The low-lying land is turned into deep swamps, the little streams become great unfordable torrents, and the ground under our feet turns into liquid mud. It is really horrible work, especially as we get very little food and less drink. It is not work for dogs." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{making up}} for lost time - not that I had to catch up, but it was as though I couldn't quite believe this world of {{storytelling}} I had found and I wanted to get as much of it down me as I possibly could.|$|E
5000|$|Blomberg {{enjoyed the}} {{attention}} he received in New York {{because he was}} Jewish: [...] "To {{be able to play}} in front of 8 million Jews! Can’t beat it. I lit everyone’s candles for every bar mitzvah in the city. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> related to everyone. They named a sandwich after me at the Stage Deli!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I did not know," [...] she wrote. [...] "I {{have often}} read {{of the white}} {{narcissus}} and wondered what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> {{never thought of it}} being the same as my dear June lilies. I am glad you told me. I love flowers very much. They are my very good friends." ...|$|R
5000|$|... nine daysyou have no stimulation, so your {{subconscious}} starts {{filling in}} the blanks ... I started to feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> channelling spirits. I was convinced my music {{was a gift from}} God. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> knew exactly what to do next, as if my songs were already written. Grimes in The Guardian, 27 April 2012 ...|$|R
5000|$|Drabek {{was voted}} the 2010 Eastern League pitcher of the year. Drabek {{attributed}} {{some of his}} success to a more consistent delivery, for which the point of release for different pitches appeared the same to batters. [...] "In the beginning, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had different movements for different pitches. Now, everything comes the same and everything stays the same." ...|$|R
5000|$|Maracle was {{in seventh}} grade when she got hit with the acting bug, “It was a {{movement}} piece on the Creation story, Skywoman Falling From the Sky, and was performed by two actors; Rosa John, and her partner. I was struck by {{what they were doing}} and knew immediately that that was what I wanted to do. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hit by a lightning bolt…I knew.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, during {{qualifying}} for the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix, explained: [...] "I {{was already on}} pole, ... and I just kept going. Suddenly I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same car. And suddenly I realised that I was no longer driving the car consciously. I was driving it {{by a kind of}} instinct, only I was in a different dimension. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in a tunnel." ...|$|E
5000|$|Steven {{wrote that}} song [...] "Lady D'Arbanville" [...] when I left for New York. I {{left for a}} month, it wasn't {{the end of the}} world was it? But he wrote this whole song about [...] "Lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still." [...] It's about me dead. So while I was in New York, for him <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lying in a coffin... He wrote that because he missed me, because he was down... It's a sad song..|$|E
5000|$|Catherine obliged willingly. She {{tightened}} the cord slowly around the young woman's neck until she stopped breathing. David Birnie {{stood beside the}} bed watching. Asked later why she had done it, Catherine Birnie said: [...] "Because I {{wanted to see how}} strong I was within my inner self. I didn't feel a thing. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> expected. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> prepared to follow him {{to the end of the}} earth and do anything to see that his desires were satisfied. She was a female. Females hurt and destroy males." ...|$|R
50|$|After his death, {{people still}} carried fond {{memories}} of Edgar. One man, who was in his 90s at the time, said in 1976: You just can’t imagine what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> remember walking down an aisle and, all of a sudden, I saw Santa Claus. I couldn’t believe my eyes, and then Santa came up and started talking to me. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a dream come true.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Spider-Man {{scene from}} the Halloween episode was my {{favorite}} to shoot thus far for the sheer fact that I was scaling down a wall in a Spider-Man costume. I will {{never in my life}} be cast in a movie where I am able to wear a super-hero costume and perform my own stunts. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> got to live a dream for a day." ...|$|R

5000|$|You weren't {{going to}} work, {{you were going}} to have fun. It was home, {{everybody}} was cohesive; it was family. One year I made nine pictures; I had to go from one set to another. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on a conveyor belt. You did not read a script and say, [...] "I guess I'll do it." [...] You did it. They had people that knew the kind of stories that were suited to you. It was a conveyor belt that made motion pictures.|$|E
5000|$|I couldn't {{really see}} that much, only people's feet {{pointing}} up. I poked their {{feet with a}} stick. I couldn't touch the dead bodies. I couldn't smell anything and they hadn't been eaten yet or started to decay. I mean, sure, decay must have started, but I couldn't notice it. I {{could tell it was}} a woman because she had polished toenails and the others must have been two men, judging by their pants and shoes.

And it would come any time--anywhere--no matter where I was. And then I was all right.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{his early}} musical {{experiences}} Mydland has stated: [...] "Late into high school I got into playing rock 'n' roll {{with friends and}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had to start from the beginning almost, because if I didn't {{have a piece of}} music in front of me I couldn't do much. I changed my outlook on playing real fast after that. I think dope {{had something to do with}} that." ...|$|R
