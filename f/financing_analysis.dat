50|$|Global Nutrition Spending: Results for Development {{completed}} the first-ever analysis of global nutrition spending. The analysis {{has shown that}} an additional $50B {{will be needed to}} achieve the World Health Assembly target aimed at reducing stunting (low height for age) by 40% globally by 2025. R4D has suggested pathways whereby high burden governments, donors, and new innovative funding mechanisms for nutrition can work together to mobilize these resources. If these resources are indeed mobilized, there will be 63 million fewer children stunted in 2025, meaning they will avoid detrimental lifelong impacts on their physical and mental development and future productivity caused by stunting. This is the first global analysis that shows how much is needed in order to improve stunting, what it will buy, and where the additional funding might come from. This analysis was presented {{for the first time at}} a high level event at the Financing for Development conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in July 2015.

In the algorithm, each neural network is obtained by bagging and is trained by PSO algorithm, and then the networks selected according to the pre-set threshold are combined. Experimental results show that the improved algorithm is effective and outperforms GA based selective ensemble (GASEN) algorithm for the stock index forecasting problems. I...|$|R
