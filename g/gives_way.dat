5|$|Dedicated to Suzanne Alfred-Bruneau, {{the eighth}} barcarolle opens {{in with a}} cheerful theme, which soon <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> to melancholy. The second episode, in C minor, marked cantabile, is succeeded by an abrupt ending with a fortissimo chord.|$|E
5|$|The song {{consists}} of 28bars. It {{begins with a}} boisterous eight-bar introduction. Fourbars follow to frame the coda. The remainder {{consists of}} sixteenbars with lyrics, half devoted to verse, and half to refrain. Each phrase <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> directly to the next with no rests between sections.|$|E

5|$|The {{coastal plain}} of the Atlantic seaboard <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> further inland to {{deciduous}} forests and {{the rolling hills}} of the Piedmont. The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest. The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south {{through the heart of}} the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.|$|E
5|$|The play is a {{statement}} {{on the idea that}} a man is valued by his position in life. Loman never matures enough to realize that being popular without any substance or skill is meaningless in the end and Miller uses Loman to make his point against the anti-intellectualists. In the end, Loman <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> to the belief that his inability to be a successful man and father is condemning.|$|E

5|$|After one {{intersection}} with 5900 South, which presently serves {{only the}} toll road company's headquarters {{and a single}} commercial building, private maintenance <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> to a four-lane city street with sidewalks just shy of 5800 South. The roadway continues northeasterly {{to the top of}} the hill near 5600 South, where pre-existing Adams Avenue (500 East) heads north, passing the Ogden Regional Medical Center to an intersection with Washington Boulevard (US-89) on the Washington Terrace-South Ogden border. Adams Avenue continues through South Ogden and into Ogden as a minor street one block east of US-89, with a gap near 4600 South and more north of downtown Ogden. In 2006 approximately 1,400cars traveled the parkway on an average weekday.|$|E
5|$|It is {{most common}} amongst the kwongan heath of the Geraldton Sandplains north of Jurien; {{it has a}} fairly {{continuous}} distribution there, often as the dominant species, and extends inland to around the 350mm isohyet. On the Swan Coastal Plain to the south, its distribution is discontinuous, being largely confined to patches of suitable sand in the narrow transition zone where tuart forest <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> to jarrah forest. With {{the exception of a}} population at Point Walter (32°00′S), it does not occur on the sandplain south of the Swan River.|$|E
5000|$|However archeologists {{have been}} able to {{identify}} three distinct phases of art: pre-estuarine (dry climate and extinct animals), estuarine (rising sea levels and marine fauna) and freshwater (freshwater fauna, moving into 'historical' subjects such as Makassan traders, and European technology e.g. guns). Rock art also demonstrates cultural and technological changes, for instance boomerangs <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to broad spearthrowers which <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to long spearthrowers, which <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to guns and boats.https://web.archive.org/web/20051125151823/http://www.lonker.net/art_aboriginal_1.htm ...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{spends the}} rest of the episode working in an improv comedy group with Quagmire and Joe. Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} should never have been attempted.|$|E
5|$|The Third of May {{references}} {{a number}} of earlier works of art, but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas. Pictorial artifice <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> to the epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary Romantic painters—who were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war, and death—composed their paintings with greater attention to the conventions of beauty, as is evident in Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (18181819) and Eugène Delacroix's 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form {{complete}} series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds {{can be described}} as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions. This description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase, and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable. For instance, ionic bonding <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> to metallic bonding along the series NaCl, Na2O, Na2S, Na3P, Na3As, Na3Sb, Na3Bi, Na.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} and western {{parts of the}} walls were originally faced with a local ashlar sandstone with a core of basalt rubble; the sandstone was mostly quarried at Howick. The sandstone has since been stripped from the western parts of the wall, and the sandstone along {{the eastern end of}} the walls <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> to small limestone blocks, originally only laid 11-foot (3.3 m) high with a 4-foot 11 inches (1.5 m) parapet, but later raised in height with additional basalt boulders, probably during the Wars of the Roses. It is uncertain if the curtain wall originally extended above the cliffs along the northern edge of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains {{was plagued}} by {{extended}} inactivity from 1996 onwards due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band reunited in 2005 for a live benefit show, performing {{with a number of}} guest vocalists. They toured in 2006, with William DuVall taking over as lead vocalist full-time. The new line-up released the band's fourth studio album, Black <b>Gives</b> <b>Way</b> to Blue, in 2009, which received gold certification by the RIAA and three Grammy nominations. Their fifth studio album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, was released in 2013. The band toured extensively and released several videos in support of these albums. Alice in Chains is currently working on their sixth studio album, tentatively set for release in early 2018.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> {{to a more}} {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E

5|$|Dog pups show {{unrestrained}} {{fighting with}} their siblings from 2 weeks of age, with injury avoided only {{due to their}} undeveloped jaw muscles. This fighting <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> to play-chasing {{with the development of}} running skills at 4–5 weeks. Wolf pups possess more-developed jaw muscles from 2 weeks of age, when they first show signs of play-fighting with their siblings; serious fighting occurs during 4–6 weeks of age. Compared to wolf and dog pups, golden jackal pups develop aggression at the age of 4–6 weeks, when play-fighting frequently escalates into uninhibited biting intended to harm. This aggression ceases by 10–12 weeks when a hierarchy has formed. Once the lactation period concludes, the female drives off the pups. Pups born late remain with their mother until early autumn, at which time they leave either singly or in groups of two to four individuals. Females reach sexual maturity after 10–11 months and males at 21–22 months.|$|E
5|$|From 1996 to 2002, {{the band}} was mostly inactive, {{releasing}} two live albums, including the successful Unplugged, and three compilations. On April 19, 2002, Staley {{was found dead in}} his home after overdosing on heroin and cocaine, causing the group to break up. In 2005, the band reunited with new vocalist William DuVall. On April 25, 2009, it was announced that Alice in Chains had signed to Virgin/EMI making it the band's first label change in their 20-plus year career. Black <b>Gives</b> <b>Way</b> to Blue, the group's first album with DuVall, was released on September 29, 2009. In 2011, Alice in Chains began work on their fifth studio album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, which was released two years later.|$|E
5|$|M-212 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Second Street and the Tromble Trail {{north of the}} entrance to Aloha State Park {{in the community of}} Aloha. The community was originally a stop on the Detroit and Mackinac Railway that was named after a trip to Hawaii by the local sawmill owner. Progressing eastward, M-212 intersects with Third Street and Fourth Street, both of which are just separated by woodlands and residences. To the north of the highway, there is all woodlands and residences. To the south, there are just a few residences. After a while, there is a large clearing, which <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> to a farm to the north and more residences to the south. After the farm there is a large field and M-212 terminates at an intersection with M-33 in Aloha Township.|$|E
