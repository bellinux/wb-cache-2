25|$|Adult {{butterflies}} take flower nectar {{and sometimes}} roost in trees. Adults fly {{through much of}} the year. The natural habitat is open brushy areas and subtropical hammocks, often in pine woodlands. Many populations now exist in suburban areas with ornamental cycads. Adults keep close to a site with host plants, thus the species forms small colonies. The females, however, may disperse in search of more hosts. The butterfly's flight is slow, unlike the swift, erratic flight of many other Lycaenidae. Like many Lepidoptera, male Atalas have hair-pencils (coremata) on their abdomens used in courtship—the male hovers in front of the female, wafting pheromones exuded from the pencils <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>direction.</b> Eggs are laid in clusters of 10-50 on the leaf tips of the host plant. Larvae feed on the leaves. Pupation is usually on the host plant.|$|E
25|$|New policemen Zane Gerard {{becomes a}} fixture in the West's lives, due to his past {{involvement}} with Sheree and Nicky Greegan. Van is pressured into becoming a police informant (behind the backs of all), infuriating Sheree when she finds out. Jethro starts up a business selling legal party pills. Nicky truly falls for Pascalle, enraging Sheree who makes off with Pascalle's millions and attempts to murder Van (to claim life insurance). After a rogue job robbing a Chinese money lender, Pascalle breaks up with Nicky. Loretta gets back together with Hayden and the two decide to marry as so they get custody of Jane. Ted ends up in prison for robbery and is helped out by Nicky, causing him and Pascalle to get back together. Near {{the end of the}} season, Cheryl has a stillbirth. The season ends with Gerard trying to arrest Pascalle for offensive language, resulting in a brawl (in the midst of Loretta and Hayden's wedding), only to be stabbed in the neck by Cheryl and turning round to fire three bullets <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E

500|$|Firing {{began at}} 16:00, when Renommée {{attempted}} to engage Astraea at extreme range. The British returned fire, Phoebe and Galatea joining the attack as they advanced, but the long distances and slow speeds involved meant that little damage {{was caused by}} either side. [...] The British squadron gradually drifted beyond {{the range of the}} French, Schomberg desperately but unsuccessfully attempting to turn back towards them. With the British becalmed, Roquebert's ships began to close the distance, using the breeze to position their broadsides close to the sterns of the British ships. From this position the French were able to unleash a destructive raking fire, Clorinde concentrating on Phoebe and Renommée on Galatea. The rearmost ship, Néréide, was unable to manoeuvre successfully in the light winds and remained beyond the effective range of Astraea and Racehorse, despite an ineffectual cannonade <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E
500|$|After {{the king}} withdrew, the exultant crowd {{would not be}} denied the same accord from the queen, and her {{presence}} was demanded loudly. Lafayette {{brought her to the}} same balcony, accompanied by her young son and daughter. The crowd ominously shouted for the children to be taken away, and it seemed the stage might be set for a regicide. Yet, as the queen stood with her hands crossed over her chest, the crowd – some of whom had muskets leveled <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>direction</b> – warmed to her courage. Amid this unlikely development, Lafayette cannily let the mob's fury drain away until, with dramatic timing and flair, he knelt reverently and kissed her hand. The demonstrators responded with a muted respect, and many even raised a cheer which the queen had not heard for quite a long time: [...] "Vive la Reine!" ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of the singer's 1993 career best-selling album Music Box, Carey and her {{management}} at Columbia Records began devising ideas and strategies for subsequent projects. Carey's then-husband, Tommy Mottola, head of Columbia's parent label Sony Music Entertainment, began mapping out possible follow ups for the singer during the pinnacle years of her career. During initial discussions regarding the thought of doing a Christmas-themed album with Carey and her writing partner of over four years, Walter Afanasieff, fear arose that it was not commercially expedient or wise to release holiday music at the peak of one's career, as it was more often equated with a release towards the end of a musician's waning career. Afanasieff recalled his sentiments during initial discussions for a holiday record: [...] "Back then, you didn't have a lot of artists with Christmas albums. It wasn't a known science at all back then, and there was nobody who did new, big Christmas songs. So we were going to release it as kind of an everyday, 'Hey, you know, we're putting out a Christmas album. No big deal.'" [...] Ultimately, with Mottola's persistence and Carey's initiative to be a [...] "risk-taker" [...] as Afanasieff put it, the song and its parent album, Merry Christmas, began taking form in early-mid 1994. Recording for the album began in June, while the Carey-Afanasieff songwriting duo penned [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] in late August. Often referencing herself a festive person and demonstrating a usual penchant for her love of all things Christmas, Carey began decorating the home she shared with Mottola in upstate New York (which also came equipped with a personal recording studio) with Christmas ornaments and other holiday-inspired trinkets. In doing so, Carey felt she could capture the essence and spirit of what she was singing and make her vocal performance and delivery more emotive and authentic. The songwriting pair carved out the chords, structure and melody for the song in just a quarter of an hour: [...] "It's definitely not 'Swan Lake,' ' admits Afanasieff. 'But that's why it's so popular — because it's so simple and palatable!". At first, Afanasieff admitted that he was puzzled and [...] "blanched" [...] as to where Carey wanted to take the melody and vocal scales, though she was [...] "adamant" [...] <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>direction</b> for the song. In an interview with Billboard, Afanasieff described the type of relationship he and Carey shared in the studio and as songwriters for the song and in general: ...|$|E

Mrs. Belmaine and her carriage some years before had accidentally got jammed crosswise in Cheapside through the clumsiness {{of the man in}} turning up a side street, blocking that great artery of the civilized world for the space of a minute and a half, when they were pounced upon by half-a-dozen policemen and forced to back ignominiously up a little slit between the houses where they did not mean to go, amid the shouts of the hindered drivers; and it was her nervous recollection of that event which caused Mrs. Belmaine to be so precise <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>directions</b> now.|$|R
