5|$|Both {{hunting and}} egging {{continue}} today, although {{not at the}} levels {{that occurred in the}} past, and generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have done for centuries, using traditional methods (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> many species into steep decline.|$|E
5|$|Qwest Field {{hosted the}} 2002 Seattle Bowl, in which Wake Forest beat Oregon 38–17. The inaugural Seattle Bowl was played {{a year earlier}} at Safeco Field, but the game was {{discontinued}} when organizers could not secure financing before 2003. Later attempts to revive the Seattle Bowl were unsuccessful. The Seattle Sports Commission <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> for a proposal of a new bowl game. In 2008 a business plan was begun for a game in 2010 {{that would be a}} fundraiser for Seattle Children's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante {{continued}} {{to collaborate with}} his friend Omar Rodríguez-López. Along with providing guitar work to The Mars Volta's studio albums, The Bedlam In Goliath and Octahedron, and Rodríguez-López's solo albums Se Dice Bisonte, No Búfalo and Calibration (<b>Is</b> <b>Pushing</b> Luck and Key Too Far), he functioned as executive producer for Rodríguez-López's directorial film debut, The Sentimental Engine Slayer. The film debuted at the Rotterdam Film Festival in February 2010. Along with work on the film, Frusciante and Rodríguez-López have released two collaborative records in May 2010. The first is the album Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & John Frusciante, an album with {{just the two of}} them, the other a quartet record, Sepulcros de Miel, consisting of Rodríguez-López, Frusciante, Juan Alderete and Marcel Rodríguez-López.|$|E

5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory was {{reinforced}} by a British Mission under James Chadwick. The first to arrive were Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton; later arrivals included Niels Bohr and his son Aage Bohr, and Sir Geoffrey Taylor, an expert on hydrodynamics who made a major contribution {{to the understanding of}} the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. This instability at the interface between two fluids of different densities occurs when the lighter fluid <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> the heavier, and was vital to the interpretation of experiments with explosives, predicting the effects of an explosion, the design of the neutron initiators, and the design of the atomic bomb itself. Chadwick remained only for a few months; he was succeeded as head of the British Mission by Rudolf Peierls. The original idea, favored by Groves, was that the British scientists would work as a group under Chadwick, who would farm out work to them. This was soon discarded in favor of having the British Mission fully integrated into the laboratory. They worked in most of its divisions, only being excluded from plutonium chemistry and metallurgy. With the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave. All had left by the end of 1946, except for Titterton, who was granted a special dispensation, and remained until 12 April 1947. The British Mission ended when he departed.|$|E

50|$|Thus the {{transition}} function takes a state, the next {{symbol of the}} input string, and the top symbol of the current stack and generates the next state, the stacks to <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> and popped onto the embedded stack, the pushing and popping of the current stack, and the stacks to be considered the current stacks in the next transition. More conceptually, the embedded stack <b>is</b> <b>pushed</b> and popped, the current stack <b>is</b> optionally <b>pushed</b> back onto the embedded stack, and any other stacks one would like <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> on top of that, with the last stack being the one read from in the next iteration. Therefore, stacks can <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> both {{above and below the}} current stack.|$|R

50|$|The {{release date}} was shifted several times.

25|$|The United States {{have not}} been {{followed}} yet by other countries. But the UN sanctions are the first international sanctions levied on Iran. The United States <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> for more economic sanctions against Iran.

25|$|The U.S. Coalition for Advanced Diesel Cars <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> for a {{technology}} neutral policy for government subsidies of environmentally friendly automotive technology. If successful, government subsidies {{would be based}} on the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards rather than supporting specific technologies like electric cars. Political shifts could drastically change adoption projections. Turbocharger sales in the United States increased when the federal government boosted corporate average fuel economy targets to 35.5 mpg by 2016.|$|E

50|$|A notable {{difference}} is that the player has a single Vorton with an energy meter, instead of five lives; accordingly, the bomb must <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> by the player, whereas in the previous game it <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> by the player's spare Vortons.|$|R
25|$|The {{issue of}} the {{charitable}} status of the Rec has prevented progress, but in 2013 the Charity Commission recommended a scheme to allow the club's former training ground at Lambridge to be exchanged for an extended footprint on the Rec free from the charitable rules.

25|$|Discrete {{manufacturing}} plants adopted these technologies fast. The more conservative process industries with their longer plant life cycles have been slower to adopt and analogue-based {{measurement and control}} still dominates. The growing use of Industrial Ethernet {{on the factory floor}} <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> these trends still further, enabling {{manufacturing plants}} to be integrated more tightly within the enterprise, via the internet if necessary. Global competition has also increased demand for Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} climate change is one that we ignore at our own peril.

And unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country, we are condemning future generations to global catastrophe.|$|E

25|$|In lobbying, the {{revolving}} door is the cycling of former federal employees into jobs as lobbyists while former K Street employees are pulled into government positions. Government officials can only work certain terms in their positions, for example senators, and afterwards they form valuable connections that could help influence future law making. The other form of {{the revolving}} door <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> lobbyists into government positions, and then developing connections and returning into the lobbying world to use said connections. This is a controversial issue in the political lobbying world.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, The Coup {{released}} Party Music {{to widespread}} praise. However, {{in part because}} of distribution problems, sales of the album were low.

The cover art was finished in June 2001 and the album was scheduled to be released in mid-September. However, in response to the uncanny similarity of the artwork with the September 11, 2001, attacks, the album release was delayed until November of that year with the cover featuring a hand with a flaming martini glass.|$|E
