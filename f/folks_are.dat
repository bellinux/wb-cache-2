2500|$|With {{reference}} to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: [...] "he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of these <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> interrelated….

[...] This quote clarifies {{the fact that the}} documentarians do not believe they have tested the DNA and have proven it to be Jesus.

The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage.

[...] Another CNN report by Douglas Rushkoff, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,"Anyone who says he has no idea what these <b>folks</b> <b>are</b> protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for {{most of the rest of}} us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns...They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture".|$|E
