40|$|We {{introduce}} a new fundamental property of waveguides induced {{by the forces of}} the guided light, namely, the ability to <b>self</b> <b>align</b> or be in instability. A nanoscale waveguide broken by an offset and a gap may tend to <b>self</b> <b>align</b> to form a continuous waveguide. Conversely, depending on the geometry and light polarization, the two parts of the waveguide may be deflected away from each other, thus being in an unstable state. These effects are unique as they rely on the presence of both the guided mode and the scattered light. Strong self alignment forces may be facilitated by near field interaction with polarization surface charges...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [40]- 41) During {{the summer}} of 1986, the first field effect transistors were built. These transistors were enhancement mode NMOS single layer aluminum gate FETs. Using this technology simple logic gates could be fabricated. But with the demand for greater complexity and density, multiple interconnect layers and smaller device geometries are needed. Given limited fabrication facilities, the only course of action available is to develop multilevel interconnect technology. But, three processes have to be developed before this can happen. First, the aluminum interconnects must be replaced with a metal silicide that can withstand post processing temperatures. Second, an interlayer dielectric system must be added to isolate the individual layers. Finally, a <b>self</b> <b>aligned</b> via system must be employed to decrease topography. It was {{the purpose of this}} study to develop a <b>self</b> <b>aligned</b> via process using the metal liftoff technique.
