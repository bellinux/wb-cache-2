5|$|Because he {{is prone}} to bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode. She treats Tony {{to the best of}} <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> {{despite the fact that they}} routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E

Capcom added detail to the zombie enemies unprecedented in the series, such as making their jaws move and eyes twitch. Claire {{was given a}} tougher appearance in Code: Veronica than in Resident Evil 2, the reason being her experiences in Resident Evil 2 built her toughness and confidence to handle any situation. This characterization is emphasized by <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to dual wield sub-machine guns, and also by the opening cinematic which features her in a John Woo-inspired action scene. Mikami described Code: Veronica as 50-60% of his perfect vision for Resident Evil in February 2001, and he cited that future Resident Evil projects may make up the other half.|$|E

Her female nature was credited with <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to elicit exceptional performances from the band, more so than any of her record producer counterparts who worked with Howling Bells previously.

Wyatt put oil leases he owned in Henrietta's name with the agreement that the proceeds would benefit Sadie after his death.

5|$|Mary's {{animated}} and personable nature {{made her}} {{popular with the}} Dutch people, and her marriage to a Protestant prince was popular in Britain.

Within months of the marriage Mary was pregnant; however, {{on a visit to}} her husband at the fortified city of Breda, she suffered a miscarriage, which may have permanently impaired <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to have children. She suffered further bouts of illness that may have been miscarriages in mid-1678, early 1679, and early 1680. Her childlessness would be the greatest source of unhappiness in her life.|$|E
