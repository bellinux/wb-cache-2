5000|$|In {{order to}} {{distinguish}} between the two versions of the <b>heptode,</b> manufacturers data often describes them as [...] "heptode of the hexode type" [...] for a <b>heptode</b> without a suppressor grid, and a [...] "heptode of the octode type", where a suppressor grid is present.|$|E
50|$|In some designs, a {{suppressor}} grid {{was added to}} produce yet another <b>heptode</b> design. Mullard's ECH81 became popular with the move to miniature nine-pin valves.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the pentagrid or <b>heptode</b> (seven-electrode) valve was a novel development in the mixer story. The idea was to produce a single valve that not only mixed the oscillator signal and the received signal and produced its own oscillator signal {{at the same time}} but, importantly, did the mixing and the oscillating {{in different parts of the}} same valve.|$|E
50|$|A {{vacuum tube}} (such as a pentode, but also {{sometimes}} triodes, hexodes, <b>heptodes</b> and so on) with its control grid given a helix with a variable pitch {{can be made}} to operate with more negative grid voltages, with reduced amplification, before it is completely cut off (i.e. yielding no significant output). This ability to vary the amplification (sometimes called mu) and also the transconductance, is useful in Automatic Gain Control (AGC) stages of radio receivers. Devices with this characteristic are called remote-cutoff or variable-mu or super-control types.|$|R
50|$|Although not {{strictly}} a pentagrid (in {{that it has}} more than five grids), the octode (eight-electrode) nevertheless operates on the pentagrid principle. It resulted simply from the addition of an extra screen grid to the UK version of the pentagrid <b>heptode.</b> This was done mainly to improve the antenna/oscillator separation and to reduce the power consumption for use in radio sets operated by dry batteries that were becoming increasingly popular.|$|E
50|$|The hexode (six-electrode) was {{actually}} developed after the <b>heptode</b> or pentagrid. It {{was developed in}} Germany as a mixer but was designed from the start {{to be used with}} a separate triode oscillator. Thus the grid configuration was grid 1, signal input; grids 2 and 4 screen grids (connected together - again, usually internally) and grid 3 was the oscillator input. The device had no suppressor grid. A major advantage was that by using grid 1 as the signal input grid, the device was more sensitive to weak signals.|$|E
5000|$|In European {{nomenclature}} a {{first letter}} [...] "E" [...] identifies tubes with heaters {{to be connected}} in parallel to a transformer winding of 6.3V; [...] "U" [...] identifies tubes with heaters to be connected in series across the mains supply, drawing 100 mA; and [...] "P" [...] identifies similar 300 mA series-connected tubes. Following the voltage letter, [...] "A" [...] stands for a low-current (signal) diode section, [...] "B" [...] for a double diode with common cathode section, [...] "C" [...] for a triode section, [...] "F" [...] for a pentode section, [...] "H" [...] for a hexode or <b>heptode</b> section, and [...] "L" [...] for a power tetrode or pentode section. The first number identified the base type, for example 3 for Octal base; 9 for B7G sub-miniature 7 pin. The remaining numbers identified a particular tube type; tubes with all characters except the first identical had identical electrodes but a different heater; e.g. the EBC81 and UBC81. Generally, odd numbers identified tubes / valves with variable mu characteristics and even numbers straight, or sharp cut-off types.|$|E
40|$|Electrophysiological signal {{processing}} is a broad, complex and growing field. Universally, {{the first steps}} of any signal analysis are detection and classification. Here we present a flexible matched filter designed to detect spikes from various biological data types, {{as well as two}} statistically based approaches for spike classification. We then apply these developed tools to study the effects of deep anesthesia on neuronal network dynamics. The matched filter was implemented for three different applications: detecting action potentials (APs) from multi-sensor extracellular recordings, detecting depolarization events (DEs) from voltage sensitive dye (VSD) imaged cardiomyocytes, and detecting calcium events (CEs) from calcium imaged neuronal somas as well as dendritic spines. Overall, the presented matched filters could accurately detect spikes from various kinds of biological data, often beating other existing methods, and outperforming manual spike selection. The classification problems explored here include AP (or spike) sorting, as well as DE classification across different drug administrations. In the case of spike sorting, the MUSIC algorithm was used to extract classification features from multi-sensor extracellular AP recordings. This approach was able to reliably classify tetrode (4 channel) and <b>heptode</b> (7 channel) recorded APs. For DE classification, salient DE features were extracted and then compared across drug treatments using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The drug treated cells were consistently statistically distinguishable from controls. Overall, both methodsâ€™ success makes them valuable tools for studying neuronal networks as well as cardiomyocyte drug assays, respectively. Finally, the matched filter for AP detection as well as the MUSIC-based AP classification scheme were applied to in vivo <b>heptode</b> data collected from M 1 of the right hemisphere of anesthetized rats, to assess the effects of increasing anesthesia on neuronal network dynamics during a burst suppression state. We found that higher anesthesia led to higher AP frequency, no change in the number of active single units, and increased cross-hemisphere functional connectivity (as measured by simultaneous ECoG recordings). Additionally, all APs were restricted to ECoG bursts, with no APs occurring during suppressed ECoG states. This work provides valuable insights for the study of neuronal network dynamics as well as coma arousal...|$|E
40|$|High {{intensity}} {{microwave radiation}} effects are demonstrated for electron transfer processes at 25 or 50 -mu m diameter platinum electrodes immersed in micellar sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) solutions. First, a solution containing 2 mM Fe(CN) (6) (3 -) and 2 mM Fe(CN) (6) (4 -) in aqueous 0. 1 M NaCl {{with and without}} SDS is employed to calibrate the electrode temperature and mass transport conditions. Addition of 0. 1 M SDS has only a small effect on the microwave enhanced voltammetry for the Fe(CN 6) 3 -/ 4 - system. Next, two highly water-insoluble redox systems are studied. A solution of 1 mM tert-butylferrocene in aqueous 0. 1 M NaCl containing 0. 1 M SDS is shown to give no current response {{in the absence of}} microwaves. In the presence of focused microwaves at a platinum disc electrode, a strong current for the one electron oxidation of tert-butylferrocene is detected presumably due to localized disruption of the micellar solution. Concentrations of tert-butylferrocene down to the micromolar level are detected. alpha-Tocopherol, a lipophilic vitamin and antioxidant, is soluble in aqueous 0. 1 M SDS/ 0. 1 M NaCl. In the presence of microwave radiation, a strong and concentration dependent anodic current response consistent with the two-electron oxidation of alpha-tocopherol is observed. A <b>heptode</b> array of seven individual 50 mu m diameter platinum microelectrodes placed in ca. 720 mu m distance of each other is shown to allow microwave enhanced currents to be increased sevenfold with each electrode exhibiting the same microwave effect...|$|E
