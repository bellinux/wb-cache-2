5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: censure by the <b>full</b> <b>Senate.</b> Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure included {{the fact that he}} was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The Ethics Committee took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the <b>full</b> <b>Senate,</b> with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E
5|$|The <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> voted {{three times}} {{on whether to}} accept the report, and each time the voting was {{precisely}} divided along party lines.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{sponsored}} {{legislation that}} would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> after being heavily modified in committee. Regarding tort reform, Obama voted for the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.|$|E
50|$|On September 20, 2012, Baer's {{nomination}} was voted out of committee to the <b>full</b> U.S. <b>Senate</b> in a 12-5 vote. On December 30, 2012, the <b>full</b> U.S. <b>Senate</b> confirmed Baer in a 64-26 vote, with all votes against him coming from Republicans.|$|R

5|$|Senator Bricker {{introduced}} another proposal {{later in}} the 83rd Congress and proposed similar constitutional amendments in the 84th and 85th Congresses. While hearings were held in the 84th and 85th Congresses, the <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> took no action {{and the idea of}} amending the Constitution was never again seriously considered. In part, this was because the Supreme Court issued rulings that undercut arguments for it, notably in Reid v. Covert.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> {{considered}} Black's nomination. Rumors relating to Black's involvement in the Ku Klux Klan surfaced among the senators, and two Democratic senators tried defeating the nomination. However, no conclusive evidence of Black's involvement was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, the Senate voted 63–16 to confirm Black. Ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black. Alabama Governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife, Dixie B. Graves, to fill Black's vacated seat.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1968, Kennedy {{had joined}} the new Committee for National Health Insurance at the {{invitation}} of its founder, United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther. In May 1970, Reuther died and Senator Ralph Yarborough, chairman of the <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> Labor and Public Welfare Committee and its Health subcommittee, lost his primary election, propelling Kennedy into a leadership role on the issue of national health insurance. Kennedy introduced a bipartisan bill in August 1970 for single-payer universal national health insurance with no cost sharing, paid for by payroll taxes and general federal revenue.|$|E

5|$|Later in 2007, Obama {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges. This amendment passed the <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> in the spring of 2008. He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which has not passed committee; and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.|$|E
5|$|President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Jon Huntsman {{to serve}} as the United States Ambassador to China on May 16, 2009, noting his experience in the region and proficiency in Mandarin Chinese. His nomination was formally delivered to the Senate on July 6, 2009, and on July 23, 2009, he appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which favorably reported his nomination to the <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> on August 4, 2009. On August 7, 2009, the Senate unanimously confirmed Huntsman and he formally resigned as Governor of Utah and was sworn in as Ambassador to China on August 11, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Pritzker was {{nominated}} as United States Secretary of Commerce by President Barack Obama on May2, 2013. To avoid conflicts of interest, Pritzker {{agreed to sell}} her interest in at least 221 companies and resign from 158 entities, including the Hyatt Board of Directors and the Chicago Board of Education. Later that month, on May23, the Senate held its confirmation hearing, which covered a variety of topics. Although Pritzker's family business dealings had been a target of Republican criticism when Obama announced her nomination, only three questions at the hearing related to her family. Pritzker was confirmed by the <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> on June25, {{by a vote of}} 97 to 1. Pritzker was sworn in as Secretary on June26, 2013.|$|E
50|$|In early 2007, Chin was {{appointed}} the United States Executive Director, with rank of ambassador, to the Asian Development Bank following his {{testimony before the}} U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and subsequent action by the <b>full</b> U.S. <b>Senate.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Senate Democratic {{leadership}} {{stated the}} bill {{might be taken}} from committee and brought to a debate before the <b>full</b> <b>Senate,</b> which was possible after March 10, 2009. Following a rally held on February 22, 2009, that opposed the passage of H.B. 444 and in which between 2,000 and 8,000 people participated, a number of Democratic senators became unwilling to {{vote in favor of}} the motion, citing concerns about changing common Senate procedure. The number of senators supporting civil unions was reduced from 18 to 13 out of 25 senators. Supporters held a candlelight vigil attended by 300 to 400 people in support of the bill on March 7, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} {{required a}} Saxbe fix, passed and {{signed into law}} in December 2008. Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, {{a week before the}} Obama inauguration; two days later, the Committee voted 16–1 to approve Clinton. By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal. On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> by a vote of 94–2. Clinton took the oath of office of Secretary of State, resigning from the Senate later that day. She became the first former first lady to serve in the United States Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak was {{appointed}} state Secretary of Education on October 5, 2005, by Governor Ed Rendell, following {{the resignation of}} former Secretary Francis Barnes. He was considered highly regarded by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers involved in education issues. During his Pennsylvania State Senate confirmation hearing in December 2005, Zahorchak said he supported the state's $44million Educational Improvement Tax Credit, which provides tax breaks for businesses that support public education programs and private school scholarships. Zahorchak also said he believed basic education should be the state's primary fiscal educational investment, rather than special education or higher education. The Pennsylvania State Senate Education Committee unanimously approved Zahorchak during his confirmation hearing on December 13, 2005, and the <b>full</b> <b>senate</b> unanimously confirmed him on February 7, 2006.|$|E

5000|$|David Byerman was the 40th Secretary of the Senate for the Nevada Senate. [...] He was {{appointed}} by then-Senate Majority Leader Steven Horsford on August 18, 2010 and was then unanimously elected by the <b>full</b> Nevada <b>Senate</b> on February 7, 2011 and on February 4, 2013.|$|R
5000|$|On October 6, Bork's {{nomination}} was rejected {{in the committee}} by a 9-5 vote.

However, three days later, Bork announced his belief that: ...|$|R
5|$|Although Cooper {{voted in}} favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed {{escalating}} U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale. On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> on recent developments in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he could}} not {{convince}} Congress to outlaw the spoils system, Hayes issued an executive order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics. Chester A. Arthur, the Collector of the Port of New York, and his subordinates Alonzo B. Cornell and George H. Sharpe, all Conkling supporters, refused to obey the president's order. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. He submitted appointments of Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., L. Bradford Prince, and Edwin Merritt—all supporters of Evarts, Conkling's New York rival—to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements. The Senate's Commerce Committee, which Conkling chaired, voted unanimously to reject the nominees, and the <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> rejected Roosevelt and Prince {{by a vote of}} 31–25, confirming Merritt only because Sharpe's term had expired.|$|E
5|$|Brown is {{a member}} of the Republican Party, and faced the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley in the 2010 special election, which had {{occurred}} after the 2009 death of long-time Senator Ted Kennedy for the remainder of Kennedy's term ending January 3, 2013. While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown saw a sudden late surge in the polls and posted a surprise win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. Brown ran for a <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> term in 2012, but lost to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren. He subsequently joined the board of directors of Kadant paper company, joined Fox News as a commentator, and joined Nixon Peabody where he provided legal services.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>full</b> U.S. <b>Senate</b> voted 82-16 for cloture on Johnson's {{nomination}} on February 4, 2010.

5|$|In {{response}} to Majority Leader Gary Hooser's {{statement that he}} intended to bring the bill to a vote before the <b>full</b> <b>Senate,</b> the Hawaii Family Forum stated other issues demanded more attention than civil unions and the bill would create legal challenges for child care and education. The group held demonstrations on Maui and Kauai and stated their intention to hold demonstrations to ask the governor to veto the legislation should the bill advance. Hooser argued for the bill using President Barack Obama's support of civil unions and the support of labor unions and the majority of Hawaii House representatives. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators the bill could lead to a lawsuit to legalize same-sex marriage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii and Supreme Court of Hawaii judge Steven H. Levinson told the legislature that a lawsuit would have little chance of success.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 1861, Crittenden {{tried to}} salvage his plan by recommending to the <b>full</b> <b>Senate</b> {{that it be}} {{submitted}} {{to the people in}} referendum. It was widely believed that a referendum would recommend adoption of Crittenden's plan, and Republicans in Congress used a variety of procedures to prevent a vote on allowing it. On January 16, with procedural delays exhausted, New Hampshire Senator Daniel Clark moved to substitute for Crittenden's plan a resolution stating that constitutional amendments were unnecessary to preserve the Union, and that enforcement of the Constitution and the present laws would eliminate the need for special sectional guarantees. With the senators from southern states (both those that had seceded and those that had not) refusing to vote, Republicans were left with a majority in the chamber and passed Clark's substitute resolution, effectively killing Crittenden's proposal.|$|E

Eisen’s nomination received bipartisan support, including from Republican Senators and conservative foreign policy scholars. The Senate ultimately confirmed Eisen on December 12, 2011.|$|R
