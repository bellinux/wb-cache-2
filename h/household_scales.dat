In this article, analytical target cascading (ATC), a hierarchical optimization methodology, is used to frame a formal optimization model that links marketing {{and engineering}} design decision-making models by defining and coordinating interactions between the two. For complex products, engineering constraints typically restrict the ability to achieve some desirable combinations of product characteristic targets, and the ATC process acts to guide marketing in setting achievable targets while designing feasible products that meet those targets.

40|$|In recent years, {{the scale}} and pace of urban change have been {{associated}} with fine-scale fragmentation of the lifestyles of urban populations. One manifestation of this is that households of diverse means and circumstances may be found living in proximity to one another, particularly in urban areas. In this paper we argue that in these changed circumstances conventional deprivation indicators fail adequately to detect within and between small area variations in socioeconomic and environmental conditions. Using a case study of Bristol, England, we develop an analysis around Gordon and Forrest's Breadline Britain indicator in order to reveal the diversity of economic conditions that exist within wards that might be labelled as either affluent or deprived. We argue that adequate representation of diversity requires a greater sensitivity to difference at fine scales. In this context, we begin to evaluate the claims of marketeers who use commercial sources of data to model incomes at unit postcode and even <b>household</b> <b>scales.</b> We undertake an evaluation of such data and extend their application to calculation of Breadline Britain index scores. The results suggest some potential for using unconventional sources of data to 'freshen up' census information and provide direct, meaningful, measures of deprivation. ...|$|E
40|$|Legally {{inhabited}} indigenous, extractive {{and sustainable}} use tropical forest reserves, have been lauded {{as a solution}} to the intractable problem of how to assure the welfare and secure livelihoods of the world’s diverse forest-dependent people, whilst conserving the world’s most biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems. This strategy has been critiqued by human rights advocates, who assert that legally inhabited reserves paternalistically restrict the livelihood choices and development aspirations of forest-dwellers, and by conservationists, who argue that sustained human presence and resource extraction erodes tropical forest biodiversity. This thesis examines both the anthropogenic impacts on tropical forests at the regional, landscape and <b>household</b> <b>scales</b> and the livelihood challenges faced by semi-subsistence local communities in the Brazilian Amazon. A spatially explicit dataset of 633, 721 rural Amazonian households and an array of anthropogenic and environmental variables were used to examine the extent and distribution of structural (deforestation) and non-structural (hunting) human disturbance adjacent to 45 cul-de-sac rivers across the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Pará. At the landscape and <b>household</b> <b>scales,</b> a total of 383 camera trap deployments, 157 quantitative interviews and 164 GPS deployments were made in the agricultural mosaics and forest areas controlled by 63 semi-subsistence communities in the Médio Juruá and Uatumã regions of Central-Western Brazilian Amazonia, in order to quantify and explicate the (i) livelihood costs incurred through the raiding of staple crops by terrestrial forest vertebrates, (ii) degree of depletion that communities exert upon the assemblage of forest vertebrates and (iii) spatial behaviour of hunting dogs and their masters during simulated hunts. Our results indicate that at the regional scale, accessibility, fluvial or otherwise, modulated the drivers, spatial distribution and amount of anthropogenic forest disturbance. Rural household density was highest in the most accessible portions of rivers and adjacent to rivers close to large urban centres. Unlike the low unipolar disturbance evident adjacent to roadless rivers, road-intersected rivers exhibited higher disturbance at multiple loci. At the household and landscape scales semi-subsistence agriculturalists lost 5. 5 % of their staple crop annually to crop raiders and invested significant resources in lethal and non-lethal strategies to suppress crop raiders, and to avoid losses an order of magnitude higher. Crop raiding was heightened in sparsely settled areas, compounding the economic hardship faced by communities already disadvantaged by isolation from urban centres. A select few harvest-sensitive species were either repelled or depleted by human communities. Diurnal species were detected relatively less frequently in disturbed areas close to communities, but individual species did not shift their activity patterns. Aggregate species biomass was depressed near urban areas rather than communities. Depletion was predicated upon species traits, with large-bodied large-group-living species the worst impacted. Hunting dogs travelled only ~ 13 % farther than their masters. Urban hunters travel significantly farther than rural hunters. Hunting dogs were recognised to have deleterious impacts on wildlife, but were commonly used to defend against crop raiders...|$|E

It provides innovative methodological steps in relation to livelihood assessment to identify the vulnerability of households and communities to drought. This will help to improve drought vulnerability assessments in Ghana and more widely as it shows extra information {{can be obtained from}} local-level vulnerability assessment that may be lacking in national- and regional-level analysis. The research employs quantitative and qualitative data collected through participatory methods, key informant interviews and a questionnaire survey with 270 households across 6 communities in two regions in Ghana. Results show that within the same agroecological zone, households and communities experience different degrees of climate vulnerability. These differences can be largely explained by socioeconomic characteristics such as wealth and gender, as well as access to capital assets. Results identify vulnerable households within resilient communities as well as more resilient households within vulnerable communities. These outliers are studied in detail. It is found that outlier households in vulnerable communities have an array of alternative livelihood options and tend to be socially well connected, enabling them to take advantage of opportunities associated with environmental and economic changes. To sustain and enhance the livelihoods of vulnerable households and communities, policymakers need to identify and facilitate appropriate interventions that foster asset building, improve institutional capacity as well as build social capital...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing body}} of work has {{emphasized}} the importance of residential areas to the overall green infrastructure of cities and recognizes that outcomes related to these areas are best studied using a social-ecological approach. We conducted vegetation surveys to evaluate yard practices that relate to the state of the yard vegetation, including species diversity and abundance, vegetation structure, and the percent of green area of yards versus paved areas, at the Río Piedras watershed within the San Juan metropolitan area. We used concomitant social household surveys to evaluate the association of social-economic and demographic factors at the <b>household</b> <b>scale</b> with these vegetation characteristics, as well as with landscape-level characteristics related to urban morphology and elevation. Our results for this tropical site were consistent with studies elsewhere in that a greater number of social factors at the <b>household</b> <b>scale</b> were more important in explaining the traits related to how green the yards were. On the other hand, we failed to detect the so-called luxury effect on urban vegetation encountered at many sites.

40|$|With growing urban {{populations and}} {{increasing}} {{concerns over the}} {{effects of climate change}} on water supplies, there has recently been a significant amount of interdisciplinary research focused on identifying the drivers of urban water use. Due to unavailability of individual or household level data, these studies are often limited to using spatially aggregated data. There is concern that this aggregation of data may be leading to misrepresentations of the drivers of urban water use, yet there have been few studies that have addressed this concern. As in all spatial quantitative analyses, studies in this area should consider how the spatial scales chosen for analysis are affecting the results.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the chipped stone artifacts found at two Seneca Iroquois sites, excavated by Dr. Kurt Jordan of Cornell University. Both of these sites are located at the northern end of Seneca Lake, in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York. The first of these sites, by historical chronology, is White Springs, occupied from 1688 - 1715, where the Senecas lived in longhouses behind a palisaded wall. The second site, Townley-Read, was occupied from 1715 - 1754, and is one of six sites which represent the dispersed community of New Ganechstage, where residents lived in smaller "short longhouses," as previously described by Jordan (2003, 2008). Conventional wisdom has de-emphasized stone tool use by indigenous peoples following initial European contact, assuming that stone tools are rapidly replaced by functionally-equivalent metal counterparts. At both of these sites, however, the lithic assemblages indicate that there was extensive stone tool use by the Senecas well into the 18 th century, despite two centuries of sustained trade with European colonists. This paper will investigate the ongoing significance of stone tool use in the lives of Seneca people. By using multiple scales of analysis, including diahcronic, regional, and <b>household</b> <b>scales,</b> a more complete view of Seneca stone tool use is produced. Formal stone tool forms at the two sites are rare, and most likely played a secondary role to the use of expedient stone tools. Over 10, 000 pieces of debitage were examined and cataloged with regard to several different variables, including morphology, dorsal flake scarring, and size, in order to provide aggregate statistics for each site and locus. Those few formal tools were also noted and analyzed, as well as the chipped stone tools (gunflints) which were introduced by Europeans. Using this methodology, patterns have been demonstrating variation between the sites and loci, indicating ongoing change and innovation in the assemblages, as reduction patterns were altered and debitage utilization intensified at Townley-Read. These stone tools are discussed in the end with the remainder of artifacts found at the site in order to illuminate the possible reasons for these choices, including as a result of and as a reaction to historical and political-economic developments, such as altered relationships with neighboring cultures and redesigned routes for the fur trade. Functionally equivalent tools made of material classes of European origin provide complementary contextual information, instead of an adversarial acculturative replacement. This serves to remind that stone tools were part of an extremely complex set of historical and socio-economic particulars, and were the product of informed, innovative decisions by the Seneca Iroquois...|$|E
40|$|Sub-Saharan Africa is {{projected}} to be severely affected by climate change {{in the form of}} increased climate variability. Ghana provides a suitable case study country in which to assess the vulnerability of communities to such climate changes. Data on {{the nature and extent of}} vulnerability of Ghana’s food production systems and livelihoods to climate variability (particularly drought) are lacking, and this hampers the development of effective policy to reduce the adverse impacts of climate change and variability. This study aims to enhance empirical understanding of the socioeconomic, institutional and biophysical factors that contribute to vulnerability to climate change and variability amongst a range of farming households and communities in Ghana. By integrating statistical analyses, participatory methods and ecological surveys, this research adopts a multi-scale approach to assess the extent of food production and livelihood vulnerability across multiple scales: mapping vulnerability at the national and regional scales and drilling down to the community and <b>household</b> <b>scales.</b> Results show that the vulnerability of crop production to climate variability (particularly drought) has discernible geographical and socioeconomic patterns, with the Northern, Upper West and Upper East regions being most vulnerable. The results of the drought assessment are used to guide local-level research, and demonstrate the need for region-specific policies to reduce vulnerability and enhance drought preparedness within dryland farming communities. Within the same agro-ecological setting, different communities and households experience different vulnerability attributed to differences in socioeconomic characteristics. Results show that vulnerability of farming households can be linked to access to livelihood capital assets and that vulnerable communities tend to have households that are characterised by low levels of human, natural, financial, physical and social capitals. Findings also demonstrate that small-scale farmers employ a range of on-farm and off-farm adaptation strategies including changing the timing of planting, planting of drought-tolerant and early maturing varieties of crops, livelihood diversification, agro-forestry systems, crop diversification, temporary migration, relying on social networks and reducing food consumption to manage climate variability. A range of challenges including a lack of financial resources, poor access to information on climate adaptation, complex land tenure systems, social-cultural barriers, limited access to improved varieties of crops, as well as a lack of institutional support, constitute serious barriers to adaptation. Policy makers need to formulate specific and targeted climate adaptation policies that a) enable farmers to engage in alternative livelihood diversification strategies; b) promote the development and planting of improved varieties of crops; and c) allow for the provision of institutional support including access to information on climate adaptation and adequate all-year-round extension services. Such policies should be linked to programmes that foster asset building as well as enhance institutional capacity and social capital. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Environmental health’s purview, {{driven by}} an {{accelerating}} transformation of social and ecological systems, has been progressively expanding to encompass a broader array of environment health relationships. This widening perspective embraces persistent, resurgent, and nascent threats to human health that often operate at multiple scales, generating the attributable burdens of the present {{as well as the}} avoidable burdens of the future. Analyzing linkages from the planetary to the individual is a core challenge for evolving environmental health into its “global” incarnation. The complications and uncertainties involved are daunting as causality cascades through multiple scales, prompting global environmental health to expand not only its paradigm but also its toolkit. In this dissertation, I motivate, develop, and demonstrate three such approaches for investigating multiscale drivers of global environmental health: (1) a metric for analyzing contributions and responses to climate change from global to sectoral scales, (2) a framework for unraveling the influence of environmental change on infectious diseases at regional to local scales, and (3) a model for informing the design and evaluation of clean cooking interventions at community to <b>household</b> <b>scales.</b> The full utility of climate debt as an analytical perspective will remain untapped without tools that can be manipulated by a wide range of analysts, including global environmental health researchers. Chapter 2 explains how international natural debt (IND) apportions global radiative forcing from fossil fuel carbon dioxide and methane, the two most significant climate altering pollutants, to individual entities − primarily countries but also subnational states and economic sectors, with even finer scales possible − as a function of unique trajectories of historical emissions, taking into account the quite different radiative efficiencies and atmospheric lifetimes of each pollutant. Owing to its straightforward and transparent derivation, IND can readily operationalize climate debt to consider issues of equity and efficiency and drive scenario exercises that explore the response to climate change at multiple scales. Collectively, the analyses presented in this chapter demonstrate how IND can inform a range of key question on climate change mitigation at multiple scales, compelling environmental health towards an appraisal of the causes and not just the consequences of climate change. The environmental change and infectious disease (EnvID) conceptual framework of Chapter 3 builds on a rich history of prior efforts in epidemiologic theory, environmental science, and mathematical modeling by: (1) articulating a flexible and logical system specification; (2) incorporating transmission groupings linked to public health intervention strategies; (3) emphasizing the intersection of proximal environmental characteristics and transmission cycles; (4) incorporating a matrix formulation to identify knowledge gaps and facilitate an integration of research; and (5) highlighting hypothesis generation amidst dynamic processes. A systems based approach leverages the reality that studies relevant to environmental change and infectious disease are embedded within a wider web of interactions. As scientific understanding advances, the EnvID framework can help integrate the various factors at play in determining environment–disease relationships and the connections between intrinsically multiscale causal networks. In Chapter 4, the coverage effect model functions primarily as a “proof of concept” analysis to address whether the efficacy of a clean cooking technology may be determined by the extent of not only household level use but also community level coverage. Such coverage dependent efficacy, or a “coverage effect,” would transform how interventions are studied and deployed. Ensemble results are consistent with the concept that an appreciable coverage effect from clean cooking interventions can manifest within moderately dense communities. Benefits for users derive largely from direct effects; initially, at low coverage levels, almost exclusively so. Yet, as coverage expands within a user’s community, a coverage effect becomes increasingly beneficial. In contrast, non users, despite also experiencing comparable exposure reductions from community-level intervention use, cannot proportionately benefit because their exposures remain overwhelmingly dominated by household-level use of traditional solid fuel cookstoves. The coverage effect model strengthens the rationale for public health programs and policies to encourage clean cooking technologies with an added incentive to realize high coverage within contiguous areas. The implications of the modeling exercise extend to priorities for data collection, underscoring the importance of outdoor pollution concentrations during, as well as before and/or after, community cooking windows and also routine measurement of ventilation, meteorology, time activity patterns, and cooking practices. The possibility of a coverage effect necessitates appropriate strategies to estimate not only direct effects but also coverage and total effects to avoid impaired conclusions. The specter of accelerating social and ecological change challenges efforts to respond to climate change, re/emerging infectious diseases, and household air pollution. Environmental health possesses a well-established and well-tested repertoire of methods but contending with multiscale drivers of risk requires complementary approaches, as well. Integrating metrics, frameworks, and models − and their insights − into its analytical arsenal can help global environmental health meet the challenges of today and tomorrow...|$|E

This paper outlines a hierarchical urban water use modelling framework for the probabilistic behavioural modelling of urban water use. The top level consists of the main drivers of urban water use, the second level simulates the spatial variability between houses (varying number of people, and varying water use appliances) and the third level simulates the temporal variability of an individual house. The methodology for simulating household indoor water use within this framework is described in this study. This consists of probabilistically simulating water use occurrence and event volumes for different end use categories (shower, washing machine, toilet etc) at minute time steps. The results showed the simulations provided a good match to the observed statistics provided by a detailed end use measurement study (Roberts, 2005) for individual water use events. The simulated aggregated statistics (total daily water use per capita for each end use and the distribution of daily total water use per capita) also provide a good match to the observations. A generic modelling approach has been adopted by separating out the behavioural processes which govern the occurrence of the water use event and the appliance that is used for that event. This has two advantages (1) Provides the potential for the model to be transferred to other regions and utilise local information and (2) Water use scenarios with different rates of uptake of water efficient appliance can be easily simulated. This capability was demonstrated with by providing simulations of water use for two scenarios with varying rates of uptake of water efficient appliances...|$|R

The top level consists of the main drivers of urban water use, the second level simulates the spatial variability between houses (varying number of people, and varying water use appliances) and the third level simulates the temporal variability of an individual house. The methodology for simulating household indoor water use within this framework is described in this study. This consists of probabilistically simulating water use occurrence and event volumes for different end use categories (shower, washing machine, toilet etc) at minute time steps. The results showed the simulations provided a good match to the observed statistics provided by a detailed end use measurement study (Roberts, 2005) for individual water use events. The simulated aggregated statistics (total daily water use per capita for each end use and the distribution of daily total water use per capita) also provide a good match to the observations. A generic modelling approach has been adopted by separating out the behavioural processes which govern the occurrence of the water use event and the appliance that is used for that event. This has two advantages (1) Provides the potential for the model to be transferred to other regions and utilise local information and (2) Water use scenarios with different rates of uptake of water efficient appliance can be easily simulated. This capability was demonstrated with by providing simulations of water use for two scenarios with varying rates of uptake of water efficient appliances. M. A. Thyer, H. Duncan, P. Coombes, G.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThis article {{challenges}} the longstanding trend of much empirical material on ethical consumption originating {{from the global}} North, offering instead rich data on ethical consumption and practices in Chile and Brazil. Drawing on data generated from 32 in-depth focus groups (179 participants in total) in both countries, the article identifies {{similarities and differences between}} these two countries and with the global North. We identify how ethical consumption in Chile and Brazil is conceptualized mainly at two different scales, namely first, the everyday ethics of consumption at <b>household</b> <b>scale</b> and, second, a more global scale of discourse on environmental problems and the negative effects of globalisation. At the <b>household</b> <b>scale,</b> narrative themes include those of prudence, of avoiding overconsumption, family health, and focus on quality. At a more national and international scale, respondents from all classes in both countries discussed labour conditions associated with Chinese imports. Further, particularly university-educated and well-travelled respondents had adopted international environmentalist discourses. Employing a relational geography to discourses, the article calls for research to both include and transcend cross-country comparisons, and binaries of global North and South.

40|$|Urban {{sustainability}} discourse {{promotes the}} increased use of green infrastructure (GI) because of its contribution of important ecosystem services to city dwellers. Under this vision, all urban green spaces, including those at the <b>household</b> <b>scale,</b> are valued for their potential contributions to a city’s social-ecological functioning and associated benefits for human well-being. Understanding how urban residential green spaces have evolved can help improve sustainable urban planning and design, but it requires examining urban processes occurring at multiple scales. The interaction between social structures and ecological structures within the subtropical city of San Juan, the capital and the largest city of Puerto Rico, has been an important focus of study of the San Juan ULTRA (Urban Long-Term Research Area) network, advancing understanding of the city’s vulnerabilities and potential adaptive capacity. Here we provide a synthesis of several social-ecological processes driving residential yard dynamics in the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, through the evaluation of empirical findings related to yard management decisions, yard area, and yard services. We emphasize the role of factors occurring at the <b>household</b> <b>scale.</b> Results are discussed within the context of shrinking cities using an integrated, multi-scalar, social-ecological systems framework, and consider the implications of household green infrastructure for advancing urban sustainability theory...|$|R

40|$|Several recent papers {{report a}} puzzling pattern of food demand falling as {{household}} size rises at constant per capita expenditure, especially in poorer countries. This pattern {{is contrary to}} a widely used model of scale economics. This paper exploits within-country differences in household survey methods and interviewer practices to provide a measurement error interpretation of this puzzle. A comparison of household surveys in Cambodia and Indonesia with the results from Monte Carlo experiments suggest that food expenditure estimates from shorter, less detailed recall surveys have measurement errors that are correlated with household size. These correlated measurement errors contribute to the negative effect of household size on food demand and cause upward bias in Engel estimates of <b>household</b> <b>scale</b> economies.

40|$|<b>Household</b> <b>scale</b> {{economies are}} plausibly {{attributed}} to shared household public goods that make larger households better {{off at the}} same level of per capita resources. Larger households should therefore have higher per capita consumption of private goods, such as food, provided that they do not substitute too much toward the effectively cheaper public goods. The evidence shows exactly the opposite. Data from rich and poor countries indicate that, at constant per capita total expenditure, the per capita demand for food decreases with household size and that it does so most in the poorest countries, where substitution should be the least.
