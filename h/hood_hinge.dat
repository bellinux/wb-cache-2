50|$|In late 1967 (1968 model year), US-spec cars {{received}} several safety additions: a padded fascia (dashboard) with smaller main gauges, collapsible steering column, scissor-type <b>hood</b> <b>hinges,</b> a third windshield wiper, additional side marker lights, and anti-burst door latches. The rear axle gear ratio was increased from 4.22:1 to 3.9:1, giving 16.5 mph for every 1000 rpm. This increased {{final drive ratio}} gave the 1275 model slightly better fuel economy than the 1098 model.|$|R
50|$|In 1937, Willys {{redesigned}} the 4-cylinder model. It {{gained a}} semistreamlined {{body with a}} slanted windshield, headlamps integrally embedded into the fenders, and a one-piece, rounded <b>hood</b> transversely <b>hinged</b> at the rear.|$|R
25|$|One of the {{distinctly}} unusual {{features of}} this car was that unlike most other passenger cars, its <b>hood</b> was <b>hinged</b> in the front thus opening at the passenger compartment, opposite of the conventional setup.|$|R
5000|$|A {{second major}} {{historical}} Beacon Falls business, where many town residents worked over the years, was the Homer D. Bronson Company. In 1884 the company moved to Beacon Falls from Waterbury, Connecticut (known as [...] "the brass {{capital of the}} world"). The Homer D. Bronson Company manufactured a multitude of brass items, specializing in hinges used in industry and homes; automobile <b>hood</b> <b>hinges</b> were a major product. The company survived both the Great Depression and the Flood of 1955. Now named HDB Inc., its present-day website states {{that it has been}} [...] "a leader in the engineered hinge and metal stamping markets since 1839." [...] In 1986 the company moved to Winsted, Connecticut.|$|R
50|$|The {{heavy duty}} K6 and larger use a center <b>hinged</b> {{butterfly}} <b>hood</b> {{rather than the}} rear <b>hinged</b> <b>hood</b> of the smaller trucks.|$|R
5000|$|In {{standard}} form, the Fairlane is 12 in {{shorter than}} a Galaxie, rides on a 3.5 in shorter wheelbase and weighs approximately 700 lb less. Installing the Ford FE V8 {{in a vehicle}} intended for an engine {{no larger than a}} Ford Windsor/Challenger engine required major reworking and relocation of the car's front suspension components and the modification and strengthening of the suspension mounting areas. Fiberglass doors, hood, front fenders and even the front bumper on the earliest cars along with Plexiglas side and rear windows aided in weight reduction; the hood with its distinctive raised [...] "teardrop" [...] ram air scoop designed to draw hot air from the engine compartment was pinned in position, eliminating the need for a <b>hood</b> <b>hinges</b> and a latch. Later cars have aluminum front bumpers in place of the fiberglass units due to racing regulations.|$|R
5000|$|The 2007 Mitsubishi Lancer {{is built}} around Mitsubishi’s {{next-generation}} RISE unibody design (GS platform). The RISE body structure disperses energy loads during side and rear crashes and controls distortion, enhancing occupant protection and also protecting the fuel system during a rear impact. The highly rigid structure makes extensive use of high-tension steel. It features straight [...] "front side members" [...] with an octagonal [...] "cross-section" [...] and a three-leg support structure, as well as increased application of both high-strength (590Mpa) and ultra-high strength (980MPa) steel. Compared to the previous-generation Lancer, torsional rigidity has been increased by 56 percent, and bending rigidity is up by 50 percent. The side pillars, roof joints and cross-car structure increase collision protection. A collapsible front chassis crossmember and a device to help prevent brake-pedal retraction during a collision contribute to better impact energy management. The pedestrian impact protection has also been increased, with new shock-absorbing hood, cowl and fender structures and shock-absorbing <b>hood</b> <b>hinges.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1957, Ford updated the Lifeguard safety {{package with}} a new frame that bowed out to {{completely}} enclose the passengers, rear child-proof door locks, a front <b>hinged</b> <b>hood</b> {{to protect against the}} hood flying up in the wind, and recessed knobs.|$|R
50|$|Like the Sonett I prototype, the Sonett II {{fiberglass}} {{body was}} bolted to a box-type chassis with an added roll-bar {{to support the}} hard top. The entire front <b>hood</b> section <b>hinged</b> forward to allow {{easy access to the}} engine, transmission, and front suspension. Equipped with a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine generating , the Sonett II achieved 0 to 100 km/h (0-62 mph) time of 12.5 seconds, with a top speed of 150 km/h. All Sonett II were left hand drive (LHD).|$|R
50|$|The Renault 4 was {{produced}} for many years, {{but was not}} significantly changed. Exterior chrome trim was eventually phased out on all models, and aluminium grilles were replaced with plastic ones. There were three different dashboard designs. On {{the right side of}} the car at the back the position of the fuel filler was raised by approximately 15 cm (6 inches) less than a year after the car's launch, presumably for safety reasons, but apart from this, changes to the body panels were limited to a slightly altered <b>hood</b> and <b>hinges.</b>|$|R
25|$|The 1986 LeSabre was {{introduced}} {{on the new}} front wheel drive H platform, after departing from rear wheel drive on the GM B platform. Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the Oldsmobile Delta 88 and the 1987 Pontiac Bonneville, which returned to full-size after a short-lived run as a mid-size on the G platform. One {{of the most striking}} features of the LeSabre version of the H-body was the <b>hood</b> was <b>hinged</b> towards the front instead of towards the back near the cowl and windshield in the same fashion as that of the Buick Electra and Chevrolet Corvette of that era.|$|R
5000|$|Under the <b>hood,</b> which <b>hinged</b> forwards, in the European style, the Opala {{originally}} {{offered only}} two engine choices: a [...] straight-four and a 230 cu in (3,764 cc) straight-six. These engine were of traditional {{design for the}} era, with cast iron cylinder block and head, and overhead valves, actuated by pushrods and a camshaft mounted in the block, and pressed-steel rocker arms, whose spherical fulcrum was GM's proprietary design. Fuel was fed from either single or double-barrel carburetors. In 1973 the four cylinder was replaced by Pontiac's [...] "Iron Duke" [...] engine, of generally similar configuration The 3.8 had already {{been replaced by the}} bigger 4.1 (...) in 1971.|$|R
5000|$|The Commodore {{series was}} Hudson's largest model range in its debut year, {{consisting}} of sedans, coupes, and convertibles. Hudson used a forward <b>hinged</b> <b>hood</b> that opened {{from the rear}} by the windshield with {{the front end of}} the hood sliding downward over the grille. Elements of the interior and exterior were styled by Betty Thatcher, [...] "the first woman designer to be employed by a car manufacturer".|$|R
40|$|WP. 29) is {{developing}} a draft global technical regulation (GTR) for pedestrian safety. In order to evaluate the potential effects of the draft GTR on the U. S. fleet, NHTSA’s Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) conducted 88 pedestrian head impact tests on 11 vehicles selected to represent the U. S. fleet, {{with a focus on}} larger passenger vehicles. The goal was to generate an overall picture of current U. S. vehicle performance with respect to specific structures and test zones in order to better understand the potential challenges and benefits of meeting the regulation. The peripheral areas of the head impact test zone defined in the draft GTR produced the most severe impacts, with the most challenging areas being {{in the rear of the}} test zone (in the area of the hinges, cowl, and wiper spindles) and the lateral edges of the test zone adjacent to the fenders. A smaller number of vehicles produced high-severity impacts at the front edge of the test zone. The challenging areas at the periphery of the test zone did not exceed the GTR requirements in every vehicle. Deformable <b>hood</b> <b>hinges</b> with adequate crushable space between the hood panel and fender, coverage of the cowl by the back edge of the hood, and flanges under the fender edge all resulted in significant HIC reductions from those areas in vehicles without these countermeasures. The range of performance in the vehicles tested indicates that while there is room for improvement in current head impact protection in US vehicles, countermeasures exist to improve the worst areas of the test zone. The presence of pedestrian-friendly components in heavier and high-front vehicles shows that design modifications are not limited to smaller vehicles...|$|R
25|$|There {{were three}} Imperial models in this generation. The C-14 was the {{standard}} eight and looked {{much like the}} Chrysler Royal C-18 with a longer hood and cowl. The C-15 was the Imperial Custom and the Town Sedan Limousine, with blind rear quarter panels. This model was available by special order. The third model, C-17, was the designation for the Airflow model. They had a concealed crank for raising the windshield and the <b>hood</b> was <b>hinged</b> at the cowl and opened from the front; side hood panels were released by catches on the inside. An Imperial Custom convertible sedan {{was used as an}} official car at the Indy 500. The car pictured is James G Martin's (retired airline mechanic) 1939 C-24 7 passenger limousine, believed by him and his son Tim to be the only 1939 production 7-passenger limo still on the road.|$|R

5000|$|The car was {{launched}} as a two- or four-door saloon with an all-steel body {{built around a}} central steel frame, which bears a resemblance to a 1949 Ford. The wings were fully integrated into the bodywork, and the passenger cabin filled the full width of the car. At a time when competitor vehicles from Opel and Mercedes Benz were still based on conventional looking prewar designs, the interior width of the Hansa, emphasized by the inclusion of bench seats both at the back and in the front, attracted favourable press comment. The car {{was seen as a}} genuine six-seater. [...] Also noteworthy in 1949 was the separate lid that permitted the boot / trunk to be accessed from outside the car. At the other end, the bonnet / <b>hood</b> was <b>hinged</b> at the side and could be opened from either the left or the right side as necessary. Instead of traditional semaphore style direction indicators, the Hansa featured flashing lights for use as direction indicators, the flashing being replicated within the tri-functional rear lights which included within a single unit rear lights and brake lights along with the US style flashing direction indicators.|$|R
50|$|The Strizh suits were {{constructed}} from olive drab colored nylon canvas with silver trim and lined with rubberized fabric and fitted with connectors for electrical, air and coolant umbilicals. They had an attached pressurized <b>hood</b> with a <b>hinged</b> visor fastened to an anodized aluminum flange. The sleeves had adjustable articulating cables fitted {{in the upper}} arms, while a support sling wrapped from chest to back by means of webbing belts and a metal harness. The gloves were detachable and fitted with rubber fingers and leather palms. The suit also had pleated knee sections. Utility pockets on the suit's thighs were intended to hold survival gear, such as a folding knife, a pistol and other items. A pressure gauge was fitted on the left sleeve and a pressure equalisation valve on the chest.|$|R
5000|$|The new lower design necessitated {{a slight}} hump {{in the cabin}} floor. The stylish new front end, deleted running boards, and {{panoramic}} windshield brought the design more up to date for the later half of the fifties on this, the first all-new design to appear since Ted Ornas {{was put in charge}} of design in 1953. The <b>hood</b> was now <b>hinged</b> in the rear, rather than being a lift-off unit. The parking lights were mounted above the headlights. As with the R- and S-Series trucks, there was a Travelall station wagon version developed from the new range. There were A-100 to A-180 series models available, with Gross Vehicle Weight ratings ranging from 4200 to 33000 lb. A step-side bed remained standard, but a new flush-sided [...] "Bonus Load" [...] bed was an option for the first time. There was also a gold and white two-tone Golden Jubilee Custom Pickup package available, featuring some special equipment.|$|R
50|$|Jowett through Lawrence Pomeroy of The Motor {{joined forces}} with ERA and they persuaded Eberan von Eberhorst, {{formerly}} with Auto Union, to come to England. He joined ERA in Dunstable and, amongst other projected development and chassis work, designed and developed what became the Jupiter's tubular steel chassis. The suspension used soft torsion bars and anti-roll bars front and rear with independent suspension at the front. The engine was mounted very far forward ahead of the front axle line with the radiator low behind it over the gearbox. Adjustment of the anti-roll bars easily influenced oversteer and understeer to provide fine suspension tuning. On this torsionally stiff frame Reg Korner of Jowett put a steel framed aluminium drophead coupé body with a bench seat for three people. Eberan's chassis had been designed for a closed coupé and it proved to require strengthening. The anti-roll bars were abandoned. There was no external access to the boot (trunk) and the bonnet (<b>hood)</b> was rear <b>hinged</b> and opened complete with the wings. These cars were only for export, it was hoped coachbuilders would supply the local market.|$|R
