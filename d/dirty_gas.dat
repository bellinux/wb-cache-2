This analysis, and others by energy experts and business groups, shows there is no economic reason to invest in this technology. New coal power stations are too risky for private investors and too expensive for energy users. A new coal plant would only get built with a government-guaranteed subsidy of around 27 - 44 billion, because: 	New coal stations will need electricity prices up to four times higher than today to earn sufficient revenue; 	They are likely to be obsolete by the time they are built, typically in seven to ten years; 	The power plants under discussion aren’t “clean” - without even more expensive carbon capture and storage, they have higher emissions than the <b>dirtiest</b> <b>gas</b> power plants; 	New coal is incompatible with Australia’s climate commitments, which require no conventional coal in the electricity mix by 2035.

40|$|Fundamental {{concepts}} {{in the theory}} and design of the flooded disc scrubber- a new variable throat orifice contactor are pre-sented. Test data from laboratory, pilot plant, and full scale operations on lime kiln, electric furnace, open hearth, blast furnace, and basic oxygen furnace applications are presented and compared with available data on other scrubbers. Conclusions are that performance on a given problem is primarily a function of power input- thus supporting the correlation concept of Semrau- and that little scale-up factor exists in utilizing pilot plant data {{in the design of}} full scale systems. The flooded disc scrubber is a new variable throat orifice contactor- cyclonic demister which is now operating in some 15 plants and contracted for in some 15 additional plants throughout the United States. Flow capacity of these installations range from approximately 9000 ACFM (actual cubic feet per minute) to over 200, 000 ACFM, and some have been in operation for over four years. Yet no comprehensive treatment of either the basic concepts utilized in the design, or the operating characteristics of this device in actual practice, has appeared in the literature.

50|$|The Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) is a modular {{assault rifle}} {{designed}} {{from the ground}} up with input from U.S. Special Operations Forces. Designed by FN Herstal (FNH) Group headquartered in Liège, Belgium, the SCAR is manufactured at the FN Manufacturing LLC plant in Columbia, South Carolina. The SCAR model range includes the MK 16 Mod 0 (SCAR-Light) chambered in 5.56mm, MK 17 Mod 0 (SCAR-Heavy) chambered in 7.62mm, and an enhanced grenade launcher module (officially referred to as the FN40GL, or Mk 13 Mod 0), which will be able to fire standard 40mm high-explosive dual purpose ammunitions as well as special low velocity (LV) munitions. The SCAR family employ a short-stroke gas-piston system instead of the direct impingement system of the M16/M4 family. This keeps the action of the weapon cleaner as <b>dirty</b> combustion <b>gasses</b> are not returned to the action in order to cycle the weapon, as well as adding the ability to fire the weapon immediately after emerging from the water. This comes at the expense of having a much less suppressible weapon as the piston creates a loud popping sound each time the weapon is fired due to excess gas venting at the piston.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 This report {{investigates the}} use of wood to fuel a trimburner {{incorporated}} in a combined-cycle, biomass-fired power plant. The term "trimburner" applies to a ductburner {{which is designed to}} boost the temperature of the air stream entering the gas turbine. The work presented here {{is part of a larger}} biomass energy project at Oregon State University. Wood conversion processes capable of producing a clean synthetic fuel were investigated since direct wood combustion products are too "dirty" to be allowed to pass through the turbine blading. Of the three wood conversion processes considered (pyrolysis, gasification, methanol production), gasification was selected as the most applicable process for the trimburner concept. Three wood-fueled trimburner systems were then developed employing an up-draft gasifier design. These sub-systems, designated A, B, and C, differ in the way the producer gas formed in the gasifier was compressed to the trimburner operating pressure. Sub-system A compresses the producer gas after the gasifier, thus simulating the operation of an atmospheric gasifier. Sub-systems B and C compress the inlet air entering the gasifier and, therefore, simulate a pressurized gasifer system. Subsystem B accomplishes the inlet air compression via a separate compressor whereas sub-system C bleeds some compressed air from the power plant's main compressor. The simulation of the sub-systems allowed for comparision of the designs in terms of parameters such as efficiency and gas composition. In addition, the effects of changing system variables such as wood moisture content and gasifier air/fuel equivalence ratio on the performance of the sub-systems and the overall system were evaluated. It was determined that the most efficient operation of all the trimburner sub-systems occurred at the lowest allowable operating gasifier equivalence ratio. Also, increasing the wood moisture content decreased the efficiency of the sub-systems. In general, sub-system C exhibited superior subsystem efficiency values by about 2 percentage points over the entire range of equivalence ratios and moisture contents. Also, results for the entire plant indicate that sub-system C again maintains superiority in efficiency by about. 5 percentage points. However, results from the simulation of the sub-systems indicate a basic difference in the producer gas formed from pressurized and non-pressurized gasifiers. The atmospheric gasifier of sub-system A produces a gas higher in combustible gases but lower in temperature as compared to that from the pressurized gasifiers of sub-systems B and C. This indicates that sub-system C (and B) will be much more sensitive to the heat exchanger process used to recover the sensible energy in the <b>dirty</b> producer <b>gas</b> stream than sub-system A. Based on the apparent superiority of sub-system C, a simple economic analysis between this sub-system and a conventional oil-fired trimburner was conducted. Results of this analysis indicated that the oil-fired trimburner would yield a more attractive payback period than the wood-fueled sub-system C trimburner. The payback periods for the oil-fired and wood-fired trimburner systems were estimated at approximately one year and four years respectively...|$|R

In many applications the expander will develop more power than the axial compressor can absorb. A power absorbing source, specifically an electrical generator, converts the mechanical excess power into electrical energy. A review of the mechanical equipment and the electrical generator operating modes and controls is needed so that the process designer and operator will know how the system will respond if process upsets were to occur.

40|$|In {{order to}} reach the highest {{possible}} efficiencies in a coal-fired turbine-based power system, the turbine should be directly fired with the products of coal conversion. Two main types of systems employ these turbines: those based on pressurized fluidized-bed combustors and those based on integrated gasification combined cycles. In both systems, suspended particulates must be cleaned from the gas stream before it enters the turbine so as to prevent fouling and erosion of the turbine blades. To produce the cleanest gas, barrier filters are being developed and are in use in several facilities. Barrier filters are composed of porous, high-temperature materials that allow the hot gas to pass but collect the particulates on the surface. The three main configurations of the barrier filters are candle, cross-flow, and tube filters. Both candle and tube filters have been tested extensively. They are composed of coarsely porous ceramic {{that serves as a}} structural support, overlain with a thin, microporous ceramic layer on the <b>dirty</b> <b>gas</b> side that serves as the primary filter surface. They are highly efficient at removing particulate matter from the gas stream and, because of their ceramic construction, are resistant to gas and ash corrosion. However, ceramics are brittle and individual elements can fail, allowing particulates to pass through the hole left by the filter element and erode the turbine. Preventing all failure of individual ceramic filter elements is not possible at the present state of development of the technology. Therefore, safeguard devices (SGDs) must be employed to prevent the particulates streaming through occasional broken filters from reaching the turbine. However, the SGD must allow for the free passage of gas when it is not activated. Upon breaking of a filter, the SGD must either mechanically close or quickly plug with filter dust to prevent additional dust from reaching the turbine. Production of a dependable rapidly closing autonomous mechanical device at high temperatures in a dusty gas stream is difficult because of problems with materials corrosion, dust leakage, and detection of filter failure. Therefore, the Energy & Environmental Research Center is using its knowledge of the factors that make filter dust sticky at gas filtration temperatures to make a simple and inexpensive SGD that employs an adhesive yet thermodynamically stable coating on a highly porous ceramic substrate. The SGDs are placed on top of individual candle filters at the filtered gas exit. Upon failure of the filter, the <b>dirty</b> <b>gas</b> flows through the SGD where the adhesive surface rapidly and permanently traps dust particles, causing the device to plug and prevent the dust from reaching the turbine...|$|E
30|$|According to Xiao et al. (2006) the {{gasification}} temperature {{plays an}} important role in char gasification. As the bed temperature increases, the carbon conversion during gasification reaction increases by oxidation, Boudouard and water gas shift reaction which shows almost linear relationship. Results of Xiao et al. (2006) are in good agreement with the other authors (Liu et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2011). Corella et al. (2006) have reported that gasification temperature has both the positive effect as well as negative effect on coal gasification reaction. For the high carbon conversion, enhanced gasification rate, high throughput and low tar content in product gases, high gasification temperature (850 – 900  °C) is required. But apart from this while operating gasifier at atmospheric pressure it is taken into consideration that above 750  °C product gases always contain less than 20 % by volume CO 2, therefore there is no CO 2 capture. To capture CO 2 with CaO at atmospheric pressure it is required to operate gasifier at below 750  °C which in turn exceeds the tar content in product gases beyond a limit. Such gasification is called <b>dirty</b> <b>gas</b> and it has no further use in any field. Hence they concluded that there is a confliction for the optimum gasification temperature.|$|E

40|$|Fluidic cat {{crackers}} {{using the}} catalyst regeneration cycle have significant power recovery potential. Typically, the regenerator takes the spent coked catalyst and burns off the coke {{in an air}} pressurized atmosphere. The hot pressurized flue gas, leaving the regenerator section, contains the potential for power conversion from the heat energy and pressure head. Many existing systems recover the heat energy by means of carbon monoxide or waste heat boilers, but fail to utilize the pressure energy which can be recovered {{by the use of}} high temperature, <b>dirty</b> <b>gas</b> expanders. The use of an expander in the regenerator system introduces additional complexity. Analysis of the system operation during "off-design" conditions must be determined in order to properly design and size all turbo machinery and process components. A computer simulation model has been developed which allows the equipment vendor to size the air string components and assist the process designer in the evaluation of the many possible operating conditions. The digital computer model simulates the performance of the axial compressor, power recovery expander, regenerator section, and system pressure drops. The program can simulate the process system design conditions for compatibility with the axial compressor and the power recovery expander. It can predict off-design operation, such as the variation of ambient air inlet temperature and its effect on the compressor-expander power balance. It can test the startup procedures so that component design limitations are not exceeded.

One approach is to replace some of the non-renewable power generation methods, with biomass based combined heat and power generation technologies. The main objective of this study has been to investigate the state-of-the- art in the area of small-scale biomass based combined heat and power generation. Other aims have been to identify proper biomass based CHP technologies for the county of Norrbotten and to make a pre-study of such a plant located in the small community Harads. The technologies investigated were the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), steam engine, gas engine and externally fired gas turbine (EFGT). An economic comparison shows that no one of the considered technologies is economically viable at present Swedish electric prices and green electric certificates. In order to reach profitability the green electricity certificates or the electricity prices must increase with at least 35 €/MWhel. Still if the problem of fouling and corrosion in the externally fired gas turbines heat exchanger is solved in a sufficient way, this technology shows potential for the future due the high electrical efficiency and resulting low cost of electricity. This is also true for the gas engine, which has similar problems with the <b>dirty</b> <b>gas,</b> yet this technology might be more suitable in power ranges higher than 5 MWth.
