40|$|RBG- 45207 Ladies and Gentlemen: In the {{referenced}} letter, EOI requested NRC {{approval of}} a License Amendment Request and asked that NRC consider exigent circumstances associated with the request. The basis for consideration of exigent circumstances relates to the impact that a delay in performing the associated activity (i. e., the heavy load movement) would have on upcoming Refueling Outage 9, scheduled to begin March 4, 2000. Such delays could impact resumption of power from the refueling outage. Additional information on the schedule of activities that must occur prior to the refueling outage to assure reliability of the River Bend Station fuel handling equipment during the outage are provided herein. Enclosed is {{a copy of the}} projected schedule for replacement of the inclined fuel transfer system (IFTS) pool <b>gate</b> <b>seal,</b> as discussed in the referenced letter. This does not account for accelerating the schedule, which could be accomplished if NRC approval is not received by January 10, 2000. However, neither does the schedule account for any contingencies associated with potential delays in conducting the planned work. For example, the work on the IFTS bottom valve does not account for removing the 24 -inch valve if the work cannot be accomplished with the valve installed. Such an activity could extend the schedule by several additional days...|$|E

40|$|Gate {{solidification}} time is {{an important}} topic in injection molding technology, as it determines cycle time, which itself {{is an important}} issue in the economics of the production process. In this work, a study of the effect of both gate and cavity geometries on gate solidification time was conducted, using a commercial polymer, injection molded with constant holding pressure into a rectangular cavity. Three cavity lengths were used, and for each, two cavity thicknesses were adopted. Spe- cial dies containing different gates were assembled in the mold. Gate thickness was found {{to be the most important}} factor determining <b>gate</b> <b>sealing</b> time. However, the cavity geometry is also quite important. A clear indication on gate solidification could be drawn by analyzing time evolution of pressure distribution inside the mold. The solidification phenomenon leading to <b>gate</b> <b>sealing</b> was analyzed by a sim- ple model, which also takes into account the effect of cavity geometry, by compar- ing the heat flow through the gate walls and the energy required to solidify the packing flow rate. Model results satisfactorily describe the main features of the ex- perimental data...|$|R

40|$|The new Folsom Dam Auxiliary Spillway gated Control Structure, {{part of the}} {{overarching}} Joint Federal Project, was recently completed. To make operation and maintenance activities for this activity more user-friendly, this project implemented innovative designs, and a select few related to the tainter <b>gate</b> (<b>seals,</b> dogging system, and anchor inspection access) are presented in this paper. This project also provided additional monitoring capacity to the trunnion anchors, both during and post-construction, both physical and data, with great results. Further, this paper discusses some lessons learned on tainter gate specifications during gate construction and installation. Building and bridge construction specifications were generally used in project specifications; however, there are components on the tainter gate that require special attention, such as ASME tolerances and high strength bolting in connections with multiple thick plies. Additionally, this paper also suggests specification language and practices to better meet the design intent in terms of fabrication and construction tolerances...|$|R

50|$|The Ridge-8th Street subway tunnel {{continues}} south under 8th Street from Market to Locust, {{where it}} turns west and runs under Locust Street to a terminus at 15th-16th Street station; a two-track tail used for layovers extends from 16th to 18th streets. Though this tunnel was also completed in 1932, {{it did not}} open for service until 20 years later; Ridge Spur and Bridge Line trains used it until 1969, when a new DRPA subsidiary, the Port Authority Transit Corporation, began operating the Lindenwold High-Speed Line (PATCO Speedline) through the 8th-Locust subway; at that time, a new single-track terminal for Ridge Spur trains was opened on the upper level of 8th and Market station. The construction of this new single track stub-end terminal was part reason why PTC's Surface Streetcar Trolley Route 47's southern end was converted to bus operations. The track connection between the Ridge Spur Subway Line and the Bridge Line -8th-Locust Streets Subway Line was removed and a <b>gate</b> <b>seals</b> the tunnel opening.

5000|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the Egyptian Al-Ahram Weekly in 2007, Palestinian journalist Khaled Amayreh listed Israeli encroachments on the Al-Aqsa Mosque: In 1977, digging continued and a large ancient tunnel was opened below the women's prayer area. A further tunnel was unearthed under the mosque, going from east to west, in 1979. In addition, in March 1984 the Archaeological Department of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque, endangering the Islamic [...] "Majlis" [...] or council building. Israeli archaeologist Israel Finkelstein, however, asserts that [...] "Palestinian accusations ... that tunnels are being dug under the Al-Aqsa Mosque in order to undermine its foundations, are false. The closest excavation to the mosque is some 70 meters to its south". In 1981, Yehuda Meir Getz, rabbi of the Western Wall, had workmen clear the debris from the gateway of the ancient Warren's Gate. There were allegations the intention of this excavation was to access the innards of the Temple Mount itself from the Western Wall Tunnel. Arabs on the Mount heard banging from one of the more than two dozen cisterns on the Mount. Israeli Government officials, upon being notified of the unauthorized breach, immediately ordered Warren's <b>Gate</b> <b>sealed.</b> The 2,000-year-old stone gate was filled with cement, and remains cemented shut today.|$|R

40|$|From immemorial time, dams {{have contributed}} {{significantly}} for {{the progress of}} civilizations. For this reason, nowadays, there is a vast engineering heritage. Over the years, these infrastructures can present some ordinary maintenance issues associated with their normal operation or with ageing processes. Normally, these problems do not represent an important risk for the structure, {{but they have to}} be attended. To do it, owners of dams have to finance many ordinary interventions. As it is impossible to carry out all of them at the same time, managers {{have to make a decision}} and select the most “important” ones. However, it is not easy because interventions usually have very different natures (for example: repair a bottom outlet, change <b>gates,</b> <b>seal</b> a crack [...] .) and because they cannot use a classical risk analysis for these type of interventions. Authors, who are aware this problem, present, in this paper, a multi-criteria decision-making system to prioritize these interventions with the aim of providing engineers a useful tool, with which they can order the interventions from the most important to the last. To do it, authors have used MIVES. This tool defines the Prioritization Index for the Management of Hydraulic Structures (PIMHS), which assesses, in two indivisible phases, the contribution to sustainability of each intervention. The first phase measures the damage of the dam, and the second one measures the social, environmental and economic impacts. At the end of the paper, it is presented a case of study where some interventions are evaluated with PIMHS...|$|R
