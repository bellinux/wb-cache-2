Studies indicate that maltreatment of children alters their brain development, possibly increasing risk for tobacco use. Previous studies have documented associations between childhood maltreatment and adult health behaviors, demonstrating the influence of adverse experiences on tobacco use. We examined prevalence and associations between adverse childhood experiences and smoking among Nebraskans. Methods We analyzed 2011 Nebraska Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (Adverse Childhood Experience module) data, defining adverse childhood experience exposures as physical, sexual, and verbal abuse (ie, <b>direct</b> <b>exposures),</b> and household dysfunction associated with mental illness, substance abuse, divorce, domestic violence, and living with persons with incarceration histories (ie, environmental exposures). We estimated prevalence of exposures, {{taking into account the}} complex survey design. We used logistic regression with predicted margins to estimate adjusted relative risk for smoking by direct or environmental exposure.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the growing {{theoretical}} literature on cascades of failures in interbank lending networks, empirical results {{seem to suggest that}} networks of <b>direct</b> <b>exposures</b> are not the major channel of financial contagion. In this paper we show that networks of interbank exposures can however significantly amplify contagion due to overlapping portfolios. To illustrate this point, we consider the case of the Austrian interbank network and perform stress tests on it according to different protocols. We consider in particular contagion due to (i) counterparty loss; (ii) roll-over risk; and (iii) overlapping portfolios. We find that the average number of bankruptcies caused by counterparty loss and roll-over risk is fairly small if these contagion mechanisms are considered in isolation. Once portfolio overlaps are also accounted for, however, we observe that the network of direct interbank exposures significantly contributes to systemic risk. Comment: 24 pages, 11 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a dynamical model of distress propagation on complex networks, which we {{apply to the}} study of financial contagion in networks of banks connected to each other by <b>direct</b> <b>exposures.</b> The model that we consider is an extension of the DebtRank algorithm, recently introduced in the literature. The mechanics of distress propagation is very simple: When a bank suffers a loss, distress propagates to its creditors, who in turn suffer losses, and so on. The original DebtRank assumes that losses are propagated linearly between connected banks. Here we relax this assumption and introduce a one-parameter family of non-linear propagation functions. As a case study, we apply this algorithm to a data-set of 183 European banks, and we study how the stability of the system depends on the non-linearity parameter under different stress-test scenarios. We find that the system is characterized by a transition between a regime where small shocks can be amplified and a regime where shocks do not propagate, and that the overall stability of the system increases between 2008 and 2013.

This study's {{objective}} was to quantify the relative contribution of <b>direct,</b> within-household <b>exposure</b> (for example, via contamination of household food, water, or surfaces) to endemic cholera transmission. Quantifying the relative contribution of <b>direct</b> <b>exposure</b> is important for planning effective prevention and control measures. Symptom histories and multiple blood and fecal specimens were prospectively collected from household members of hospital-ascertained cholera cases in Bangladesh from 2001 - 2006. We estimated the probabilities of cholera transmission through 1) <b>direct</b> <b>exposure</b> within the household and 2) contact with community-based sources of infection. The natural history of cholera infection and covariate effects on transmission were considered. Significant direct transmission (p-value< 0. 0001) occurred among 1414 members of 364 households. Fecal shedding of O 1 El Tor Ogawa {{was associated with a}} 4. 9 % (95 % confidence interval: 0. 9 %- 22. 8 %) risk of infection among household contacts through <b>direct</b> <b>exposure</b> during an 11 -day infectious period (mean length). The estimated 11 -day risk of O 1 El Tor Ogawa infection through exposure to community-based sources was 2. 5 % (0. 8 %- 8. 0 %). The corresponding estimated risks for O 1 El Tor Inaba and O 139 infection were 3. 7 % (0. 7 %- 16. 6 %) and 8. 2 % (2. 1 %- 27. 1 %) through <b>direct</b> <b>exposure,</b> and 3. 4 % (1. 7 %- 6. 7 %) and 2. 0 % (0. 5 %- 7. 3 %) through community-based exposure. Children under 5 years-old were at elevated risk of infection. Limitations of the study may have led to an underestimation of the true risk of cholera infection. For instance, available covariate data may have incompletely characterized levels of pre-existing immunity to cholera infection. Transmission via <b>direct</b> <b>exposure</b> occurring outside of the household was not considered. <b>Direct</b> <b>exposure</b> contributes substantially to endemic transmission of symptomatic cholera in an urban setting.

S.) due to direct effects while others (for instance the European region) through positive spillovers from major trading partners. Furthermore, most countries in our sample experience short-run in inflationary pressures as both energy and non-fuel commodity prices increase.

40|$|I {{explore and}} analyze {{a problem of}} finding the {{socially}} optimal capital requirements for financial institutions considering two distinct channels of contagion: <b>direct</b> <b>exposures</b> among the institutions, as represented by a network and fire sales externalities, which reflect the negative price impact of massive liquidation of assets. These two channels amplify shocks from individual financial institutions to the financial {{system as a whole}} and thus increase the risk of joint defaults amongst the interconnected financial institutions; this {{is often referred to as}} systemic risk. In the model, there is a trade-off between reducing systemic risk and raising the capital requirements of the financial institutions. The policymaker considers this trade-off and determines the optimal capital requirements for individual financial institutions. I provide a method for finding and analyzing the optimal capital requirements that can be applied to arbitrary network structures and arbitrary distributions of investment returns. In particular, I first consider a network model consisting only of <b>direct</b> <b>exposures</b> and show that the optimal capital requirements can be found by solving a stochastic linear programming problem. I then extend the analysis to financial networks with default costs and show the optimal capital requirements can be found by solving a stochastic mixed integer programming problem. The computational complexity of this problem poses a challenge, and I develop an iterative algorithm that can be efficiently executed. I show that the iterative algorithm leads to solutions that are nearly optimal by comparing it with lower bounds based on a dual approach. I also show that the iterative algorithm converges to the optimal solution. Finally, I incorporate fire sales externalities into the model. In particular, I am able to extend the analysis of systemic risk and the optimal capital requirements with a single illiquid asset to a model with multiple illiquid assets. The model with multiple illiquid assets incorporates liquidation rules used by the banks. I provide an optimization formulation whose solution provides the equilibrium payments for a given liquidation rule. I further show that the socially optimal capital problem using the ``socially optimal liquidation" and prioritized liquidation rules can be formulated as a convex and convex mixed integer problem, respectively. Finally, I illustrate the results of the methodology on numerical examples and discuss some implications for capital regulation policy and stress testing. Dissertatio...|$|E

40|$|Maternal {{exposure}} {{during pregnancy}} to toxins can occasionally lead to miscarriage and malformation. It is currently thought that toxins {{pass through the}} placental barrier, albeit bilayered in the first trimester, and damage the fetus directly, albeit at low concentration. Here we examined the responses of human embryonic stem (hES) cells in tissue culture to two metals at low concentration. We compared <b>direct</b> <b>exposures</b> with indirect exposures across a bi-layered model of the placenta cell barrier. Direct exposure caused increased DNA damage without apoptosis or a loss of cell number but with some evidence of altered differentiation. Indirect exposure caused increased DNA damage and apoptosis but without loss of pluripotency. This was not caused by metal ions passing through the barrier. Instead the hES cells responded to signalling molecules (including TNF-α) secreted by the barrier cells. This mechanism was dependent on connexin 43 mediated intercellular ‘bystander signalling’ both within and between the trophoblast barrier and the hES colonies. These results highlight key differences between direct and indirect exposure of hES cells across a trophoblast barrier to metal toxins. It offers a theoretical possibility that an indirectly mediated toxicity of hES cells might have biological relevance to fetal development...|$|E
40|$|In {{the turmoil}} of 2007 - 2009, {{troubles}} in a small segment of the US mortgage market escalated into a crisis of global proportions. A striking feature of the crisis is the contagion that hit Asia. In a region where <b>direct</b> <b>exposures</b> to problem mortgages were minimal, credit spreads for major borrowers widened even {{more than they did}} in Europe and the United States. We argue that the contagion was part of an amplification mechanism driven by valuation losses caused by the bursting of a global credit bubble. The valuation losses stemmed not so much from a reassessment of credit risks as from a global repricing of these risks. It was this repricing that was the main channel for contagion into Asian credit (and equity) markets. For empirical evidence, we analyze fluctuations in credit default swap (CDS) spreads and expected default frequencies (EDFs) for major Asian borrowers. We find that valuation losses on CDS contracts for these Asian borrowers arose in part from movements in global and region-specific risk pricing factors as well as from revisions to expected losses from defaults.

40|$|The 2007 – 2009 {{financial}} crisis has {{shed light on}} the significance of systemic risk, and has made the concern about systemic risk increase. Most of the literature on systemic risk measures are about banking, as banks have long been known as a source of systemic risk. In fact, some researchers have provided evidence that the real estate sector is the most important source of systemic risk (Reinhart and Rogoff 2009; Allen and Carletti 2013; Ferrari and Pirovano 2014). However, studies on the real estate sector mainly focus on identifying the determinants of booms and busts in asset and/or real estate prices (Ferrari and Pirovano 2014). Generally, bank portfolios have high exposure to the real estate sector directly or indi-rectly in many countries, such as the USA, Germany and some Asian countries (Martins et al. 2011). Distress in the real estate sector could affect the value of both the <b>direct</b> <b>exposures</b> in property loans and the real estate collaterals of loans, therefore, banks’ performance or risk could change significantly in the case of real estate sector collapse (Wheaton 1999).
