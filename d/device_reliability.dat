50|$|The {{reason for}} a growing {{importance}} of subthreshold conduction is that the supply voltage has continually scaled down, both to reduce the dynamic power consumption of integrated circuits (the power that is consumed when the transistor is switching from an on-state to an off-state, which depends on {{the square of the}} supply voltage), and to keep electric fields inside small devices low, to maintain <b>device</b> <b>reliability.</b> The amount of subthreshold conduction is set by the threshold voltage, which sits between ground and the supply voltage, and so has to be reduced along with the supply voltage. That reduction means less gate voltage swing below threshold to turn the device off, and as subthreshold conduction varies exponentially with gate voltage (see MOSFET: Cut-off Mode), it becomes more and more significant as MOSFETs shrink in size.|$|E

Two categories for mobility enhancing schemes, channel induced strain using Si/SiGe, and hybrid-substrate engineering, with (100) and (110) orientations, will be discussed next. In terms of the <b>device</b> <b>reliability,</b> different mechanisms are responsible for these two different technologies. While we have paid much more attention on the performance of these technologies, the <b>device</b> <b>reliability</b> has not been taken care of in the past studies.

The Strain-Engineering for Mobility Enhancement The interest in the strain engineering has been speed-up in recent years for a need in further scaling of CMOS device for high speed and low power applications. A typical 3 D strain engineering is illustrated in Fig. 1 [1], in which biaxial stress can be achieved by channel [2] or substrate engineering[3]. Uniaxial strain can be achieved by trench isolation, silicide, nitride cap layer, and recessed S/D etc [4]. Depending on process types and device structures, these devices exhibit mobility enhancement with a factor of up to 100 % or even higher over that of conventional process/device structures. 2.
