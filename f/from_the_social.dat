5|$|By {{the end of}} 1936, Aberhart's {{government}} had made no progress towards the promised dividends, leaving many Albertans disillusioned and frustrated. These Albertans included some of Aberhart's own Social Credit MLAs, who had been elected {{on the promise of}} dividends and were angry at Aberhart's failure to follow through. Some of them felt that, while the idea of social credit was sound, Aberhart lacked a real understanding of Douglas's theory and could not implement it. These MLAs wanted Douglas or somebody from his British organization to come to Alberta and deliver on Aberhart's campaign promises. One such MLA, Samuel Barnes, had been expelled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> Credit caucus and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> Credit League for voicing these views.|$|E
5|$|Further {{following}} {{his opposition to}} government intervention, Reagan cut the budgets of non-military programs including Medicaid, food stamps, federal education programs and the EPA.

5|$|Food and cuisine in Ireland {{takes its}} {{influence}} from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until {{the arrival of}} the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing. Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.|$|E
5|$|Historian Katharine Glover {{argues that}} women had less means of public {{participation}} than men {{and that as}} a result piety and an active religious life may have been more important for women <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> elite. Church going played an important part in the lives of many women. Women were largely excluded from the administration of the kirk, but when heads of households voted on the appointment of a new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate.|$|E

The President asked the present government to continue until a new government can be formed, and held talks with the five political parties represented in the Althing.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social Democratic Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters. Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Mesa resigned, {{citing the}} {{pressure}} of Morales and the cocalero road blocks and riots. Amid fears of civil war, Eduardo Rodríguez became President of a transitional government, preparing Bolivia for a general election in December 2005. Hiring the Peruvian Walter Chávez as its campaign manager, the MAS electoral campaign was based on Salvador Allende's successful campaign in the Chilean presidential election, 1970. Measures were implemented to institutionalize the party structure, giving it greater independence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> movement; this was done to allow Morales and other MAS leaders to respond quickly to new developments without the lengthy process of consulting the bases, and to present a more moderate image away from the bases' radicalism. Although he had initially hoped for a female running mate, Morales eventually chose Marxist intellectual Álvaro García Linera as his Vice Presidential candidate, with some Bolivian press speculating as to a romantic relationship between the two. MAS' primary opponent was Jorge Quiroga and his center-right Social and Democratic Power, whose campaign was centered in Santa Cruz and which advocated continued neo-liberal reform; Quiroga accused Morales of promoting the legalization of cocaine and being a puppet for Venezuela.|$|E

5|$|Lowland Scotland {{was part}} of the pattern of late {{marriage}} {{for both men and women}} (between the mid and late 20s), with a relatively large proportion of the population remaining unmarried. In the Highland and Islands marriage ages may have been lower and more closely resembled Gaelic Ireland. Throughout the period, women could legally marry from the age of 12 and boys from 14. However, while many girls <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> elite married in their teens, most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature and the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s. They could also act as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others.|$|E
5|$|Stratton wrote Social Psychology for International Conduct {{for social}} science {{teachers}} {{who wanted to}} use psychology to analyze international affairs. The book's first part evaluated races. Stratton concluded the Caucasoid and Mongoloid races were innately more intelligent enabling them to build strong cultures. He also stated the prejudice of other people was <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> and political advantages it brought. Stratton saw nations as made up of individuals and possessing a national character similar to what individuals had. Reviewing the book in the American Journal of Sociology, Ellsworth Faris objected to the author concluding the Northern and Central Europeans were more intelligent than Southern and Eastern Europeans, noting intelligence measures correlated also with length of stay in America.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of archbishop was usually {{held by a}} scion of nobility, and not necessarily a priest; this widespread practice allowed younger sons of noble houses to find prestigious and financially secure positions without the requirements of priesthood. The archbishop and prince-elector was chosen by the cathedral chapter, the members of which also served as his advisers. As members of a cathedral chapter, they participated in the Mass, or sang the Mass; in addition, they performed other duties as needed. They {{were not required to}} be priests but they could, if they wished, take Holy Orders. As prebendaries, they received stipends from cathedral income; depending on the location and wealth of the cathedral, this could amount to substantial annual income. In the Electorate, the Chapter included 24canons of various social ranks; they each had a place in the choir, based on their rank, which in turn was usually derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> standing of their families.|$|E

5|$|This {{position}} was contested by Andrés Nin {{and some other}} members of the League who did not support the call for a new International. This group prioritised regroupment with other communist oppositions, principally the International Communist Opposition (ICO), linked to the Right Opposition in the Soviet Party, a regroupment which eventually {{led to the formation of}} the International Bureau for Revolutionary Socialist Unity. Trotsky considered those organisations to be centrist. Despite Trotsky, the Spanish section merged with the Spanish section of ICO, forming the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). Trotsky claimed the merger was to be a capitulation to centrism. The Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, a left split <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> Democratic Party of Germany founded in 1931, co-operated with the International Left Opposition briefly in 1933 but soon abandoned the call for a new International.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in England, where kinship was predominately cognatic (derived {{through both}} males and females), in Scotland kinship was agnatic, with {{members of a group}} sharing a (sometimes fictional) common ancestor. Women {{retained}} their original surname at marriage, symbolising that they did not join their husband's kin, and marriages were intended to create friendship between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship. Women could marry from the age of 12 (while for boys it was from 14) and, while many girls <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> elite married in their teens, most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties, by which they accrued resources, status and skills {{that would allow them to}} establish a household. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Highland women, based on the higher birth rate of the Highlands, might have married earlier than their Lowland counterparts.|$|E
5|$|While the inceptive noir, Stranger on the Third Floor, was a B picture {{directed}} by a virtual unknown, {{many of the}} films noir still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with The Maltese Falcon (1941), John Huston followed with Key Largo (1948) and The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), Strangers on a Train (1951) and The Wrong Man (1956). Otto Preminger's success with Laura (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss 20th Century-Fox presentation. Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include Fallen Angel (1945), Whirlpool (1949), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) (all for Fox) and Angel Face (1952). A half-decade after Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend, Billy Wilder made Sunset Boulevard (1950) and Ace in the Hole (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. In a Lonely Place (1950) was Nicholas Ray's breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, They Live by Night (1948) and On Dangerous Ground (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> mainstream.|$|E
