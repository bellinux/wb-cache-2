40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{approach}} for designing a R- 2 R 10 bit Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) {{which could be}} made to operate at low voltage supply by efficiently exploiting the cascaded Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) architecture. The DAC operates at a 3 V power supply with a settling time of 50 - 100 ns, dynamic range of around 50 - 60 dB for signals upto a frequency of 10 Mhz. Graph & simulation results are provided to verify the stability of the Op-Amp used in <b>DAC.</b> Index <b>Terms</b> — Cascaded Op-Amp Topology, DAC I...|$|R
50|$|Deferred Acquisition Costs (<b>DAC)</b> is a <b>term</b> {{commonly}} used in the insurance business. It describes the practice of deferring the cost of acquiring a new customer over {{the duration of the}} insurance contract. Insurance companies face large upfront costs incurred in issuing new business, such as commissions to sales agents, underwriting, bonus interest and other acquisition expenses.|$|R
50|$|The <b>term</b> <b>DAC</b> is {{commonly}} used in contexts that assume that every object has an owner that controls the permissions to access the object, probably because many systems do implement DAC using {{the concept of an}} owner. But the TCSEC definition does not say anything about owners, so technically an access control system doesn't have to have a concept of owner to meet the TCSEC definition of DAC.|$|R
30|$|Current cell {{arrangement}} is very vital {{in the quality}} performance of the DAC. It could be arranged in a matrix shape ranging from 12 lines (one cell in each line) to 1 line. The more are the lines, the more will be the loading effect on the bias circuit. Otherwise, the less are the lines, the more current dividers and hence more transistors will be used. This means the more will be the occupied area and the consumed power. After a long, time-consuming deliberate try, the current source array arrangement shown in Figure 2 proved itself {{to be the best}} arrangement for the sufficiently high performance of the <b>DAC</b> in <b>terms</b> of power consumption, DNL, INL, SFDR, and output response.|$|R
40|$|Multiple-antenna {{systems is}} a key {{technique}} to serve multiple users in future wireless systems. For low energy consumption and hardware complexity we first consider transmit symbols with constant magnitude and then 1 -bit digital-to-analog converters. We propose precoding designs which maximize the minimum distance to the decision threshold at the receiver. The precoding design with 1 -bit DAC corresponds to a discrete optimization problem, which we solve exactly with a branch-and-bound strategy. We alternatively present an approximation based on relaxation. Our {{results show that the}} proposed branch-and-bound approach has polynomial complexity. The proposed methods outperform existing precoding methods with 1 -bit <b>DAC</b> in <b>terms</b> of uncoded bit error rate and sum-rate. The performance loss in comparison to infinite DAC resolution is small. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{controversy}} has surrounded the carbenoid character of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) since their isolation {{nearly two decades}} ago by Arduengo. 1 Indeed, these remarkable compounds, {{as well as other}} diaminocarbenes (<b>DACs),</b> are <b>termed</b> “ylidenes” according to IUPAC nomenclature because of their ylidic reactiv-ity. 2 Traditional carbenes, such as methylene, typically facilitate insertions into unactivated C-H bonds, 3 activate H 2, 4 cyclopro-panate olefins, 5 and form ketenes upon exposure to CO. 6 In contrast, DACs do not facilitate the aforementioned chemical reactions. This disparity is primarily due to the π-donating nature of the amino substituents bonded to the carbene atom, which, in addition to stabilizing the divalent carbon nucleus, renders it nucleophilic. Moreover, DACs do not display reactivities typical of Fischer-type carbenes despite their high propensity to metalate, 2 presumably {{because of a lack of}} electrophilic character. 7 - 9 In fact, as recentl...|$|R
40|$|Historically, the Savannah River Site, {{like many}} Department of Energy sites, has used some {{multiple}} {{of the expected}} Derived Air Concentration (DAC) of a radionuclide as a suspension guide for Radiological Work Permits (RWP) or validation of selected respiratory protection equipment. The <b>term</b> <b>DAC</b> expresses the concentration of a radionuclide in air, typically in mCi/cc. Even though the <b>term</b> <b>DAC</b> is derived from an intake of radioactivity (Annual Limit on Intake) {{that would result in}} defined estimated dose to a worker, knowing only the DAC value does not allow a worker's potential dose to be determined. Recently, the Savannah Rive Site has converted to the use of DAC-hours for RWP suspension guides and respiratory equipment validation. The term DAC-hr takes into account not only the concentration of the radionuclide in air (DAC) but also the time the individual was exposed allowing an estimate of a worker's dose to be determined. The conversion to DAC-hrs resulted in four benefits to the radiation protection program without increasing the risk to workers; (1) consistency with the constant air monitor (CAM) alarm setpoint protocol; (2) consistency with Internal Dosimetry terminology; (3) an a priori determination of the potential risk to a worker; and (4) reduced complexity/error in field calculations. This paper outlines the justification for the conversion to DAC-hrs, the protocols used for field and count room calculations, and the implementation process utilized at the Savannah River Sit...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} China's and Taiwan's humanitarian assistance to Haiti, {{as well as}} the extent to which China and Taiwan – as non-Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors – adhered to the DAC-established humanitarian assistance architecture. It argues that China's and Taiwan's emergency aid was comparable with the <b>DAC</b> donorship in <b>terms</b> of its declaratory commitment to altruism and the pursuit of strategic objectives. Both Beijing and Taipei considered cross-Strait relations and domestic and international public opinion when strategizing emergency aid. The primacy of politics determined a divided China's modalities of aid, funding levels, and institutional framework. The article concludes that strategic considerations – including cross-Strait politics, a suspension of cross-Strait diplomatic rivalry notwithstanding – are at least as significant as altruism in driving China's and Taiwan's humanitarian assistance.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the growth, electronic properties and modification of hydrogenated amorphous carbon films of a thickess range of 50 - 300 nm, which have been deposited using rf plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition. These films may be subdivided into two types according to the electrode on which they are grown and the resulting film properties. These are polymer-like amorphous carbon or PAC, and diamond-like amorphous carbon or DAC. PAC possesses a wide optical band gap (2. 7 eV), high resistivity (1014 - 10 15 Ocm) and low density of paramagnetic defects (~ 10 17 spins cm- 3). The dominant current transport mechanism at room temperature has been observed to be hopping conduction at low electric fields and space-charge-limited current at high electric fields. The addition of nitrogen gas to the plasma to incorporate nitrogen within the film has been shown to move the Fermi level by 1 eV, towards midgap. A mechanism of doping due to the introduction of aromatic nitrogen-containing sites has been postulated. The boron, carbon and nitrogen ion implantation of PAC has resulted in the controllable increase in conductivity from 1015 to 106 O cm as a function of ion dose, from 2 x 1012 to 2 X 1016 ions cm- 2. At low ion doses (up to 6 x 1014 ions cm- 2) this occurs without any change in band gap; however, at higher doses the band gap collapses as a result of graphitisation. The dependence on the implant ion shows {{that it is possible to}} move the Fermi level towards the valence band with the implantation of boron, and towards midgap with the implantation of nitrogen. A hysteresis effect is observed at intermediate ion doses, which is attributed to the trapping of holes resulting in an increase in electron current. Implanting part of the thickness of the film at this ion dose has resulted in rectification, which has not previously been reported for this type of structure in amorphous carbon. DAC has been shown to possess a smaller band gap (0. 7 eV), higher density of defects (~ 1020 spins cm- 3) and lower resistivity (~ 1013 O cm) than PAC. The room-temperature current transport is governed by band-tail conduction at fields below 105 V cm- 1, and the Poole-Frenkel effect at higher fields. The addition of nitrogen of up to 8 at. % has been observed to increase the band gap from 0. 7 to 1. 0 eV and therefore decrease the magnitude of the Poole-Frenkel conductivity. The Fermi level remains pinned at midgap, however. Therefore, it appears that PAC shows advantages over <b>DAC</b> in <b>terms</b> of future device applications...|$|R
40|$|The United States has a {{substantial}} impact on promoting {{economic growth and}} reducing poverty in developing countries due to the large size of its economy, its ability to influence world opinion and action and its weight within the international donor community. In 2001 the United States was the largest donor in the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (<b>DAC)</b> in volume <b>terms,</b> reporting net official development assistance (ODA) of USD 10. 9 billion, more than one-fifth of the DAC total. This represented 0. 11 % of its gross national income (GNI), the lowest ODA/GNI ratio in the DAC and below the DAC average country effort of 0. 40 %. President Bush recently announced a bold new proposal, the “Millennium Challenge Account” (MCA) for an additional USD 5 billion annually by 2006. If approved by Congress, the MCA will consolidate the American position as the largest donor, and slightly improve the country’s ODA/GNI performance. The American “checks and balances” system of government has some important ramifications for United States development co-operation. This approach implicates {{a wide range of}} stakeholders in budget decision-making, especially through the Congress. Flexible approaches to compromise are standard features of the American system, especially for issues of a short-term nature that respond to national or special interests. Addressing long-term issues related to development co-operation can prove more difficult because they lack urgency or a sufficiently strong and influential domestic constituency. Several of the issues raised in the 1998 DAC Peer Review are being addressed by the current Administration. However, some important development issues, including those relating to Congress, to the basic structure of American aid administration, or to the promotion of policy coherence for development, have proven more resistant to change and are noted again in this review [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} study, drivers 2 ̆ 7 preferences of {{and responses to}} text and graphic road sign messages at work zones were analyzed {{in an attempt to}} reduce the bottleneck conditions at lane-reduced work zones. A particular emphasis was placed on zip merging, an application of alternate vehicle merging already successfully employed in the Czech Republic and other nations, that eliminates the perceived right-of-way held by drivers in the open lane(s) at merge points. Both experimental and currently existing advisory messages were to be evaluated and compared for effectiveness in this study. These advisory messages, associated with three driving advisory conditions (DACs), 2 ̆ 2 Merge to the Right Lane, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Zip Merge 2 ̆ 2 (vehicles take turns), and 2 ̆ 2 Continue Travel Normally, 2 ̆ 2 were assessed through a questionnaire survey, driving simulation and traffic study to seek the best messages in advising drivers in different traffic conditions when approaching work zones. ^ A questionnaire survey was first deployed to identify participants 2 ̆ 7 preferences towards a series of messages posted on variable message signs (VMSs). Participants rated each message from one to five as to their effectiveness in advising drivers in different conditions. Between the highest rated text and graphic messages under each DAC, participants gave their preferences toward either text or graphic messages. A total of 81 subjects participated in the survey. Survey results indicated that text messages were preferred at a 4 : 1 ratio over graphic messages, where the Zip Merge text sign messages were the least preferred of any combination of DAC and message type. ^ The effectiveness of several top rated messages identified in the survey was further assessed through a driving simulation. Various text and graphic messages were posted on portable VMSs along a straight freeway in a fix-based driving simulator. Subjects were asked to verbally respond with a number when they identified a message, denoting the DAC associated with that message. It was found that graphic messages were most effective in all three <b>DACs</b> in <b>terms</b> of response time and accuracy, where the Zip Merge graphic messages elicited among the fastest and most accurate responses. ^ Through regression and analysis of variance models, the questionnaire and driving simulation results show a public bias towards text sign messages, especially those which are currently being used in lane-reduced work zone setups, that is not supported through drivers 2 ̆ 7 responses to messages. While the survey offered the conclusion that drivers prefer to be advised by text sign messages using wording familiar to them, the driving simulation displayed the power of graphic messages to elicit more quick and accurate responses when compared with text. The combination of drivers 2 ̆ 7 not in favor of Zip Merge text sign messages and their positive response to Zip Merge graphics shows a clear recommendation to use graphic messages in any future field test at work zones. A field study was planned but not carried out in this study due to constant mechanical setbacks with a portable Dynamic Lane Merge System (DLMS) unit obtained from the Czech Republic. ...|$|R
