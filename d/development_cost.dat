5|$|With condo prices {{set from}} US$500,000 to US$2,000,000, many critics {{have noted that}} the One Rincon Hill complex is too {{expensive}} for most San Franciscans. With the total initial <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> of US$290 million, the average <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> per unit with 709 units total is approximately US$409,000. However, the developer Urban West Associates has contributed a total of US$38.5 million to funds like the South of Market Community Stabilization Fund {{in order to address}} this concern.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, {{development}} of the longer range 747-400 began. The variant had a new glass cockpit, which allowed for a cockpit crew of two instead of three, new engines, lighter construction materials, and a redesigned interior. <b>Development</b> <b>cost</b> soared, and production delays occurred as new technologies were incorporated {{at the request of}} airlines. Insufficient workforce experience and reliance on overtime contributed to early production problems on the 747-400. The -400 entered service in 1989.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{there was}} an {{intention}} to procure up to 400 aircraft for the Royal Navy and the RAF, but the <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> for the changes to accommodate the Spey turbofans meant that the per-unit price eventually ended up three times the price of an F-4J. Because the government then had a policy of negotiating fixed-price contracts, these costs could not be evened out by a large production run, which left the total order at 170.|$|E
5|$|The {{order was}} placed with ABB Strømmen and AEG in August 1991. The high <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> was subsidised by the Norwegian government, {{who saw the}} project as {{potentially}} establishing a new industrial export product. Electrical components were built by AEG in Berlin, while the bogies were built by MAN in Nuremberg. The bodywork was built at Strømmen, with profiles from Alusuisse, and the trains were assembled in Strømmen.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, American bombers {{such as the}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Boeing B-29 Superfortress were {{protected}} by long-range escort fighters such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and North American P-51 Mustang. These fighters could not match {{the range of the}} Northrop B-35 or Convair B-36, the next generation of bombers developed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> for longer-ranged fighters was high, while aerial refueling was still considered risky and technologically difficult. Pilot fatigue had also been a problem during long fighter escort missions in Europe and the Pacific, giving further impetus to innovative approaches.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the economic effects of capitalizing <b>development</b> <b>costs</b> during a race between two firms {{to discover and}} develop a new technology. Winning the race requires success in the research stage and success in the <b>development</b> stage. <b>Development</b> <b>costs</b> are expensed in some settings, but capitalized in others. Capitalization of <b>development</b> <b>costs</b> provides a credible signal regarding progress in the race, allowing the rival to make a more informed decision regarding whether to proceed with development. We {{study the effects of}} this signal on the firms’ investment decisions and social welfare. We show that if both firms capitalize instead of expense <b>development</b> <b>costs,</b> aggregate investment in research weakly increases but aggregate investment in development weakly decreases. We also characterize the accounting policies that the two rival firms would adopt if they could freely choose either an expensing policy or a capitalization policy...|$|R

5|$|Prior to 2008, {{the project}} had been {{estimated}} {{at a total}} cost of $3.1 billion USD, however the revised project has an estimated cost of $1 billion USD (The difference in estimates partially {{due to differences in}} previous tunnel designs). Financial closing on the project was reached in October, 2009. Miami-Dade County allegedly contributed $402 million, the city of Miami $50 million, and the state $650 million to build, operate and maintain it. Those contributions are spread during construction and operation of the tunnel project. During construction, 90% of the funds are provided by the private sector. Of the estimated one billion dollar total project cost, 607 million it said to go to design and construction, 195.1 million to financing, 59.6 million to insurance and maintenance during construction, 41.2 million to reserves, and 209.8 million for state <b>development</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E
5|$|The new Ibrox had a {{capacity}} of 44,000 and was opened with an Old Firm game played on 19 September 1981. By this time, however, the <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> had risen to £10 million, which depleted the club financially. This resulted in a difficult period {{in the history of}} Rangers, as the average attendance fell to 17,500 in the 1981–82 season, including a crowd of only 4,500 for a game against St Mirren. The redeveloped stadium was partly blamed for this, as some fans felt that the new ground lacked atmosphere due to the spaces between the stands. This was during a period of low attendances in Scottish football in general. Despite the relatively low attendance at Ibrox, Rangers had the highest average home attendances in the Premier Division in both 1983–84 and 1984–85.|$|E

40|$|In {{a rapidly}} {{changing}} business environment, successful enterprises are becoming more innovative and increasing resources are allocated to {{research and development of}} new ideas, products, processes, services and systems. Consequently, the disclosure of information on research and <b>development</b> <b>costs</b> in the financial statements of enterprises is becoming more important to the users of these statements. The aim {{of this study is to}} establish the extent to which South African listed companies disclose information on research and <b>development</b> <b>costs</b> in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice in their financial statements. The report of the Foundation for Research Development (1997) on, Innovation Patterns in South African Manufacturing Firms, is used to identify the South African listed companies that are involved in research and development. The information in this report is compared to the financial statements of the selected companies for the financial years ending from 1994 to 1997. The study found that the financial statements of the companies in the sample in 1994 did not provide the information on research and <b>development</b> <b>costs</b> required by AC 122. In subsequent years (1995 - 1997) the companies disclosed more of the information on research and <b>development</b> <b>costs</b> required by the statement.

25|$|Seven early customers, namely British Airways, Cathay Pacific, KLM, Lufthansa, Northwest, Qantas, and Singapore Airlines, {{formed a}} consultative group to advise Boeing on the 747-400's design process. While the {{aircraft}} was planned as a new-technology upgrade, Boeing originally proposed minimal design changes {{in order to}} reduce <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> and retain commonality with existing models. The airline consultative group sought more advanced changes, including a two-crew glass cockpit. As a result of airline input, the 747-400's new digital cockpit design featured a hybrid of the cathode-ray tube (CRT) display technologies first employed on the 757 and 767, along with carry-over 747 systems such as its autopilot.|$|E
25|$|The {{design change}} imposed a two-year delay into the {{original}} timetable and increased development costs from US$5.3billion (€5.5B) to approximately US$10billion (€9.7B). The total <b>development</b> <b>cost</b> for the A350 {{was estimated at}} US$15billion by Reuters (€12billion or £10billion). The original mid-2013 delivery date of the A350 changed, as a longer than anticipated development forced Airbus to delay the final assembly and first flight of the aircraft to {{the third quarter of}} 2012 and second quarter of 2013 respectively. As a result, the flight test schedule was compressed from the original 15 months to 12 months. A350 programme chief Didier Evrard stressed that delays only affect the A350-900 while the -800 and -1000 schedules remain unchanged.|$|E
