Farther north, the business loop passes {{the eastern end of}} the Rogers City Airport and turns northwesterly, parallel to, but inland from, the Lake Huron shoreline. Now following 3rd Street, Bus. US23 runs through a residential area on the southern side of town before entering downtown. At the intersection with Erie Street, Bus.

5|$|Caroline Street is {{situated}} along the northwestern {{side of the}} island, in an historic district known as Old Town Key West. Part of the district, roughly defined as the area between Caroline Street and Angela Streets (which run parallel about <b>four</b> <b>blocks</b> apart), harbors many old houses, some of which belonged to famous writers and other influential persons. For example, the Dr. Joseph Y. Porter House at 429 Caroline Street was home to the first public health inspector {{in the state of}} Florida. The Porter House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Many of the houses in the area have been converted into inns; the Curry Mansion Inn at the corner of Caroline and Ann streets was originally built in 1855 for the Currys, a prominent local family. At Caroline Street's southern terminus across from the Presidential Gates is the Airways Building, which served as the original Pan American World Airways office during its formation in 1927.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of Avon, West Main feeds into Park Place, a large traffic circle {{providing}} access to two local streets from US20 and NY5. The routes follow the circle counterclockwise, departing the roundabout on East Main Street. The street proceeds east, passing through <b>four</b> <b>blocks</b> of densely populated neighborhoods before exiting the village and abruptly entering vast, barren fields to the east. US20 and NY5, now named Avon–Lima Road, intersects NY15 two miles (3km) to the east in East Avon, a community based around the intersection and the streets comprising it, and connects to I-390 at exit10 a half-mile from NY15. Continuing on, the road intersects a number of county routes {{over the next four}} miles (6km) before becoming West Main Street once more, this time for the village of Lima. At an intersection with NY15A in the village center, US20 and NY5 become East Main Street, retaining the name to the Ontario County line at Honeoye Creek.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>four</b> <b>block</b> {{problem is}} a {{generalization}} of Nehari's problem for matrix functions. It {{plays an important role}} inH∞-optimal control theory. It is well known that Nehari's problem for a continuous scalar function has a unique solution. However, in the matrix case the situation is quite different. V. V. Peller and N. J. Young (1994,J. Funct. Anal. 120, 300 – 343) studiedsuperoptimal solutionsof Nehari's problem. They minimize not only theL∞-norm of the corresponding matrix function but also the essential suprema of all further singular values. It was shown that forH∞+Cmatrix functions Nehari's problem has a unique superoptimal solution. In this paper we study superoptimal solutions of the <b>four</b> <b>block</b> problem and we find a natural condition under which such a superoptimal solution is unique. Our result is new even in the case of Nehari's problem. We study some related problems such as thematic factorizations, invariance of indices, and inequalities between the singular values of the <b>four</b> <b>block</b> operator and the superoptimal singular values...|$|R

5|$|M-88 {{starts in}} the {{community}} of Eastport at an intersection <b>four</b> <b>blocks</b> east of the Grand Traverse Bay of Lake Michigan next to Barnes County Park. From its start, it runs east along the northern end of Torch Lake. M-88 zig-zags south and east along Scenic Highway to the community of Central Lake. In Central Lake it runs south along Main Street, following the western shore of Intermediate Lake. South of Intermediate Lake, M-88 crosses the Intermediate River on a historic designation-eligible Depression-era bridge along Bridge Street in Bellaire. This section of M-88 is just west of the Antrim County Airport before the highway turns east on Cayuga Street in downtown and south on Division Street. The Bellaire section of the trunkline is the location of the highest traffic levels along the highway. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) measures the annual average daily traffic (AADT) in traffic surveys. The 2007 survey showed that 5,200vehicles used the section of roadway on the average day in Bellaire.|$|E
5|$|MD7 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US40 {{just west of}} Havre de Grace.

The route heads through the Havre de Grace Historic District, passing through a residential area about <b>four</b> <b>blocks</b> from the Susquehanna River waterfront through Congress Street, where the highway begins to approach the waterfront. Immediately after passing under the Amtrak Susquehanna River Bridge, MD7 turns west onto Otsego Street.

5|$|Old Business Spur I-96 (Old BS I-96) is {{the section}} of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I-96 and the {{intersection}} with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in downtown Detroit and an unsigned state trunkline highway. It was previously a business spur of I-96. Picking up where M-5 ends at the interchange with I-96, Old BS I-96 follows Grand River Avenue southeasterly. The road itself is bounded by businesses as it passes through residential neighborhoods on Detroit's West Side. About a mile and three-quarters (2.8km) along, the highway crosses I-96 again, and I-96 from here into the downtown area parallels Grand River Avenue. Old BS I-96 here is mostly residential. It passes Bishop Park near Grand Boulevard and then crosses I-94. In the North Corktown neighborhood, Grand River Avenue crosses M-10 (Lodge Freeway) near the MotorCity Casino. About a half mile (0.7km) past M-10, Old BS I-96 crosses I-75 (Fisher Freeway) and enters Downtown Detroit's Foxtown neighborhood.
