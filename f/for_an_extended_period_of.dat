5|$|Easy is {{the most}} recent major {{hurricane}} to strike the Homosassa, Florida, area. Due to the hurricane remaining near the northwest Florida coast <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, Easy produced severe rainfall and strong waves, resulting in heavy damage in the Cedar Key area. Hurricane Easy {{was one of two}} major hurricanes to strike Florida during the year; the other was Hurricane King which affected Miami.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{designation}} as {{a tropical}} disturbance, the predecessor to Cyclone Bejisa dropped heavy rainfall across the Seychelles. A weather station on Mahé observed 164mm (6.46in) of rain over a 24-hour period beginning on December27. The Farquhar Group were particularly affected, as the storm's incipient central region of convection remained {{over the area}} <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|E
5|$|After his {{athletic}} career, Thorpe struggled {{to provide for}} his family. He {{found it difficult to}} work a non-sports-related job and never held a job <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. During the Great Depression in particular, he had various jobs, among others as an extra for several movies, usually playing an American Indian chief in Westerns. He also worked as a construction worker, a doorman (bouncer), a security guard and a ditch digger, and briefly joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1945. Thorpe was a chronic alcoholic during his later life.|$|E
5|$|Five people drowned {{after their}} cars were {{swept away by}} floodwaters while trying to cross a flooded stream. The floods also damaged 4,000-6,000 homes and {{buildings}} and significantly disrupted water and communications <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. The hurricane's storm surge damaged many boats and yachts in ports along the peninsula's coast, most of them beyond repair. Minor beach erosion was reported at San Felipe, Baja California. As a result, the Baja California Sur municipalities of La Paz, Los Cabos, Loreto, Comondú, and Mulegé were declared national disaster areas. 6,000 people were affected and total damage from the storm was $100 million.|$|E

5|$|Following Jor-El's coordinates, {{the ship}} crash lands on Earth in Smallville, Kansas. A childless couple, Jonathan and Martha Kent, find Kal-El and raise him as their own, naming him Clark. Clark {{eventually}} becomes an isolated young {{man as a}} result of developing superhuman powers. He then learns his true origins from Jonathan, who urges him to keep his powers hidden. Several years later, Jonathan dies in a tornado while refusing to let Clark rescue him. Burdened with guilt and looking for a new purpose in his life, Clark leaves to travel the world <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time under several disguises.|$|E
5|$|The season's first {{storm had}} limited {{reported}} impacts on land, {{and the subsequent}} system caused more severe damage in southern Texas and northern Mexico. Hurricane Three dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico before striking the same region as the previous cyclone. Hurricane Four bypassed Bermuda to the east, where some property damage was reported. Hurricane Five was the most catastrophic storm of the season, buffeting western Cuba <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time as it slowly executed a counterclockwise loop. Death tolls from the hurricane are estimated in the hundreds.|$|E
5|$|Across Honduras, {{agriculture}} sustained serious damage, with initial {{estimates of}} 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of covered <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. This washed away {{large areas of}} topsoil, which would take {{a long period of}} time to recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover. Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} 1982 to 1991, Godwin {{produced}} another {{collection of short}} fiction and four more novels. According to Publishers Weekly, it was A Mother and Two Daughters (1982) and A Southern Family (1987) that substantially expanded her readership. These novels remained on bestseller lists <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. Godwin's earlier works had sold an average of less than 8,000 copies, while A Mother and Two Daughters sold more than 1.5 million. It {{was the most popular}} of Godwin's early works and {{the first time she had}} written a narrative from the point-of-view of multiple characters. In 1987, Godwin was awarded the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for her work on The Southern Family.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Juan {{remained}} at peak intensity for over 24hours. After moving northwestward <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, it turned and accelerated to the north. The eye became less distinct on September28, and the hurricane weakened slightly. Due to its fast forward motion, Juan {{had little time}} to weaken over significantly colder waters before making landfall between Shad Bay and Prospect (near Halifax) on September29 with winds of 100mph (160km/h). It weakened quickly while rapidly moving across the southern Canadian Maritimes and crossing the Nova Scotia peninsula as a hurricane. Juan had diminished to a tropical storm as it moved over Prince Edward Island by early September29. Later that afternoon, the storm was absorbed by a large extratropical low over the northwestern Gulf of Saint Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, {{the city}} council decided that a branch was to be built during {{construction}} at Nørrebro, to allow a future branch line from the City Circle Line towards Brønshøj. The {{first part of this}} line was intended to be constructed {{at the same time as}} the City Circle Line, to avoid a multitude-higher construction cost and long interruptions of operations later. This did not involve a final decision, only an option for future construction. The Herlev/Brønshøj line was ultimately dropped as the City of Copenhagen withdrew its share of the cost of the Nørrebro branch chamber in its 2009 budget, and the state refused to continue the project. Any branch to the Herlev / Brønshøj region would now require a shutdown of the City Circle Line <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|E

5|$|Iniki's {{high winds}} also downed 26.5% of the island's {{transmission}} poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800mile (1300km) distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within {{four weeks of}} Iniki, while other areas were without power {{for up to three}} months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{complications}} kept Ebert {{off the air}} <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. Ebert {{made his}} first public appearance since mid-2006 at Ebertfest on April 25, 2007. He was unable to speak, instead communicating through his wife. He returned to reviewing on May 18, 2007, when three of his reviews were published in print. In July 2007, he revealed {{that he was still}} unable to speak. Ebert adopted a computerized voice system to communicate, eventually using a copy of his own voice created from his recordings by CereProc. In March 2010, his health trials and new computerized voice were featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Ebert later proposed a test to determine the realism of a synthesized voice.|$|E
5|$|The last {{semifinal}} {{match between}} LAX, accompanied by Guerrero and Salinas, and Styles and Super Eric. During the bout, Hernandez lifted Super Eric {{and held him}} upside-down vertically <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time before slamming him back-first into the mat with a delayed vertical suplex. Later, Styles held Homicide in a small package pin attempt until Salinas distracted the referee, allowing Guerrero to enter the ring and readjust Styles and Homicide to make the pin in LAX's favor. Afterwards, the referee counted the pin, giving LAX the win at seven minutes and forty seconds, although Styles' shoulders were clearly not fully against the mat.|$|E
