5|$|Due to <b>erotomania,</b> Hinckley's {{motivation}} for the attack was born of his obsession with actress Jodie Foster. While living in Hollywood in the late 1970s, he saw the film Taxi Driver at least 15 times, apparently identifying strongly with Travis Bickle, the lead character portrayed by Robert De Niro. The arc of the story involves Bickle's attempts to protect a 12-year-old child prostitute, played by Foster. Toward {{the end of the}} film, Bickle attempts to assassinate a United States Senator who is running for president. Over the following years, Hinckley trailed Foster around the country, {{going so far as to}} enroll in a writing course at Yale University in 1980 after reading in People magazine that she was a student there. He wrote numerous letters and notes to her in late 1980. He called her twice and refused to give up when she indicated that she was not interested in him.|$|E
2500|$|Sexual addiction, {{also known}} as sex addiction, is a state {{characterized}} by compulsive participation or engagement in sexual activity, particularly sexual intercourse, despite negative consequences. [...] The term sexual dependence {{is also used to}} refer to people who report being unable to control their sexual urges, behaviors, or thoughts. Related models of pathological sexual behavior include hypersexuality (nymphomania and satyriasis), <b>erotomania,</b> Don Juanism (or Don Juanitaism), and paraphilia-related disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Gender structured, too, {{the early}} modern {{understanding}} {{of the distinction between}} Hamlet's madness and Ophelia's: melancholy was understood as a male disease of the intellect, while Ophelia would have been understood as suffering from <b>erotomania,</b> a malady conceived in biological and emotional terms. This discourse of female madness influenced Ophelia's representation on stage from the 1660s, when the appearance of actresses in the English theatres first began to introduce [...] "new meanings and subversive tensions" [...] into the role: [...] "the most celebrated of the actresses who played Ophelia were those whom rumor credited with disappointments in love". Showalter relates a theatrical anecdote that vividly captures this sense of overlap between a performer's identity and the role she plays: ...|$|E
60|$|But {{nowadays}} {{we cannot}} depend on these safeguards, {{such as they}} were. We no longer have large families: all the families {{are too small to}} give the children the necessary social training. The Roman father is out of fashion; and the whip and the cane are becoming discredited, not so much by the old arguments against corporal punishment (sound as these were) as by the gradual wearing away of the veil from the fact that flogging is a form of debauchery. The advocate of flogging as a punishment is now exposed to very disagreeable suspicions; and ever since Rousseau rose to the effort of making a certain very ridiculous confession on the subject, there has been a growing perception that child whipping, even for the children themselves, is not always the innocent and high-minded practice it professes to be. At all events there is no getting away from the facts that families are smaller than they used to be, and that passions which formerly took effect in tyranny have been largely diverted into sentimentality. And though a little sentimentality may be a very good thing, chronic sentimentality is a horror, more dangerous, because more possible, than the <b>erotomania</b> which we all condemn when we are not thoughtlessly glorifying it as the ideal married state.|$|E
50|$|<b>Erotomania</b> is {{also called}} de Clérambault's syndrome, after French {{psychiatrist}} Gaëtan Gatian de Clérambault (1872-1934), who published {{a comprehensive review}} paper on the subject (Les Psychoses Passionnelles) in 1921. The term <b>erotomania</b> is often mistakenly confused with obsessive love, obsession with unrequited love, or hypersexuality.|$|E

50|$|Perrier {{produced}} {{a large body}} of work, ranging from phobia (1956), psychosis (1956 and after), and <b>erotomania</b> (1966), to alcoholism and female sexuality, while also contributing {{to the question of the}} training analysis (1969).|$|E
50|$|<b>Erotomania</b> is {{a fairly}} {{progressive}} piece, {{with a lot of}} switching and changes of tone, tempo and style, though this may {{have to do with the}} patchwork style writing more than a specific urge to write a varied song. <b>Erotomania</b> is made up of several different parts, many taken from other songs or sources. A prime example of this is the main vocal melody of The Silent Man which is used as a guitar solo. A section that was originally cut from Pull Me Under was also used in shaping the song. As it is part of a suite, the song flows directly into Voices without any sort of pause.|$|E
50|$|On <b>erotomania,</b> Perrier made a {{link between}} the early {{observations}} of Clérambault and Lacan's later work. He saw motherhood as a way for female sexuality to live out its disturbances, but also as an opportunity to work through them.|$|E

50|$|People {{characterized}} as stalkers may {{be accused of}} having a mistaken belief that another person loves them (<b>erotomania),</b> or that they need rescuing.

5000|$|Peter Alsop {{used the}} melody {{of the song}} {{as the basis for}} his song [...] "My Father's Top Drawer", which was about his father {{experiencing}} a phase of <b>erotomania</b> and addiction to pornography magazines and souvenirs with designs of sexual parts.

5000|$|Little White Lies {{wrote that}} the movie [...] "is {{a prime example of}} meta-cinema, {{endlessly}} blurring the line between behind-the-scenes reality and onscreen fantasy, between documentary and fiction, while also repeatedly commenting on the process of its own making.

5000|$|Early {{references}} to the condition {{can be found in}} the work of Hippocrates, Erasistratus, Plutarch and Galen. In the psychiatric literature it was first referred to in 1623 in a treatise by Jacques Ferrand (Maladie d'amour ou Mélancolie érotique) and has been variously called, [...] "erotic paranoia" [...] and [...] "erotic self-referent delusions" [...] until the common usage of the terms <b>erotomania</b> and de Clérambault's syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Erotomanic, {{originating}} {{from the word}} <b>Erotomania,</b> refers to stalkers who genuinely believe that their victims are in love with them. The victims in this case are almost always well known within their community or within the media, meaning that they can range from being small town celebrities or famous personalities from Hollywood. Comprising less than 10% of all stalking cases, Erotomanic stalkers are the least common. Unlike simple-obsessional stalkers, {{a majority of the}} individuals in this category of stalking are women. Similar to love-obsessional stalkers, the behavior of Erotomanic stalkers may be a result of an underlying psychological disorder such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. Individuals who suffer from <b>Erotomania</b> tend to believe that the celebrity with whom they are obsessed is utilizing the media as a way to communicate with them by sending special messages or signals. Although these stalkers have unrealistic beliefs, {{they are less likely to}} seek any form of face-to-face interaction with their celebrity obsession, therefore posing less of a threat to them.|$|E
50|$|Consistent with {{there not}} being any {{consensus}} over what causes hypersexuality, authors have used many different labels {{to refer to}} it, sometimes interchangeably, but often depending on which theory they favor or which specific behavior they were studying. Contemporary names include compulsive masturbation, compulsive sexual behavior, cybersex addiction, <b>erotomania,</b> “excessive sexual drive”, hyperphilia, hypersexuality, hypersexual disorder, problematic hypersexuality, sexual addiction, sexual compulsivity, sexual dependency, sexual impulsivity, “out of control sexual behavior”, and paraphilia-related disorder.|$|E
50|$|Adèle's {{obsession}} was {{a manifestation}} of <b>erotomania.</b> Along with her other symptoms of mental illness, including hallucinations, Adèle's condition indicates schizophrenia. The illness appeared in {{other members of the}} Hugo family; Victor Hugo's brother Eugène was also schizophrenic. She was ultimately sent to live in a mental institution for the affluent outside Paris. She remained there until her death. Out of Victor Hugo's five children, Adele {{was the only one who}} outlived him.|$|E
5000|$|He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not (À la folie... pas du tout) is a 2002 French {{psychological}} drama film {{directed by}} Laetitia Colombani. The film {{focuses on a}} Fine Arts student, played by Audrey Tautou, and a married cardiologist, played by Samuel Le Bihan, with whom she is dangerously obsessed. The film studies the condition of <b>erotomania</b> and is both {{an example of the}} nonlinear and [...] "unreliable narrator" [...] forms of storytelling.|$|E
5000|$|Erotolepsy {{is a term}} {{first used}} by English author Thomas Hardy in his 1895 novel Jude the Obscure to {{describe}} a passionate sensual desire and longing which is more violent and urgently felt than <b>erotomania.</b> It has been variously described as [...] "love-seizure" [...] and [...] "sexual recklessness". The term is a portmanteau of Eroto and Lepsy, and has since become more widely used, including by American poet Susan Mitchell in her 2001 poetry collection Erotikon.|$|E
50|$|Voices is {{performed}} live somewhat often, usually preceded by <b>Erotomania,</b> though not exclusively so. It is uncommon {{for the band}} to play Voices in its entirety, usually opting for an edited version. Fans have speculated {{that this may be}} done to spare James LaBrie's voice due to his vocal injury though even after his recovery the band continues to play the edited version. Although playing the entire suite is common, {{it is not uncommon for}} the band to sub out the third part with another song, such as The Spirit Carries On or Solitary Shell.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, J. Marion Sims {{followed}} Brown's {{work and}} in 1862 slit the neck of a woman's uterus and amputated her clitoris, [...] "for the relief of the nervous or hysterical condition as recommended by Baker Brown", after the patient complained of menstrual pain, convulsions and bladder problems. Later that century A. J. Bloch, a surgeon in New Orleans, removed the clitoris of a two-year-old girl who was reportedly masturbating. According to a 1985 paper in the Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey, clitoridectomy was performed in the US into the 1960s to treat hysteria, <b>erotomania</b> and lesbianism.|$|E
5000|$|Sexual addiction, {{also known}} as sex addiction, is a state {{characterized}} by compulsive participation or engagement in sexual activity, particularly sexual intercourse, despite negative consequences. Proponents of a diagnostic model for sexual addiction, as defined here, consider it {{to be one of}} several sex-related disorders within an umbrella concept known as hypersexual disorder. [...] The term sexual dependence is also used to refer to people who report being unable to control their sexual urges, behaviors, or thoughts. Related models of pathological sexual behavior include hypersexuality (nymphomania and satyriasis), <b>erotomania,</b> Don Juanism (or Don Juanitaism), and paraphilia-related disorders.|$|E
5000|$|Levy's debut novel, Erotomania: A Romance, a satirical {{examination}} of compulsive sexuality, was a Queerty Top 10 Book of 2008 and named a Standout Book of the Year by Inland Empire Weekl. <b>Erotomania</b> was reviewed in The Village Voice, The Los Angeles Times, Publishers Weekly, Time Out Chicago and elsewhere. Levy's short stories, poems, criticism, and essays {{have appeared in}} The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Republic, The Village Voice, The East Hampton Star, The Quarterly, and Evergreen Review. The journal American Imago published a long autobiographical essay about Levy's psychoanalytic treatment entitled [...] "Psychoanalysis: The Patient’s Cure” in its Spring 2010 issue. Levy blogs as The Screaming Pope.|$|E
5000|$|The core {{symptom of}} the {{disorder}} is that the sufferer holds an unshakable belief that another person is secretly in love with them. In some cases, the sufferer may believe several people at once are [...] "secret admirers." [...] The sufferer may also experience other types of delusions concurrently with <b>erotomania,</b> such as delusions of reference, wherein the perceived admirer secretly communicates his or her love by subtle methods such as body posture, arrangement of household objects, and other seemingly innocuous acts (or, {{if the person is}} a public figure, through clues in the media). Erotomanic delusions are typically found as the primary symptom of a delusional disorder or in the context of schizophrenia and may be treated with atypical antipsychotics.|$|E
5000|$|Obsessive love [...] is a {{condition}} in which one person feels an overwhelming obsessive desire to possess another person toward whom one feels a strong attraction, with an inability to accept failure or rejection. Although not categorized specifically under any specific mental diagnosis by the DSM-5, some people argue that obsessive love {{is considered to be a}} mental illness similar to attachment disorder, borderline personality disorder, and <b>erotomania.</b> Obsessive lovers may feel entirely unable to restrain themselves from extreme behaviors such as acts of violence toward themselves. They may be entirely convinced that their feelings are love, and may reject the idea that their severe obsession is not love. Obsessive love can begin at first sight and may persist indefinitely, requiring psychotherapy.|$|E

He is then {{directed}} by two nymphs to three gates. He chooses the third, and there he discovers his beloved. They are taken by some more nymphs to a temple to be engaged. Along the way they come across five triumphal processions celebrating their union. They are then taken to the island of Cythera by barge, on which Cupid is the boatswain. On Cythera, they see another triumphal procession celebrating their union. The narrative is interrupted, and assumed by a second voice, as Polia describes Poliphio's <b>erotomania</b> from her own point of view.|$|E

Exploring the house that she was house-sitting, he finds a life-sized garbage mosaic of himself. Loïc and Angélique have a final confrontation, in which he declares that they never had, nor ever will have, a relationship. Angélique strikes him {{over the head with}} a brass figurine and he falls down the stairs. Angélique is arrested, diagnosed with <b>erotomania,</b> and remanded to a mental institution.

The original article states that these butterflies are able to change colour, and are luminescent, naturally emitting light from their wings. This is due to the cold temperatures and low oxygen environment these butterflies live in. There are an estimated 14,000 butterflies living throughout the world, and thus are considered to be precious and highly uncommon.|$|E
