5|$|Contrasting {{with the}} company's usual method for {{designing}} motherboards, the first components that Asus {{placed on the}} device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the other components did not force speaker placement towards one side, which would harm sound quality. The design saw the implementation of two microphones to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not muffle sound during videoconferencing, while the headphone <b>jack</b> <b>was</b> moved {{to the bottom of}} the device, preventing the headphone wire from draping across the screen.|$|E

5|$|<b>Jack</b> <b>was</b> {{not always}} {{the name of the}} Georgetown Hoyas' mascot, nor was the mascot always a bulldog, as other types of dogs, {{particularly}} bull terriers, were associated with the sports teams before 1962.

5|$|Many {{of those}} {{involved}} in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings.

One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. <b>Jack</b> <b>was</b> also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E

50|$|Insert <b>jacks</b> <b>are</b> often {{normalized}} so {{that signal}} is {{passed through the}} <b>jack</b> if nothing <b>is</b> inserted but is interrupted when the <b>jack</b> <b>is</b> holding a plug. Inserts with two separate jacks will have normalizing such that the Return jack interrupts signal but the Send jack doesn't. The Send <b>jack</b> can always <b>be</b> counted on to send signal out to external devices. A refinement of the normalization of <b>jacks</b> <b>is</b> the presence on the mixer of an insert ON/OFF button which allows the user to patch into or around the inserted devices at will without having to physically disconnect the insert cables.|$|R
