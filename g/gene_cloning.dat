Molecular biologists were able to produce DNA probes and primers for use in DNA sequencing and mapping, <b>gene</b> <b>cloning,</b> and gene synthesis. The DNA synthesizer {{played a critical role}} in the identification of many important genes and in the discovery of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the critical technique used to amplify segments of DNA a million-fold.|$|E
25|$|Developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis, PCR is now {{a common}} and often {{indispensable}} technique used in clinical and research laboratories for a broad variety of applications. These include DNA cloning for sequencing, <b>gene</b> <b>cloning</b> and manipulation, gene mutagenesis; construction of DNA-based phylogenies, or functional analysis of genes; diagnosis and monitoring of hereditary diseases; amplification of ancient DNA; analysis of genetic fingerprints for DNA profiling (for example, in forensic science and parentage testing); and detection of pathogens in nucleic acid tests for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. In 1993, Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Michael Smith {{for his work on}} PCR.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{others may}} have made {{observations}} on interferons before the 1957 publication of Isaacs and Lindenmann. For example, during research to produce a more efficient vaccine for smallpox, Yasu-ichi Nagano and Yasuhiko Kojima—two Japanese virologists working at the Institute for Infectious Diseases at the University of Tokyo—noticed inhibition of viral growth {{in an area of}} rabbit-skin or testis previously inoculated with UV-inactivated virus. [...] They hypothesised that some [...] "viral inhibitory factor" [...] was present in the tissues infected with virus and attempted to isolate and characterize this factor from tissue homogenates. Independently, Monto Ho, in John Enders's lab, observed in 1957 that attenuated poliovirus conferred a species specific anti-viral effect in human amniotic cell cultures. They described these observations in a 1959 publication, naming the responsible factor viral inhibitory factor (VIF). It took another fifteen to twenty years, using somatic cell genetics, to show that the interferon action gene and interferon gene reside in different human chromosomes. The purification of human beta interferon did not occur until 1977. Chris Y.H. Tan and his co-workers purified and produced biologically active, radio-labeled human beta interferon by superinducing the interferon gene in fibroblast cells, and they showed its active site contains tyrosine residues. Tan's laboratory isolated sufficient amounts of human beta interferon to perform the first amino acid, sugar composition and N-terminal analyses. They showed that human beta interferon was an unusually hydrophobic glycoprotein. This explained the large loss of interferon activity when preparations were transferred from test tube to test tube or from vessel to vessel during purification. The analyses showed the reality of interferon activity by chemical verification. The purification of human alpha interferon was not reported until 1978. A series of publications from the laboratories of Sidney Pestka and Alan Waldman between 1978 and 1981, describe the purification of the type I interferons IFN-α and IFN-β. By the early 1980s, genes for these interferons had been cloned, adding further definitive proof that interferons were responsible for interfering with viral replication. [...] <b>Gene</b> <b>cloning</b> also confirmed that IFN-α was encoded by a family of many related genes. [...] The type II IFN (IFN-γ) gene was also isolated around this time.|$|E

The data reported here extend a previous {{analysis of a}} bacterioplankton 16 s rRNA clone library with 15 additional nucleic acid clone sequences, to provide information on 60 16 s rDNA clones from hydrostation S in the Sargasso Sea. The data were compared to partial sequences of 37 Bacterial 16 s rDNA clones reported from a surface picoplankton population collected at the Aloha station in the North Pacific gyre, and partial sequences of 29 Bacterial 16 s rRNA clones obtained from sites near Bermuda and the western California Current.

Many of the alpha gen clones contained both coding and reciprocal joints of V alpha-to-J alpha joining {{on the same}} structure.

40|$|Several {{different}} transforming genes {{have been}} observed in the DNA {{of a variety of}} tumours and tumour cell lines of human and rodent origin by the ability of these genes to induce morphological transformation in NIH 3 T 3 cells 1 - 5.

50|$|They {{are used}} to assist {{insertion}} of genes into plasmid vectors during <b>gene</b> <b>cloning</b> and protein production experiments. For optimal use, plasmids that are commonly used for <b>gene</b> <b>cloning</b> are modified to include a short polylinker sequence (called the multiple cloning site, or MCS) rich in restriction enzyme recognition sequences. This allows flexibility when inserting gene fragments into the plasmid vector; restriction sites contained naturally within genes influence the choice of endonuclease for digesting the DNA, since {{it is necessary to}} avoid restriction of wanted DNA while intentionally cutting the ends of the DNA. To clone a gene fragment into a vector, both plasmid DNA and gene insert are typically cut with the same restriction enzymes, and then glued together with the assistance of an enzyme known as a DNA ligase.|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} marine {{phytoplankton}} diversity is uncertain {{in many respects}} because, like bacteria, these organisms sometimes lack defining morphological characteristics and {{can be a challenge}} to grow in culture. Here, we report the recovery of phylogenetically diverse plastid small-subunit (SSU) rRNA <b>gene</b> (rDNA) <b>clones</b> from natural plankton populations collected in the Pacific Ocean off the mouth of Yaquina Bay, Oreg. (OCS clones), and from the eastern continental shelf of the United States off Cape Hatteras, N. C. (OM <b>clones).</b> SSU rRNA <b>gene</b> <b>clone</b> libraries were prepared by amplifying rDNAs from nucleic acids isolated from plankton samples and cloning them into plasmid vectors. The PCR primers used for amplification reactions were designed to be specific for bacterial SSU rRNA genes; however, plastid genes have a common phylogenetic origin with bacteria and were common in both SSU rRNA <b>gene</b> <b>clone</b> libraries. A combination of restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses, nucleic acid sequencing, and taxon-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridizations revealed that 54 of the 116 OCS <b>gene</b> <b>clones</b> were of plastid origin. Collectively, clones from the OCS and OM libraries formed at least eight unique lineages within the plastid radiation, including gene lineages related to the classes Bacillariophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae, Chrysophyceae, and Prasinophyceae; for a number of unique clones, no close phylogenetic neighbors could be identified with confidence. Only a group of two OCS rRNA <b>gene</b> <b>clones</b> showed close identity to the plastid SSU rRNA gene sequence of a cultured organism [Emiliania huxleyi (Lohmann) Hay and Mohler; 99. 8 % similar].
