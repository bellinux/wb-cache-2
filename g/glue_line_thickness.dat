40|$|Plywood {{is highly}} esteemed as a {{construction}} material. Yet, {{the influence of}} moisture on both strength and durability are important factors. Especially the dynamics of moisture desorption and absorption {{should be taken into}} account when assessing the quality of a panel, which is a fact for all panel materials. This paper therefore focuses on the monitoring of the moisture dynamics of plywood subjected to outdoor weathering and the evaluation of its internal structure using X-ray tomography. Visual inspection of the internal structure of panels sheds a light on some of the moisture dynamics phenomena, such as the fact that high absorbing panels seem to have failure of glue lines. The qualitative X-ray approach in this paper pinpoints at the value of such a ‘non-destructive’ inspection and in combination with quantification of <b>glue</b> <b>line</b> <b>thickness,</b> glue penetration and the monitoring of crack development linked to moisture dynamics, this can become a fundamental method for product optimisation...|$|E

5000|$|Traditional {{edge banding}} was a manual process {{requiring}} ordinary carpentry tools and materials. In modern applications, particularly for high-volume, repetitive manufacturing steps such as cabinet doors, edge banding {{is applied to}} the substrate by an automated process using a hot-melt adhesive. Hot melt adhesives can be water or solvent based and may consist of various raw materials including EVA, PUR, PA, APOA, and PO. A substrate primer may also be used as a bonding agent between the adhesive and the substrate. Thicker edge bandings typically require a slight concavity to provide a tight <b>glue</b> <b>line.</b> The <b>thickness</b> can vary from [...]018" [...] to 5mm or even more. The machine that applies the edge banding is called edgebander. An edgebander bonds the edge banding to the substrate, trims the leading and trailing edges, trims top and bottom flush with the substrate, scraps any surplus, and buffs the finished edge.|$|R

However, little information is available on the behavior of epoxy‐repaired timber during a fire. To evaluate this behavior for repaired truss joints, an experimental and theoretical investigation was conducted.

At first, LVL panels were manufactured with nine layers of wood veneer glued with phenol-formaldehyde resin. After, they were reinforced with fiberglass impregnated with epoxy or isophthalic resin or with isophthalic resin. The treatments consisted on the aplication of one, two and four reinforced layers.

The epoxy and the isophthalic resin showed the same mechanical qualities among different treatments.

Thus, the bamboo stems were treated by immersion method with chemical product (solution of 1 % of active ingredients of copper chrome borate - CCB) and water by 15 days. Before treating the stems, the external and internal parts were removed to obtain the flat strips of bamboo with 4 mm of thickness, 45 cm of length and 5 cm of width. The "Cascophen RS" (resorcinol-formaldehyde) and "Cascorez-extra" (polyvinyl acetate) commercial adhesives were used to bond the flat strips.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{alkaline}} copper quaternary (ACQ) preservative treatment and of plywood <b>glue</b> <b>lines</b> on resistance-based moisture content (MC) measurements. Moisture meter readings using stainless steel screws as electrodes were acquired over a range of moisture conditions in Southern Yellow Pine (SYP) lumber and plywood. Calibration equations are presented for predicting gravimetric MC from meter readings taken in SYP lumber and SYP plywood with or without ACQ treatment. These corrections assume that the meter has been set for SYP. Correlation equations are also presented for directly relating resistance to gravimetric MC, which may be useful for automated data collection systems employed in monitoring moisture levels in buildings. The conductance of SYP lumber was raised by treatment with ACQ, particularly at higher moisture contents, but was unaffected by vacuum-pressure treatment with water. The conductance of untreated SYP plywood, measured with electrodes penetrating the <b>glue</b> <b>lines,</b> exceeded that of untreated SYP lumber. The conductance of SYP plywood was lowered by treatment with ACQ, by vacuum-pressure soaking with water, and by exposure to rain. We suggest that electrolytes in the plywood <b>glue</b> <b>lines</b> increase the conductance of untreated plywood relative to that of untreated lumber, and that the concentration of these electrolytes is lowered by the (aqueous) preservative treatment process, thereby lowering the conductance of these high-conductance pathways...|$|R

Three types of adhesives (poly(vinyl) acetate (PVAc), emulsion polymer isocyanate (EPI) and polyurethane (PU)) glued in two side gluing orientation (radial and tangential) and analyzed after the conditioning tests (dry and wet) were analyzed. The 360 specimens were prepared for determining the shear strength of edge glued panels of Pinus taeda, and these were tested in a universal testing machine called EMIC. The shear strength of the <b>glue</b> <b>line</b> at dry condition was lower in the tangential side for the three types of adhesives analyzed.
