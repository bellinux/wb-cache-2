50|$|In 1993, two {{joint ventures}} were formed with Cummins; Komatsu Cummins Engine Corporation (KCEC) to {{manufacture}} Cummins <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> Japan, and the Cummins Komatsu Engine Corporation (CKEC) to manufacture Komatsu <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> the United States.

50|$|In January 2012, the {{companies}} announced they would jointly produce <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> Nissan's plant in Decherd, Tennessee. The collaboration {{marks the first}} production of Mercedes-Benz <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> the North America Free Trade region. The Tennessee plant’s strategic location and logistics links ensure a direct supply of <b>engines</b> starting <b>in</b> 2014 for the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, built at Daimler’s vehicle plant in Tuscaloosa, Ala. The deal {{marked the first time}} that Daimler had ever built <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> North America. The companies will together produce 250,000 four-cylinder gasoline <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> the plant.|$|R

5|$|As of 2009, {{graphene}} {{appears to}} be the strongest material ever tested. The process of separating it from graphite will require some further technological development before it is economical for industrial processes. If successful, graphene could be used in the construction of a space elevator. It could also be used to safely store hydrogen for use in a hydrogen based <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> cars.|$|E
5|$|Eccles {{became the}} first {{municipal}} corporation in England to operate a motorised fire <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> 1901. It was supplied to Eccles Corporation by a local firm, the Protector Lamp and Lighting Co., also known for manufacturing Miners' Safety Lamps. Barton Aerodrome, the first municipal aerodrome in the UK to be licensed by the Air Ministry, was opened on 29 January 1930 on a site at Barton-on-the-Moss.|$|E
5|$|Installing {{such a large}} <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> a {{relatively}} small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained {{essentially the same as}} the Alpine's. Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman recirculating ball steering mechanism to a more modern rack and pinion system.|$|E

5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a longitudinally mounted <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> front driving {{the rear wheels}} through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The {{rack and pinion steering}} had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
5|$|Starting with Apollo 13, descent orbit {{insertion}} {{was to be}} performed using the Service Module engine instead of the LM <b>engine,</b> <b>in</b> order to allow a greater fuel reserve for landing. This was actually done {{for the first time}} on Apollo 14, since the Apollo 13 mission was aborted before landing.|$|E
5|$|Vulcan B.2 XH557 {{was used}} by BSEL for {{developing}} the Olympus 301 and first flew with the larger <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> May 1961. It was returned to Woodford in 1964 to be refurbished for the RAF.|$|E

25|$|His business, Maybach Motorenbau GmbH {{continued}} in Friedrichshafen.

5|$|Age of Empires III {{builds on}} and {{introduces}} new features to the Age of Mythology engine, called Bang! Engine. One new {{feature is the}} inclusion of the Havok physics simulation middleware engine on the Windows version and the similar PhysX engine on Mac OS X. This means that many events such as building destruction and tree falls will not be pre-created animations, but will be calculated according to the physics <b>engine,</b> <b>in</b> an innovation for the series. Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.|$|E
5|$|As the Game Boy Advance {{was able}} to handle newer, {{enhanced}} graphics, Ruby and Sapphire were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, {{as opposed to the}} previous limit of two. However, the development team used a more basic graphics <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> order to keep the game simple and not overly confusing. The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to be easy enough for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.|$|E
5|$|As the Merlin was {{considered}} to be so important to the war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 Merlin order. Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E

5|$|At nightfall, as {{the three}} swap stories, the great white returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull and killing the power. The men work through the night, {{repairing}} the <b>engine.</b> <b>In</b> the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line {{is tied to the}} stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backwards, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment before breaking the cleats off. He then heads toward shore, intending to lure the shark to shallower waters and suffocate it, but the overtaxed engine fails.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Pratt & Whitney {{dominated}} the commercial market. GE needed an <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> this market class, and SNECMA had previous experience {{of working with}} them, collaborating on {{the production of the}} CF6-50 turbofan for the Airbus A300. Pratt & Whitney was considering upgrading their JT8D to compete in the same class as the CFM56 as a sole venture, while Rolls-Royce dealt with financial issues that precluded them from starting new projects; this situation caused GE to gain the title of best partner for the program.|$|E
5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with no need for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw control authority. Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due {{to the loss of}} an <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E

Six years later, Revolution released Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon, which features 3D graphics and a direct-control mechanism. It uses the RenderWare <b>engine.</b> <b>In</b> 2006 the company released Broken Sword: The Angel of Death (Secrets of the Ark: A Broken Sword Game in North America), which returns to the point-and-click system used {{in the first two}} games. It is the only game in the series not released for a console, and it uses Sumo Digital's engine. The fifth installment, , was announced through a Kickstarter project in August 2012. The game features 2D graphics, and it {{was released}} in September 2013.|$|E
