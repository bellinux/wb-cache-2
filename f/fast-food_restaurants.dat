In May 1965, for two weeks, St. Paul, Minnesota and Minneapolis, Minnesota were on different times, when the capital city decided to join most of the nation by starting Daylight Saving Time while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law. In the mid-1980s, Clorox (parent of Kingsford Charcoal) and 7-Eleven provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to U.S. DST, and both Idaho senators voted for it {{based on the premise that}} during DST <b>fast-food</b> <b>restaurants</b> sell more French fries, which are made from Idaho potatoes.|$|E

25|$|The Turkish cuisine {{first arrived}} in Germany during the sixteenth century and was {{consumed}} among aristocratic circles.

Today there are Turkish restaurants scattered throughout the country selling popular dishes like döner kebap in take-away stalls to more authentic domestic foods in family-run restaurants. Moreover, since the 1970s, Turks have opened grocery stores and open-air markets where they sell ingredients suitable for Turkish home-cooking, such as spices, fruits, and vegetables.|$|E

25|$|Lactose {{is also a}} {{commercial}} food additive used for its texture, flavor, and adhesive qualities. It is found in additives labelled as casein, caseinate, whey, lactoserum, milk solids, modified milk ingredients, etc. As such lactose is found in foods such as processed meats (sausages/hot dogs, sliced meats, pâtés), gravy stock powder, margarines, sliced breads, breakfast cereals, potato chips, processed foods, medications, prepared meals, meal replacements (powders and bars), protein supplements (powders and bars), and even beers in the milk stout style. Some barbecue sauces and liquid cheeses used in <b>fast-food</b> <b>restaurants</b> may also contain lactose. Lactose is often used as the primary filler (main ingredient) in most prescription and non-prescription solid pill form medications, though product labeling seldom mentions the presence of 'lactose' or 'milk', and neither do product monograms provided to pharmacists, and most pharmacists are unaware of the very wide scale yet common use of lactose in such medications until they contact the supplier or manufacturer for verification.|$|E

500|$|In 1982, {{the city}} {{attempted}} {{to revitalize the}} downtown district by closing Ben Yehuda Street and the Triangle's interior streets (Luncz, Dorot Rishonim, Yavetz, Ben Hillel, and HaHistadrut Streets) to traffic, and converting the entire area to an open-air pedestrian mall. Though taxi companies demonstrated against the renovation and merchants claimed it would fail, the idea proved successful. Outdoor cafes, pizzerias, and <b>fast-food</b> <b>restaurants</b> moved into the Triangle, together with shops selling souvenirs, Judaica, and jewelry to tourists. Street musicians, street artists, political promoters, and tables manned by Chabad and Breslov Hasidim add to the lively nature of the mall. The pedestrian mall restored the Triangle's reputation as the [...] "heart" [...] of the city, although the formerly upscale, European tone {{was replaced by a}} more populist image. The introduction of the Jerusalem Light Rail in December 2011 further increased local and visitor traffic: estimates show that 36,000 pedestrians per day visited the Triangle in April 2012, up from 16,000 per day in April 2004. The mall is especially busy on Saturday nights, as eateries that have closed for Shabbat reopen and the streets are crowded with young Israelis from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.|$|E
5000|$|McDonaldization is a {{term used}} by {{sociologist}} George Ritzer in his book The McDonaldization of Society (1993). He explains that it becomes manifested when a society adopts {{the characteristics of a}} <b>fast-food</b> <b>restaurant.</b> McDonaldization is a reconceptualization of rationalization and scientific management. Where Max Weber used the model of the bureaucracy to represent the direction of this changing society, Ritzer sees the <b>fast-food</b> <b>restaurant</b> as having become a more representative contemporary paradigm (Ritzer, 2004:553). The process of McDonaldization can be summarized as the way in which [...] "the principles of the <b>fast-food</b> <b>restaurant</b> are coming to dominate more and more sectors of American society {{as well as of the}} rest of the world." ...|$|R
