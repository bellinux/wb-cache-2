25|$|Family {{folklore}} is {{the branch}} of folkloristics concerned with the study and use of folklore and traditional culture transmitted within a family group. This includes items of material culture, crafts produced by family members or memorabilia saved as reminders or remainders of significant family events. It also includes family photos and photo albums in paper and <b>electronic</b> <b>format,</b> along with bundles of other pages held for posterity: certificates, letters, journals, notes and shopping lists. Family stories and sayings, originally recounting actual events, are told and retold until the historical facts {{give way to a}} distilled expression of common identity. Family customs are performed, modified, forgotten, created or resurrected with alarming frequency; each time with the goal of defining and solidifying the perception of this family as unique, distinct and different from other families.|$|E
25|$|Pertinent up-to-date, {{confidential}} {{patient information}} {{is converted to}} a written text document by a medical transcriptionist (MT). This text may be printed {{and placed in the}} patient's record and/or retained only in its <b>electronic</b> <b>format.</b> Medical transcription can be performed by MTs who are employees in a hospital or who work at home as telecommuting employees for the hospital; by MTs working as telecommuting employees or independent contractors for an outsourced service that performs the work offsite under contract to a hospital, clinic, physician group or other healthcare provider; or by MTs working directly for the providers of service (doctors or their group practices) either onsite or telecommuting as employees or contractors. Hospital facilities often prefer electronic storage of medical records due to the sheer volume of hospital patients and the accompanying paperwork. The electronic storage in their database gives immediate access to subsequent departments or providers regarding the patient's care to date, notation of previous or present medications, notification of allergies, and establishes a history on the patient to facilitate healthcare delivery regardless of geographical distance or location.|$|E
25|$|The {{cemetery}} {{retains its}} character as a garden cemetery, including its asymmetrical, winding pathways and roads; landscaping; and walls. Burials occur in plots and in rows, and many graves are marked with {{good examples of}} Victorian funerary art. Many markers from {{the mid to late}} 1800s markers are simple slabs or headstones carved from limestone or marble, which is typical for the mid-Atlantic area in the 1800s. Later monuments tend to be larger and more ornate, and several prominent sculptors are known to have created pieces for the cemetery. Included among them are works by noted German-American artist Jacques Jouvenal. About 75 percent of the 14,000 burials at Prospect Hill Cemetery in 2006 are German Americans, and the cemetery remains the historic burying ground of the city's once-large German American community. Most of the remaining graves represent European families. Almost 200 Civil War veterans, most of them German Americans who served in the 8th Battalion, are buried at Prospect Hill. The cemetery began converting its burial records to <b>electronic</b> <b>format</b> in late 2012. The first information to be digitized were lot ownership records, with burial records to follow.|$|E

Results indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in self-assessment of workload when using the electronic replica or the paper format of the NASA-TLX scale. Variations of the <b>electronic</b> <b>formats</b> were tested to enforce structure to the TLX scale. Respondents had more consistent ratings with these alternative formats of the NASA-TLX. Non-pilots, in general, had lower workload ratings than pilots. The time to input the rating was the fastest for the electronic facsimile and random title formats. Also subjects preferred the <b>electronic</b> <b>formats</b> and thought these formats were easier to use. Therefore, moving questionnaires from paper to electronic media could change respondents' answers...|$|R

Writing in the San Diego Law Review, Orly Lobel called Fairman's article a thought-provoking analysis into how the law and the First Amendment address issues of sexual language. In a 2011 article for the Federal Communications Law Journal, W.Wat Hopkins was critical of Fairman's article and subsequent book, writing that both appeared to be formats for the author to repeatedly use the word [...] "fuck", rather than actually analyze the subject from a rigorous perspective.|$|E
