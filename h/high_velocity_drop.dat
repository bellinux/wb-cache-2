40|$|The {{impact of}} {{nanometer}} sized drops on solid surfaces is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Equilibrated floating drops consisting of short chains of Lennard-Jones liquids with adjustable volatility are directed normally onto an atomistic solid surface {{where they are}} observed to bounce, stick, splash or disintegrate, depending on the initial velocity {{and the nature of}} the materials involved. Drops impacting at low velocity bounce from non-wetting surfaces but stick and subsequently spread slowly on wetting surfaces. <b>Higher</b> <b>velocity</b> impacts produce an prompt splash followed by disintegration of the drop, while at still <b>higher</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>drops</b> disintegrate immediately. The disintegration can be understood as either a loss of coherence of the liquid or as the result of a local temperature exceeding the liquid-vapor coexistence value. In contrast to macroscopic drops, the presence of vapor outside the drop does not effect the behavior in any significant way. Nonetheless, the transition between the splashing and bouncing/sticking regimes occur at Reynolds and Weber numbers similar to those found for larger drops...|$|R

40|$|The {{visual effects}} of rain are complex. Rain {{consists}} of spatially distributed <b>drops</b> falling at <b>high</b> <b>velocities.</b> Each <b>drop</b> refracts and reflects the environment, producing sharp intensity changes in an image. A group of such falling drops creates a complex time varying signal in images and videos. In addition, {{due to the}} finite exposure time of the camera, intensities due to rain are motion blurred and hence depend on the background intensities. Thus, the visual manifestations of rain are {{a combination of both}} the dynamics of rain and the photometry of the environment. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the visual effects of rain on an imaging system. We develop a correlation model that captures the dynamics of rain and a physics-based motion blur model that explains the photometry of rain. Based on these models, we develop efficien...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Well {{productivity}} of gas condensate reservoirs is highly affected by near-wellbore phenomena. Inertial force resulting from convective acceleration of fluid {{particles in the}} medium, as well as viscous force, determines the flow of gas through porous media at <b>high</b> <b>velocity.</b> Pressure <b>drop</b> builds up the molar content of water in gas by water vaporization in the near-wellbore region, which means a drop in connate water saturation. Given that the inertial force {{is a function of}} the non-Darcy coefficient, &# 946;, which itself depends upon connate water saturation, this can ultimately lessen the non-Darcy component of the pressure drop and therefore inertial forces, leading to improvement of well deliverability. Currently, no physically relevant model takes into account the non-Darcian flow coefficient variation due to this phenomenon. This paper utilizes a single-well compositional simulation to exhibit how water vaporization could compensate for the effect of inertia on well {{productivity of}} gas condensate reservoirs...|$|R

The amount of throughfall and raindrop sizes and velocities were measured at twenty-four points under four canopy structures generated by staged branch pruning. Decreasing the canopy thickness resulted in increases of the initial throughfall amount, volume proportion of large throughfall drops, the number of <b>drops</b> with <b>high</b> <b>velocities,</b> and throughfall kinetic energy.

25|$|During {{the early}} part of 1965 about one dozen {{personnel}} of the 109th Quartermaster Corps, U.S. Army, were sent TDY to Eglin Air Force Base, where they assisted Air Force personnel developing an air delivery technique called the low-altitude parachute extraction system (LAPES). The 109th's mission was to provide parachute packing, temporary storage and rigging of supplies and equipment for aerial drop by aircraft of all the services. In addition, the 109th was to render technical assistance in the recovery and evacuation of airdrop equipment. Using the LAPES system, while a cargo plane flew a few feet above ground level, a drogue parachute would be released, pulling palletized cargo out of the aircraft and onto the drop zone. An alternative method was the ground proximity extraction system (GPES), in which cargo was yanked from the aircraft by a hook that snagged a cable traversing the runway. At full strength the unit would be capable of preparing 200 tons of material per day for delivery by free, <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> or low-velocity <b>drop</b> techniques.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{experimentally}} {{investigate how}} the impregnation of porous media can be forced using the initial kinetic energy of an impacting drop. We {{focus on the}} scale of a single pore – either hydrophilic or hydrophobic– and thus study the impact of a single drop falling on vertical cylindrical capillary tubes. This experimental configuration therefore differs from the impregnation of a porous media because of the finite volume of the drop and its initial kinetic energy. We observe different limit regimes: at low impact velocity, we recover the classical results for impregnation. The liquid does not impregnate the hydrophobic pore while it is totally sucked into the hydrophilic one. At <b>high</b> impact <b>velocities,</b> the <b>drop</b> is broken in two parts: one part spreads {{at the top of the}} surface while an isolated slug is trapped within the pore.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to improve the {{temporal}} resolution of seismic wave velocity variations measured using ambient noise correlations. We first reproduce the result obtained by Chen et al. using a network of 21 broad-band stations ideally located around the fault system activated during the Wenchuan earthquake. We measure a <b>velocity</b> <b>drop</b> of 0. 07 per cent that was associated with the main shock, with a temporal resolution of 30 days.

The <b>velocity</b> <b>drop</b> was approximately 3 % with 0.37 wt.% H 2 O and 3 % to 4 % with 0.98 wt.% H 2 O.

40|$|This {{contribution}} describes recent {{progress on}} materials modelling and numerical simulation of fibre reinforced composite shell structures subjected to <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> impact loads. A Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) model for fibre reinforced composites {{is applied to}} model both in-ply damage and delamination failure during impact loading. The CDM model has been implemented in a commercial explicit finite element (FE) code in which a laminate is modelled by stacked shell elements with cohesive interfaces which fracture when a delamination failure energy criterion is reached. A comparison of structural response and failure modes from numerical simulations is then conducted. In particular, emphasis is put {{on the influence of}} delamination damage on the impact behaviour of composite plates and stiffened panels. Delamination damage is measured in low <b>velocity</b> <b>drop</b> tower impact tests and also in <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> gas gun tests on composite plates with steel projectiles carried out at the DLR. In both types of test it is seen that at lower impact energies delamination damage was often the main damage mechanism, whereas at higher impact energies there was fibre fracture and plate penetration by the hard projectiles. In this case, the presence of some delamination provides an additional energy absorption mechanism in the composite plate, which can reduce complete penetration. It follows that modelling and analysis of impact damage require composites failure models which include both in-plane ply damage and delamination damage...|$|R

These stars are speculated to reflect the stellar orbits in the Galactic bar. In this study, we use two N-body models of a Milky Way-like disk galaxy with different bar strengths to critically examine this possibility. The general trends of the Galactocentric radial velocity distribution in observations and simulations are similar, but neither our models nor the BRAVA data reveal a statistically significant cold <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> peak. A Monte Carlo test further {{suggests that it is}} possible for a spurious <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> peak to appear if there are {{only a limited number of}} stars observed. Thus, the reported cold <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> peak, even if it is real, is unlikely due to stars on the bar-supporting orbits.

In the distance-velocity diagram, the <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> particles in different fields exist at a similar distance similar to 8. 5 +/- 1 kpc away from the Sun.
