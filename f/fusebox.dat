Under Polaris sold out a five-day run at REDCAT in Los Angeles, and was featured at the 2009 National Performers Network conference in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 2010 the show will travel to the Exit Festival in Paris, and the <b>Fusebox</b> Festival in Austin, Texas.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, The <b>Fusebox</b> Corporation asked Sean Corfield to {{take the}} lead in {{developing}} the next iteration of <b>Fusebox.</b> <b>Fusebox</b> 5 was another complete rewrite with new features and improved performance. <b>Fusebox</b> 5 nearly completely maintained backwards-compatibility with <b>Fusebox</b> 4.1. In November 2006 The <b>Fusebox</b> Corporation transferred ownership of the core files and <b>fusebox</b> website to TeraTech under the guidance of TeraTech president and <b>Fusebox</b> speaker Michael Smith. TeraTech announced that <b>Fusebox</b> will remain open source and is seeking to increase community involvement in the project again. <b>Fusebox</b> 5.1 and all subsequent releases are licensed under theApache Source License 2.0.In February 2007 the members of Team <b>Fusebox</b> met at the Frameworks conference in Bethesda Maryland and created a plan of action for community involvement using volunteers in nine different areas of <b>Fusebox.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fusebox</b> 3 (written {{primarily}} by Hal Helms, John Quarto-von Tivadar and Nat Papovich) {{was an effort}} by leading members of the <b>Fusebox</b> community to incorporate XFB and other ideas into a reusable library, known as the [...] "core files." [...] A simple API allowed application code {{to communicate with the}} core files. Upon release in the fall of 2001, <b>Fusebox</b> became a framework rather than a methodology. A subsequent 3.01 release addressed minor issues. <b>Fusebox</b> 3 was something of a sea-change from <b>Fusebox</b> 2. Only the original principles remained relatively unchanged; a <b>Fusebox</b> 2 and <b>Fusebox</b> 3 application are structured very differently.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{panels are}} easily {{accessible}} junction boxes used to reroute and switch electrical services. The term {{is often used}} to refer to circuit breaker panels or <b>fuseboxes.</b> Local codes can specify physical clearance around the panels.|$|R
50|$|A {{small number}} of pre-1950 <b>fuseboxes</b> are still in service. These should be treated with caution because exposed live parts are common on these boxes. The {{installations}} they supply will not meet modern standards for electrical safety. Another characteristic of very old installations is {{that there may be}} two fuses for each circuit; one on the live and one on the neutral. In rare instances, old ring circuits may be encountered with no fewer than 4 15 A fuses per ring, one on each of L and N, and this duplicated for each of the two feeds for the ring.|$|R
25|$|Chrysotile {{has been}} used {{more than any other}} type and {{accounts}} for about 95% of the asbestos found in buildings in America. Chrysotile is more flexible than amphibole types of asbestos, and can be spun and woven into fabric. The most common use was corrugated asbestos cement roofing primarily for outbuildings, warehouses and garages. It may also be found in sheets or panels used for ceilings and sometimes for walls and floors. Chrysotile has been a component in joint compound and some plasters. Numerous other items have been made containing chrysotile including brake linings, fire barriers in <b>fuseboxes,</b> pipe insulation, floor tiles, residential shingles, and gaskets for high temperature equipment.|$|R
50|$|Hal Helms {{built upon}} <b>Fusebox</b> 2 and called his ideas eXtended <b>FuseBox,</b> or XFB.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fusebox</b> 1 {{grew out}} of a {{conversation}} on the CF-Talk mailing list in April 1998. Steve Nelson and Gabe Roffman are credited with creating the original <b>Fusebox</b> though the first <b>Fusebox</b> program was written by Josh Cyr. The methodology was constantly evolving and beyond a whitepaper and a handful of examples, no official documentation existed. Very few developers were exposed to <b>Fusebox</b> during these early days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fusebox</b> 4 was a {{complete}} rewrite of <b>Fusebox</b> 3. The license for the core files (which is open source) is held by a private company owned by Hal Helms and John Quarto-von Tivadar: The <b>Fusebox</b> Corporation (which {{appears to be a}} defunct corporation).|$|E
50|$|The 17 ft deep hull {{accommodated}} a {{total of}} two decks, the upper deck forming a lengthy compartment divided into sections to accommodate 3000 lb of freight and mail along with a storage space and a ship's clerks office. This office contained controls such as electrical <b>fuseboxes</b> and circuit switches, ventilation controls, and fuelcocks. The lower deck contained a large marine compartment containing an anchor, a pair of drogues, a mooring bollard, and a boat hook, along with a step ladder to the cockpit; aft of the mooring compartment was the forward passenger saloon, followed by a central corridor flanked by the toilets and galley, a mid-ship cabin, a spacious promenade cabin, and finally an aft-cabin. The cabins could be alternatively outfitted with comfortable seating or bunks for sleeper services. Near {{the rear of the}} aircraft, a further compartment for the purpose of containing freight and mail was present which extended into the after fuselage.|$|R
50|$|In January, 2012, {{a team of}} five {{community}} developers led by John Blayter announced on the <b>Fusebox</b> mailing list that they had obtained the rights and copyright of <b>Fusebox</b> from TeraTech. The framework code has had the copyright removed and is available at GitHub to encourage community participation. Experienced <b>Fusebox</b> developers vetting any changes which are submitted. <b>Fusebox</b> 5.6 goals have been announced, but there is currently no target date.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} concepts behind <b>Fusebox</b> {{were based}} on the household idiom of an electrical <b>fusebox</b> that controls a number of circuits, each one with its own fuse. In a <b>Fusebox</b> web application, all requests are routed through a single point (usually [...] for CFML) and processed by the <b>Fusebox</b> core files. The application is divided into a number of circuits (usually in sub-directories) which are intended to contain related functionality. Each circuit in the application is further divided into small files called fuses that should perform simple tasks. As such, <b>Fusebox</b> is considered an implementation of the front controller, a common design pattern.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fusebox</b> 4.1 {{introduced}} {{some new}} XML grammar elements beyond those available in 4.0 {{that let you}} declare, instantiate and manipulate objects (COM, Java and ColdFusion Components) as well as web services. These features have provided <b>Fusebox</b> developers with the means of tying object-oriented models (i.e. business-logic) directly into their controllers. However, many <b>Fusebox</b> developers used object-oriented or highly structured models in earlier versions of <b>Fusebox</b> or in the current versions without use of these grammar elements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fusebox</b> has {{had several}} major {{revisions}} over the years. The most popular versions {{in use today}} are <b>Fusebox</b> 3, 4 (including 4.1) and 5. In <b>Fusebox</b> 3, the control files were all written in the underlying programming language (e.g., fbx_Switch.cfm for CFML). <b>Fusebox</b> 4 and later versions use XML for the control files (fusebox.xml and circuit.xml), but other framework components are written using the underlying programming language (e.g. fusebox5.cfm, again for CFML). In theory, this helps improve tool support for the framework. It also allowed for the pre-parsing and generation of a single template for processing each fuseaction, greatly increasing performance. <b>Fusebox</b> 5.5 allows the XML files to be omitted if certain conventions are followed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fusebox</b> {{provides}} {{web application}} developers with a standardized, structured way of developing their applications using a relatively straightforward {{and easy to}} learn set of core files and encouraged conventions. In addition to the framework itself, <b>Fusebox</b> has become closely associated with a Web application development methodology developed by its proponents known as [...] "FLiP" [...] (for <b>Fusebox</b> Lifecycle Process). (Many people refer to <b>Fusebox</b> as a [...] "methodology", but in fact, as stated, it's a development framework. FLiP, however, is a methodology). Many frameworks provide comparable advantages; however, <b>Fusebox</b> (probably on account of both its relatively long history and the sizable and active community that supports it) {{seems to be the}} most popular one for CFML. The framework has been ported and used in ASP, JSP, Lasso, Perl/CGI and PHP as well, though the CFML and PHP versions of <b>Fusebox</b> are the only versions to gain momentum.|$|E
50|$|Although FuseDocs was {{so named}} because of its {{creation}} within the <b>Fusebox</b> community, it is also used by developers who do not employ <b>Fusebox</b> as an application framework.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fusebox</b> Funk is a {{powerhouse}} 6 piece Funk/Hip Hop phenomenon! Hailing from Jacksonville FL, <b>Fusebox</b> Funk has thrilled {{tens of thousands}} of fans at clubs and festivals across the country since their debut in 2001. Featuring a full horn section, 3 vocalists, and one of the tightest rhythm sections in the region, <b>Fusebox</b> Funk is guaranteed to be a standout at any venue or festival and can appeal to any type of audience.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fusebox</b> is {{intended}} to be easy to learn and provides benefits by helping developers structure their code through a set of simple conventions. <b>Fusebox</b> also allows advanced developers to build large applications, leveraging design patterns and object-oriented programming techniques if they wish.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fusebox</b> is a web {{application}} framework for CFML and PHP. Originally released in 1997, the current version, 5.5.1, {{was released in}} March 2008. In January 2012 the rights to <b>Fusebox</b> were transferred from TeraTech to a team of five developers, who have removed the rights and placed the framework {{in the hands of}} the community.|$|E
50|$|The {{release of}} <b>Fusebox</b> 5.5.1 in March 2008 {{was the last}} release by Sean Corfield. In August 2008, Adam Haskell took over development, but became {{frustrated}} with the <b>Fusebox</b> organization, and attempted to branch a new framework called FuseNG (NG for Next Generation, a Star Trek reference). FuseNG quickly lost steam and ended without a release.|$|E

5000|$|URLs {{within a}} <b>Fusebox</b> web {{application}} are usually {{of the form}} [...] where [...] "" [...] {{is the name of}} a circuit and [...] "" [...] is an XML-defined [...] "method" [...] within that circuit known as a fuseaction. The query-string variable name [...] "fuseaction" [...] can vary depending on configuration parameters, so not all applications using <b>Fusebox</b> need to use the action variable [...] "fuseaction".|$|E
50|$|<b>Fusebox</b> encourages, {{but does}} not enforce, {{separation}} of presentation logic from business logic. It uses a number of file naming conventions to encourage this separation: presentation files begin with dsp (display) or lay (layout), database access files begin with qry (query) and general business files begin with act (action). Typical file names are in the format prefix_filename like dsp_loginform.cfm. Additional naming conventions are used by some <b>Fusebox</b> developers {{but these are the}} most common ones.|$|E

5000|$|This release focused {{primarily}} on adding a set of conventions that allow the creation of <b>Fusebox</b> applications without XML configuration files. The use of these new features instead of XML is called [...] "implicit Fusebox".|$|E
50|$|A noted {{strength}} of ColdSpring {{is its ability}} to provide complementary services to other applications and frameworks. ColdSpring has been deeply embedded within the core of the Model-Glue framework since Model-Glue 2.0. Also, <b>Fusebox</b> since 5.0 ships with a ColdSpring-specific lexicon.|$|E
