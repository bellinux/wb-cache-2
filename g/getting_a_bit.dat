I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer {{on it or}} take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E
25|$|Durham Dynamos lost {{by seven}} wickets in the top-of-the-table clash at Arundel against Sussex Sharks. Dale Benkenstein won the toss and chose {{to have his}} Durham side bat first, as he made 57 not out from number five, but Durham still lost their last seven wickets for 66 to be 195 all out. James Kirtley was the main culprit with four for 29 but every Sussex bowler except Robin Martin-Jenkins got among the wickets. In reply, Ian Ward hit 93 off 75 balls, Chris Adams took 58 off 49, and Liam Plunkett was plundered for 46 off his four overs - {{including}} nine wides. In 29.3 of a possible 45 overs, the match was over, Sussex <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of Twenty20 practice in as they closed the gap {{at the top of}} the table to two points.|$|E
25|$|Durham Dynamos sorely {{missed their}} two {{international}} stars, Steve Harmison and Paul Collingwood, as they whimpered to a seven-wicket {{defeat in the}} top-of-the-table clash at Arundel against Sussex Sharks. Dale Benkenstein won the toss and chose to have his Durham side bat first, as he made 57 not out from number five, but there was woefully little support as Durham collapsed from 129 for 3 to 195 all out. James Kirtley was the main culprit with four for 29 but every Sussex bowler except Robin Martin-Jenkins got among the wickets. In reply, Ian Ward blitzed 93 off 75 balls, Chris Adams was just as punishing with 58 off 49, and Liam Plunkett was plundered for 46 off only four overs - including nine wides. In only 29.3 overs, the match was over, Sussex <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of Twenty20 practice in as they closed the gap {{at the top of}} the table to two points.|$|E

Just {{when he was going}} to sleep he came up with the lines: [...] "Sometimes you're better off dead, there's a gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head". The lyrics were inspired by T.S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land, particularly in the use of different narrative voices and arcane references. The song's lyrics are largely concerned with class, inner-city pressure. Tennant later said that some listeners had assumed the song referred to prostitutes, but was actually, [...] "about rough boys <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of posh." ...|$|E

We wanted to get fresh ideas, we felt we were <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> stale living in England." [...] For the album, songwriters Holder and Lea drew much inspiration from living in New York City.|$|E

Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we never did that. We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he's standing there next to me and he'd done quite a few passes and it wasn't going anywhere. I could see he was <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned around and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!"

2500|$|Grace captained England in the First Test of the 1899 {{series against}} Australia at Trent Bridge, {{when he was}} 51. By this time his bulk had made him a {{liability}} in the field and, afterwards, realising his limitations all too clearly, he decided to stand down and surrendered both his place and the captaincy to Archie MacLaren. It is evident that Grace [...] "plotted" [...] his own omission from the England team by asking C.B. Fry, another selector who had arrived late for their meeting, if he thought that MacLaren should play in the Second Test. Fry answered: [...] "Yes, I do." [...] "That settles it", said Grace, and he promptly retired from international cricket. Explaining his decision later, Grace ruefully admitted of his diminished fielding skills that [...] "the ground was <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too far away".|$|E

As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E

During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house".

2500|$|Though {{the closest}} of confidants, Beavis and Butt-Head have a jaded, violent, {{and at times}} {{borderline}} sadistic relationship. Butt-Head often insults and physically abuses Beavis (usually by slapping him, sometimes accompanied by a request to [...] "Settle down, Beavis!" [...] if Butt-Head feels his friend is <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too hyperactive, as he often does). On occasion, Beavis will fight back or stand up for himself (“Madame Blavatsky”, “They're Coming to Take Me Away, Huh Huh”). His favorite means of retribution is kicking Butt-Head in the testicles. On at least one occasion, Beavis throws the first punch. In [...] "Canoe", he initiates a fight by smacking Butt-Head across {{the head with a}} paddle (although Butt-Head goaded him into doing it). Butt-Head usually knows when Beavis is approaching his breaking point and will back off (as seen when he calls Beavis [...] "Buttknocker" [...] or insults Metallica one too many times). In [...] "Choke", he specifically states that Butt-Head is [...] "not really my friend". Nevertheless, it can be inferred that the duo are still best friends, considering their shared activities, residency, interests, and their lack of any other friends. The two usually complement each other when one makes any sort of endeavor, especially if it involves their lifelong goal to 'score with chicks'.|$|E
