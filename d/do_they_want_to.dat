Games marketed as Xbox One X Enhanced have specific optimizations for graphical fidelity on the console's hardware, while separate iconography {{is being used to}} denote games that natively run at 4K resolution, or support HDR. Existing games may receive updates to provide enhancements or additional 4K support for Xbox One X. Though Xbox Games marketing head Aaron Greenberg stated that Xbox One X will have no exclusive titles, general manager of game publishing Shannon Loftis remarked in a follow-up interview that he was not sure on this point, and exclusivity would be [...] "up to the game development community what <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Spencer also touted that Xbox One X's hardware could also be used to support virtual reality, noting that especially at a console price point, [...] "having something at six teraflops that will get millions of people buying it is very attractive to some of the VR companies that are out there already, and we've architected it such that something will be able to plug right in and work." [...] However, Microsoft has not yet announced any official plans for VR support on Xbox One X, stating that it wished to prioritize wireless VR efforts on console, and Windows Mixed Reality on PC.|$|E
