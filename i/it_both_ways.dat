All courtly love was erotic to some degree, and not purely platonic—the troubadours speak of the physical beauty of their ladies and the feelings and desires the ladies arouse in them. However, {{it is unclear what}} a poet should do: live a life of perpetual desire channeling his energies to higher ends, or physically consummate. Scholars have seen <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|E

It argued that the PUP leadership was still {{in a position to}} significantly influence the UVF and as such, the party could not have <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>ways</b> by associating with an active paramilitary organisation and not face any political consequences.|$|E

For another, their archness (Gothel sings with a forearm to her forehead) suggests that the filmmakers want to have <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>ways</b> — to be sincere and to sneer." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the song a negative review, feeling that it was equally as unmemorable as the other tracks and writing, [...] "It's hard to imagine someone humming ...

500|$|Ryan Bray, {{writer for}} Consequence of Sound, {{concluded}} So was an [...] "all-too-rare record that manages to have <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>ways,</b> earning its richly deserved critical and commercial respect without giving {{so much as}} an artistic inch". He added that [...] "it still stands on its own two feet as one of the consensus best records of the 80s". Mark Blake of Q described the album as [...] "carbon-dated to 1986 thanks to those blaring saxes and Fairlight CMI digital sampling synths". He added that [...] "Gabriel crafted an album of user-friendly pop that was still reassuringly odd." [...] Terry Staunton of Classic Rock wrote [...] "Red Rain was familiarly pensive and politically charged, but the radio waves completely surrendered to the record's muscular dance rock and slower tempo eloquence." [...] Staunton concluded that Gabriel had displayed [...] "a masterful confidence, delivering a satisfyingly unified whole".|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{generally}} positive reviews received by Mulan, critical reception towards the character's romantic relationship with Li Shang {{has been largely}} negative, drawing much speculation from critics who accused Mulan of having [...] "a typical girl-hooks-up-with-boy ending." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, [...] "The message here is standard feminist empowerment: Defy the matchmaker, dress as a boy, and choose your own career. But Mulan has <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>ways,</b> since inevitably Mulan's heart goes pitty-pat over Shang, the handsome young captain she's assigned to serve under. The movie breaks with the tradition in which the male hero rescues the heroine, but is still totally sold on the Western idea of romantic love." [...] The New York Times' Janet Maslin negatively opined, [...] "For all of Mulan's courage and independence in rebelling against the matchmakers, this is still enough of a fairy tale to need Mr. Right." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could even play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>ways.</b> This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit me with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut my tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E

The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>ways</b> because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E

On passing Wasim's record, McGrath said, [...] "Wasim Akram, to me, is one of the {{greatest}} bowlers of all time.

2500|$|A key {{moment in}} that race took place at an all-candidates debate in Montreal on June 2, 1990, where the {{discussion}} quickly turned to the Meech Lake Accord, which had emerged as the major policy issue that divided Martin and Chrétien. At the debate on June 2, 1990, Martin attempted to force Chrétien to abandon the latter's nuanced position on Meech Lake and speak out for or against it, arguing that his position of opposing Meech Lake as it is, but with willing to support with amendments was attempting to have <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>ways.</b> When Chrétien refused to endorse Meech as it was, young Liberal delegates crowding the hall began to chant [...] "vendu" [...] ("sellout" [...] in French), [...] "you're selling out to the Anglos" [...] and [...] "Judas" [...] at Chrétien. One of Chrétien's aides frenetically asked that Martin [...] "get the fuck {{out there and do}} something" [...] as the Young Liberals continue shouting abuse at Chrétien-to his clear discomfort-only to be told that Quebec youth were [...] "hotheads" [...] whom nobody could control. In private, Chrétien was deeply enraged by the incident, and claimed that the delegates shouting vendu at him were actually Martin supporters from Toronto, charging that their poor French had betrayed that they were not from Quebec. Martin denied involvement in 'coordinating' any response from the floor, or a similar outburst by his supporters at the convention.|$|E

40|$|Philosophical anarchists {{have made}} their living criticizing {{theories}} of state legitimacy and the duty to obey the law. The most prominent theories of state legitimacy have been called into doubt by the anarchists' insistence that citizens' lack of consent to the state renders the whole justificatory enterprise futile. Autonomy requires consent, they argue, and justification must respect autonomy. In this essay, I want {{to call into question}} the weight of consent in protecting our capacity for autonomy. I argue that if we care about all of the preconditions for autonomy, then we have good reasons to leave the state of nature. This leaves the philosophical anarchist with a dilemma. If she truly cares about autonomy, then she must welcome the state. But if she wants to deny the legitimacy of the state because of the value of consent, then she needs to downplay the moral significance of autonomy in people's lives. If autonomy matters, the state does too. If it doesn't, then consent doesn't. The philosophical anarchist can't have <b>it</b> <b>both</b> <b>way...</b>|$|R
