50|$|Since 2007 junior {{doctors have}} been {{receiving}} below inflation salary rises. The <b>independent</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Body</b> on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB) takes evidence {{from a range}} of sources and makes recommendations around pay; in 2015 they recommended a 1% pay increase. In 2005, the average starting earnings (salary plus bonuses) for a medical graduate was £32,086. In an inflationary environment all wage earners including doctors may find the buying power of their income becomes less, some describe this as a real terms cut in pay of 15% between 2007-2014, where the word cut does not actually indicate a wage reduction.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1970s, {{complaints}} against {{the police in}} Britain were dealt with internally, with no outside oversight, leading to public dissatisfaction amid allegations that misconduct and corruption were not being effectively dealt with. The 1976 Police Act established the Police Complaints Board, an <b>independent</b> <b>review</b> <b>body,</b> but following the Scarman Report in 1982 this {{was replaced by the}} more effective Police Complaints Authority, creating the background of the series. However, even today, under the current Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), the majority of {{complaints against}} the police are dealt with internally. The IPCC investigates the most serious cases, and deals with appeals.|$|E
5000|$|The pay {{of judges}} is {{determined}} by an <b>independent</b> pay <b>review</b> <b>body.</b> It makes recommendations to the government after taking evidence {{from a variety of}} sources.

As long as judges hold their positions in [...] "good order," [...] they remain in post until they wish to retire or until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70.|$|R
40|$|Eight new events (handball, basketball, and six rowing events) were {{introduced}} {{for women in}} the Olympic Games at Montreal in 1976. Of 187 women rowers who competed at Montreal, none was shorter than the mean height (162 cm, 64 in) of women aged 18 - 24 in the United States. In team events only two out of 250 participants were shorter than the reference mean. Even among the tall, it was the taller participants who won medals. What does the slogan "Sport for All" mean in this context? Moreover, the physical size required of champion rowers and basketball players is not to be found in some Asian, African, and Latin American populations. International contests in many such events therefore seem to be at variance with the first charter of the Olympic Games. An <b>independent</b> <b>reviewing</b> <b>body</b> is urgently needed to examine the merits of man made rules in many sporting contests...|$|R
50|$|As {{in other}} sectors, {{industrial}} relations under the Thatcher Government {{continued to be}} conflictual. Successive Health Ministers looked to hold down pay {{in the public sector}} and to outsource ancillary staff where possible. Following the 1983 Griffiths Report, the NHS also tried to import a business model more similar to the private sector with professional managers taking over cost control, reducing the power of the medical profession. There were disputes over all of these policies. In 1982 there was another conflict over pay restraint involving ancillaries and nurses. Campaigning by NUPE, COHSE and RCN won an interim pay rise for nurses who were also granted their own <b>independent</b> pay <b>review</b> <b>body,</b> as the doctors had been 20 years earlier. The status and pay for registered nurses subsequently tended to improve, particularly when nurse education was shifted to university degree courses under Project 2000 in 1986.|$|R
50|$|The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM) is the <b>independent</b> <b>review</b> <b>body</b> of the Australian Government {{responsible}} for reviewing the operation, effectiveness {{and implications of}} Australia’s counter‑terrorism and national security legislation on an ongoing basis. The INSLM also considers whether legislation contains appropriate safeguards for protecting the rights of individuals, remains proportionate to any threat of terrorism or {{threat to national security}} or both, and remains necessary. Australian security and intelligence agencies provide the INSLM with information (both classified and unclassified), relevant to the above functions. This is under compulsion in some circumstances. The INSLM makes recommendations on these matters in reports, which are then tabled in Parliament.|$|E
50|$|All {{human rights}} {{oriented}} mental health laws require {{proof of the}} presence of a mental disorder as defined by internationally accepted standards, but the type and severity of disorder that counts can vary in different jurisdictions. The two most often utilized grounds for involuntary admission are said to be serious likelihood of immediate or imminent danger to self or others, and the need for treatment. Applications for someone to be involuntarily admitted usually come from a mental health practitioner, a family member, a close relative, or a guardian. Human-rights-oriented laws usually stipulate that independent medical practitioners or other accredited mental health practitioners must examine the patient separately and that there should be regular, time-bound review by an <b>independent</b> <b>review</b> <b>body.</b> The individual should also have personal access to independent advocacy.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1948 and 1972 the NHS largely {{remained}} free of strikes, {{but nevertheless}} did experience some other industrial disputes. The {{foundation of the}} service was opposed by many doctors, particularly general practitioners, who feared that a state medical service would reduce their independence. Doctors expressed this opposition through their largest professional organisation, the British Medical Association, which held a number of ballots canvassing its members' (largely negative) opinions on arrangements for the new service. After a threat to boycott the new service, the BMA secured some concessions from Aneurin Bevan, the Minister of Health responsible for implementing the NHS Act. The BMA's intransigence did not stop the new health service coming into being, but did secure {{the right to be}} paid on a [...] "capitation" [...] basis (per patient) rather than on a set salary. More importantly for doctors the government's concessions established the conventional wisdom in the Ministry of Health that changes to the NHS were impossible without the consent of the medical profession, effectively giving doctors a [...] "medical veto". Winning consent from physicians remained a problem for Health Ministers, who faced regular complaints, particularly over pay. In 1962 the government gave up control over doctors' pay to the <b>independent</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Body</b> on Doctors and Dentists Remuneration.|$|E
40|$|At {{stake in}} the May 2013 {{publication}} of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5), are {{billions of dollars in}} insurance payments and government resources, as well as the diagnoses and treatment of millions of patients. We argue that the most recent revision process has missed social determinants of mental health disorders and their diagnosis: environmental factors triggering biological responses that manifest themselves inbehavior; differing cultural perceptions about what is normal and what is abnormal behavior; and institutional pressures related to such matters as insurance reimbursements, disability benefits, and pharmaceutical marketing. In addition, the experts charged with revising the DSM lack a systematic way to take population-level variations in diagnoses into account. To address these problems, we propose the creation of an <b>independent</b> research <b>review</b> <b>body</b> that would monitor variations in diagnostic patterns, inform future DSM revisions, identify needed changes inmental health policy and practice, and recommend new avenues of research. Drawing on the best available knowledge, the <b>review</b> <b>body</b> would make possible more precise and equitable psychiatric diagnoses and interventions. © 2013 Project HOPE- The People-to-People Health Foundation...|$|R

40|$|Research {{on music}} and {{language}} {{in recent decades}} has focused on their overlapping neurophysiological, perceptual, and cognitive underpinnings, ranging from the mechanism for encoding basic auditory cues to the mechanism for detecting violations in phrase structure. These overlaps have most often been identified in musicians with musical knowledge that was acquired explicitly, through formal training. In this paper, we <b>review</b> <b>independent</b> <b>bodies</b> of work in music and language that suggest an important role for implicitly acquired knowledge, implicit memory, and their associated neural structures in the acquisition of linguistic or musical grammar. These findings motivate potential new work that examines music and language comparatively {{in the context of}} the implicit memory system...|$|R

The audit of financial statements can only be performed by a Registered Auditor and is currently still required for all companies. The objective of the study is to determine the perceptions of Chartered Accountants (South Africa) regarding <b>independent</b> <b>reviews.</b> A questionnaire was used in order to obtain the perceptions of Chartered Accountants (South Africa) regarding <b>independent</b> <b>reviews.</b> This questionnaire covered the nature of an <b>independent</b> <b>review,</b> determinants of audit exemption, performing an <b>independent</b> <b>review,</b> and practitioners deemed competent to perform an <b>independent</b> <b>review.</b> The study also evaluated whether Chartered Accountants (South Africa), who are not allowed to perform audits, do in fact qualify to perform <b>independent</b> <b>reviews.</b> The respondents confirm the need for a principle-based stand-alone set of <b>independent</b> <b>review</b> standards as this is likely to clarify the terminology and to enhance the quality of reviews. The study also reveals that Chartered Accountants (South Africa) meet the requirements to perform <b>independent</b> <b>reviews.</b> However, the <b>Independent</b> Regulatory Board for Auditors should oversee the regulation of Chartered Accountants (South Africa) performing <b>independent</b> <b>reviews</b> to ensure that <b>independent</b> <b>reviews</b> are also performed in the public interest.
