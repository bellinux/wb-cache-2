Using a sample of 367 Taiwanese market and 210 South Korean hierarchy organizations, this study differentiates the role <b>of</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> DLMs in these organizations to provide more robust insights into DCs exploitation in polar governance structures. This study posits that learning intent and embedded learning are important primary antecedent <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> DCs exploitation.

A qualitative research method, including interviews and focus groups, is used to test the model. At the early stage of environmental transformation in the wine industry, we find that managerial attitudes and norms, existing regulations, employee welfare and competitive pres-sures are all strong <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> proactive environmental behavior. However, our multi-level analysis suggests that <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> environmentalism vary in relevance and relative importance and that future environmental management research needs to consider the relationship between <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> environmentalism and the stage of an industry’...|$|R

This paper is written especially for the students of business management to enhance their knowledge about supply chain practices. Methodology- The paper contains qualitative approach. In first phase the authors reviewed literature about the <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> supply chain performance. In second phase the data from internationally published articles were collected and suggest a framework to manage the <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> supply chain performance. Findings- The whole study concluded that there are six <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> supply chain performance in literature that need to be managed to enhance organizational performance. These drivers are; Facilities, Inventory, Transportation, Information, Sourcing and pricing. These drivers are closely related with each other and have a greater impact on organizational performance. Organizations need to find a situation where both efficiency and responsiveness in supply chain practices are at average level to enhance their performance. This average level can only be achieved through better management <b>of</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> supply chain performance.
