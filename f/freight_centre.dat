In the 1860s, Thomas Elder took up vast areas in the northern Flinders region and called the property Mount Lyndhurst.|$|E
5000|$|The Großbeeren {{intermodal}} <b>freight</b> <b>centre</b> (Güterverkehrszentrum, GVZ), {{which is}} of considerable importance for supplying Berlin, was built in 1998 and enlarged in 2005. Its terminal for combined transport is located east of the Anhalt Railway and consists of a container terminal with two gantry cranes, an access road for container trucks and a service centre for containers. There are two tracks with a usable length of 700 m and two tracks with a usable length of 350 m. Each year, up to 100,000 TEU can be handled at the centre. The operator is Deutsche Umschlaggesellschaft Schiene-Straße (DUSS), a Deutsche Bahn subsidiary. Due to its high traffic, a 40-acre extension to the centre was completed in the [...] "Am Lilograben" [...] area {{to the west of}} the Anhalt Railway in 2014. To connect to the existing intermodal terminal, a road bridge was built over the railway line with funding from the European Regional Development Fund. Currently (as of 2014) 6,200 people work in the <b>freight</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|E
50|$|Until the 1960s {{the main}} {{outbound}} traffic was agricultural produce, wool, firewood, timber; along with incoming supplies for town.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a stated-preference study aimed at {{investigating}} how transport decisions are made by receivers or by transport operators about the potential use of an urban <b>freight</b> consolidation <b>centre</b> in the city of Fano, Italy. Because there are no revealed preference data, a stated-choice methodology is used. The stated-choice experiments present two alternatives—one using a private vehicle subject to various traffic regulations and one using the urban <b>freight</b> consolidation <b>centre</b> with varying cost and efficiency levels. Conventional discrete choice data modelling shows that the potential demand is influenced mainly by the distance of the parking bay from the shop, by access permit cost, by the service cost of the urban <b>freight</b> consolidation <b>centre,</b> and by the delay in delivery time. Simulations are then performed to assess how the potential demand is affected by various incentives and regulations affecting urban goods distribution...|$|R

50|$|The {{track is}} used by freight trains, running from Falkenberg/Elster for {{instance}} or formed in Eilenburg and running towards the <b>freight</b> <b>centre</b> in Halle (Saale). Moreover, {{it has become increasingly}} important for freight to and from Eastern Europe, branching in Falkenberg via Hoyerswerda to Węgliniec to Poland (Węgliniec-Roßlau railway). After the completion of the construction work between Horka and Hoyerswerda, traffic on the line, according to Deutsche Bahn publicity, will increase from the current 40 freight trains to 160 freight trains daily on the Falkenberg-Eilenburg-Halle/Leipzig section, thus making the line a major international freight route.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{the study}} of November 1991, the PBDE {{prepared}} the preliminary design, which was confirmed by the ZHvDR in late 1992. Simultaneously, a consultation of state and environmental planning organisations took place with the participation of the states and the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation. An investigation was made of the corridor to establish route options at a scale of 1:100,000. Among other things, conflicts and risks for spatial and environmental compatibility as well as effects on railway operations and economic aspects were taken into account. Among other things, the connection of the city of Halle, Leipzig/Halle Airport, the Leipzig Trade Fair and the <b>freight</b> <b>centres</b> in Erfurt and Leipzig were considered. The new line would not only shorten travel times, but also relieve the existing network. The axis between Erfurt and Halle was considered by the Reichsbahn as congested or overloaded.|$|R

50|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the year 2012, the First Phase of the construction project of the New Port has been completed and progression to the Second Phase has begun in late 2013 and was completed by 2016, when the Third Phase of the constriction begun. With the completion of the First phase, Igoumenitsa has become a modern, large port in the Mediterranean Sea, able to serve passenger, commercial and tourist traffic. The completion of the Second Phase, enabled the port to serve large cruise ships. Also, the planned creation of a <b>freight</b> <b>centre</b> in a section within the port area, is estimated to greatly strengthen the commercial traffic and turn the city of Igoumenitsa into an international logistics centre.|$|E
50|$|Shipping {{services}} from Bairnsdale to metropolitan areas {{linked with the}} railway so local primary producers could send their goods off to the markets in the major centre of Melbourne. As {{a consequence of the}} more frequent use of rail and the advent of refrigerated carts in 1890 which allowed dairy farmers and fishermen to appropriately transport their produce, the last coach service between Sale and Bairnsdale ran in 1889. In World War II rail services were reduced with only three trains per week direct to Bairnsdale but services were restored in 1948. In 1952 diesel trains were first used on the line and the daily train from Melbourne to Bairnsdale was named The Gippslander. Victorian Railways established the Bairnsdale station as a regional <b>freight</b> <b>centre</b> in 1977.|$|E
5000|$|The {{line would}} connect the Western Line {{just east of}} Avondale Train Station with the Southern Line at Auckland <b>Freight</b> <b>Centre,</b> Southdown. The reopening in 2010 of the Onehunga Branch to {{passenger}} traffic may make it more feasible for the line to connect with that branch in Onehunga township. New Zealand Railways Corporation owns most of the corridor for the line, which follows Oakley Creek {{and part of the}} State Highway 20 corridor. The SH20 extension from Hillsborough to Mount Roskill made provision for the line's construction. The line would cross over the entrance to the proposed SH20 Waterview Connection.

40|$|Urban <b>freight</b> {{consolidation}} <b>centres</b> {{are part}} of the city logistics measures that aim to reduce the negative impacts related to urban freight transport activities, whilst at the same time providing a more seamless, higher-value logistics experience for their users. By collecting the goods destined to the target area and consolidating deliveries into one large delivery made by high-load vehicles, urban consolidation centres can relieve congestion and improve air quality. Significant benefits also accrue to the participating retailers, e. g. improved staff productivity and safety, the provision of pre-retailing services and recycling of packaging. The paper draws on the experiences of the Bristol-Bath <b>freight</b> consolidation <b>centre</b> (BBFCC), established in 2002 to serve Bristol city centre and uniquely extended in 2011 to cover Bath, each served by electric lorries; it appraises the benefits of shared ‘last mile’ freight services focusing in particular on the perspective of its users: the participating retailers...|$|R

50|$|The {{double-track}} line {{begins in}} Michendorf station, where it separates {{there from the}} Berlin-Blankenheim railway. The line runs to the east. In Saarmund it joins the also double-track line of the Berlin Outer Ring from Golm. Beyond Genshagener Heide station and the crossing of the Anhalt railway opened in 1926, the Michendorf-Großbeeren railway separates from the Outer Ring and runs to the north as a single track {{on the eastern side}} of the Anhalt line. Originally the line connected in Großbeeren station to the Anhalt line. Since its reconstruction in 2006, it has only connected to the Großbeeren intermodal <b>freight</b> <b>centre</b> (Güterverkehrszentrum, GVZ) and the Teltow freight yard. A direct connection to Berlin no longer exists. Traffic between the Outer Ring and the Anhalt line in the Berlin area has since been operated over a new connection curve to the west of the Anhalt line.|$|E
50|$|The line {{continues}} {{to the southwest}} past Saaleck, {{through a series of}} bends in the valley of the Ilm, which it crosses four times. The area around the town of Bad Sulza is also known as Thuringian Tuscany because its gently rolling hills with their vineyards and mild climate recalls Tuscany. The next major town on the Thuringian Railway is Apolda. Until 150 years ago it was still a small farming town with about 2,500 inhabitants, but the construction of the railway line and the growth of the textile industry gave an enormous boost to the town and by 1900 it had nearly 25,000 residents. Further southwest, the next Intercity-Express stop is reached at Weimar. The station, from which the Woodland Railway branches off to the east towards Jena and Gera, is relatively far from the inner city. In Weimar, the Thuringian Railway leaves the valley of the Ilm and initially runs west along the foot of the Ettersberg (Etter Mountain) and then through the flat Thuringian Basin, where, about 20 kilometres from Weimar, the line reaches Erfurt, the state capital of Thuringia. From Weimar the line is also part of the Mid-Germany Connection. In the Erfurt suburb of Vieselbach there is a rail <b>freight</b> <b>centre</b> on the line and east of Erfurt Hauptbahnhof there is a large marshalling yard and a freight yard. Just before the Hauptbahnhof, the new line from Halle/Leipzig, the Nordhausen-Erfurt railway and the Nordhausen-Erfurt railway connect to the Thuringian Railway from the north. Erfurt Hauptbahnhof was extensively remodelled from 2003 to 2008 as part of the building of a high-speed line from Nuremberg via Erfurt to Halle/Leipzig (see Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway and Nuremberg-Erfurt high-speed railway). The northern section between Erfurt and Halle/Leipzig was put into operation on 13 December 2015. The southern section to Nuremberg is expected to open at the timetable change in December 2017.|$|E
30|$|The {{variety of}} {{logistics}} hubs – {{each with its}} own and specific characteristics – hampers an explicit assignment of hubs to specific a type and class. In order to enable a typification, however, a simplistic differentiation is very often {{made on the basis of}} a spatial or functional analysis [8, 14, 37]. The following examples will illustrate the possible differentiation: A spatial differentiation can be made according to the spatial level (micro, meso, macro), for instance. Therefore, a transport logistics hub can be defined as hub (micro level) as well as a sea port (macro level). Regarding the functional differentiation, logistics hubs may consist of individual modules (e.g., single shipping facility) or several modules (intermodal terminal with rail <b>freight</b> <b>centre</b> and freight forwarders). Following from this, a plurality of hubs may be identified [19, 38].|$|E
