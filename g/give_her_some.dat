T. to get information on Beauty of Nature's deal with a Japanese department store, he lets Ashley in on his and her brother Jack's (Peter Bergman) plans to obtain Beauty of Nature. Ashley and Tucker go to Japan and discover Victor's daughter, Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), bribing the Japanese Minister of Zoning with an antique gun. They commiserate over how their mother's abandoned them and make love for the first time.

Tucker buys Abby a horse for her birthday, her parents disapprove and he and Ashley get engaged on Christmas Eve.|$|E
500|$|Kaif's {{paternal}} parentage {{has been questioned}} by {{some members of the}} film industry. In a 2011 interview with Mumbai Mirror, Boom producer Ayesha Shroff accused Kaif of fabricating her history: [...] "We created an identity for her. She was this pretty young English girl, and we gave her the Kashmiri father and thought of calling her Katrina Kazi. We thought we'd <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>some</b> kind of Indian ancestry, to connect with the audience... But then we thought that Kazi sounded too... religious?... Mohammad Kaif was at the top, and so we said, Katrina Kaif sounds really great". Kaif called Shroff's comments [...] "hurtful".|$|E
500|$|The {{episodes of}} the series have a {{distinct}} structure: Veronica investigates a different [...] "case of the week" [...] while continually trying to solve a larger mystery which spans several episodes or a whole season. The first two seasons of Veronica Mars have a season-long mystery arc, which is introduced in the first episode {{of the season and}} solved in the finale. The third season takes on a different format, focusing on two smaller mystery arcs that last the course of nine and six episodes respectively. The final five episodes of the season feature stand-alone mysteries. During the first season, Thomas was unsure if the success {{of the series}} was attributed to the [...] "case of the week" [...] each episode, or the overarching story. He realized that fans were cool with the [...] "case of the week", but came back for the ongoing mystery. Thomas felt that Bell had been overworked in the first season, and the mystery involving Logan and Weevil in the second season was an attempt to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>some</b> time off. He said that the mystery arcs of the second season had [...] "way too many suspects, way too many red herrings", and that the third season needed a change.|$|E

500|$|While Leigh made Streetcar in 1951, Olivier {{joined her}} in Hollywood to film Carrie, {{based on the}} {{controversial}} novel Sister Carrie; although the film was plagued by troubles, Olivier received warm reviews and a BAFTA nomination. Olivier began to notice a change in Leigh's behaviour, and he later recounted that [...] "I would find Vivien sitting {{on the corner of}} the bed, wringing her hands and sobbing, in a state of grave distress; I would naturally try desperately to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>some</b> comfort, but for some time she would be inconsolable." [...] After a holiday with Coward in Jamaica, she seemed to have recovered, but Olivier later recorded, [...] "I am sure that... must have taken some pains to tell me what was wrong with my wife; that her disease was called manic depression and what that meant—a possibly permanent cyclical to-and-fro between the depths of depression and wild, uncontrollable mania. He also recounted the years of problems he had experienced because of Leigh's illness, writing, [...] "throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness—an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other critics {{often called}} her voice weak and thin. In {{reviewing}} for her second studio album Fear of Flying, Jon Azpiri of AllMusic commented that [...] "she is a promising young talent, but still {{has yet to}} develop the chops necessary to rank among the best of R divas." [...] Rolling Stone stated, [...] "The signature quiver in Mýa's voice does <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>some</b> sonic identity, but otherwise {{this could be the}} music of Destiny's Child, Aaliyah or any of the countless interchangeable hip-hop/R divas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some sources {{describe}} Ada Douglas Wetherill as a French princess. [...] In fact, she {{was neither}} French nor a princess. [...] This {{is very likely}} a fiction created to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>some</b> legitimacy later in life. [...] Wetherill had been Duleep's mistress before he {{decided to return to}} India with his family, and upon being stopped in Aden by the British authorities he abandoned his family and moved to Paris, where she joined him. [...] She stayed with him through his years in Paris and also travelled with him to St Petersburg, Russia, where he failed to persuade the Czar of the benefits of invading India through the north and reinstalling him as ruler.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the rest}} of Catfish Row prepares for the church picnic on nearby Kittiwah Island, Sportin' Life again offers to take Bess to New York with him; she refuses. He {{attempts}} to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>some</b> [...] "happy dust" [...] despite her claims that she's given up drugs, but Porgy grabs his arm and scares him off. Sportin' Life leaves, reminding Bess as he goes that her men friends come and go, but he will be there all along. Bess and Porgy are now left alone, and express their {{love for each other}} ("Bess, You Is My Woman Now"). The chorus re-enters in high spirits as they prepare to leave for the picnic ("Oh, I can't sit down"). Bess is invited to the picnic by Maria, but she demurs as Porgy cannot come (due to his disability, he cannot get on the boat), but Maria insists. Bess leaves Porgy behind as they go off to the picnic. Porgy watches the boat leave ("I got plenty o' nuttin" [...] reprise).|$|E
