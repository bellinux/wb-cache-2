5|$|On August 27, <b>Falcons</b> owner Arthur Blank {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that the <b>Falcons</b> would seek to recover a portion of Vick's signing bonus. He said the team had no {{immediate}} plans to cut ties with Vick, citing salary-cap issues. It initially appeared that Goodell had cleared the way for the <b>Falcons</b> to release Vick, since he ruled that Vick's involvement in gambling activity breached his contract. On August 29, the <b>Falcons</b> sent a letter to Vick demanding that he reimburse them for $20 million of his $37 million bonus. The case was sent to arbitration, and on October 10, an arbitrator ruled that Vick had to reimburse the <b>Falcons</b> for $19.97 million. The arbitrator agreed with the Falcons' contention that Vick knew he was engaging in illegal activity when he signed his new contract in 2004, and that he had used the bonus money to pay for the operation.|$|E
