5|$|It {{is easier}} to attack than to <b>defend.</b> <b>A</b> {{defending}} mistake can have bigger consequences than an attacking mistake. Thus, the defender {{needs to be more}} precise, which in turn can lead to a time advantage for the attacker.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Dutch Champions AZ Alkmaar {{approached}} Jess to {{join them}} and become the first overseas player in the Eredivisie. Jess won back to back league titles during the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 seasons, and were on track to <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> third title during the 2010/2011 season when she left {{to come back to}} the UK.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} become world {{champion}} for the third time, Sebastian Vettel needed to <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> 13-point advantage over Fernando Alonso meaning the Spaniard needed at least third place even if the German failed to score. Conversely, a fourth place was sufficient for Vettel even if Alonso won.|$|E

5|$|In the 2015 {{edition of}} tournament, hosted by England, New Zealand once again won the final, this time against {{established}} rivals, Australia. In doing so, {{they became the}} first team in World Cup history to win three titles, {{as well as the}} first to successfully <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> title. It was also New Zealand's first title victory on foreign soil.|$|E
5|$|Many birds {{actively}} <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> territory {{from others}} {{of the same species}} during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.|$|E
5|$|Many dragonflies, {{particularly}} males, are territorial. Some <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> territory {{against others}} {{of their own}} species, some against other species of dragonfly and a few against insects in unrelated groups. A particular perch may give a dragonfly a good view over an insect-rich feeding ground, and the blue dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis) jostles other dragonflies to maintain the right to alight there.|$|E

5|$|Solitary animals <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> {{territory}} and avoid social {{interactions with the}} members of its species, except during breeding season. This is to avoid resource competition, as two individuals of the same species would occupy the same niche, and to prevent depletion of food. A solitary animal, while foraging, can also be less conspicuous to predators or prey.|$|E
5|$|Termites rely {{on alarm}} {{communication}} to <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> colony. Alarm pheromones can be released when the nest has been breached or is {{being attacked by}} enemies or potential pathogens. Termites always avoid nestmates infected with Metarhizium anisopliae spores, through vibrational signals released by infected nestmates. Other methods of defence include intense jerking and secretion of fluids from the frontal gland and defecating faeces containing alarm pheromones.|$|E

5|$|The {{player has}} {{a set of}} binoculars. While it is {{generally}} ignored during infantry-limited gameplay, {{it is vital to}} the long-range use of the Crusader tanks and one of the missions in which the player must direct artillery fire to <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> town. It is also important for scouting, though most of the game takes place in personal, close combat situations reducing the importance of this tactic.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, Phoenix's {{reputation}} takes a hit when {{he fails to}} properly <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> former client, Maggey Byrde, against accusations that she poisoned a talented programmer, Glen Elg. Convinced that someone impersonated him, Phoenix secures a retrial and conducts his own investigation. He discovers that Elg was developing a computer virus on behalf of loan shark Furio Tigre, and that Tigre, needing money to repay a large debt, killed him to steal it, then arranged for Maggey to take the fall. With no conclusive evidence, Phoenix manages to get Tigre arrested by making him say something only the real killer would know.|$|E
5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to {{a safe place to}} train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was wary of trying to <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> fixed position – the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they {{do not need to be}} as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E
5|$|As the {{defending}} champion, Kuznetsova took a wildcard into the Kremlin Cup, {{knowing that she}} had to win the title to qualify for Singapore. Kuznetsova handled the pressure well; defeating Alizé Cornet, Tímea Babos, Elina Svitolina and Daria Gavrilova in the final to win the title. This win automatically took the place in the last spot at WTA Finals {{for the first time since}} 2009 and also meant that Kuznetsova managed to successfully <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> title for the first time in her career.|$|E
5|$|Breeding pairs {{must have}} a {{territory}} of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are found}} in nature and are also {{designed}} and produced as part of pharmacology and biochemistry. Natural poisons are often enzyme inhibitors that have evolved to <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> plant or animal against predators. These natural toxins include {{some of the most}} poisonous compounds known. Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be insecticides such as malathion, herbicides such as glyphosate, or disinfectants such as triclosan. Other artificial enzyme inhibitors block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine, and are used as nerve agents in chemical warfare.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s {{during the}} American Civil War, housing for {{a battery of}} four field {{artillery}} pieces was constructed {{at the tip of}} the peninsula. It was used to <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> prison for Confederate soldiers on nearby Johnson's Island. Louis Zistel, a German immigrant, built two boats to transport the prisoners. In 1870, he began to ferry locals to the Cedar Point peninsula, which was regaining popularity as a summer picnic destination. Zistel opened a bathhouse on the north shore of the peninsula and the same year built a beer garden with a small dance floor. He charged 25 cents per person to ride from Sandusky to Cedar Point on his boat, Young Reindeer. This marked the beginning of commercial tourism on the Cedar Point peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Robben's first {{participation}} at {{an international}} tournament came at UEFA Euro 2004 when manager Dick Advocaat called up younger players, such as Wesley Sneijder and John Heitinga. During the group stage of the tournament, Advocaat substituted Robben in the 66th minute to <b>defend</b> <b>a</b> 2–1 lead over the Czech Republic. The Czechs, however, then scored two goals and won 3–2, which led to criticism about Advocaat's decision. In the quarter-finals, Robben scored the deciding kick in the penalty shootout between the Netherlands and Sweden, which ensured that at the fifth attempt, the Dutch finally won a shootout.|$|E
