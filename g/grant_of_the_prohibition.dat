40|$|Harmony is one {{of three}} major {{elements}} in the music. Harmonics are <b>the</b> basic theory <b>of</b> composition. There are several kinds of prohibitions in relation to the chord progression in <b>the</b> rules <b>of</b> Harmonics. When composers compose music pieces, they pay attention not to contain these <b>prohibitions.</b> <b>The</b> <b>prohibitions</b> are empirically- defined with giving the musical expressions to melody processes by try and error. Even so, there are few studies that are quantitatively examined <b>the</b> perceptual effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prohibitions.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> authors have investigated <b>the</b> perceptual effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prohibition</b> quantitatively. <b>The</b> present study deals with the psychological tests and the physiological measurements using electro-encephalograph (EEG) in listening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chord progressions. When subjects listened to the chord progression including the consecutive chord with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prohibitions,</b> how subjects perceive to the consecutive chord by <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> paired comparisons test and how the chord progression induces “P 300 ” by EEG in physiological experiment. Psychological results suggest that subjects can distinguish the consecutive chord with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prohibitions.</b> P 300 was elicited by <b>the</b> <b>prohibition</b> in <b>the</b> physiological experiment. These results suggest that there is a different response <b>of</b> listening to <b>the</b> consecutive chord with <b>the</b> <b>prohibition...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{requirement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> reformatio in peius {{may arise}} {{taking into consideration}} several basic principles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criminal procedure. The most important element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> reformatio in peius {{is that it is}} a legal guarantee for the defence to be able to file an appeal without the risk that a judgment might be altered to <b>the</b> detriment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused. Therefore, the accused will have confidence that the appeal will not do wrong to his interest. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> reformatio in peius can only be considered as a legal favour, but at the same time, many problems and counterarguments are being discussed regarding <b>the</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> reformatio in peius, such as <b>the</b> violation <b>of</b> fundamental principles and constitutionality. This paper examines the reasons for <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> reformatio in peius in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criminal procedure while arguing its connection to <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> constitutionality. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} <b>the</b> international regime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> biological weapons. It theoretically delimits the regime by defining the terms international regime and biological weapon. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> this thesis is to evaluate <b>the</b> effectivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international regime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> biological weapons and to delineate its presumable {{evolution in the}} future. The thesis presents the historical development and <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> biological weapons, their <b>prohibition</b> until <b>the</b> completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international regime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> biological weapons in its narrowest form. It also focuses on <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normative pillars which support the narrowly defined regime. The pillars are the Geneva Protocol (1925) and the Biological Weapons Convention. This thesis summarizes the most important events {{that occurred during the}} negotiations over <b>the</b> lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regime. It provides an assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international regime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> biological weapons based on <b>the</b> criteria <b>of</b> efficiency, which in this case is seen as the ability to enforce compliance with the regime, verify that it is respected and if not, as the ability to punish the violators. Given the current regime condition and the ongoing discussions relevant to the topic, <b>the</b> presumable evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regime in the future is delineated. In conclusion, based on the chosen methodology, <b>the</b> international regime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> biological weapons seems to be rather ineffective, however, in the future there may be an improvement...|$|R
