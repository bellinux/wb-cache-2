40|$|The use {{of large}} volume {{injections}} {{has been studied}} for the verification of intact organophosphorus chemical warfare agents in water samples. As the use of ethyl acetate caused severe detection problems new potential solvents were evaluated. With the developed procedure, the nerve agents sarin, tabun, soman, DFP and VX can be determined in <b>freshly</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>water</b> samples at ppt levels. Except for the nerve agent tabun all other agents added to the water samples were still present after 8 days at 20 - 60 % levels, if the pH of the water sample is adjusted to ca. 5 shortly after sampling and adjusted to pH 7 for analysis...|$|E
30|$|Main {{components}} of iron gall inks (IGI) are hydrolysable extracts from plant materials containing mainly gallotannins and ferrous sulfate [15]. A <b>freshly</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>water</b> solution of ink is a colorless complex of Fe (II) with gallic acid. Writing means gain their typical color by oxidation of Fe (II) into Fe (III) supplying the deep black-blue complex with gallates. With {{the passage of}} time, a degradation process of paper support was taking place [16]. This “iron gall inks corrosion” {{is considered to be}} directly caused by two particular mechanisms: acid hydrolysis of cellulose (in excess of acidic compound presented in IGI) and the oxidative degradation of paper support catalyzed by the transitional metals (Fe, Cu) [17]. After the absorption of light, an excited state of deep-blue complex is created and its reaction with the other ingredients leads to a decomposition into the brown colored compounds [18]. Visual signs of corrosion are brown rims in the ink areas and brown strike through patches of ink appearing on verso.|$|E

Chromatography was performed at 30  °C with a Grace Alltima C 18 column (250  mm ×  4.6  mm, 5  μm) protected by a C 18 guard column (10  mm ×  4.6  mm, 5  μm).

Injection volume was 50  μl, and flow rate was set at 0.7  ml/min with detection wavelength at 280  nm and reference wavelength at 580  nm. The interface and mass spectrum detector (MSD) parameters employed were as follows: nebulizer pressure, 50 psi; dry gas, 5.0  l/min; dry gas temperature, 350  °C; vaporizer temperature: 400  °C; scan range 100 – 1100  m/z; target mass, 500  m/z; compound stability, 100  %.

Samples of HQ extracts were <b>freshly</b> <b>prepared</b> in <b>water</b> (10  mg/ml). Authentic standards and extract samples were diluted (methanol–water, 50 : 50, vol/vol) to the desired concentrations. 6 -hydroxyflavone {{was used as the}} internal standard (I.S.), and 10  μl of I.S. (50  μg/ml) was used with 50  μl of individual sample. The quantitative method used in this study was validated based on the detection of baicalin, baicalein, wogonoside and wogonin.|$|R
