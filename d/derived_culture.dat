5000|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of the genomes and transcriptomes of HEK 293 and five derivative cell lines compared the HEK 293 transcriptome with that of human kidney, adrenal, pituitary and central nervous tissue. The HEK 293 pattern most closely resembled that of adrenal cells, which have many neuronal properties. Given {{the location of the}} adrenal gland (adrenal means [...] "next to the kidney"), a few adrenal cells could plausibly have appeared in an embryonic kidney <b>derived</b> <b>culture,</b> and could be preferentially transformed by adenovirus. Adenovirus transforms neuronal lineage cells much more efficiently than typical human kidney epithelial cells. An embryonic adrenal precursor cell therefore seems the most likely origin cell of the HEK 293 line. As a consequence, HEK 293 cells should not be used as an in vitro model of typical kidney cells.|$|E

The results showed a linear relationship between the mass of biomass {{at the start of the}} first order degradation phase (X&# 8320;) and the first order hydrolysis rate (r) for both rumen inoculated and leachate inoculated cellulose digestions and that the slopes of these relationships were not distinguishable. This suggested that differences in the microbial community, media and other environmental factors had a lesser impact on the hydrolysis rate compared to the effect of the number of cells in the system. This could be of great importance to industrial applications of anaerobic digestion technologies as it suggested that if cells densities in the waste treatment digesters could be boosted to match those seen in the rumen, then the rates of the cellulose hydrolysis would rise...|$|E

The neurons produced displayed molecular phenotypes similar to those normally derived from each of these regions in vivo.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) are an {{important}} component of the innate immune system, which modulate the adaptive immune response. As a professional APC, DCs are often targeted in vaccine research and immunotherapeutic development. Most studies mass-produce mature DCs in late-phase in vitro cultures using mainly GM-CSF. However, DC-based therapy, especially for cancer, has largely been unsuccessful. Furthermore, the use of GM-CSF for DC generation can also produce myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The presence of these cells may have contributed to the lack of response from the in vitro DCs. In this thesis, we investigated the properties, such as phenotype, endocytosis, activation and functionality, of early GM-CSF and GM-CSF + IL- 4 derived DCs and MDSCs. We also attempted to explore the possible use of the early GM-CSF derived DCs in cancer therapy by exposing them to in vitro cancer cell lines. Whilst the results from this study revealed several promising aspects of the early GM-CSF <b>derived</b> <b>culture,</b> these findings still warrant further research before they can be integrated into the development of future vaccine and immunotherapeutic treatments...|$|E
40|$|Background. Expression {{of human}} CD 133 (human prominin- 1) in cancer cells has been {{postulated}} to be {{a marker of}} stemness and is considered as a putative marker of cancer stem cells (CSCs). We designed a study to describe the expression pattern of CD 133 in normal skin and in epithelial cutaneous neoplasms. Methods. The CD 133 immunohistochemical expression of forty-three eccrine and apocrine tumors was compared to that observed in other epithelial tumors of the skin. In addition, flow cytometry was used to detect the CD 133 expression of four epithelial skin neoplasms, including one porocarcinoma. Results. CD 133 immunoreactivity at the apical or at the apicolateral surface of cells forming glandular structures was observed. Cells from solid areas of benign or malignant tumors were not stained. The porocarcinoma <b>derived</b> <b>culture</b> cells showed a 22 % of CD 133 positive cells using flow cytometry, while squamous cell carcinoma cultures contained less than 0. 1 %. Conclusions. These observations indicate that CD 133 is a specific marker of glandular differentiation that could {{be included in the}} diagnostic panel of cutaneous tumors with possible eccrine or apocrine differentiation.

40|$|Background. Scaffolds for bone tissue {{engineering}} (BTE) can be loaded with stem and progenitor cells (SPC) from different sources to improve osteogenesis. SPC {{can be found}} in bone marrow, adipose tissue, and other tissues. Little is known about osteogenic potential of adipose-derived culture expanded, adherent cells (A-CEAC). This study compares in vivo osteogenic capacity between A-CEAC and bone marrow <b>derived</b> <b>culture</b> expanded, adherent cells (BM-CEAC). Method. A-CEAC and BM-CEAC were isolated from five female sheep and seeded on hydroxyapatite granules prior to subcutaneous implantation in immunodeficient mice. The doses of cells in the implants were 0. 5 × 106, 1. 0 × 106, or 1. 5 × 106 A-CEAC and 0. 5 × 106 BM-CEAC, respectively. After eight weeks, bone volume versus total tissue volume (BV/TV) was quantified using histomorphometry. Origin of new bone was assessed using human vimentin (HVIM) antibody staining. Results. BM-CEAC yielded significantly higher BV/TV than any A-CEAC group, and differences between A-CEAC groups were not statistically significant. HVIM antibody stain was successfully used to identify sheep cells in this model. Conclusion. A-CEAC and BM-CEAC were capable of forming bone, and BM-CEAC yielded significantly higher BV/TV than any A-CEAC group.

No haploid material of C. annuum could be obtained, so diploid <b>derived</b> <b>cultures</b> alone were used for this species. A plating method was devised in which small aggregates from the cell suspensions were incorporated into a thin layer of agar medium in Petri dishes, and exposed to the selection pressures in this form. Using these methods, lines of both species were selected with improved chilling tolerance, high temperature tolerance and high salt resistance, in some cases chemical mutagens were shown to increase the yield of lines selected as tolerant. Many tolerant lines were maintained in culture for a number of passages and a proportion of them maintained their tolerance through extended periods {{in the absence of the}} selection pressures. For three chilling tolerant lines of N. sylvestris, fertile plants were regenerated and two of these exhibited the maintenance of an improved tolerant phenotype in the seedlings.

40|$|Quantitative Fitness Analysis (QFA) is an {{experimental}} and computational workflow for comparing fitnesses of microbial cultures grown in parallel 1, 2, 3, 4. QFA {{can be applied}} to focused observations of single cultures but is most useful for genome-wide genetic interaction or drug screens investigating up to thousands of independent cultures. The central experimental method is the inoculation of independent, dilute liquid microbial cultures onto solid agar plates which are incubated and regularly photographed. Photographs from each time-point are analyzed, producing quantitative cell density estimates, which are used to construct growth curves, allowing quantitative fitness measures to be <b>derived.</b> <b>Culture</b> fitnesses can be compared to quantify and rank genetic interaction strengths or drug sensitivities. The effect on culture fitness of any treatments added into substrate agar (e. g. small molecules, antibiotics or nutrients) or applied to plates externally (e. g. UV irradiation, temperature) can be quantified by QFA. The QFA workflow produces growth rate estimates analogous to those obtained by spectrophotometric measurement of parallel liquid cultures in 96 -well or 200 -well plate readers. Importantly, QFA has significantly higher throughput compared with such methods. QFA cultures grow on a solid agar surface and are therefore well aerated during growth without the need for stirring or shaking.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{summarize}} the outcomes of a detailed research study carried out as part of the fulfilment of a doctoral programme which examined the relationships between, and impacts of organisational culture on construction performance within a Hong Kong context.

The significance of the research was to advance knowledge of the importance of organisational culture strength as a performance driver in the construction industry and the further proof of the culture performance links using a set of measures of the latter which were not financially-based. The findings of the research make a contribution to theory by further validating the work by Denison (1990) and others, not only in that a successful link between organisational culture and performance was demonstrated, but it also identifies particular cultural factors in organisations that appear to be significantly responsible for achieving successful outcomes and reveals opportunities for further research into the organisational culture of construction companies Keywords: organisational culture, construction performance, business success. ...|$|E

The use of short-term <b>cultures</b> <b>derived</b> from these tumors to screen drugs at doses that can be attained within human intracranial tumors provides {{a model system that}} should be capable of identifying effective drugs suitable for clinical evaluation. The sensitivity of a panel of short-term <b>cultures</b> <b>derived</b> from 22 malignant astrocytoma and four malignant oligodendroglioma was assessed to aziridinylbenzoquinone (AZQ), etoposide and doxorubicin (DOX) using a [(35) S] methione uptake assay.

40|$|Primary human hepatocytes are a scare {{resource}} {{with limited}} lifespan and variable function which diminishes with time in culture. As a consequence, {{their use in}} tissue modelling and therapy is restricted. Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) could provide a stable source of human tissue due to their self-renewal properties {{and their ability to}} give rise to all the cell types of the human body. Therefore, hESC have the potential to provide an unlimited supply of hepatocytes. To date, the use of hESCs-derived somatic cells is limited due to the undefined, variable and xeno-containing microenvironment that influences the cell performance and life span, limiting scale-up and downstream application. Therefore, the development of highly defined cell based systems is required if the true potential of stem cell derived hepatocytes is to be realised. In order to replace the use of animal <b>derived</b> <b>culture</b> substrates to differentiate and maintain hESCs-derived hepatocytes, an interdisciplinary approach was employed to define synthetic materials, which maintain hepatocyte-like cell phenotype in culture. A simple polyurethane, PU 134, was identified which improved hepatocyte performance and stability when compared to biological matrices. Moreover, the synthetic polymer was amenable to scale up and demonstrated batch-to-batch consistency. I subsequently used the synthetic polymer surface to probe the underlying biology, identifying key modulators of hepatocyte-like cell phenotype. This resulted in the identification of a novel genetic signature, MMP 13, CTNND 2 and THBS 2, which was associated with stable hepatocyte performance. Importantly, those findings could be translated to two hESC lines derived at GMP. In conclusion, hepatocyte differentiation of pluripotent stem cells requires a defined microenvironment. The novel gene signature identified in this study represents an example of how to deliver stable hESCs-derived hepatocytes...|$|E

Smear-positive sputa from consecutive new tuberculosis patients diagnosed in Cotonou, (Benin) were included, before patients had started treatment. An aliquot of decontaminated sputum was used for direct spoligotyping, and another aliquot was cultured on Löwenstein Jensen (LJ) medium (90 days), for indirect spoligotyping. After DNA extraction, spoligotyping was done according to the standard method for all specimens, and patterns obtained from sputa were compared versus those from the <b>derived</b> <b>culture</b> isolates. From 199 patient's sputa, 146 (73. 4 %) yielded a positive culture. In total, direct spoligotyping yielded a pattern in 98. 5 % (196 / 199) of the specimens, versus 73. 4 % (146 / 199) for indirect spoligotyping on cultures. There was good agreement between sputum- and isolate derived patterns: 94. 4 % (135 / 143) at spoligotype level and 96. 5 % (138 / 143) at (sub) lineage level. Two of the 8 pairs with discrepant pattern were suggestive of mixed infection in sputum. Ancestral lineages (Lineage 1, and M. africanum Lineages 5 and 6) {{were less likely to}} grow in culture (OR = 0. 30, 95 %CI (0. 14 to 0. 64), p = 0. 0016); especially Lineage 5 (OR = 0. 37 95 %CI (0. 17 to 0. 79), p = 0. 010).

40|$|DO INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECT MASSETER AND TIBIALIS ANTERIOR MUSCLE REGENERATION? By Camden Benton Doughtie May 2011 Chair: Joyce Morris-Wiman Major: Dental Sciences Masseter (MAS) has a {{prolonged}} healing response after injury {{compared to other}} muscles such as tibialis anterior (TA). However, {{it is not known}} if this diminished repair capacity is due to a decreased ability of myogenic stems cells in MAS to activate, proliferate and form myofibers or the result of a differential response to specific inflammatory mediators. The {{purpose of this study was}} to: 1) compare the myogenic potential of MAS and TA in an in vitro model; and 2) determine if there is a differential effect of three inflammatory cytokines, TNF-?, IL- 1 ? and IL- 4, on MAS and TA myogenic potential in vitro. Single muscle fibers from MAS and TA of CD- 1 female mice were harvested and placed on matrigel-coated coverslips in 24 well plates. To evaluate early events, fibers were cultured for six days in a proliferation medium. Late events were evaluated by culturing the myoblasts/myotubes an additional six days in differentiation media. Cytokines were tested individually for an effect on cell type proportions during the proliferation and differentiation phases. Four culture replicates were evaluated for each condition. Activation and proliferation were assessed by immunostaining for MyoD, a myoblast marker; myotube and myofiber formation were evaluated by immunostaining for myogenin. Proportions of cells with distinct phenotypes were calculated for each condition. In the in vitro model, myogenic stem cells derived from MAS and TA were capable of activation, proliferation and formation of myofibers. However, <b>cultures</b> <b>derived</b> from MAS and TA differed in myogenic cell phenotype proportions indicating differences in maturation. In both MAS and TA <b>derived</b> <b>cultures,</b> cytokine administration affected specific myogenic cell phenotype proportions, suggesting a differential effect on specific phases of myogenesis. However, when cell proportions were normalized to controls, the only significant difference between MAS and TA <b>derived</b> <b>cultures</b> exposed to cytokine was an increase in the proportion of supporting cells. These results indicate that cytokine exposure has similar effects on myogenic cells derived from both muscles. Thus, the diminished capacity of MAS to repair does not appear to be the result of an increased adverse effect of cytokines on MAS presumptive myogenic cells...|$|R
