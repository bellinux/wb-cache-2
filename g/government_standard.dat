Fragments of this book have survived in the Tang Lü (The Tang Code), while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the Yingzao Fashi (State Building Standards) by Li Jie (1065–1101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (712–756) there were 34,850 registered craftsmen serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the ROC adopted Tongyong Pinyin as its {{national}} standard for romanization. Most townships and county-controlled cities changed their romanization to Tongyong Pinyin at that time.

In 2009, Tongyong Pinyin was replaced by Hanyu Pinyin as the ROC <b>government</b> <b>standard.</b> Currently, most of the divisions are romanized by Hanyu Pinyin system, but some local governments still use Tongyong Pinyin, like Kaohsiung. In 2011, the ROC Ministry of the Interior restored historical romanizations for two towns, Lukang and Tamsui.|$|E
25|$|On 3 August, the {{prefecture}} Shimane, {{in western}} Japan, conducted radiation checks on all beef cattle to ease consumer concerns about food safety. Starting {{from the second}} week of August all cattle were tested. Late July at one farm in this prefecture rice-straw was discovered with radioactive caesium levels exceeding the government safety guide. Although all other tests of beef cattle found far lower levels of radioactivity than the <b>government</b> <b>standard,</b> prices of beef from Shimane plummeted and wholesalers avoided all cattle from the prefecture. All processed beef would undergo preliminary screening, and meat registering 250 becquerels per kilogram or more of radioactive caesium – half the government safety level – would be tested further.|$|E
