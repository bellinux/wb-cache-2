5|$|The {{new owners}} oversaw the {{construction}} of a ten-storey expansion to the property. This added a further 200 rooms to the lodge, for which permission was given although the Nevada State Park Advisory Committee opposed the move. They sought to re-open the Cal Neva on July 1, 1969, but instead it partly opened in May of that year with the new expansion opening the following month. The Ohio Real Estate <b>Investment</b> <b>Trust</b> purchased the lodge in 1970 for $6 million, with the aim to lease it to the U.S. Capital Corporation, who in turn sought to sublease it to Tahoe Crystal Bay Inc. The stockholders of the Ohio Real Estate <b>Investment</b> <b>Trust</b> filed a lawsuit against the company in 1973, which resulted in the Cal Neva being placed into federal receivership. After opening year round since Sinatra purchased the lodge, it closed for the winter season in 1974 due to a drop in visitors blamed on the 1973 oil crisis.|$|E

40|$|British <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> first {{appeared}} in London during the late 19 th century. These trusts offered the British investor a vehicle for international investing and an affordable means to form a well-diversified portfolio. We introduce a new data set containing 584, 764 stock prices and 38, 233 dividend payments from 1958 securities that traded on the London stock exchange between 1872 and 1907. We use this data to evaluate the risk and return characteristics of these 19 th century precursors of the modern mutual fund. In general, <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> delivered returns in line with their systematic risk. There is some evidence of momentum in trust returns but these effects were most likely too small for investors to profit from. <b>Investment</b> <b>trusts</b> did succeed in mobilizing large quantities of capital for overseas investment.

5|$|A {{deal for}} the sale of Constitution Center was agreed to in December 2012. MetLife and an {{unidentified}} investor (represented by Clarion Partners LLC) each purchased a 50 percent interest in the building. The sale price was $734 million, or $524 per square foot (0.093 square meters). The sale price was the most expensive in D.C. history for a single building. (It was not the most paid per square foot, however.

That same year, MIGA held a conference in Ghana to promote investment. The agency joined the Berne Union, an international community of export credit and investment insurance providers in 1994. In 1997, MIGA issued the inaugural contract under its Cooperative Underwriting Program to support an energy project in Indonesia. In collaboration with the European Union <b>Investment</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the agency set up a fund for investment guarantees amounting to $12million ($17million in 2012dollars). The agency also established the West Bank and Gaza Investment Guarantee Trust Fund with a capacity of $20million ($29million in 2012dollars). In 1998 the Council of Governors of MIGA adopted a resolution establishing a general capital increase of $850million ($1.2billion in 2012dollars), and transferring a grant of $150million ($212million in 2012dollars) from the IBRD. MIGA exceeded $1billion ($1.4billion in 2012 dollars) in investment guarantees within a single {{year for the first}} time in 1999.

40|$|Since 1998, sales {{channels}} for <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> have expanded in Japan. We expected this {{to result in}} greater demand for <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> but these expectations {{have yet to be}} met. The underlying causes of investment trusts' slow growth may be due to negative net returns to individual investors during the economic downturn - i. e., after deducting costs from dividends. When the Japanese economy is sluggish, asset management companies should invest in high-growth Asia, among other regions, rather than the domestic market. And when domestic financial markets are strong, the companies should invest more in Japanese markets. <b>Investment</b> <b>trusts</b> are the vehicle for seizing world economic trends. However, the performance of Japan's <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> has not been as good as that of the United States (US).
