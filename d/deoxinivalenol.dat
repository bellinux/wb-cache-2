O principal causador de giberela no trigo na Argentina e sua capacidade de produzir tricotecenos foram estudados por GC e HPLC em amostras altamente infectadas. A espécie predominante foi Fusarium graminearum, sendo que de um total de 33 isolados, 10 produziram <b>deoxinivalenol</b> (0, 1 - 29 mg kg - 1), 13 produziram <b>deoxinivalenol</b> (1, 0 - 708 mg kg- 1) e nivalenol (0, 1 - 6, 2 mg kg- 1), 12 produziram 3 -acetildeoxinivalenol (0, 1 - 14 mg kg- 1), 13 produziram 15 -acetildeoxinivalenol (0, 1 - 1, 9 mg kg- 1), 10 produziram fusarenona X (0, 1 - 2, 4 mg kg- 1) e 7 produziram zearalenona (0, 1 - 0, 6 mg kg- 1). Esses resultados sugerem que as cepas de F. graminearum isoladas de trigo cultivado na Argentina pertencem ao quimiotipo DON.

Sci., 13 : 99 - 104 The {{aim of the}} present investigation is to evaluate the presence of mycotoxins Zearalenon and <b>Deoxinivalenol</b> as natural contaminators of the basic cereal components of combined feed in this country – maize, wheat, barley and oats. A total of 281 samples, including maize 104, wheat 103, barley 39 and oats 35, stock cereals from 2003 – 2005 crops had been evaluated. More favorable substrates for their accumulation had been maize, wheat and barley, while for oats the presence was established only in some of investigated years. The average concentrations of Zearalenon for maize vary between 398 and 838 µg/kg, for wheat between 450 and 884 µg/kg, for barley between 320 and 378 µg/kg, for oats between 250 and 350 µg/kg. The average concentrations of <b>Deoxinivalenol</b> for maize vary between 237 and 372 µg/kg, for wheat between 336 and 678 µg/kg, for barley between 250 and 333 µg/kg, and for oats 250 µg/kg...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} fungus and mycotoxins {{contamination}} in wheat grain (Triticum aestivum) in post harvest during 180 days of storage. Five samples were taken at 30 days intervals during the six months of storage period, assessing fungus such as: Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp. and Fusarium spp., and mycotoxins such as aflatoxins (AFB 1, AFB 2 and AFG 1, AFG 2), ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZON), <b>deoxinivalenol</b> (DON) and fumonisins (FB 1 and FB 2). The results showed that in all 35 samples analyzed many mycotoxins such as aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, <b>deoxinivalenol</b> and fumonisin FB 2 were detected and the fumonisin FB 1 were present in 11 samples (31. 4 %) with levels of 36. 3 to 2, 891 mg/g. The presence of the Aspergillus spp., fungus showed in 100 % of the samples, the Fusarium spp. in 80 %, and Penicillium spp. in 60 % of the samples. The influence of grain fumigation during the storage period on the microorganism development, by reducing the percentage of fungus in the grain bulk, was also verified. This was due to the deleterious effect of phosphine on fungus development. As the mycotoxins can not be removed from the grain during milling process it is important to prevent their development by reducing the temperature and moisture content, and also the pest contamination in the bulk grain.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{confirm the}} focus in modeling mycotoxin in few crops; cereals, both small grains and maize, deserve major attention. <b>Deoxinivalenol</b> {{is still the}} mycotoxin of major interest in wheat, with some studies developed on T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins. Regarding maize, after fumonisins, the interest moved to aflatoxins. Minor efforts were devoted to aflatoxin contamination in nuts and ochratoxin A in grapes. Weather data are the main driving variables used as input in all modeling approaches, in empiric models commonly supported by cropping data. Few example of mechanistic models were developed, but they seem more promising in the future, when climate change is expected to significantly impact on mycotoxins...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of phytic acid (IP(6)) as a possible inhibitor of cellular damage induced by toxic substances such as mycotoxins on a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC- 1). We first observed that a dose of 5 mM phytic acid decreases cell viability and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of cell monolayer. We next investigate the effect of non-cytotoxic dose of phytic acid on the <b>deoxinivalenol</b> (DON) induced decreased TEER. We showed that treatment with 0. 5 mM or 1. 0 mM phytic acid restores the decrease in TEER caused by 25 μM DON. In conclusion this study demonstrates that phytic acid decreased the negative effects of deoxynivalenol on the membrane integrity of the IPEC- 1 intestinal epithelial cell line...|$|E

Samples {{were analyzed by}} LC/MS with atmospheric pressure photo ionization (APPI). Further confirmation was performed by liquid chromatography/time of flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOFMS). The average contamination of each Fusarium mycotoxin was 3. 1, 23, 0. 7, 0. 1 and 4. 2 ng/g for NIV, DON, HT- 2, T- 2 and ZEN, respectively. Multiple toxins were observed in 120 samples while FX and 3 ADON were not detected. The incidence of these toxins was 41 % for NIV, 98 % for DON, 19 % for HT- 2, 11 % for T- 2 and 2 % for ZEN.

40|$|A DSS was {{elaborated}} {{to determine}} the level of risk for mycotoxin accumulation in small grain cereals {{during the growing season}} and to support different management actions along the cereal production chain. The DSS is based on a discriminant analysis carried out on a representative data set on the presence of <b>deoxinivalenol</b> in winter-sown bread wheat, durum wheat and barley grown in different areas of Emilia-Romagna (northern Italy) between 2002 and 2004. Three to five levels of proneness to Fusarium head blight were defined for six influencing factors (weather conditions, growing area, host species and variety, previous crop and type of soil tillage before sowing), each level having its own coefficient, and linearly combined in an equation of risk (R). A value of R can be then calculated for any plot using information at both regional (weather conditions and growing area) and plot-specific (host and cropping practices) levels. R ranges between - 3. 86 and 4. 43 with four risk levels: low (R - 2), intermediate (- 2 1. 2). Different management actions are suggested based on the level of R of the plot. The DSS was satisfactorily validated using data from many plots other than those used in its elaboration...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeasonality is a {{key issue}} of total diet studies (TDS), as season may impact {{consumption}} patterns and concentrations of food chemicals, then exposure levels. This work aimed at analyzing the impact on dietary exposure of different options of seasonality management, to propose guidelines for TDS sampling. Dietary exposure to nine chemicals was assessed for adults and children from the second French Individual and National Food Consumption Survey: arsenic, copper, manganese, dioxins, furans, dioxin-like and non dioxin-like PCBs, <b>deoxinivalenol</b> and ochratoxin A. Seasonality was considered either in both consumption and concentration data, consumption data only, or concentration data only. Results showed significant differences between exposures during different seasons. For most chemicals, the difference between seasonal exposures may not be mainly driven by seasonality of consumption, but partly by seasonality of concentration. Results on risk assessment remained generally the same. If the main objective of the TDS is the risk assessment, considering season for sampling could be costly but with a low added value in terms of results. For exposure refinement, season has {{to be considered in}} the sampling design. More particularly, seasonal samples should be kept separately for chemicals with expected seasonal variation in concentrations, such as some metals or mycotoxins...|$|E

For pursuing the proposed purpose, 21 assays of fodder (6 assays of fibrous feed and 15 assays of concentrated feed) were gathered and analysed from farms located in the Ilfov County. The mycotoxicological analysis {{was done with the}} ELISA imunoenzymatic test for the following mycotoxins: total aflatoxins (AF), ochratoxin A (OTA), <b>deoxinivalenol</b> (DON), zearalenona (ZEA) and T- 2 toxin (T- 2). The results obtained have been statistically processed with the help of JMP 6. 0 program (SAS Company, 2005). The interpretation of the results was done after the CE Rules No. 1881 / 2006 and 1126 / 2007 regarding the admitted limits for mycotoxins in fodder and food.

40|$|Climatic {{conditions}} {{prior to}} wheat harvest 2010 were favorable {{for the development}} of field molds. The most important wheat contamination that should be determined is the presence and frequency of grain lots infected with Fusarium. This paper presents the results of content of fusarious kernels found in samples collected from all wheat growing regions of Serbia. Investigations were performed according to the regulations which foresee sensory determination of content of infected kernels. Determined average content of fusarious kernels was 6. 01 %, varying in range from 0 % to 29. 65 %. The obtained results, which exceeded the upper limits of permitted contents defined by national and EU regulations, pointed to the need for investigation of presence of Fusarium metabolic products, i. e. mycotoxins (zearalenone (ZEA) and <b>deoxinivalenol</b> (DON)) in wheat. Mycotoxin content was determined in average wheat samples and in wheat samples with increased content of fusarious kernels. Direct enzymatic immunoaffinity test (ELISA) was applied for determination of mycotoxin content. Although high content of fusarious kernels characterizes wheat crop in 2010, the determined quantities of two investigated mycotoxins did not exceed maximal permitted content. Consequences of unfavorable quantity and structure of total impurities in wheat crop in 2010 reflect decreased commercial and technological quality of wheat and point out to the need of necessary wheat safety control...|$|E
40|$|Amostras de sementes de soja (Glycine max) produzidas no Sul do Brasil estavam infetadas com Fusarium graminearum. Para determinar se membros desse complexo de espécies eram patogênicos à soja, seis isolados do fungo, originados de sementes soja, foram adicionados ao solo numa densidade de 103 macroconídios/ml ou vagens foram inoculadas individualmente com 104 macroconídios/ml. Plântulas crescidas em solo infestado desenvolveram pequenas lesões necróticas na coroa e na parte {{superior}} das raízes. Vagens inoculadas com conídios desenvolveram lesões necróticas marrom-escuro grandes (> 1 cm). Vagens jovens inoculadas com o fungo secaram e caíram da planta. Isolados de F. graminearum recuperados das lesões das coroas, raízes e vagens das plantas de soja foram identificadas como pertencentes aos grupos de compatibilidade 1, 2 ou 8, através da análise da seqüência de DNA do gene EF 1 -alfa, quando comparados com as linhagens conhecidas. Dois isolados de F. graminearum dos Estados Unidos, pertencentes ao grupo de compatibilidade 7, causaram sintomas semelhantes em soja. Testes das micotoxinas produzidas em soja e trigo (Triticum aestivum) indicaram que a maioria dos isolados Brasileiros produz Nivalenol, como {{a principal}} toxina dos tricotecenos, ao invés de <b>Deoxinivalenol.</b> Em adição, os isolados dos grupos 2 e 8 produziram uma nova toxina, o 3,Acetil- Nivalenol. Surveys of soybean (Glycine max) seed grown in South Brazil revealed infection with Fusarium graminearum. To determine if {{members of this}} complex were pathogenic to soybean, six strains derived from soybean were added to soil {{at a rate of}} 103 macroconidia/ ml or individual pods were inoculated with 104 macroconidia/ml. Seedlings grown in infested soil developed small necrotic lesions in the crown and upper roots. Pods inoculated with conidia developed large (> 1 cm), dark brown, necrotic lesions. Younger pods inoculated with the fungus blighted and dropped from the plant. Strains of the F. graminearum complex recovered from lesions on the crown, roots and pods of soybean plants were identified as lineage 1, 2 or 8 by obtaining the DNA sequence from the EF 1 -alpha gene and comparing it to strains of the known lineage. Two strains of F. graminearum lineage 7 from the U. S. caused similar symptoms of the disease on soybean. Mycotoxin tests on soybean and wheat (Triticum aestivum) indicate that most Brazilian strains produce nivalenol as the major trichothecene mycotoxin rather than deoxynivalenol. In addition, strains from lineages 2 and 8 produce the novel trichothecene, 3 -acetylnivalenol...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium species make {{multiple}} mycotoxins {{of which}} the most important are <b>deoxinivalenol</b> (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA). ZEA and its metabolites α-zearalenol (α-ZOL) and β-zearalenol (β-ZOL) have reportedly {{an effect on the}} reproductive system because they act as an estradiol agonist. Chronic DON exposure in cattle can reduce phagocytic and neutrophilic activity. The objective of the first experiment was to determine if there was any correlation between the embryo quality after superovulation treatment and ZEA concentration in the urine of Japanese black and Holstein cattle. The urine ZEA concentration was determined using an ELISA kit, superovulation treatment and embryo flushing was done without any additions. Quality of the embryos was defined as the percentage of transferable embryos, percentage degenerated embryos and percentage unfertilized embryos. The ZEA concentration in the urine was measured because this {{has proven to be a}} biomarker for ZEA exposure (Takagi et al. 2011). A commercially available ELISA kit was used because this is a reliable method to monitor the urine ZEA concentration (Takagi et al. 2011). De ZEA concentration is expressed as the ration to urinary creatinine (Crea). No significant correlations were observed between the urinary ZEA concentration of Japanese Blacks and the total number of embryos r=- 0, 015 P= 0, 956, transferable embryos r= 0, 191 P= 0, 479, degenerated embryos r=- 0, 108 P= 0, 689 or unfertilized embryos r=- 0, 372 P= 0, 156. In the Holstein group also no significant correlations were discovered. Holstein ZEA concentration and the total number of embryos r= 0, 053 P= 0, 815, transferable embryos r= 0, 011 P= 0, 960, degenerated embryos r= 0, 141 P= 0, 532 or unfertilized embryos r=- 0, 015 P= 0, 948. In the second experiment the ZEA concentration in the TMR and urine was checked monthly. The goal was to determine a correlation and/or significant difference in the ZEA in TMR and urine throughout the year. During this research the same ELISA kit was used to determine the ZEA but also the DON concentration. The third and final objective was to determine if there was a correlation between the SSC and DON concentration. SSC data were collected from the farm records to find a correlation with the DON. No DON was detected in the urine and TMR samples by the ELISA and LC/MC/MC. The individual urinary ZEA concentration by itself had no correlation with the individual SSC in the Holstein herd r=- 0. 027 P= 0. 86. In this experiment no correlation was found between the urinary and TMR samples that were collected the same month r= 0, 167 P= 0, 604. However, there was a significant difference in the Urinary ZEA concentration between December and April, December and July P< 0, 05. Nevertheless this result is questionable because of many variables decreasing the standardization.
