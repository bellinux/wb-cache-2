The Era of Stagnation, a term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev, is considered by several economists {{to be the worst}} financial crisis in the Soviet Union. It was triggered by the Nixon Shock, over-centralisation and a conservative state bureaucracy. As the economy grew, the volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. As a result, labour productivity decreased nationwide. The cumbersome procedures of bureaucratic administration did not allow for the free communication and flexible response required at the enterprise level to deal with worker alienation, innovation, customers and suppliers. The late Brezhnev Era also saw an increase in political corruption. <b>Data</b> <b>falsification</b> became common practice among bureaucrats to report satisfied targets and quotas to the government, and this further aggravated the crisis in planning.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Automatic Identification System (AIS) is an {{electronic}} system set on board vessels, and transmits its location, amongst many other data. As messages are sent and received by vessel and coastal stations within the radio horizon, it enables {{a better understanding}} of the surroundings for vessel and coastal states. However, this system has weaknesses, as errors in <b>data</b> and <b>falsification</b> such as identity theft or disappearances have been demonstrated. This paper presents a methodology based on the notion of data integrity, in which data coming from AIS is processed in different ways in order to produce confidence coefficient on the genuineness and truthfulness of the data within. Such a study is done using an architecture built around a relational database using geospatial predicates. As AIS falsification brings maritime risks, a geospatial analysis of risks is proposed, based on both the AIS integrity assessment and geographic features around the studied vessel, leading to a better response from competent authorities in case of need, an overall improvement of maritime situational awareness and an enhancement of the safety and security of maritime navigation...|$|R

40|$|There is a spurt of {{interest}} in research productivity in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to {{lay the foundation for}} national development. From a global perspective, increased research productivity could conceivably be accompanied by an exponential increase in research misconduct (RM). Inevitably, erroneous or falsified data will be expected to adversely affect public health by misleading policy makers and clinicians alike into embarking on health policy and allocation of resources that are byproducts of RM. This will contribute significantly to the emerging crisis of confidence of the public in the integrity of scientific research.

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that scientific misconduct (<b>data</b> fabrication or <b>falsification)</b> is goal-directed behavior. This hypothesis predicts that papers retracted for misconduct: are targeted to journals {{with a high}} impact factor (IF); are written by authors with additional papers withdrawn for misconduct; diffuse responsibility across many (perhaps innocent) co-authors; and are retracted slower than papers retracted for other infractions. These hypotheses were initially tested and confirmed in a database of 788 papers; here we reevaluate these hypotheses in a larger database of 2, 047 English-language papers. Journal IF was higher for papers retracted for misconduct (p 1 retraction (p < 0. 0001). Papers flawed by misconduct diffuse responsibility across more authors (p < 0. 0001) and are withdrawn more slowly (p < 0. 0001) than papers retracted for other reasons. Papers retracted for unknown reasons are unlike papers retracted for misconduct: they are generally published in journals with low IF; by authors with no other retractions; have fewer authors listed; and are retracted quickly. Papers retracted for unknown reasons appear not to represent a deliberate effort to deceive...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cooperation among nodes {{is vital}} in {{wireless}} networks since in such networks nodes depend {{on each other}} for routing packets. However, cooperation in such operations consumes nodes recourses such as battery and bandwidth. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} design incentive mechanisms to enforce nodes to forward packets when the source and destination of the packet are other nodes. We study routing in wireless networks from a game theoretic view point. Based on this view, the network consists of greedy and selfish nodes who accept payments for forwarding data for other nodes if the payments cover their individual costs incurred by forwarding <b>data.</b> Also, route <b>falsification</b> attacks are easy to launch by malicious nodes in wireless networks. These nodes falsify data and routes in the network. Thus, mitigating this attack is vital for the performance of the whole network.

In this work, we consider that the network consists of malicious nodes too. Here we present a secure and truthful mechanism for routing in wireless networks that cope selfish and malicious nodes.

40|$|This {{extended}} editorial {{asks whether}} peer-review {{is continuing to}} operate effectively in policing research misconduct in the academic world. It explores the mounting problems encountered by editors of journals such as Research Policy (RP) in dealing with research misconduct. Misconduct can take a variety of forms. Among the most serious are plagiarism and <b>data</b> fabrication or <b>falsification,</b> although fortunately these still seem to be relatively rare. More common are problems involving redundant publication and self-plagiarism, where the boundary between acceptable behaviour (attempting to exploit the results of one's research as fully and widely as possible) and unacceptable behaviour (in particular, misleading the reader as to the originality of one's publications) is rather indistinct and open to interpretation. With {{the aid of a}} number of case-studies, this editorial tries to set out clearly where RP Editors regard that boundary as lying. It also notes with concern a new form of misconduct among certain journal editors, who attempt to engineer an increase in their journal's ‘impact factor’ through a practice of ‘coercive citation’. Such problems with research integrity would appear to be unintended, and certainly undesirable, consequences of the growing trend to quantify research performance through various indicators...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} introduces three {{essays on}} health and public economics. In the first essay, I reexamine how false ID laws with scanner provisions affect underage drinking. Yoruk uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 and finds that false ID laws with scanner provisions have large impacts on underage drinking. I first demonstrate that analyses based on NLSY 97 <b>data</b> fail <b>falsification</b> exercises testing for significant pre-intervention effects, and that the estimated effects based on these data are highly sensitive to {{the inclusion of a}} lead term and to sample selection, which weakens confidence in the large estimated effects reported in the previous literature. I then use data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System for the analysis and show that estimates based on these data indicate that these policies have no effect on underage drinking behavior. In the second essay, I take advantage of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process to analyze the effect of government spending on local economic conditions. Exploiting variation in the timing and amount of construction funding provided across counties, my analyses yield an estimated cost per job of $ 65, 000 per year and a local fiscal multiplier of 1. 21. Analyses of neighboring counties show little evidence of spillover effects. To further explore the mechanisms underlying these results, I investigate the effects of government spending on migration and show that the funding has positive effects on in-migration, but these effects are too small to explain the main results. In the final essay, we examine how childbearing responds to changes in economic conditions. We exploit variation driven by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process, in which $ 25 billion of construction funding was distributed across the United States in different amounts and at different points in time. We show that this stimulus improved men?s?but not women?s?economic conditions, providing a rare opportunity to assess different theoretical models of childbearing. We find that the stimulus led to significant increases in birth rates. These results are consistent with models in which child quantity is a normal good and women?s foregone earnings are a major component of the costs of having children...|$|R
