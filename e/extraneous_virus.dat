40|$|Poliomyelitis {{virus was}} {{propagated}} in vitro successfully in extraneural tissues. Suspended tissue fragment cultures and combined plasma clot-suspended tissue fragment cultures of monkey or human testicular tissues were employed. Five strains representative of poliomyelitis virus were maintained for from 36 to 263 {{days in the}} suspended tissue fragment type of culture. The dilution factors calculated by tissue replacements for the eight serial passages ranged from 107. 8 to 1044. 5 and when assessed by fluid replacements, from 1015 to 1095. 3. The LD 50 for each strain of Type 2 virus was determined for selected transfers. The identify of each strain of virus was established by neutralization tests and histopathological findings in monkeys dead from the injection of tissue culture virus. Control experiments and other tests made known that propagation of poliomyelitis virus did not occur {{in the absence of}} viable testicular cells and that an <b>extraneous</b> <b>virus</b> was not inadvertently acquired during the course of these studies...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the many}} {{problems}} {{connected with the}} preparation and laboratory control of oral poliomyelitis vaccines, {{one of the most}} vexed is that of the presence of undesirable, <b>extraneous</b> <b>viruses</b> of simian origin, particularly the foamy viruses. In Czechoslovakia, as elsewhere, these have been encountered in the production of live poliomyelitis vaccine from Sabin strains. Of 596 single lots of primary monkey kidney cell cultures intended for use in vaccine, only 143 lots successfully passed laboratory control tests, mainly because foamy viruses were found. Comparison tests showed that monkey and rabbit kidney cells were equally sensitive for the detection of foamy viruses but that dog kidney cells were less so and, in addition, in 8 % of cases contained endogenous cytopathogenic virus agents. The presence of vacuolating agent was not tested for in the control tests discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEuropean {{technical}} requirements for veterinary vaccines are {{laid down in}} Annex 1, Title II, to Directive 2001 / 82 /EC, as amended by Directive 2009 / 9 /EC, and the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.). Safety tests carried out on each batch are generally overdosage studies carried out {{in at least one}} of the most sensitive target species and by at least the recommended route of administration that poses the greatest risk. The dose administered should preferably be twice the standard dose for inactivated vaccines and ten times the standard dose for live vaccines. Each batch must also be tested to show that it will contain the appropriate potency or titer to ensure its safety and efficacy. Live vaccines are usually tested by in vitro titration, while serological or challenge tests in vaccinated animals are commonly used for inactivated vaccines, although alternative methods are encouraged if satisfactorily validated. Several amendments have been introduced into the Ph. Eur. to facilitate reduction in the severity of tests and the numbers of animals used, including: the ability to waive the batch safety test when consistency of production has been established; in vitro methods to test for <b>extraneous</b> <b>viruses</b> in live poultry vaccines; and humane endpoints for rabies vaccine potency tests. This report discusses some preliminary conclusions concerning how these changes have affected the numbers of animals used during batch control testing of vaccines released via the UK batch release scheme...|$|R
40|$|The V 2 carcinoma—a transplanted rabbit cancer derived {{originally}} from a virus-induced papilloma and carrying in masked or altered form the virus {{primarily responsible for}} it—was propagated in five successive groups of animals all previously hyperimmunized against the papilloma virus. The cancer grew {{as well in the}} hyperimmunized hosts as in normal animals implanted during the same months; and serological tests, made when the tumor was eventually returned to ordinary hosts, proved that the virus was still associated with the carcinoma cells: it had increased to the usual extent as the tumor grew in the hyperimmune animals. The continued increase of the neoplastic virus during propagation of the V 2 carcinoma in hyperimmunized hosts contrasts sharply with the elimination of certain <b>extraneous</b> passenger <b>viruses</b> when the tumors they ride upon are grown in hosts previously immunized against them. The facts as a whole would seem to warrant a distinction between the enduring partnership of a neoplastic virus and carcinoma cells {{on the one hand and}} the casual association of passenger viruses with tumor cells on the other...|$|R
40|$|Some {{characteristics}} of a newly recognized porcine enteric virus are described. Tentatively, the virus {{was referred to as}} porcine pararotavirus (PaRV) because it resembled rotaviruses in respect to size, morphology, and tropism for villous enterocytes of the small intestine. However, it was antigenically distinct from porcine, human, and bovine rotaviruses and reoviruses 1, 2, and 3, and the electrophoretic migration pattern of PaRV double-stranded RNA was distinct from the electrophoretic migration patterns of the rotaviral and reoviral genomes. By passage in gnotobiotic pigs, PaRV was isolated from two suckling diarrheic pigs originating from two herds. After oral exposure of gnotobiotic pigs, villous enterocytes of the small intestines became infected as judged by immunofluorescence, resulting in villous atrophy and diarrhea. Mortality was high when gnotobiotic pigs less than 5 days old were infected. The C strain of this virus was serially passed 10 times in gnotobiotic pigs, and electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and serological tests indicated no <b>extraneous</b> agents. The <b>virus</b> was serially passed five times in cell cultures which contained pancreatin in the medium, but replication was negligible or absent, as the number of immunofluorescent cells decreased with each passage. Since rotaviral infections are frequently diagnosed by direct electron microscopy of fecal specimens, the presence of other morphologically similar viruses, such as PaRV, should be considered. The use of immune electron microscopy is suggested as a means of helping recognize this situation...|$|R
