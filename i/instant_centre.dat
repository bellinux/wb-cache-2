50|$|For {{determining}} the <b>instant</b> <b>centre</b> of {{rotation of the}} third element of the linkage, the body BAC, the two points A and B are used because its moving characteristics are known, as derived from {{the information about the}} links P1-A and P2-B.

Its <b>instant</b> <b>centre</b> of rotation must be perpendicular to this vector (as VA is tangentially located on the circumference of a circle). The only line that fills the requirement is a line colinear with link P1-A. Somewhere on this line there is a point P, the <b>instant</b> <b>centre</b> of rotation for the body BAC. What applies to point A also applies to point B, therefore this <b>instant</b> <b>centre</b> of rotation P is located on a line perpendicular to vector VB, a line colinear with link P2-B. Therefore, the <b>instant</b> <b>centre</b> of rotation P of body BAC is the point where the lines through P1-A and P2-B cross.|$|E

40|$|In spherical {{mechanisms}} (SMs), instantaneous pole axes (IPAs) {{play the}} same role as <b>instant</b> <b>centres</b> in planar mechanisms. Their use in kinematic analyses requires general techniques to determine them. In the literature, such techniques have not been proposed yet.

This article aims to fill this lack of techniques. For SMs with one degree of freedom (DOF), a general method to analytically locate all the IPAs {{as a function of}} the mechanism configuration is presented.

40|$|Objective. In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} {{the hypothesis that the}} tibialis anterior tendon moment arm increases during maximum isometric dorsiflexion as compared with rest. Background. In musculoskeletal modelling applications, moment arms from passive muscles at rest are assumed representative of those measured during isometric muscle contraction. The validity of this assumption is questionable in musculotendon actuators enclosed by retinacular systems as in tibialis anterior. Design and Methods. Sagittal-plane magnetic resonance images of the right ankle were taken in six subjects at rest and during maximum isometric dorsiflexion at six ankle angles between dorsiflexion and plantarflexion having the body placed in the supine position and the knee flexed at 90 °. <b>Instant</b> <b>centres</b> of rotation in the tibio-talar joint, tibialis anterior tendon action lines and moment arms were identified in the sagittal plane at ankle angles of - 15 °, 0 °, + 15 °and + 30 °at rest and during maximum isometric dorsiflexion. Results. At any given ankle angle, the tibialis anterior tendon moment arm during maximum isometric dorsiflexion increased by 0. 9 - 1. 5 cm (P < 0. 01) compared with rest. This was attributed to a displacement of both tibialis anterior tendon action line by 0. 8 - 1. 2 cm (P < 0. 01) and all <b>instant</b> <b>centres</b> of rotation by 0. 3 - 0. 4 cm (P < 0. 01) distally in relation to their corresponding resting positions. Conclusions and implications. The assumption that the tibialis anterior tendon maximum isometric dorsiflexion is invalid. Erroneous tendon forces, muscle stresses and joint moments by as much as 30 % would be calculated using resting tibialis anterior tendon moment arms in the moment equilibrium equation around the ankle joint during maximum isometric dorsiflexion...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the effect of a plantarflexor maximum {{voluntary}} contraction (MVC) on Achilles tendon moment arm length. Sagittal magnetic resonance (MR) images of the right ankle were taken in six subjects both at rest and during a plantarflexor MVC in the supine position at a knee angle of 90 deg and at ankle angles of - 30 deg (dorsiflexed direction), - 15 deg, 0 deg (neutral ankle position), + 15 deg (plantarflexed direction), + 30 deg and + 45 deg. A system of mechanical stops, support triangles and velcro straps was used to secure the subject in the above positions. Location of a moving centre of rotation was calculated for ankle rotations from - 30 to 0 deg, - 15 to + 15 deg, 0 to + 30 deg and + 15 to + 45 deg. All <b>instant</b> <b>centres</b> of rotation were calculated both at rest and during MVC. Achilles tendon moment arms were measured at ankle angles of - 15, 0, + 15 and + 30 deg. At any given ankle angle, Achilles tendon moment arm length during MVC increased by 1 - 1. 5 cm (22 - 27 %, P < 0. 01) compared with rest. This was attributed to a displacement of both Achilles tendon by 0. 6 - 1. 1 cm (P < 0. 01) and all <b>instant</b> <b>centres</b> of rotation by about 0. 3 cm (P < 0. 05) away from their corresponding resting positions. The findings of this study have important implications for estimating loads in the musculoskeletal system. Substantially unrealistic Achilles tendon forces and moments generated around the ankle joint during a plantarflexor MVC would be calculated using resting Achilles tendon moment arm measurements...|$|R

40|$|The common aim of {{the long}} and triple jumps is to attain maximum {{horizontal}} distance {{from the front of}} the take-off board. This is achieved by converting some of the horizontal velocity developed in the approach run into vertical velocity at take-off. The aim of this thesis was to examine a theoretical model and to identify kinematic and kinetic factors that facilitate the generation of vertical velocity in the long and triple jump take-offs. A pivot mechanism was defined to act between touch-down and the <b>instant</b> the <b>centre</b> of mass was directly above the toe of the support foot. This mechanism was found to be the largest contributor to the gain in vertical velocity in all take-offs, accounting for 83. 0 % in the long jump and 63. 7 %, 69. 8 % and 70. 7 % in the hop, step and jump take-offs. The contribution of the pivot to the gain in vertical velocity at take-off in the long jump was significantly greater than in each of the triple jump take-offs, (all P< 0. 002). A relative momentum approach was used to determine the contribution of the free limbs to the generation of vertical velocity. In the long jump, the free limbs made a 10. 8 % contribution to the gain in vertical velocity, compared to 12. 2 %, 19. 0 % and 19. 0 % in the triple jump take-offs. Multiple regressiona nalysesw ere used to identify factors relating to the generationo f vertical velocity in the long jump (n= 14). The greatestg ains in vertical velocity were associatedw ith techniquest hat emphasiseda low centre of mass and extended knee joint at touch-down and the ability to resist knee flexion in the compression phase, R 2 = 72. 7 %. The greatest losses in horizontal velocity were associated with excessiveh ip adduction, less hip extensiona nd greater increasesin height from touchdown to take-ofll R 2 = 84. 5 %. Ground reaction forces and net joint moments were measured during short approach running jump tests. Peak vertical impact forces were greater in simulated `drop' take-offs, 5080 N, compared to those experienced in `flat' approach take-offs, 3250 N, (P=O. 002). Peak horizontal braking forces were 1800 N in both types of take-off. However, the peak net joint moments about the ankle, (403 N. m and 387 N. m), knee (233 N. m and 296 N. m) and hip (292 N. m and 249 N. m) were similar between the `flat' and `drop' take-offs. This suggests that athletes adapt their technique in the `drop' take-off to distribute the larger forces effectively and to keep the net joint moments within controllable limits. Results indicated that strength about the ankle joint was particularly important in both types of take-off, but depending on the athlete's technique strength about the knee and hip are also vital. Greater flexion of the knee joint at touch-down and maximum knee flexion were found to be associated with greater average knee moments, R 2 = 30. 8 % and 75. 5 % respectively, and greater angles of leg placement were moderately associated with greater average hip moments, R 2 = 23. 5 %. In conclusion, this thesis has provided a greater insight into the kinetics and kinematics of jumping for distance. It has quantified the contribution made by the pivot mechanism and the free limbs to the generation of vertical velocity, and has assessetdh e demandso n the musculoskeletal system in terms of ground reaction forces and net joint moments. The results indicate that elite performers cannot rely on speed alone, and that strength and technique are major factors of successful performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} analyses {{the scale}} {{effects on the}} tensile strength of materials. By the term scale effects it is meant the variation in a mechanical property {{as a function of}} structural size. In particular, it has been observed by numerous investigators that the nominal tensile strength of many materials decreases with increasing size of the specimen tested. This phenomenon is more evident in disordered materials, that is, materials that are macroscopically heterogeneous and damaged. On the basis of Weibull's statistical theory and the principles of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics, a self-similarity distribution for defect size is presented (Chapter 4). With this distribution the length of the most critical defect is taken to be proportional to the linear size of the specimen. It is shown that the assumption of self-similarity represents the instance of maximum disorder that can be encountered in real materials, and it supplies, in a strength-size bilogarithmic plane, a linear scaling law with an inclination of - 1 / 2, corresponding {{to the power of the}} stress singularity envisaged by LEFM. This formulation contains the fractal concept of self-similarity, even though it is limited to maximum defect dimension. In order to consider the real nature of the micro-structure of the materials, a more complex fractal model is presented (Chapter 5) in which the property of self-similarity is extended to the entire population of defects. This topological law, based on fractal theory and on the so-called renormalisation procedure, states that in order to obtain a nominal constant strength for the material it is necessary to refer to surface areas with non integer physical dimensions. For disordered materials, such as for instance concrete and rocks, renormalised tensile strength is given by a force acting on a surface having a fractal dimension lower than 2. The dimensional decrease, always comprised in the [0, 1 / 2] range, represents self-similar vacancies in the undamaged section associated with the presence of pores, voids, defects, cracks, aggregate and inclusions, and it approaches the 1 / 2 limit only for extremely brittle and disordered materials, as is assumed, incidentally, in statistical approaches. As a rule, the scale variation taken into consideration in experimental investigations does not exceed one order of magnitude. In such circumstances, it is only possible to determine a single tangential inclination in the bilogarithmic diagram. Only by taking into account scale variations higher than one order of magnitude it proves possible to detect the transition from disordered to ordered conditions, and a continuous transition from - 1 / 2 to zero inclination may be seen to appear. In physical reality, the peak load resistant section can be viewed as multifractal, of dimension 1. 5 on small scales and dimension 2 at large scales. This clearly shows a transition from the extreme disorder that is associated with small scales, where a self-similar distribution of Griffith cracks predominates, to the extreme order of large scales, where the disorder of the microstructure is no longer visible, on account of the limited dimensions of the defects and heterogeneities. The assumption of multifractality for the microstructure of the damaged material (Chapter 7) is the basis of the so-called Multifractal Scaling Law (MFSL). Such law consists of an approximation method which imposes the concavity of the bilogarithmic curve facing upward, which contradicts Bazant's size effect law (SEL). To verify this scaling law and to determine experimentally the variation in nominal tensile strength and fracture energy, a totally innovative testing set-up has been created, involving the use of three servo-controlled jacks (Chapter 5). The interaction of the three jacks, arranged in L formation, makes it possible to <b>centre</b> <b>instant</b> by instant the resultant of the load with the respect to the undamaged section even in the presence o...|$|R
