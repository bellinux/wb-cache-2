50|$|This {{site in the}} Vale of Gordano {{is listed}} because of Pleistocene ‘plateau-deposits’ which include ‘cannon-shot’ <b>gravels,</b> fine sandy <b>gravels</b> and silty <b>gravels</b> {{with a wide range}} of erratic lithologies.|$|R
40|$|The Tertiary <b>gravels</b> {{deposited}} {{along the}} western flank of the Sierra Nevada mountains elucidate {{the nature of the}} paleochannels and paleotopography of the range in the Eocene-Oligocene epochs. Numerous geologic maps and studies were compiled to place existing Tertiary <b>gravels</b> onto topographic maps and cross-sections extracted from ArcGIS. Based on the remnant deposits, the extent of deposition of the <b>gravels</b> during the Eocene-Oligocene epoch was inferred, and average end-area values were measured from the cross-sections to calculate the volume of the Tertiary <b>gravels</b> that was originally deposited. The map of the inferred deposits was also used to measure surface gradients of the <b>gravels</b> and compare them to deposits of active fluvial systems. This study calculated that 197 - 290 km 3 of <b>gravels</b> were originally deposited and that surface gradients ranged from 0. 004 to 0. 034 (0. 229 ° to 1. 95 °). The map shows that the <b>gravels</b> were widely distributed across the west sloping ramp of the north and central Sierras, and the cross-sections suggest that the river valleys were deeply incised and filled with Tertiary <b>gravels.</b> The early Cenozoic Sierran landscape consisted of a tall, rugged mountain range carved by paleochannels that were subsequently buried by gold-bearing <b>gravels</b> during the Eocene and Oligocene epochs...|$|R

40|$|In {{studying}} the problems on sediment transport {{in a stream}} and stabilities of astream channel, the criterion for mvement of sands and <b>gravels</b> by action of fljw, theso-called critical tractive force, becomes generally important. The present paper dealswith the hydraulic approach to solve the mechanism of the critical tractive force ofgraded sand <b>gravels.</b> In {{the first part of}} this paper, the results of some basic experiments on the critical trac-tive force of graded sand <b>gravels,</b> especially the mechanism of sediment transport nearthe critical condition for movement and the sorting effect of flow, are described. It isconcluded from the experiments that the practical definition for the criterion for move-ment of sand <b>gravels</b> proposed by the author in the previous paper can also be appliedto the critical tractive force of graded sand <b>gravels,</b> and the sorting effect of flow nearthe critical condition is expressed by a function of size frequency distributions of gradedsand <b>gravels.</b> In the second part, a theory for the critical tractive force of graded sand <b>gravels</b> isdeveloped, based on the author's procedure to solve the criterion for movement of sandgravels and the existence of wakes behind sand <b>gravels.</b> It is clarified from the com-parison of the theoretical curve with the results of experiments performed by the authorand some other authorities that the critical tractive force of graded sand <b>gravels</b> expressedin the dimensionless form is a function of the standard deviation of graded sand gravels,and the theoretical curve is in good agreement with the experimental results within therange of the standard deviation less than about two. Based on the above consideration,an empirical formula for the critical tractive force of graded sand <b>gravels</b> is proposedand compared with some other formulas proposed by authorities...|$|R

5|$|In 1980, <b>Gravel</b> was {{challenged}} for the Democratic Party's nomination by State Representative Clark Gruening, {{the grandson of}} the man <b>Gravel</b> had defeated in a primary 12 years earlier. Several factors made <b>Gravel</b> vulnerable. As an insurgent candidate in 1968, <b>Gravel</b> had never established a firm party base. Not liking to hunt or fish, he was also always culturally suspect in the state. A group of Democrats, including future governor Steve Cowper, led the campaign against <b>Gravel,</b> with Gravel's actions in respect to the 1978 and 1980 Alaskan lands bills a major issue, especially given that the latter's dénouement happened but {{a week before the}} primary. The sources of Gravel's campaign funds, some of which came from political action committees outside the state, also became an issue in the contest. Another factor may have been Alaska's blanket primary system of the time, which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents; Republicans believed Gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election.|$|E

Gray, her boss at the time. Gray allegedly wanted to secure Gravel's support for further funding for construction of the National Visitor Center in Washington, a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired. Another Congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter, but <b>Gravel</b> said {{at the time that he}} had never met either of the women. Both <b>Gravel</b> and Gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation, and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing.

5|$|Nuclear {{power was}} {{considered}} an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and {{was part of a}} popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the 1950s and 1960s. <b>Gravel</b> publicly opposed this policy; besides the dangers of nuclear testing, he was a vocal critic of the Atomic Energy Commission, which oversaw American nuclear efforts, and of the powerful United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which <b>Gravel</b> tried to circumvent. In 1971, <b>Gravel</b> sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents; in 1975, he was still proposing similar moratoriums. By 1974, <b>Gravel</b> was allied with Ralph Nader's organization in opposing nuclear power.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many gravelly soils {{liquefied}} cases history {{especially in}} the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake warn that loose to moderate density of <b>gravels</b> have much potential to liquefy under a given earthquake shaking. The large diameter triaxial apparatus is a relative feasible means to explore the liquefaction mechanism of gravelly soils to some extent. Becker penetration test (BPT) could be droved hrough gravelly soils layer, but BPT was not directly correlated with field behavior. Because of {{a wider range of}} grain sizes than those reported from previous earthquakes, <b>gravels</b> characteristics liquefied in the Wenchuan earthquake are representative and universal. The <b>gravels</b> liquefaction evaluation method developed from the Wenchuan earthquake should be feasible for worldwide use.

So that, you see, the newest layers, the London clay and the <b>gravels,</b> are lower in height than the {{limestone}} cliffs at Bristol, and much lower than the old mountain ranges of Devonshire and Wales, though in geological order they are far higher; and there are whole worlds of strata, rocks and clays, one on the other, between the Thames <b>gravels</b> and the Devonshire hills.|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{offering}} some interesting data for change in size, shape and provenance of <b>gravels</b> {{on the shores of}} a river in relation to distance from the mouth of a river, the authors researched quantitatively shape analysis and rock composition of river shores <b>gravels</b> at seven localities in the lower reaches of the Sagami River that flows from Lake Yamanaka and the neighborhood in Yamanashi Prefecture through the central regions of Kanagawa Prefecture into Sagami Bay. The river shores retain almost natural conditions in the lower reaches of the river. Size of the <b>gravels</b> shows a clear tendency to decrease from the upper to the lower in the lower reaches of the river. As the localities are closer to the mouth of the river, sorting of the maximal size of the <b>gravels</b> is higher. Sphericity of the <b>gravels</b> was measured according to two methods of calculation at five localities (Loc. 1 to Loc. 5) in the lower reaches it does not vary largely through al 1 the localities at both methods, having peak sphericity of 0. 6 ~ 0. 8 in the frequency distribution. Rock kinds of the <b>gravels</b> were classified into about 16 at the studied seven localities, they are roughly recognized as origins from three mountainous regions and one mountain; Kanto-, Tanzawa- and Hakone Mountains, and Mountain Fuji. <b>Gravels</b> at all studied localities are overwhelmingly composed of rocks from two origins of the Kanto- and the Tanzawa Mountains, the former origin’s <b>gravels</b> are Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, the later Miocene green tuffs and igneous rocks. At Loc. 1 near the river-mouth and Loc. 2 with distance of about 3. 20 km from the mouth, <b>gravels</b> originated from the Kanto Mountains are dominant with a majority in the rock composition. At Loc. 3 with distance of about 6. 5 km from the mouth and at other localities until Loc. 7 with distance of 22. 0 km from the mouth, their compositions are predominated with a majority by rocks from the Tanzawa Mountains instead of the Kanto Mountains...|$|R
