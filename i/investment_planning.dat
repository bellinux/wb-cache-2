25|$|Water {{and sewer}} tariffs in Costa Rica are {{approved}} by the regulatory agency ARESEP and instituted by AyA, the water and sewer agency for Costa Rica. Revenues from user fees do not cover {{operation and maintenance costs}} and the financial situation of the sector is weak. Furthermore, tariff levels do not allow for full cost recovery. In the case of AyA, there are cross-subsidies from San José to the other urban and rural areas of the country. The tariff is set based on short term cash flow needs rather than on real economic costs of service provision. AyA requests tariff increases when its financial situation is precarious and not a result of long-term <b>investment</b> <b>planning.</b> The regulator, ARESEP tends to approve a partial percentage of these requests.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Lee-Chin {{took the}} {{proceeds}} from his Mackenzie investment to buy a Kitchener-based company called the Advantage Investment Council (a division of AIC Limited) for $200,000. At the time, the company had holdings of around C$800,000. He renamed the company AIC, and developed it to a fund that today controls around C$6 Billion, {{with hundreds of thousands}} of investors. Following the acquisition of AIC Limited, Lee-Chin set up the Berkshire group of companies – comprising an <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> arm, a securities dealership and an insurance operation. By 2007, Berkshire amassed more than C$12 billion of assets under administration. In 2007, Manulife acquired Berkshire from Portland Holdings in exchange for shares, making Portland one of the largest shareholders of Manulife.|$|E
25|$|From its inception, the Peruvian {{electricity}} system {{started to}} be developed by private initiative. In 1955, Law No. 12378 regulated the mechanisms of private participation, establishing a system of concessions with commitments to increase generation capacity by 10% annually. The National Tariff Commission and other mechanisms aiming at guaranteeing the profitability of the investments were then created. However, {{at the beginning of}} the 1970s, profound changes took place. In 1972, the de facto military government nationalized the electricity industry through Law No.19521, creating ELECTROPERU (Peru Electricity Company). ELECTROPERU became the owner of all the generation, transmission and distribution assets and came to be in charge of service provision and <b>investment</b> <b>planning.</b> Until the beginning of the 1980s there were large investments in hydroelectric and thermal projects. However, this dynamism started to fade during the 1980s mainly due to the debt crisis that started in 1982 and that precluded new financing in the region. By the beginning of the 1990s, the electricity sector in Peru showed an important deterioration due to low investment in infrastructure, the fact that tariffs did not cover production costs, the restricted investment in maintenance and the systematic destruction of infrastructures by terrorist activities. The results of this crisis were severe: in 1990 only 45% of the population had access to electricity, supply only covered 74% of the demand and distribution losses were above 20%.|$|E
50|$|There are two plans: The Texas Guaranteed Tuition Plan and The Texas College Savings Plan (formally the Tomorrow's College <b>Investment</b> <b>Plan).</b> The {{former is}} a constitutionally {{guaranteed}} trust fund {{backed by the}} State of Texas, whereas the latter is an <b>investment</b> <b>plan</b> managed by NorthStar Financial Services Group, LLC.

25|$|Water <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> {{for rural}} areas is {{done at the}} {{district}} level by the respective water departments. In 2009 the NGO WaterAid studied the local government planning process for water investments {{in four of the}} country's 99 rural districts, namely in Mpwapwa, Kongwa, Iramba and Nzega. Planning begins with long wish-lists based on demands from the village level. Since real priorities are difficult to identify, one selection criterion used is the balance of money held in the village water fund. This is seen as a sign of community ownership and can be easily explained to councillors and villagers. Other purported criteria are health statistics and data collected from a waterpoint mapping exercise, but they are not given high priority in practice. Selection is done {{in such a way that}} water projects are equally divided between the constituencies of the district’s Members of Parliament. Furthermore, councilors steer projects to villages in their wards, with more dynamic councillors exerting greater influence. Another de facto criterion is the previous track record in caring for infrastructure: In some areas handpumps have been stolen, making it hard to justify new investments. Communities close to town, located on main roads or with existing social services have an advantage in the decision-making process, since officials visit them more often and the cost of providing infrastructure is lower. The WaterAid report suggests that if there was better availability of data on rural water supply infrastructure this could help the representatives of underserved communities to lobby on behalf of their constituents.|$|E

2500|$|Adequate protection: the {{analysis}} of how to protect a household from unforeseen risks. [...] These risks {{can be divided into}} the following: liability, property, death, disability, health and long term care. [...] Some of these risks may be self-insurable, while most will require the purchase of an insurance contract. [...] Determining how much insurance to get, at the most cost effective terms requires knowledge of the market for personal insurance. [...] Business owners, professionals, athletes and entertainers require specialized insurance professionals to adequately protect themselves.
