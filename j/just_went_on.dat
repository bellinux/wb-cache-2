25|$|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, {{was on the}} show, and {{he threw}} in {{a few of his}} folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were {{different}} on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.|$|E

He outstripped Stegeman by eleven chickens. He wasn't satisfied just to win. He <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to a decisive victory." [...] As Cody explained: [...] "I got two chickens {{ahead of him}} early and just coasted." ...|$|E
500|$|Schreiber {{became the}} {{associate}} leader of W Division in 1947, {{and then the}} head of the division in 1951. During this time, W Division worked {{on the development of the}} hydrogen bomb. He was once again in charge of the pit crew for the Ivy Mike nuclear test on Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific, the first test of a thermonuclear device. Even the veteran Schreiber was impressed by the [...] explosion. [...] "It really filled up the sky," [...] he recalled, [...] "It was awesome. It <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> and on." ...|$|E

500|$|Jenna's storyline in {{the episode}} {{received}} mixed reception. Canning enjoyed her subplot but found it predictable and stereotypical, while Sepinwall reported {{it did not}} work, and wrote that Jenna's stories need to have Liz or Jack featured prominently or that she be put with Scott Adsit's 30 Rock character, Pete Hornberger, as in this episode, [...] "as her insanity's only amusing when contrasted against a relatively normal character. As with Sepinwall, Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad believed Jenna's subplot was fair, observing it was great in parts but [...] "it <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> too long and got tedious and silly." [...] He believed {{it would be a}} good idea to have Jenna dating or perhaps marrying a recurring character, but opined [...] "The Ones" [...] did not choose that path. Tom O'Neil from the Los Angeles Times, in an August 2009 article, was thrilled for Krakowski receiving an Emmy nomination for her work on 30 Rock, but felt that [...] "The Ones" [...] would not be the episode for which she'd win the Outstanding Supporting Actress award.|$|E
500|$|Betty Driver, who {{had been}} {{performing}} since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire. It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, producer of Coronation Street, Harry Kershaw, who persuaded her to audition {{for the role of}} Hilda Ogden in 1964; she eventually had to turn the role down as she was tied into an advertising contract with Procter & Gamble and they refused to release her. The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, [...] "Harry Kershaw, producer of Coronation Street, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just think I could have been wearing curlers for 30 years." [...] In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin. Commenting on her casting in 1999, Driver said, [...] " [...] said, 'Betty, {{how would you like to}} pull pints for us on television?', and that was it. I suppose I expected I'd be there for perhaps a few months. But it <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> and on and, well, they've never managed to get rid of me." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a perfect four-star rating, calling it [...] "the most cheerfully exciting, bizarre, goofy, romantic {{adventure}} movie since Raiders, {{and it is}} high praise to say that it's {{not so much a}} sequel as an equal. It's quite an experience." [...] Vincent Canby felt the film was [...] "too shapeless to be the fun that Raiders is, but shape may be beside the point. Old-time, 15-part movie serials didn't have shape. They <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> and on and on, which is what Temple of Doom does with humor and technical invention." [...] Neal Gabler commented that [...] "I think in some ways, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. In some ways it was less. In sum total, I'd have to say I enjoyed it more. That doesn't mean it's better necessarily, but I got more enjoyment out of it." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun." [...] Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, claimed it was [...] "one of the most sheerly pleasurable physical comedies ever made." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide described the film as a [...] "slow-starting adventure romp with much ingenuity and too much brutality and horror." ...|$|E

2500|$|Basie's new band which {{included}} many Moten alumni, with the important addition of tenor player Lester Young. They {{played at the}} Reno Club and sometimes were broadcast on local radio. Late one night with time to fill, the band started improvising. Basie liked the results and named the piece [...] "One O'Clock Jump." [...] According to Basie, [...] "we hit it with the rhythm section {{and went into the}} riffs, and the riffs just stuck. [...] We set the thing up front in D-flat, and then we <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> playing in F." [...] It became his signature tune.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking to Rolling Stone {{magazine}} in early 1979, {{by which time}} he and Arias were married and {{the parents of a}} newborn son, Dhani, Harrison further acknowledged Arias' positive influence on his life when discussing the despondency behind his Dark Horse song [...] "Simply Shady": [...] "I wasn't ready to join Alcoholics Anonymous or anything – I don't think I was that far gone – but I could put back a bottle of brandy occasionally, plus all the other naughty things that fly around. I <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> a binge... Then I met Olivia and it all worked out fine." [...] Other Harrison love songs dedicated to Arias include [...] "Dark Sweet Lady" [...] and [...] "Your Love Is Forever", both released on the 1979 album George Harrison.|$|E
2500|$|As in the {{previous}} instalments, Stuart Craig and Stephenie McMillan provided the film's art and set designs, respectively. Due to the film's scope, there were many new sets and transformations of old sets created. McMillan was most excited about redesigning the Great Hall for the scenes involving the Yule Ball. [...] "Originally we thought silver curtains, silver table cloths and an ice dance floor," [...] said McMillan, [...] "but it <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> and on. The drapes man eventually said, 'Why not just stick the fabrics on the wall?'" [...] Each task of the Triwizard Tournament required massive sets. The rock quarry set for the first task, where Harry faces off with the Hungarian Horntail, was built in two sections at Leavesden Studios. Craig called it [...] "one of the biggest sets we've ever built {{for any of the}} films." [...] For the second task, involving the film's underwater scenes, the film crew designed and built a blue screen tank holding [...] "about half a million gallons of water." [...] As for the final task, which took place in the maze, hedge walls ranging from 20 to 40 feet tall were constructed and enhanced with computer-generated imagery.|$|E

60|$|He went on stubbornly for a time. Then {{the strain}} became too great for him. A hot, {{accumulated}} consciousness was always awake in his chest, his wrists felt swelled and quivering, his mind became full of lustful images, his eyes seemed blood-flushed.
