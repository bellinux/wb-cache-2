5|$|Fearful {{of arrest}} as a rebel once {{he left the}} Senate, Benjamin quickly {{departed}} Washington <b>for</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans.</b> On the day of Benjamin's resignation, the Provisional Confederate States Congress gathered in Montgomery, Alabama, and soon chose Davis as president. Davis {{was sworn in as}} provisional Confederate States President on February 18, 1861. At home in New Orleans for, it would prove, the last time, Benjamin addressed a rally on Washington's Birthday, February 22, 1861. On February 25, Davis appointed Benjamin, still in New Orleans, as attorney general; the Louisianan was approved immediately and unanimously by the provisional Congress. Davis thus became the first chief executive in North America to appoint a Jew to his Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the regular}} season, {{speculation}} surrounded whether Turner Gill would leave Buffalo for another school's head coaching position. He {{was identified as}} a candidate at two schools: Syracuse and Auburn. In neither case was Gill hired; Syracuse opted <b>for</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Saints offensive coordinator Doug Marrone, while Auburn passed him over in favor of Iowa State head coach Gene Chizik, a move that prominent former National Basketball Association (NBA) player, Basketball Hall-of-Famer, and Auburn alumnus Charles Barkley claimed was due to racism. Gill ended up signing a contract extension with Buffalo.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two centuries}} since the hurricane, the oceans rose about , the {{wetlands}} around New Orleans have diminished, and the elevation has dropped due to subsidence. These {{have increased the}} threat to the city of a significant hurricane strike. The 1812 hurricane was not a worst-case scenario <b>for</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans,</b> as a stronger and larger hurricane would have caused more damage. If the storm struck in 2012, one researcher estimated the hurricane would have been among the costliest Louisiana hurricanes, comparable to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{made the}} Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

25|$|During the {{administration}} of Morrison's successor, Vic Schiro, the government sponsored studies of the feasibility of relocating New Orleans International Airport to a new site, contemporaneous with similar efforts that were ultimately successful in Houston (George Bush Intercontinental Airport) and Dallas (Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport). This attempt {{got as far as}} recommending a site in New Orleans East; a man-made island was to be created south of I-10 and north of U.S. Route 90 in a bay of Lake Pontchartrain. In the early 1970s it was decided that the current airport should be expanded instead, leading to the construction of a lengthened main terminal ticketing area, an airport access road linking the terminal to I-10, and the present-day Concourses A and B. New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, in office from 1986 to 1994, later reintroduced the idea of building a new international airport for the city, with consideration given to other sites in New Orleans East, {{as well as on the}} Northshore in suburban St. Tammany Parish. Only a couple months before Hurricane Katrina's landfall, Mayor Ray Nagin again proposed a new airport <b>for</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans,</b> this time to the west in Montz, Louisiana. These initiatives met with the same fate as 1960s-era efforts concerning construction of a new airport <b>for</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans.</b>|$|E
