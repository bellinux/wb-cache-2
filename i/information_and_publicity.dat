40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} substantially improve road safety in the Dutch province of Utrecht in the long term. The aim to realise a 'sustainably safe' infrastructure should be {{the focal point of}} this approach. The principles of mixing traffic types at speeds of up to 30 km/h in residential areas, and of separating traffic types at higher speeds on both connecting and on flow roads should be put into practice more consistently. The number of road categories should be restricted as much as possible. Each individual road category should be clearly recognisable. It is already possible to adapt infrastructural measures in order to promote road safety. However, infrastructural measures alone are unable to realise a 'sustainably safe' road traffic system. They need to be integrated into: (1) the legislative and regulatory process; (2) enforcement of compliance with these regulations; (3) education and training; <b>and</b> (4) <b>information</b> campaigns <b>and</b> <b>publicity.</b> However, effective police enforcement is only essential for the realisation of the road safety objective in the short term: 25 % fewer victims by the year 2000. A joint approach towards road hazard should is only feasible, if road safety projects are coordinated between the different parties involved...|$|R
