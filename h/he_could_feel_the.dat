He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{his long}} army career, Dwight Eisenhower {{and his wife}} never had a house to call their own, with the couple moving from army post to army post. After he became Columbia University's {{president}} in 1948, Mamie requested that they finally {{have a place to}} call their own. A married couple that were friends with the Eisenhowers, George and Mary Allen, had recently purchased a small farm around Gettysburg, and recommended the area. In 1950, they found a [...] "run-down farm" [...] on the outskirts of Gettysburg, and purchased the farm and its [...] for $40,000 (equal to $ today) from one Allen Redding, who had owned the farm since 1921. Eisenhower stated that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> [...] "forgotten heroisms" [...] that occurred on the grounds as the Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E

500|$|Mau {{was born}} Pius Piailug in 1932, {{in the village}} of Weiso, on the small coral island of Satawal, in Yap State of the Caroline Islands, a part of the Federated States of Micronesia. Satawal is a wooded island with an area of , located in the western Pacific Ocean about [...] south of Guam. Mau's {{personal}} connection to the sea began early in his life, when he was placed in tide pools in his infancy so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pull of the ocean. At the age of four or five, Mau was chosen by his grandfather Raangipi to study as an apprentice navigator. Mau initially protested his grandfather's teaching, preferring to spend his time playing on the beach with children his own age. [...] Raangipi trained Mau as a young navigator for many years. Their day would begin at sunrise, when they would eat breakfast together and afterwards, take care of chores before they went fishing. During the evening, Mau would join the men in the canoe house as they drank, listening to their stories about navigation and sailing. Raangipi told the young boy that if he chose to become a navigator, Mau could gain respect from his community, eat well, and maintain a position in Satawalese society higher than that of a chief. Encouraged, Mau learned basic navigational clues regarding the [...] "stars, swells, and birds" [...] from Raangipi, but his grandfather died sometime before Mau was fourteen.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was a clear}} {{progression}} in his development, from {{an early}} concentration on tap and musical comedy style to greater complexity using ballet and modern dance forms. Kelly himself refused to categorize his style: [...] "I don't {{have a name for}} my style of dancing...It's certainly hybrid...I've borrowed from the modern dance, from the classical, and certainly from the American folk dance – tap-dancing, jitterbugging...But I have tried to develop a style which is indigenous to the environment in which I was reared." [...] He especially acknowledged the influence of George M. Cohan: [...] "I have a lot of Cohan in me. It's an Irish quality, a jaw-jutting, up-on-the-toes cockiness – which is a good quality for a male dancer to have." [...] He was also heavily influenced by an African-American dancer, Robert Dotson, whom he saw perform at Loew's Penn Theatre around 1929. He was briefly taught by Frank Harrington, an African-American tap specialist from New York. However, his main interest was in ballet, which he studied under Kotchetovsky in the early Thirties. As biographer Clive Hirschhorn explains: [...] "As a child he used to run for miles through parks and streets and woods – anywhere, just as long as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> wind against his body and through his hair. Ballet gave him the same feeling of exhilaration, and in 1933 he was convinced it was the most satisfying form of self-expression." [...] He also studied Spanish dancing under Angel Cansino, Rita Hayworth's uncle. Generally speaking, he tended to use tap and other popular dance idioms to express joy and exuberance – as in the title song from Singin' in the Rain or [...] "I Got Rhythm" [...] from An American in Paris, whereas pensive or romantic feelings were more often expressed via ballet or modern dance, as in [...] "Heather on the Hill" [...] from Brigadoon or [...] "Our Love Is Here to Stay" [...] from An American in Paris.|$|E

60|$|The man hesitated; {{but he was}} too {{worn-out}} to resist, and he made no opposition as Frank {{entered the}} tent. An elderly man lay stretched upon some blankets, one of which was thrown loosely over him. Frank stooped and put his fingers on his wrist. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pulse.|$|R
60|$|The stillness and {{the dusk}} were very impressive. So long had the {{bell-metal}} cogwheel sung its deafening song into Will's ear that, {{as he walked}} away into the dusk, he had a weird feeling of being suddenly deaf, and his legs were so numb that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> earth. <b>He</b> stumbled away like a man paralyzed.|$|R

60|$|At once he overflowed with pity. As a boy he had exulted in Grizel's fear of him; {{as a man}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> only <b>the</b> pain of it.

60|$|Cyril {{knelt down}} on the ground as before, in an agony of suspense, and struck the rail three times {{distinctly}} with his walking-stick. Then he put his ear to it and listened, and waited. In less than half a minute three answering knocks rang, dim but unmistakable, along the buried rail. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> even <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> vibration on the iron with his face.|$|R
60|$|His fingers tingling, {{his whole}} body yearning till every cell seemed a beating hammer, Milt longed just once to slip his hand about Claire's waist like that. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> satin of her bodice and its warmth.|$|E
60|$|Then--how it all {{happened}} he could not himself have told you--he suddenly found himself at her feet, kneeling beside the high-backed chair; his arms were round her shoulders and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> exquisite perfume of her breath upon his cheek.|$|E

50|$|When {{he awoke}} {{there was some}} other {{presence}} in <b>the</b> room and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> it. <b>The</b> table shakes and there is movement but in the dark {{it is hard to}} discern.

60|$|In the {{constant}} {{pushing through the}} crowd the bandages on his shoulder had shifted, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> again <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> claws of the panther tearing at his flesh, and the hot breath of the beast scorching his face.

60|$|For {{the first}} second it {{scarcely}} seemed to stir, then the motion grew palpable, {{and at that}} instant Leonard heard a noise behind him and felt his left foot clasped by a human hand.

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> body of {{the girl}} pressed close to his tremble as her eyes rested upon the inmates of the room, and involuntarily his arm encircled her {{shoulders}} as though {{to protect her from}} some danger which he sensed without recognizing.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Stoop, Hubert, stoop!'

6000|$|Lawford rose {{very slowly}} from his knees. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> in <b>the</b> dark his brows drawn down; {{there came a}} low, sullen beating on his ear; he saw his face as it were in dim outline against the dark.

'Dearest, dearest, you must not be angry with me now!' ...|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} forties, Niaz Fatehpuri had already {{switched}} over to philosophy and criticism, {{for the true}} features {{of the short story}} having been identified with those of Premchand by now, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not but <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> futility of his wanderings in imaginative wilderness.|$|R

60|$|He {{could see}} his father sitting under the oak-tree; and {{suffered}} in advance all the loss of caste he must go through {{in the eyes of}} that tranquil figure, with his knees crossed, thin, old, and elegant; already <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> faint irony which would come into his voice and smile.|$|E
50|$|On January 29, Mahmut Kamil Paşa {{returned}} from Istanbul. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>the</b> Russians {{would not only}} attack to Erzurum but also renew the offensive southern flank around Lake Van. Hınıs, located further south, was taken on February 7 to prevent reinforcements from Muş from coming in. Mahmut Kamil tried to strengthen the defensive lines. That drew most of the Turkish reserves and diverted Turkish {{attention away from the}} decisive attack farther north. On the same day, Russian forces captured Muş after the Battle of Mush. Muş was seventy miles from Erzurum.|$|R
