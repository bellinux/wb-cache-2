25|$|The French {{language}} {{began to}} spread {{with the establishment of}} French settlements, and French is now spoken <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> secluded villages. The level of fluency, however, varies significantly across the population as a whole, primarily due to the absence of universal access to public education before 1953, but also due to immigration and ethnic diversity. At the 2009 census, 97.3% of people aged 15 or older reported that they could speak, read and write French, whereas only 1.1% reported that they had no knowledge of French. Other significant language communities among immigrant populations are those of Wallisian and Javanese language speakers.|$|E
25|$|The Bride and the Butterfly Hunter (1974) is a quirky, surrealistic {{film version}} of a play by Nisim Aloni about a bride who flees her wedding and a clerk who flees his humdrum {{existence}} by escaping to the park every Wednesday afternoon to hunt—and release—butterflies. The encounter between the two {{takes place in a}} park, where political propaganda is broadcast over a loudspeaker system. Though this is not integral to the story, it indicates that <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> whimsical encounters it is impossible to escape the overbearing presence of political forces exploiting the conflicts in Israel for their own advantage. This film was selected to represent Israel at the Prix Italia.|$|E
25|$|According to the Japanese Government, 180,592 {{people in}} the general {{population}} were screened in March 2011 for radiation exposure and no case was found which affects health. Thirty workers conducting operations at the plant had exposure levels greater than 100 mSv. It is believed that the health effects of the radioactivity release are primarily psychological rather than physical effects. <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> severely affected areas, radiation doses never reached {{more than a quarter of}} the radiation dose linked to an increase in cancer risk (25 mSv whereas 100 mSv has been linked to an increase in cancer rates among victims at Hiroshima and Nagasaki). However, people who have been evacuated have suffered from depression and other mental health effects.|$|E

25|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, {{cannibalism}} is not a societal norm, but is sometimes resorted to in situations of extreme necessity. The survivors of the shipwrecks of the Essex and Méduse in the 19th century are said to have engaged in cannibalism, as did the members of Franklin's lost expedition and the Donner Party. Such cases generally involve necro-cannibalism (eating the corpse of someone who is already dead) as opposed to homicidal cannibalism (killing someone for food). In English law, the latter is always considered a crime, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> trying circumstances. The case of R v Dudley and Stephens, in which two men were found guilty of murder for killing and eating a cabin boy while adrift at sea in a lifeboat, set the precedent that necessity is no defence to a charge of murder.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 {{two more}} storm chaser tools emerged. The first, WxWorx, {{was a new}} XM Satellite Radio based system {{utilizing}} a special receiver and Baron Services weather software. Unlike preexisting cellular based services there was no risk of dead spots, and that meant that <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> remote areas storm chasers still had a live data feed. The second tool was {{a new piece of}} software called GRLevel3. GRLevel3 utilized both free and subscription based raw radar files, displaying the data in a true vector format with GIS layering abilities. Since 2006 a growing number of chasers are using Spotter Network (SN), which uses GPS data to plot real time position of participating spotters and chasers, and allows observers to report significant weather as well as GIS layering for navigation maps, weather products, and the like.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the failure}} of the revolt, the {{position}} of the prōtosebastos was weakened: on the one hand, his readiness to use force against fellow citizens <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> hallowed of all churches in the Empire increased popular hostility, while the amnesty offered to Maria and her supporters strengthened the perception of the regime's weakness. The situation was exacerbated when Alexios turned against Patriarch Theodosios for the aid and shelter he had given the rebels. The Patriarch was confined in the Pantepoptes Monastery, and was saved from being dismissed only through the intervention of the Empress-regent {{and other members of the}} imperial family. At long last, the prōtosebastos was forced to consent to the reinstatement of the Patriarch. His triumphal return, with jubilant crowds lining the procession that led him back to the patriarchal palace near the Hagia Sophia, was another blow to the regime's authority.|$|E

25|$|The 150 sedan {{shows an}} {{interesting}} trend in promotional offerings when comparing the early 1950s {{with the early}} 1960s. The pre-performance, post-war era of practicality in the early 1950s gave emphasis to more economical sedans, so it is notable that early promotional model makers commonly molded vehicles in 4-door configurations <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> basic models available. Four-door Bel Airs were offered by PMC {{all the way up}} to 1958, one available with police decor. It is interesting that PMC also did a 1958 Chevrolet in two-door style, reinforcing the trend that by about 1960 most promotional makers only modeled sportier and more powerful 2-door coupes and hardtops. However, a molded red four door did became a Fire Chief car. This was in line with the newer era of a stronger economy, more affluent clientele and the onset of the new baby-boomer driver's market.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, in 1996, member {{countries}} of the European Union, per Directive 94/33/EC, agreed {{to a number of}} exceptions for young people in its child labour laws. Under these rules, children of various ages may work in cultural, artistic, sporting or advertising activities if authorised by the competent authority. Children above the age of 13 may perform light work for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country. Additionally, the European law exception allows children aged 14 years or over to work as part of a work/training scheme. The EU Directive clarified that these exceptions do not allow child labour where the children may experience harmful exposure to dangerous substances. Nonetheless, many {{children under the age of}} 13 do work, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> developed {{countries of the}} EU. For instance, a recent study showed over a third of Dutch twelve-year-old kids had a job, the most common being babysitting.|$|E
25|$|The true {{human is}} an incorporeal contemplative {{capacity}} of the soul, and superior to all things corporeal. It then follows that real human happiness is independent of the physical world. Real happiness is, instead, dependent on the metaphysical and authentic human being found in this highest capacity of Reason. “For man, and especially the Proficient, is not the Couplement of Soul and body: the proof is that man can be disengaged from the body and disdain its nominal goods.” (Enneads I.4.14) The human who has achieved happiness will not be bothered by sickness, discomfort, etc., as his {{focus is on the}} greatest things. Authentic human happiness is the utilization of the most authentically human capacity of contemplation. Even in daily, physical action, the flourishing human’s “…Act is determined by the higher phase of the Soul.” (Enneads III.4.6) <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> dramatic arguments Plotinus considers (if the Proficient is subject to extreme physical torture, for example), he concludes this only strengthens his claim of true happiness being metaphysical, as the truly happy human being would understand that which is being tortured is merely a body, not the conscious self, and happiness could persist.|$|E

25|$|Kala (Susanne Blakeslee) - If his woes {{become too}} great or his {{thoughts}} too burdensome, Tarzan seeks seclusion and the calm council of his gorilla mother, Kala. A sympathetic ear when Tarzan needs someone wise to talk to, Kala {{acts as the}} voice of the apes, always reminding Tarzan of his unique obligations to the family. She is also Jane's closest confidant. The two share a warm, strong bond, and Jane regards her mother-in-law as her only kindred spirit in the jungle. From Kala's point of view, Jane is the human daughter she never had. Kala was Kerchak's mate, and perhaps the only one besides Tarzan that ever openly defied him without repercussions. Her open mind is a well of great wisdom and she is almost always right. Even though Kerchak is gone, she is still highly respected. Although kind and motherly to Tarzan, Jane, and all the gorillas, Kala is almost undoubtedly the bravest gorilla in the family. When the family was trapped in a cave by Tublat, Kala bravely stood up to the villain, and encouraged all the other gorillas to be brave as well. Her presence and support keeps the family together and ensures that they are always there for each other <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> dire situations.|$|E
