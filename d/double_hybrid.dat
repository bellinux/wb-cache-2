Here, we assess the ability of TDDFT to describe the photochemistry of an important class of triplet sensitizers, namely, aromatic ketones. We take acetophenone as a test molecule, for which accurate ab initio results exist in the literature. Triplet acetophenone is generated thanks to an exotic three-state crossing involving one singlet and two triplets states (i. e., a simultaneous intersystem crossing and triplet conical intersection), thus being a stringent test for approximate TDDFT. We show that most exchange-correlation functionals can only give a semi-qualitative picture of the overall photochemistry, in which the three-state crossing is rather represented as a triplet conical intersection separated from the intersystem crossing. The best result overall is given by the <b>double</b> <b>hybrid</b> functional mPW 2 PLYP, which is even able to reproduce quantitatively the three-state crossing region. We rationalize this results by noting that <b>double</b> <b>hybrid</b> functionals include a larger portion of double excitation character to the excited states. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E

40|$|A two-parameter {{extension}} of the density-scaled <b>double</b> <b>hybrid</b> approach of Sharkas et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 134, 064113 (2011) ] is presented. It {{is based on the}} explicit treatment of a fraction of multideterminantal exact exchange. The connection with conventional double hybrids is made when neglecting density scaling in the correlation functional as well as second-order corrections to the density. In this context, the fraction ac of second-order Møller-Plesset (MP 2) correlation energy is not necessarily equal to the square of the fraction ax of Hartree-Fock exchange. More specifically, it is shown that ac ≤ ax 2, a condition that conventional semi-empirical double hybrids actually fulfill. In addition, a new procedure for calculating the orbitals, which has a better justification than the one routinely used, is proposed. Referred to as λ 1 variant, the corresponding <b>double</b> <b>hybrid</b> approximation has been tested on a small set consisting of H 2, N 2, Be 2, Mg 2, and Ar 2. Three conventional double hybrids (B 2 -PLYP, B 2 GP-PLYP, and PBE 0 -DH) have been considered. Potential curves obtained with λ 1 - and regular double hybrids can, in some cases, differ significantly. In particular, for the weakly bound dimers, the λ 1 variants bind systematically more than the regular ones, which is an improvement in many but not all cases. Including density scaling in the correlation functionals may of course change the results significantly. Moreover, optimized effective potentials based on a partially-interacting system could also be used to generate proper orbitals. Work is currently in progress in those directions...|$|E

However, {{its effects on}} metabolome and resulting fruit quality are not yet fully understood, particularly {{when some of the}} ripening-associated biochemical changes are independent of ethylene action. We have generated a homozygous transgenic tomato genotype (2 AS-AS) that exhibits reduced ethylene production as a result of impaired expression of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate synthase 2 gene by its antisense RNA and had a longer shelf life. Double transgenic hybrid (2 AS-AS x 579 HO) developed through a genetic cross between 2 AS-AS and 579 HO (Mehta et al., 2002) lines resulted in significantly higher ethylene production than either the WT or 2 AS-AS fruit. To determine the effects of reduced ethylene and introgression of higher polyamines’ trait, the metabolic profiles of ripening fruits from WT (556 AZ), 2 AS-AS, and 2 AS-AS x 579 HO lines were determined using 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. The levels of Glu, Asp, AMP, Adenosine, Nucl 1 and Nucl 2 increased during ripening of the WT fruit. The increases in Glu, Asp, and AMP levels were attenuated in 2 AS-AS fruit but recovered in the <b>double</b> <b>hybrid</b> with higher ethylene and polyamine levels. The ripening-associated decreases in Ala, Tyr, Val, Ile, Phe, malate and myo-inositol levels in the 2 AS-AS line were not reversed in the <b>double</b> <b>hybrid</b> line suggesting a developmental/ripening regulated accumulation of these metabolites independent of ethylene. Significant increases in the levels of fumarate, formate, choline, Nucl 1 and Nucl 2 at most stages of ripening fruit were found in the double transgenic line due to introgression with higher-polyamines trait.

The <b>double</b> cross <b>hybrids,</b> from different origins, that is,the F 1, F 2 or F 2 i generations were similar in their yield performance and variability what showsthat it is possible to reduce the cost of <b>double</b> cross <b>hybrid</b> seed production using the intercrossedpopulation derived from the SC hybrid, so line multiplication is not needed nor does the SC F 1 hybrid have to be obtained every year...|$|R
40|$|Brassica carinata (BBCC, 2 n = 34) {{possesses}} {{many good}} agronomic characters and, {{to provide more}} genetic information about this species and utilize it further, 110 accessions of B. carinata were tested for genetic variation by using 233 amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, so that a dendrogram could be constructed. To combine the good traits of B. carinata and B. rapa (AA, 2 n = 20) with those of B. napus (AACC, 2 n = 38) which is the major rapeseed variety in China, interspecific crosses between these two species have been made which have resulted in 276 <b>doubled</b> <b>hybrids</b> (AABBCC). These hexaploids combine positive characters {{and can be used}} for crossing with B. napus. Brassica carinata as the female parents exhibited extensive differences in interspecific crossability and 20 high crossability accessions were identified. The Poisson Regression Model analysis result (P < 0. 0255) indicated that such differences were due to the genotype of the accessions. Accessions with high crossability could promote gene flow within the genus Brassica...|$|R
