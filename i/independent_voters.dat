Preckwinkle {{was endorsed by}} then state Rep.

5|$|Throughout October, {{the media}} {{emphasized}} the lead Johnson had over Goldwater, stating that Goldwater had {{little chance of}} winning the election. This negative coverage of the campaign caused many <b>independent</b> <b>voters,</b> who were not strong supporters of either candidate, not to vote, for they believed {{the result of the}} election had been already determined.|$|E

The Chicago Tribune endorsed Orbach. Shiller charged that Orbach catered to developers, displacing people {{in the wake of}} rehabilitation that priced housing {{out of the reach of}} many, and said she wanted community zoning boards, with their decisions binding on the alderman.

25|$|Democrats reacted {{positively}} to John Kerry's acceptance speech. With Democrats strongly {{opposed to the}} Bush administration, John Kerry {{spent most of his}} speech appealing to <b>independent</b> <b>voters</b> and to swing voters.

25|$|The {{speculation}} that the AKP were preparing for large-scale election fraud to keep the HDP out of parliament mainly originated from the hugely controversial 2014 local elections, which were marred by allegations of misconduct. However, the largely controversy-free general election was partly attributed to better preparation of the opposition parties for the election process. Furthermore, large-scale efforts by <b>independent</b> <b>voters</b> to monitor the election was also seen as significant, with organisations such as Oy ve Ã–tesi (Voting and Beyond) training volunteers to become election observers for polling day. Such organisations were also active during the overseas voting process.|$|E

25|$|A US Census in 2006 {{reported}} that the population of New Hampshire was 1,314,895. 356,897 did not declare a party affiliation. These <b>independent</b> <b>voters</b> make up 44 percent of the New Hampshire electorate and could have voted in either the Democratic primary or the Republican Party's primary, but couldn't have voted in both. Democratic voters made up a smaller proportion. 216,005 people have registered as a Democrat. These statistics are important because in 2004, the New Hampshire independents leaned towards the Democratic side in favor of then-candidate John Kerry. Since then, New Hampshire has become more Democratic, replacing their Republican governor and state legislature with a government led by Democratic politicians. However, the people of New Hampshire are divided into several smaller regions, so the entire state as a whole wouldn't {{have been expected to}} act in a uniform manner.|$|E
25|$|A NY1-Marist Poll {{released}} show of November 1ed 44 {{percent of}} New York voters supported the Occupy Wall Street movement, while only 21 percent supported the Tea Party. A survey of roughly 1,000 adults conducted from November 10 to 14 found that majorities of nearly identical size felt that Occupy Wall Street, and the Tea Party, respectively, {{did not share}} their values. A November 3 poll done by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute found that 30 percent of American voters have a favorable view of the protests, while 39 percent do not. The same poll found that among <b>independent</b> <b>voters,</b> 29 percent have a favorable view opposed to 42 percent who have an unfavorable view, while 45% of Democrats have a favorable view opposed to 19% who have an unfavorable view. A Pew Research Center poll, released December 15, 2011, found that nearly {{three months after the}} start of OWS, 44% support the Occupy Wall Street movement and 35% oppose it. Americans overwhelmingly agree with the concerns raised by the movement, but more disapprove of the tactics used than approve.|$|E

Paul was disappointed in the Libertarian Party for nominating Gary Johnson for President of the United States and told <b>independent</b> <b>voters</b> that Jill Stein was a better candidate for those who [...] "lean towards progressivism and liberalism".|$|E
