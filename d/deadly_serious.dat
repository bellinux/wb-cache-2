Some of the {{performances}} he provided for his previous AIP movies had certain elements of campy overacting, but in Witchfinder he was subtle and <b>deadly</b> <b>serious.</b> The role was a great challenge for Price, as his frequent clashes with Reeves left him unsure {{as to what the}} director wanted (see [...] "Filming" [...] section below).

500|$|Unconnected {{with the}} Pynchon case, DCI Wilder Blanks (Walker) begins seeing visions {{related to the}} Stoics, [...] "a group {{dedicated}} {{to the destruction of}} magic" [...] in favor of [...] "reason, rationality, and [...] science"a laughable prospect, but one about which they are <b>deadly</b> <b>serious.</b> [...] Twelve years previously (1999), the Stoics committed a series of murders to further their cause, but have neither been seen nor heard of since. [...] Blanks retrieves DS Mira Barkley (Channing) from her dissatisfying work in another precinct to help with the Stoics; Barkley was his partner during the previous Stoics case. [...] Blanks partners Barkley with rookie detective Jimmy Travers (Long) due to the latter's potential as an intuitive savant. [...] Investigating a nuisance case in an apartment building, Barkley and Travers unwittingly allow the Stoics access to murder an otherwise protected tenant, a college professor of [...] "advanced magical engineering and biology with an emphasis on power plant design." [...] In the dénouement, it is revealed that the Stoics use [...] "mechanical, rather than 'true' magic" [...] which nothing in their world can defend against; the professor was killed using the Stoics' means, something called a bullet.|$|E
50|$|Nicotine {{poisoning}} {{describes the}} symptoms of the toxic effects of nicotine following ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact. Nicotine poisoning can potentially be <b>deadly,</b> though <b>serious</b> or fatal overdoses are rare. Historically, most cases of nicotine poisoning {{have been the result}} of use of nicotine as an insecticide. More recent cases of poisoning typically appear to be in the form of Green Tobacco Sickness, or due to accidental ingestion of tobacco or tobacco products or consumption of nicotine-containing plants.|$|R

Something similar could also be said about his plots. Possibly the main drawback is that although Caine's books can be romantic and emotionally moving, they lack humour; they are <b>deadly</b> earnest and <b>serious.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the school}} on August 30, 2013, at 2:30 PM, a 15-year-old student was shot {{three times in}} the neck and shoulder. The student was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. An 18-year-old student was arrested by a school {{resource}} officer and was charged with assault with a <b>deadly</b> weapon inflicting <b>serious</b> injury, and four firearms-related charges. He faces up to 14 years in prison. The victim said that he was not familiar with the suspect, and that the shooting may have been a case of mistaken identity.|$|R
500|$|Sally-Anne Croft and Susan Hagan were extradited from Britain in 1994, {{and were}} convicted {{by a jury}} {{decision}} on July 28, 1995, for their roles in the assassination plot. They had unsuccessfully attempted to appeal their extradition from Britain to Home Secretary Michael Howard. During their trial the prosecution presented twenty-nine witnesses, including former followers of Rajneesh who placed both women in planning meetings where they discussed murdering Turner. David Berry Knapp, {{the former mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, testified for the government in the case and implicated Croft and Hagan in the assassination conspiracy. Ava Kay Avalos (Ma Ava), a Rajneesh disciple, testified in the Croft case and stated that she {{had been part of the}} conspirators that plotted to assassinate Turner. In addition to Knapp and Avalos, co-conspirators Richard Kevin Langford, Phyllis Caldwell, and Alma Peralta testified in the case pursuant to conditional plea or immunity agreements. Both women were sentenced to five years in prison. Croft and Hagan did not testify during their trial. [...] "We hashed over everything – evidence, notes, evidence, notes. I think we did an absolutely fabulous job," [...] said one of the jurors. At the sentencing for Croft and Hagan, the federal Judge Malcolm Marsh described them as [...] "people of obvious goodwill who had committed an extremely serious offense against the criminal justice system." [...] Prosecutor Tim Reardon called the conspiracy to commit assassination [...] "a <b>deadly</b> <b>serious</b> crime aimed at the heart of the criminal justice system." [...] Croft and Hagan were released from imprisonment at FCI Dublin, California, in April 1998, and returned to Britain.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{overwhelmingly}} negative reviews, a few reviewers {{had positive}} {{things to say}} about the song and video. Entertainment Weekly writer Joseph Lynch noted that there was [...] "something sickeningly catchy about this tune that keeps you coming back for more." [...] Rolling Stones Perpetua stated, [...] "When you see this video, you immediately notice everything that it does 'wrong', but it actually gets {{a lot of things about}} pop music right, if just by accident." [...] OK! Magazine also noted that [...] "some are calling the 13-year-old signed singer the next Justin Bieber." [...] After watching the video, singer Chris Brown said: [...] "Honest opinion? It was great. I'll be jammin' to it on Friday, Friday." [...] Fellow teenage singer Miley Cyrus denied that she had criticized Black, saying [...] "I am a fan" [...] and that she sang [...] "Friday" [...] while driving. Simon Cowell praised Black, saying [...] "I love her [...] the fact that she's gotten so much publicity. People are so upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. [...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being <b>deadly</b> <b>serious.</b> Whatever she's done has worked. Whether you like her or not, she's the most talked-about artist in America right now. Nobody over the age of 18 should understand her or like her. So she should just do it her way." ...|$|E

For example, former Australian captain Allan Border said: [...] "I firmly believe that this status should be {{restricted}} to matches between national sides. Test cricket is an institution that has been built up {{over a period of}} 128 years, and it should not be tampered with". Conversely, Tony Greig, who played for the Rest of the World against Australia in 1971–1972, said [...] "My understanding of the status of first-class and Test cricket is related to the standard of the players.

All were taken to WakeMed hospital in Raleigh. On October 29, 2013, the operator of the ride, Timothy Dwayne Tutterow, was charged with three felony counts of assault with a <b>deadly</b> weapon inflicting <b>serious</b> bodily injury in connection with the accident. In June 2015, Tutterow pleaded guilty, but has not been sentenced as part of a plea arrangement to testify against the ride owner, Joshua Gene Macaroni.

40|$|Acute lung injury (ALI) is a <b>deadly</b> symptom for <b>serious</b> lung inflammation. Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 (DDR 1) {{is a new}} {{potential}} {{target for}} anti-inflammatory drug discovery.

50|$|On December 30, 2009, Soles (at the time, the longest-serving {{legislator}} in the state) {{announced he}} would not seek re-election in 2010. This came after an August, 2009 incident in which he shot {{a young man and}} former legal client in the leg who was allegedly trying to kick in Soles' front door. In another incident, Soles pepper sprayed a young man. Soles' lawyer, Joseph Cheshire, said the shooting was self-defense. Cheshire and Soles have said that Soles has been generous to former clients in hoping to ease them back to a law-abiding life. Soles has denied having sexual relations with any of the young men. Soles was indicted on charges of assault with a <b>deadly</b> weapon inflicting <b>serious</b> injury on 7 January 2010. Soles pleaded guilty in 2010 to {{assault with a deadly weapon}} and was fined $1,000.|$|R
2500|$|Schulz {{decided to}} produce {{all aspects of}} the strip himself from the script to the {{finished}} art and lettering. Schulz did, however, hire help to produce the comic book adaptations of Peanuts. Thus, the strip was able to be presented with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally not used, and when they were, Schulz's frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing [...] "its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions." [...] Schulz held this belief all his life, reaffirming in 1994 the importance of crafting the strip himself: [...] "This is not a crazy business about slinging ink. This is a <b>deadly</b> <b>serious</b> business." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephen King {{liked the}} film, stating: [...] "Of Fox's two summer creepshows , give the edge to The Happening, partly because M. Night Shyamalan really understands fear, partly because this time he's {{completely}} let himself go (hence the R rating), {{and partly because}} after Lady in the Water {{he had something to}} prove". Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, awarding the movie three stars, found it [...] "oddly touching": [...] "It is no doubt too thoughtful for the summer action season, but I appreciate the quietly realistic way Shyamalan finds to tell a story about the possible death of man". William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called it [...] "something different—and a pleasant surprise" [...] among that summer's major Hollywood releases, and approved of its taking [...] "the less-is-best approach." [...] The New York Times’ Manohla Dargis praised Wahlberg's lead performance, adding that the film [...] "turns out to be a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent, moments of shivery and twitchy suspense". Philipa Hawker of The Age gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting on [...] "the mood of the film: a tantalizing, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters," [...] drawing special attention to [...] "the sound of the breeze and the sight of it ruffling the trees or blowing across the grass— an image of tension that calls to mind Antonioni's Blowup". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "It almost dares you to roll your eyes or laugh at certain scenes that are supposed to be <b>deadly</b> <b>serious.</b> But, you know what, I appreciated this creatively offbeat, daring sci-fi mind-trip". Reviewer Rumsey Taylor said that the film moves forward with [...] "jack-in-the-box suspense, traipsing from one garish death to another in a parade of cartoonish terror," [...] and noted how the film seemed like [...] "Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds, only without the birds." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once {{it became}} clear that Eccleston would decline to appear, Moffat turned to an {{alternative}} concept he had been formulating, featuring a [...] "mayfly Doctor" [...] who appears for a single episode, asking, [...] "Would it be weird in the run of the series to have the 45th Doctor turn up and be played by Johnny Depp or someone? Would that be a cool thing to do?". He also indicated that the [...] "classic Doctor" [...] he would most like to feature in a new story was William Hartnell's First Doctor, stating, [...] "You'd want him to come and say 'What in the name of God have I turned into?' That's the confrontation that you most want to see, to celebrate 50 years. Going round and round in circles on it I just thought, 'What about a Doctor that he never talks about?' And what if it is a Doctor who's done something terrible, who's much <b>deadlier</b> and more <b>serious,</b> who represents that thing that is the undertow in both David and Matt. You know there's a terrible old man inside them. Well, here he is, facing the children he becomes, as it were." ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} known and acknowledged in contemporary {{times that the}} burning of coal and other fossil fuels has caused environmental harm on a global scale, especially global warming caused by {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} and other gases. Nuclear energy does not cause emissions, but the risk of nuclear accidents is a <b>deadly</b> and <b>serious</b> one for communities close to nuclear power stations. 8 Furthermore, humans have not yet found a completely safe method for disposal of nuclear waste. 9 Florini and Sovacool write that global energy governance is currently on an unsustainable and conflict-prone path. There are issues of unreliable supply, brittle and vulnerable energy infrastructure, massive environmental degradation, and failure to deliver energy services. 10 Udall {{goes so far as to}} say that 'energy is the original currency', and that mankind is at the beginning of a period of resource nationalism. 11 Victor and Yueh endorse this view, saying that the decade between 2000 and 2010 has seen governments in all the large consumer nations of the world besieged by doubts about their energy security. 12 The increasing demand for energy across the world has a number of consequences. Among these, the most challenging for governments is the association of energy generation with climate change, resulting from emission of greenhouse gases in the process of burning fossil-based fuels to generate electricity. 13 Victor and Yueh describe the energy sector as one of the most exciting technological frontiers in the world, with many countries changing their expectation as to what the sector should deliver, due to climate change. 14 Across the world, renewable energy sources are being recognised as the safest and most desirable energy sources, as they are largely free of emissions and are non-depletable. 15 In South Africa the legislative framework explicitly promotes the development and use of renewable energy. In this dissertation it will be shown how municipalities in South Africa can play a valuable role in energy governance, which, it is posited, is a central element of their legislative responsibilities with regard to service delivery, upholding of the Bill of Rights, promoting a safe and healthy environment, promoting local economic development, and other issues...|$|R
30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} {{in this regard}} to stress that the term “limited sovereignty” was not coined by Schroeder himself, but had been mentioned {{in the context of}} German reunification. In 1990 it had been confirmed in a press statement that “The united Germany receives at the moment of its unification its full and unlimited sovereignty” (highlighted by author) meaning {{at the time that the}} “four power rights and responsibilities” had been rendered null and void and that Germany’s sovereignty over its territory had been fully restored (Gray et al. 1996 : 245). Limited sovereignty refers in this context to the former lack of authority of Germany to govern itself within its own territorial borders without any interference from outside sources or bodies. For Schroeder, who had been dissatisfied with Germany being perceived by the world as paymaster, Afghanistan presented an opportunity to engage and test Germany’s military capabilities for the first time since 1945 by dispatching German ground forces to a remote conflict (Hacke, 2008). Interestingly, the conservative Merkel has endorsed the social-democrat Schroeder in her assessment of the situation in Afghanistan. In a major government declaration on Afghanistan from 2009 Merkel justified the German mission to: “protect the lives of people in Germany from the evil of international terrorism” (Associated Press, 2009). That being said, the argument connecting German national security to the Taliban threat has remained, vague and weak. The military parliamentary mandate that was formulated, reflected a cautious, reluctant and maybe even delusive national perspective. This logic ultimately led to the acceptance of the offensive use of force. The biggest damage to Germany’s reputation as highly respected civilian power was caused in 2009, when a German airstrike resulted in the death of many civilians in the Kunduz region. Kunduz became a deep source of criticism against German military involvement in Afghanistan. The defensive mandate given to soldiers had not matched the reality on the battleground and the strict field operations manual guidelines (rules of engagement) issued by the US commandment to ensure that no civilians become unintended targets of NATO airstrikes had not been observed by the acting German field commander. This resulted in the significant loss of lives and the entanglement of German soldiers in offensive counter-insurgency operations. Even though no one was held criminally or legally accountable, the <b>deadly</b> airstrike had <b>serious</b> consequences for some: Germany’s Army Chief of Staff resigned in late 2009 over the airstrike. In late May 2010, the German President Horst Koehler followed and resigned after a row over remarks where he had linked the use of military force in Afghanistan to the protection of legitimate German national economic interests.|$|R

And {{it might have been the}} tenacity, the unintelligent tenacity, of the man who had persisted in throwing millions of other people's thrift into the Lone Valley Railway, the Labrador Docks, the Spotted Leopard Copper Mine, and other grotesque speculations exposed during the famous de Barral trial, amongst murmurs of astonishment mingled with bursts of laughter. For it is in the Courts of Law that Comedy finds its last refuge in our <b>deadly</b> <b>serious</b> world.

For want of it I was hardening, crystallizing, growing blind to the joy and variety of existence. Nancy could have saved me; she brought it home to me that I needed salvation.... I was struck by another thought; in spite of our separation, in spite of her marriage and mine, she was still nearer to me--far nearer--than any other being.|$|E

Well, it was about time, thought Duane, that he made use of his name if it were to help him at all. That name had been MacNelly's hope. He had anchored all his scheme to Duane's fame. Duane was tempted to ride off after Fletcher and stay with him. This, however, would hardly be fair to an outlaw who had been fair to him. Duane concluded to await developments and when the gang rode in to Ord, probably from their various hiding-places, he would be there ready to be denounced by Knell. Duane could not see any other culmination of this series of events than a meeting between Knell and himself. If that terminated fatally for Knell there was all probability of Duane's being in no worse situation than he was now. If Poggin took up the quarrel!
