500|$|When Ambrosius {{first met}} Jackson, {{it took a}} few minutes to calm down. She {{recalled}} to the same publication Stewart was interviewed by, [...] "To begin with, I was kinda shook. Because you don't realize how you're going to feel until you're put in that situation. I had the tears in my eyes and got kinda nervous. But as I got into it, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> work, it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend." [...] Harris commented on the single, [...] "He's showing you, I'm still the Michael Jackson that did 'Billie Jean' and 'Rock With You' because 'Butterflies' really falls along those lines." ...|$|E
500|$|Danny Elfman {{had great}} enthusiasm for {{returning}} because [...] "I didn't {{have to prove}} myself from the first film. I remember Jon Peters was very skeptical at first to hire me." [...] Elfman's work schedule was 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. [...] "When completing this movie <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> something of a film score and an opera. It was 95 minutes long, twice {{the amount of the}} average film score." [...] Burton allowed Elfman to be more artistic with the sequel score, such as the [...] "scraping" [...] on violins for the cat themes. Under the pressure of finishing the score, however, {{the relationship between the two}} strained, which — along with further [...] "creative differences" [...] on The Nightmare Before Christmas — led Burton to use Howard Shore to score his next film Ed Wood. The musician co-orchestrated [...] "Face to Face", which was written and performed by Siouxsie and the Banshees. The song can be heard in one scene during the film and during the end credits.|$|E
500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a fumble and did the wrong thing. I realized I was wrong but there was nothing I could do about it." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Reincarnation of a Lovebird" [...] is a {{composition}} dedicated to Bird. [...] "I wouldn't say I {{set out to}} write a piece on Bird. ... Suddenly <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Bird. ... In one way, the work isn't like him. It's built on long lines {{and most of his}} pieces were short lines. But it's my feeling about Bird. I felt like crying when I wrote it." ...|$|R

2500|$|Throughout the year, Friedgen had {{challenged}} {{his players}} {{with the phrase}} [...] "Are you in or are you out?" [...] After the dramatic first-year turnaround, he was a high-profile candidate for an NFL position, and his players repeated his question. He remained at Maryland and said, [...] "Last year the kids {{made a commitment to}} me and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my turn. We've got plenty left to do. This program has not yet arrived." ...|$|E
2500|$|May {{spoke about}} this {{incident}} years later, saying, [...] "the first thing I knew I was being fired {{on from the}} rear ... all I could do was try to dodge my attacker. I noticed it was a red tri-plane, but if <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Richthofen, I would have probably {{passed out on the}} spot. I kept on dodging and spinning, I imagine from about 12,000 feet until I ran out of sky and had to hedge hop over the ground. Richthofen was firing at me continually, [...] the only thing that saved me was my poor flying. I didn't know what I was doing myself and I do not suppose that Richthofen could figure out what I was going to do".|$|E
2500|$|Project leader Colonel S. and {{his team}} in the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure (Maf'at) had very little spare time, and only on the {{weekends}} could they think of an appropriate name for the system. According to Colonel S., [...] "The first name I thought of was 'Anti-Qassam', but when the project started to move forward <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> problematic... I sat down with my wife, and together we thought of suitable names. She suggested the name 'Tamir' (Hebrew acronym for טיל מיירט, Til Meyaret, 'interceptor missile') for the missile, and for the system itself we thought of 'Golden Dome'. The following Sunday, 'Tamir' was immediately approved, {{but there was a}} problem with 'Golden Dome'—it could be perceived as ostentatious. So it was changed to 'Iron Dome'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For this reason, I {{owed it to}} you to speak--to thank you. <b>I</b> have <b>realized,</b> {{since that}} first meeting, that you became my friend then, and that you spoke as a friend.

But then some loud noise outside woke me up, and I {{wanted to go back to}} the dream and get an ending. But I couldn't fall back asleep so I {{recorded}} what I remembered right there and then on my phone. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a gothic romance setting, so in fact I'd be able to do it all around my home base, rather than have to go to a distant country.|$|R
60|$|We speculated {{upon what}} {{might be in the}} wind, during ten minutes or more without coming to any {{satisfactory}} conclusion, and then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my duty to make the other lads acquainted with the orders of the day, so far as they concerned us, therefore I hastened away in order to find them, for my Minute Boys were prone to scatter all over the encampment, instead of remaining in any one particular place.|$|E
6000|$|Resolved not to {{be caught}} a second time in such a humiliating {{position}} by a Democrat, I asked my father that night what the Tariff was. But I {{was too young to}} understand it, he said. I was to take his word for it that the country would go to the dogs if the Democrats got in and the Tariff were taken away. Here, in a nutshell, though neither he nor <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> the political instruction of the marching hordes. Theirs not to reason why. I was too young, they too ignorant. Such is the method of Authority! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not even}} do that," [...] said West. [...] "On {{the day of the}} funeral Joe {{carelessly}} left them lying upon a table, so I slipped them into my pocket. When I thought of them again Joe had gone away and I did not know his address. I came over and searched the cupboard unsuccessfully. But it was not a matter of great importance at that time if the stock was mislaid, since {{there was no one to}} contest my ownership of it. It was only after Mr. Merrick accused me of robbing my old friends and ordered my payments stopped that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important to me to prove my ownership.

5000|$|Frehley noted: [...] "I wrote 'Cold Gin' in a New York subway, in my head, both {{lyrics and}} music. I had a spiral {{notebook}} with me. I never took a guitar lesson, nobody believes that. <b>I</b> didn't <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> gonna become a Kiss classic".|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{high time}} for me to vacate that {{position}} unless I wished the couple to discover me, and so I slipped back into the shadow, just in time, as they strode out carrying something. I watched them vanish into the blackness, heard the scout answer their hail, and then I crawled back swiftly--toward the door this time. A glance through the window in passing showed me that the remaining outlaw stood with his back toward the entrance, and his eyes fixed on the Colonel. The door was half closed when I reached it, and for a moment I stood there shortening my grip on the rifle and gathering my breath; then with a bound I drove it inward, and whirled aloft the butt of the Winchester.|$|E
5000|$|Borom {{served in}} the U.S. Army briefly in 1943, but was {{released}} because of migraine headaches.

5000|$|Gold {{first came}} up with the idea as a means to {{liquidate}} slow selling wines at his liquor store. [...] "Whenever I'd put wine or cheese on sale for $1.02 or 98 cents, it never sold out," [...] Gold said in 2001 interview with The Los Angeles Times. [...] "When I put a 99 cent sign on anything, it was gone in no time. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a magic number." ...|$|E
60|$|With the {{approach}} of night <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to make arrangements for the girl's comfort. With {{the aid of a}} couple of upright poles I stretched a grey blanket across the raft so as to make a complete partition.|$|R
6000|$|... "One moment, sir," [...] I said, as <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a pink bald head, {{and not a}} red face, {{which was}} {{fronting}} me. [...] "I am not very clear yet why I am to interview this gentleman. What has he done?" ...|$|R

5000|$|His father, {{speaking}} {{of the fact that}} he has two sons playing in the National Football League, said: [...] "I just kvell."

5000|$|I {{secretly}} cherished {{the idea}} of being a great artist [...] [...] [...] but that dream seemed in no way possible of realization [...] [...] [...] Although my desire to create beauty was strong, I did not seem to possess talent for music, writing, painting or sculpture, at the time, the only outlet a woman had to express any artistic ability [...] [...] [...] My artistic yearnings lay fallow until <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to earn my living.|$|E

50|$|Lorenzo Semple, Jr. {{wrote the}} script. He later recalled:Dino {{wanted to make}} Flash Gordon humorous. At the time, I {{thought that was a}} {{possible}} way to go, but, in hindsight, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a terrible mistake. We kept fiddling around with the script, trying to decide whether to be funny or realistic. That was a catastrophic thing to do, with so much money involved... I never thought the character of Flash in the script was particularly good. But there was no pressure to make it any better. Dino had a vision of a comic-strip character treated in a comic style. That was silly, because Flash Gordon was never intended to be funny. The entire film got way out of control.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{composition}} [...] "Closing Time", Semisonic would usually end their concerts {{with the song}} [...] "If I Run". However, the band eventually grew tired of playing this song every night and so Wilson set out to write a new song that they could play {{at the end of}} their set. Wilson's girlfriend was pregnant at the time and although Wilson did not set out consciously to write a song about giving birth, he has stated that [...] "Part way into the writing of the song, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> also about being born." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nothing was moving. In a {{place where}} I had made many friends, and {{hundreds}} of photographs, it was many things, but never silent. Usually, kids were yelling and playing, women were talking, dogs were barking, cars horns were honking ... but, on this morning, all was quiet. I was surrounded by piles of what, at first glance, looked like garbage, but as my brain started to work, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> piles of corpses.
