Identical in height, slightly varying in width (square, vertical rectangle, horizontal rectangle), evenly spaced and united by a certain blueness of tone, the photographs are portraits of a middle-aged man and woman; close-ups of stuffed animals and feather-strewn birds' nests; stills from Iceland's favorite television soap opera, The Guiding Light; and the beam of a lighthouse cutting through the night. There are also images of {{the interior of a}} plain house near the Arctic Circle; expanses of tundra, and of ground scattered with feathers in some instances and with stuffed dead birds in others.

500|$|Critics {{from both}} Rolling Stone and Blender made strong {{comparisons}} between Long Distance and the English musical duo Everything but the Girl. The former stated that [...] "any fan of Everything but the Girl, Saint Etienne or vintage Blondie should find plenty to swoon over", {{while the latter}} called the sound [...] "cloudy and distant, [...] takes tentative steps toward Everything but the Girl". In a more mixed review, a critic from SonicNet stated that [...] "Ivy specialize in nebulously oriented dream-pop: too ethereal for straight pop fans, too structured for the 4AD crowd." [...] In a divided review, Michaelangelo Matos of City Pages noted that he preferred Ivy's previous releases, but stated, [...] "If your band had spent four years getting dropped and picked up and dropped again by record labels, you'd sound tired too." [...] Similarly, a reviewer from Alternative Press was negative, expressing that [...] "the 13 tracks here are improbably <b>edgeless,</b> all love-me-do/love-me-don't plaints that evaporate on impact".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the controversies surrounding {{the early years of}} their career, the band has also drawn a fair amount of professional criticism in their home state. The Portland Mercury have been frequent detractors of the Daddies, deriding them as [...] "at best, an <b>edgeless</b> recycle of a rather particular musical fashion movement; at worst, a self-conscious parody of the genre they purport to love", while the Willamette Week, in an article detailing the band's polarizing reception, described the negative consensus of the Daddies as [...] "an annoying white-boy funk rock band who, seeing the opportunity, milked the swing revival for all it was worth". Jazz critic and author Scott Yanow vociferously criticized the band as the choice [...] "whipping boy for the Retro Swing movement" [...] in his 2000 book Swing!, writing them off as [...] "a punk rock band who has chosen to masquerade as Swing, at least until a better fad comes along", spotlighting the Daddies' [...] "mediocre" [...] rhythm section and profane lyricism as a case for making them [...] "a band to avoid".|$|E
500|$|Upon Louds release, {{multiple}} music critics {{wrote about}} [...] "Fading" [...] {{as part of}} their review, many of whom praised the production of the song. Emily Mackay of NME wrote about the song as part of an overall review of the album, writing [...] "A weird baroque pop opening, violin stabs and treated vocals, builds slowly into a rolling and shuddering beat and soft, sad-toned piano. Mesfin Fekadu of The Boston Globe called the track [...] "exceptional" [...] and compared the lyrical content to that of one of Rihanna's previous singles [...] "Take A Bow", writing that Rihanna is skilled at putting out songs about being the woman in a relationship who leaves the man, as she does in [...] "Fading". Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Polow da Don's production of the song, writing [...] "Fading' strategizes with long and short elements—sustained choruses and staccato verses, <b>edgeless</b> keyboard chords and notes that are suddenly truncated—to capture the ambivalence of a failing romance." [...] Melissa Maerz of Rolling Stone commented that the singer manages to remain [...] "serene" [...] on the song, even with the sampling of Enya's [...] "One by One", and added that [...] "maybe the good girl gone bad is getting better?", in reference to Rihanna's third studio album title, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007).|$|E

Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly found the songwriting perfunctory and commented that the album [...] "furthers the uncomfortable and frustrating disconnect between Brown's hotheaded personal life and his oddly <b>edgeless</b> musical persona." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times criticized Brown's [...] "brazenness" [...] and stated, [...] "Listening to Mr. Brown at the deepest level balances aesthetic pleasures, when they happen, with superegolike self-protection against aligning oneself too closely with someone who's done such heinous things." ...|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 66, based on 22 reviews. Jon Pareles of Blender {{felt that the}} album [...] "advances" [...] from her previous two albums [...] "by showing an experimental side." [...] Spin commented that Keys' songwriting has improvement from her previous work. In a rave review of the album, Gregory Stephen Tate of The Village Voice praised Keys for her vintage soul influence and called As I Am a [...] "complete work". NME perceived the album as a departure from Keys' previous albums and described it as [...] "streetwise, smoky set of real soul". Entertainment Weeklys Neil Drumming described it as [...] "Keys' most polished — if, at times, <b>edgeless</b> — album to date". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote that [...] "Keys isn't quite a superwoman come to save R from itself, but the timeless quality of As I Am is right on time." [...] USA Today called it Keys' [...] "most cohesive studio album". Nate Chinen of The New York Times stated [...] "As I Am radiates not just confidence but also experience", and called it Keys' [...] "strongest effort yet". According to The Star-Ledger the album is [...] "another solid effort" [...] but [...] "not the masterpiece that Keys seems capable of producing, someday".|$|E

[...] Evan Davies of Now Magazine wrote, [...] "Bittersweet is another testament {{to the fact that}} Simpson has little to offer, this time taking the form of an <b>edgeless,</b> forgettable pop rock that desperately tries to hit the mark but almost always falls short." [...] Allison Stewart of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "Bittersweet World feels reactive and very, very empty, as if it swung at every passing trend and missed." [...] Dan Gennoe of Dotmusic wrote that [...] "she's got an album which for all its sing-along moments is neither catchy nor extreme enough to be exceptional." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today, giving the album two out of four stars, called it [...] "a collection of bouncy, banal homages to the '80s" [...] and wrote that Simpson, [...] "aided by Timbaland, The Neptunes' Chad Hugo and others, channels Debbie Harry, Madonna and Toni Basil about as well as any girl who could afford the help." [...] IGN wrote that Simpson seemed [...] "confused, awry, and decidedly astray in terms of discovering her own unique personality and sound. Until she's able to establish her own distinct entity, Ashlee is destined to be another forgotten footnote on the fickle pop front." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent only gave the album one star and wrote, [...] "Her voice is all attitude and no emotion, a textbook case of style over substance – and given the paucity of style, that's as insubstantial as it gets." [...] Blender critic Ryan Dombal wrote, [...] "in the quest to make overly bronzed twentysomethings sweat, this endearing pseudo–rebel loses much of the little–sister angst that made her so appealing in the first place." [...] Tom Young of Orange United Kingdom described Simpson as an [...] "enigma for the UK audience" [...] and that Bittersweet World [...] "does nothing to clear up her purpose." ...|$|E

6000|$|Nothing {{could have}} {{exceeded}} {{at the same}} time our general sense--unless I all discreetly again confine myself to the spare record of my own--for our good fortune in never having been, even when most helpless, dragged by any approach to a faint jerk over the threshold of the inhabited temple. It stood there in the centre of our family life, into which its doors of fine austere bronze opened straight; we passed and repassed them when we didn't more consciously go round and behind; we took for granted vague grand things within, but we never paused to peer or penetrate, and none the less never had the so natural and wistful, perhaps even the so properly resentful, [...] "Oh I say, do look in a moment for manners if for nothing else!" [...] called after us as we went. Our admirable mother sat on the steps at least and caught reverberations of the inward mystic choir; but there were positive contemporary moments when I well-nigh became aware, I think, of something graceless, something not to the credit of my aspiring [...] "intellectual life," [...] or of whatever small pretensions to seriousness I might have begun to nourish, in the anything but heroic impunity of my inattention. William, later on, made up for this not a little, redeeming so, to a large extent, as he grew older, our filial honour in the matter of a decent sympathy, if not of a noble curiosity: distinct to me even are certain echoes of passages between our father and his eldest son that I assisted at, more or less indirectly and wonderingly, as at intellectual [...] "scenes," [...] gathering from them portents of my brother's independent range of speculation, agitations of thought and announcements of difference, which could but have represented, far beyond anything I should ever have to show, a gained and to a considerable degree an enjoyed, confessedly an interested, acquaintance with the paternal philosophic penetralia. That particular impression refers indeed to hours which at the point I have reached had not yet struck; but I am touched even now, after all the years, with something exquisite in my half-grasped premonitory vision of their belonging, these belated discussions that were but the flowering of the first germs of such other, doubtless already such opposed, perceptions and conclusions, to that order of thin consolations and broken rewards which long figured as the most and the best of what was to have been waited for on our companion's part without the escape of a plaint. Yet I feel I may claim that our awareness of all that was so serenely dispensed with--to call it missed would have been quite to falsify the story and reflect meanly on the spirit--never in the least brutally lapsed from admiration, however unuttered the sentiment itself, after the fashion of raw youth; it is in fact quite distinct to me that, had there been danger of this, there came to us from our mother's lips at intervals long enough to emphasise the final sincerity and beauty a fairly sacred reminder of that strain of almost solely self-nourished equanimity, or in other words insuperable gaiety, in her life's comrade, which she had never seen give way. This was the very gaiety that kept through the years coming out for us--to the point of inviting free jokes and other light familiarities from us at its expense. The happiest household pleasantry invested our legend of our mother's fond habit of address, [...] "Your father's ideas, you know--!" [...] which was always the signal for our embracing her with the last responsive finality (and, for the full pleasure of it, in his presence). Nothing indeed so much as his presence encouraged the licence, as I may truly call it, of the legend--that is of our treatment en famille of any reference to the attested public weight of his labours; which, I hasten to add, was much too esoteric a ground of geniality, a dear old family joke, not to be kept, for its value, to ourselves. But there comes back to me the impression of his appearing on occasion quite moved to the exuberance of cheer--as a form of refreshment he could draw on for a stronger and brighter spurt, I mean--by such an apology for resonance of reputation as our harmless, our of course utterly <b>edgeless,</b> profanity represented. It might have been for him, by a happy stretch, a sign that the world did know--taking us for the moment, in our selfish young babble, {{as a part of the}} noise of the world. Nothing, {{at the same time}}, could alter the truth of his case, or can at least alter it to me now: he had, intellectually, convictionally, passionally speaking, a selfless detachment, a lack of what is called the eye for effect--always I mean of the elated and interested order--which I can but marvel at in the light of the rare aptitude of his means to his end, and in that of the beauty of both, though the stamp was doubtless most vivid, for so differing, so gropingly [...] "esthetic" [...] a mind as my own, in his unfailingly personal and admirable style. We knew he had thoroughly his own [...] "unconventional" [...] form, which, by the unspeakable law of youth, we managed to feel the distinction of as not platitudinous even while we a bit sneakingly felt it as quotable, on possible occasions, against our presence of mind; the great thing was at all events that we couldn't live with him without the sense that if his books resembled his talk and his character--as we moreover felt they couldn't help almost violently doing--they might want for this, that or the other which kept the conventional true to its type, but could as little fail to flush with the strong colour, colour so remarkably given and not taken, projected and not reflected, colour of thought and faith and moral and expressional atmosphere, as they could leave us without that felt side-wind of their strong composition which made after all so much of the air we breathed and was in the last resort the gage of something perpetually fine going on.|$|E
