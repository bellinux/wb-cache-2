40|$|The mitral-aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa of {{the heart}} is of great {{clinical}} and surgical importance, because of its involvement in the anatomical and functional integrity of these two valves. In this work, we examined the morphology of the mitral-aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa {{and its relationship to}} the mitral and aortic valves. Thirty formaldehyde-fixed adult human hearts of both sexes were dissected and the structural organization, dimensions and area of the mitral-aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa were determined. The mitral-aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa was a thin, translucent membranous area located between the root of the aortic artery and the left atrioventricular orifice. In most cases (63 %), the mitral-aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa was approximately triangular in shape, with an area of 93. 9 p 47. 4 mm. The lower edge was associated with the anterior cusp of the mitral valve and was 18. 0 p 2. 2 mm long, whereas the anterior edge was continuos with the left fibrous trigone and was 10. 6 p 3. 0 mm long. The posterior edge was associated with the aortic wall and was continuos with the right fibrous trigone. This edge was 11. 7 p 3. 4 mm long.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Annular subvalvular {{pseudoaneurysm}} {{is a rare}} {{example of}} left ventricle aneurysm described predominantly in young African people. These aneurysms are divided into two different types, namely, submitral or subaortic, with subaortic being the less frequent kind. The subaortic type is most often localized in the mitral–aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report of a mitral–aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa pseudoaneurysm associated with coarctation of the aorta, anomalous pulmonary venous return, bicuspid aortic valve and patent ductus arteriosus diagnosed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Case presentation We report the case of a 15 -year-old African-American boy with a history of mild chest trauma who underwent echocardiographic evaluation as part of an out-patient work up. The echocardiogram was suspicious for the presence of mitral-aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa pseudoaneurysm and cardiovascular magnetic resonance was then performed to better characterize this finding. In addition to confirming the presence of the aneurysm, cardiovascular magnetic resonance also revealed coarctation of the aorta, a bicuspid aortic valve, and anomalous pulmonary venous return. Conclusion In our case, cardiovascular magnetic resonance was helpful in: (a) making a definite diagnosis of mitral–aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa pseudoaneurysm and its borders, which was not clear with an echocardiogram examination; and (b) illustrating additional associated congenital anomalies including the anomalous pulmonary venous return. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to provide a {{detailed}} description of echocardiographic and Doppler features of pseudoaneurysms involving the mitral-aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa and to compare echocardiographic and aortographic findings. Background. Infection of the aortic valve may spread to the aortic annulus, resulting in ring abscesses or pseudoaneurysms, or both, of the <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa, which can alter patient management and prognosis. Methods. The echocardiographic and Doppler findings of 20 patients with pseudoaneurysms or ring abscesses, or both, were reviewed and compared with surgical and aortographic results. Results. A total of 23 lesions were identified, of which 16 were <b>intervalvular</b> pseudoaneurysms, and 7 were ring abscesses. Transthoracic echocardiography detected 43 % of the lesions, whereas transesophageal echocardiography identified 90 % (p < 0. 01). The most distinct feature of the pseudoaneurysms was marked pulsatility, with systolic expansion and diastolic collapse (mean systolic area [±SD] 4. 1 ± 3. 4 cm 2 vs. diastolic mean area 1. 8 ± 2. 2 cm 2, p < 0. 05). Using color Doppler, two types were identified: unruptured pseudoaneurysms (n = 9), which communicated only with the left ventricular outflow tract and had a distinct flow pattern, and ruptured pseudoaneurysms (n = 7), which, in addition, communicated with the left atrium or aorta. Compared with pseudoaneurysms, ring abscesses were smaller and nonpulsatile and showed either no flow or continuous systolic and diastolic flow, the site of paravalvular aortic insufficiency. In 10 patients who underwent aortography, three lesions were identified, and findings were concordant with echocardiography. However, in seven patients aortographic findings were normal, whereas echocardiography identified <b>intervalvular</b> pseudoaneurysms, all of which were documented at operation. Conclusions. <b>Intervalvular</b> pseudoaneurysms are more frequently detected by transesophageal echocardiography than by aortography or transthoracic examination and exhibit distinct dynamic features and Doppler patterns that can further help characterize cavitary lesions in the aortic root and guide appropriate surgical intervention...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} late outcomes of reconstruction of the <b>intervalvular</b> fibrous body during aortic and mitral valve replacement. MethodsSeventy-six consecutive patients underwent reconstruction of the <b>intervalvular</b> fibrous body with replacement of the mitral and aortic valves. There were 35 men and 41 women whose mean age was 58 ± 12 years. Additional procedures were circumferential reconstruction of the mitral annulus in 27 patients, tricuspid valve repair in 21, coronary artery bypass in 15, and aortic root replacement in 4. Indications for the operation were active infective endocarditis with abscess in 15 patients, extensive calcification of the mitral annulus and interventricular fibrous body in 24, lack of fibrous tissue to secure a prosthetic valve in 17, and treatment or prevention of patient-prosthesis mismatch in 20. Fifty-five patients had undergone one or more previous valve operations, and 52 (68 %) were in functional class IV. The mean follow-up was 47 ± 47 months, and it was complete. ResultsThere were 8 (10 %) operative and 18 (24 %) late deaths. The 10 -year survival was 50 % ± 9 %. There were 15 reoperations in 12 patients: 7 for prosthetic valve endocarditis (5 early, 2 late), 7 for patch or valve dehiscence (3 early, 4 late), and 1 for structural valve deterioration. All but 2 reoperations were re-reconstruction of the <b>intervalvular</b> fibrous body and double valve replacement. The 10 -year freedom from reoperation was 73 % ± 7 %.

40|$|Infection of the mitral-aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa occurs most {{commonly}} {{in association with}} infective endocarditis of the aortic valve. Infection of the aortic valve results in a regurgitant jet that presumably strikes this subaortic inter-annular zone of fibrous tissue and produces a secondary site of infection. Infection of this interannular zone then leads {{to the formation of}} subaortic abscess or pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricular outflow tract. This infected zone of mitral-aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa or subaortic aneurysm can subsequently rupture into the left atrium with systolic ejection of blood from the left ventricular outflow tract to the left atrium. This report describes the echocardiographic findings in three patients with pathologically proved left ventricular outflow tract to left atrial communication. Precise preoperative diagnosis is important, and this lesion should be differentiated from ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva and perforation of the anterior mitral leaflet. Transthoracic echocardiography using color flow imaging and conventional Doppler techniques may show an eccentric mitral regurgitation type of signal in the left atrium originating from the region of the left ventricular outflow tract.

40|$|The Iinvolvement of subaortic {{structures}} in the aortic valve endocarditis appears more commonly than pre-viously recognized. These subaortic complications are most commonly located in the mitral-aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa and may be presented as abscess, or as pseudoaneurysm with or without perforation. Perforated pseudoaneurysm {{can lead to the}} development of communication between the left ventricular outflow tract and various cardiac chambers, most commonly the left atrium. These complications are related with poor pro-gnosis. Early and precise recognition of these complications is important for optimal treatment.

We sought, retrospectively, to identify morphologic predictors {{for the development}} of late obstruction. Pts diagnosed with COA before age 3 months (from 1988 — 1992) were included (N= 101). Pts with aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, subaortic stenosis or complex heart disease on initial presentation were excluded. A VSD was present in 53 %, an LSVC in 18 % and a bicuspid aortic valve in 59 % (53 %—intercoronary cusp fusion and 6 %—right/non-coronary cusp fusion). At the initial study, left ventricular volume tended to be larger than normal while other left sided structures were smaller. The probability of freedom from new left sided lesions was 81 % at 1 yr, 74 % at 3 yrs and 70 % at 5 yrs. Mitral stenosis developed in 11 pts. Multivariate analysis revealed that these pts had smaller mitral valve annulus diameter (MV) (p= 0. 027), higher mean transmitral gradients (p= 0. 043) and longer <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa (p= 0. 017). Ten pts developed aortic stenosis.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The <b>intervalvular</b> fibrous body {{between the}} aortic and mitral valves can be damaged by infective endocarditis, {{degenerative}} calcification, or multiple previous heart valve operations, making double valve replacement difficult. We have managed {{this problem by}} approaching the aortic and mitral valves through the aortic root and {{the dome of the}} left atrium. After excising the aortic valve, the diseased fibrous body, and the mitral valve, we suture a properly tailored patch of Dacron fabric or bovine pericardium to the lateral and medial fibrous trigones and to the aortic root, reestablishing the aortic and mitral anuli. A prosthetic mitral valve is implanted and a separate patch is used to close the left atriotomy before implantation of a prosthetic aortic valve. This study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of this operation. Methods: Forty-three patients underwent reconstruction of the <b>intervalvular</b> fibrous body during aortic and mitral valve replacement because of infective endocarditis with abscess in 14 patients, extensive calcification in 9, lack of fibrous tissue because of multiple previous operations in 10, and to enlarge the aortic and mitral anuli in 10. The group comprised 18 men and 25 women {{with a mean age of}} 58 ± 12 years. Thirty-two patients had had one or more previous heart valve replacements. All patients were in New York Heart Association functional classes III and IV, and 9 patients were in shock before the operation. Results: Seven operative deaths occurred (16 %). Early prosthetic valve endocarditis developed in two patients and necessitated reoperation. Follow-up extended from 4 to 108 months, with a mean of 38 months. No patient was lost to follow-up. Six late deaths occurred. The actuarial survival at 6 years was 56 % ± 6 %. A Doppler echocardiographic study revealed normal prosthetic valve function and anatomically intact anuli in all 30 long-term survivors.

In all IE cases, the rate of healthcare-associated IE has been reported as 23 %. Aortic valve endocarditis may extend to mitral-aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa (MAIVF), which may cause pseudoaneurysm formation and subsequent perforation. Direct perforation of the MAIVF is a rare clinical finding. In this report, we present a case of bicuspid aortic valve endocarditis which manifested as acute heart failure secondary to perforation of MAIVF and developed after diagnostic coronary angiography. <Learning objective: Direct perforation of MAIVF without abscess or aneurysm formation is a rare complication of IE. Health-care associated IE (HAIE) occurs mostly secondary to vascular manipulations and coronary angiography (CAG) is a rare cause of HAIE. Here, we report a case of aortic valve IE which developed two weeks after CAG and was complicated with perforation of MAIVF. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the causative microorganism. Urgent surgical treatment resulted in complete recovery of the patient. ...|$|E
40|$|Thrombosis at {{the left}} {{ventricular}} outflow tract occurs without any detectable heart disease or predisposing factors only extremely rarely. A 48 -year-old male visited Konkuk University Medical Center with loss of consciousness one month prior to presentation. Before he visited our hospital, he {{had been diagnosed with}} a cardiac tumor, which was located between the left atrium and posterior aortic root, and which was adjacent to both the aortic and mitral valves. Cardiac transplantation was recommended at the other hospital because of the high risk of cardiac dysfunction induced by both aortic and mitral valvular dysfunction after surgical resection. Based on preoperative transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, we considered it to be a benign tumor. Complete resection was achieved and the pathology confirmed organizing thrombus. We report a case of organizing thrombus mimicking a cardiac tumor, which was located at the mitral-aortic <b>intervalvular</b> fibrosa of the left ventricular outflow tract without any heart disease...|$|E
