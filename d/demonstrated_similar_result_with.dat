The converter was suppose to work under Zero Voltage Switching conditions, and this information was used to simplify the model derivation. Experimental frequency responses <b>demonstrate</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> <b>with</b> the presented model, what validates the method for a higher order resonant converter.

No difference was found in the sensitivity of the two systems in the control sample; however, the global method demonstrated more sensitivity in measuring behaviour in the playtime context. This finding may indicate that global ratings are more sensitive in a population with high base rates of positivity or in a playtime context.

40|$|Portable insulin {{infusion}} {{devices are}} effective and safe insulin delivery systems for managing diabetes mellitus, especially type 1 diabetes. Rapidly absorbed insulin analogues, such as insulin lispro or insulin aspart, may offer {{an advantage over}} regular human insulin for insulin pumps. Several open-label randomised crossover trials demonstrated that continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with insulin lispro provided a better control of postprandial hyperglycaemia and a slightly but significantly lower glycated haemoglobin level, with lower daily insulin requirement and similar or even less hypoglycaemic episodes. A CSII study comparing insulin lispro and insulin aspart <b>demonstrated</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> <b>with</b> the two analogues, and better <b>results</b> than those <b>with</b> regular insulin. Because these analogues have a quicker onset and a shorter duration of action than regular insulin, one might expect an earlier and greater metabolic deterioration in case of CSII interruption, but a more rapid correction of metabolic abnormalities after insulin boluses when reactivating the pump. These expectations were confirmed in randomised protocols comparing the metabolic changes occurring during and after CSII interruption of various durations when the pump infused either insulin lispro or regular insulin. The extra cost resulting {{from the use of}} CSII and insulin analogues in diabetes management should be compensated for by better metabolic control and quality of life. In conclusion, CSII delivering fast-acting insulin analogues may be considered {{as one of the best}} methods to replace insulin in a physiological manner by mimicking meal and basal insulin requirements, without higher risk of hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis in well-educated diabetic patients.

METHODS: Design: Prospective experimental study with in vivo pressure measurements. Setting: Institute for Clinical and Experimental Surgery, University of Saarland. Animals: Seven domestic male pigs (body weight 34. 8 +/- 2. 5 kg). Interventions: Stepwise increase and decrease of IAP by means of CO(2) pneumoperitoneum. Continuous direct measurement of the IAP and correspondent indirect IAP measurement techniques including analysis of intravesical pressure (IVP), femoral vein pressure (FVP), and CPRS. RESULTS: Bland-Altman analysis comparing direct IAP measurement with correspondent CPRS showed good agreement for IAP between 12 mm Hg and 30 mm Hg (bias - 0. 5 mm Hg, lower and upper limits of agreement (LLA/ULA) - 3. 5 / 2. 5 mm Hg). FVP (bias - 0. 3 mm Hg, LLA/ULA - 2. 3 / 1. 6 mm Hg) and IVP (bias 0. 4 mm Hg, LLA/ULA - 2. 1 / 2. 9 mm Hg) <b>demonstrated</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> compared <b>with</b> direct IAP measurement.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To use {{published}} data {{to evaluate}} quantitatively the dental effects of noncompliance intramaxillary appliances in individuals with Class II malocclusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search {{was carried out}} identifing 13 prospective or retrospective clinical studies matching inclusion criteria. Only appliances with conventional anchorage designs were considered for the review. The data provided in these publications were grouped and analyzed in terms of molar distalization, tipping and vertical movements, and incisor and premolar mesialization, tipping, and vertical movements. RESULTS: Maxillary first molars showed distal crown movement and tipping greater than the mesial crown movement and tipping shown by incisors and premolars. Vertical movements of incisors and premolars were in general extrusive, but molars were intrusive or extrusive, depending on the study {{and the type of}} appliance used. Appliances that acted palatally seemed to display a smaller distal tipping movement, as well as smaller incisor and premolar mesial tipping movements, when compared with those that acted buccally. Friction-free appliances, namely the pendulum, produced a large amount of mesiodistal movement and tipping, if no therapeutic uprighting activation was applied. CONCLUSIONS: Noncompliance intramaxillary molar distalization appliances all act by distalizing molars with a concomitant and unavoidable loss of anchorage, as revealed by incisor and premolar mesial movement. Buccal acting and palatal acting appliances <b>demonstrate</b> almost <b>similar</b> <b>results,</b> <b>with</b> palatal acting appliances showing less tipping.

40|$|Introduction: Dynamic {{contrast}} enhanced {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (DCE-MRI) may act as a biomarker for successful cancer therapy. This thesis demonstrates an imaging technique developed to be simple and reproducible. PTK 787 /ZK 222584 (PTK/ZK) is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor mediated angiogenesis. The pharmacodynamic effects of PTK/ZK were evaluated by assessing changes in contrast enhancement parameters of metastatic disease using DCE-MRI in advanced cancer patients treated in two dose escalating phase I studies using once and twice-daily dosing schedules. Patients and Methods: A theoretical analysis was performed to optimise sequence parameters. MRI phantom and clinical studies were performed to establish the validity and reproducibility of the technique. The clinical studies of PTK/ZK were performed with centralised DCE-MRI analysis. DCE-MRI was performed at baseline, day 2, {{and at the end}} of the 28 -day cycle (EC 1). Doses of oral PTK/ZK ranged from 50 to 2000 mg per day. Tumour permeability and vascularity were assessed by calculating the bi-directional transfer constant (Ktrans). Results: This technique can accurately measure R 1 within the expected range of tumour enhancement. The reproducibility study showed a coefficient of variation (CoV) of 16 % for Ktrans if tumours of diameter less than 3 cm were excluded. A significant correlation was shown between changes in Ktrans and PTK/ZK oral dose, plasma levels and efficacy at both day 2 and ECI. Visual assessment of the DCE-MRI scans <b>demonstrated</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> but <b>with</b> weaker correlations to dose and efficacy. Conclusion: The clinical findings suggest that DCE-MRI is sufficiently sensitive and reproducible to act as a useful biomarker for defining the pharmacological response and dose of angiogenesis inhibitors, such as PTK/ZK...|$|R
40|$|Ignoring {{an object}} slows {{subsequent}} naming responses to it, a {{phenomenon known as}} negative priming (NP). A central issue in NP research concerns the level of representation at which the effect occurs. As object naming is typically considered to involve access to abstract semantic representations, Tipper 1985 proposed that the NP effect occurred at this level of processing, and other researchers supported this proposal by <b>demonstrating</b> a <b>similar</b> <b>result</b> <b>with</b> categorically related objects (e. g., Allport et al., 1985; Murray, 1995), an effect referred to as semantic NP. However, objects within categories share more physical or structural features than objects from different categories. Consequently, the NP effect observed with categorically related objects might occur at a structural rather than semantic level of representation. We used event related fMRI interleaving overt object naming and image acquisition to demonstrate {{for the first time}} that the semantic NP effect activates the left posterior-mid fusiform and insular–opercular cortices. Moreover, both naming latencies and left posterior-mid fusiform cortex responses were influenced by the structural similarity of prime–probe object pairings in the categorically related condition, increasing with the number of shared features. None of the cerebral regions activated in a previous fMRI study of the identity NP effect (de Zubicaray et al., 2006) showed similar activation during semantic NP, including the left anterolateral temporal cortex, a region considered critical for semantic processing. The results suggest that the identity and semantic NP effects differ with respect to their neural mechanisms, and the label “semantic NP” might be a misnomer. We conclude that the effect is most likely the result of competition between structurally similar category exemplars that determines the efficiency of object name retrieval.

40|$|Background When {{trials are}} subject to departures from {{randomised}} treatment, simple statistical methods that aim to estimate treatment efficacy, such as per protocol or as treated analyses, typically introduce selection bias. More appropriate methods to adjust for departure from randomised treatment are rarely employed, primarily due to their complexity and unfamiliarity. We demonstrate the use of causal methodologies {{for the production of}} estimands with valid causal interpretation for time-to-event outcomes in the analysis of a complex epilepsy trial, as an example to guide non-specialist analysts undertaking similar analyses. Methods Two causal methods, the structural failure time model and inverse probability of censoring weighting, are adapted to allow for skewed time-varying confounders, competing reasons for treatment changes and a complicated time to remission outcome. We demonstrate the impact of various factors: choice of method (structural failure time model versus inverse probability of censoring weighting), model for inverse probability of censoring weighting (pooled logistic regression versus Cox models), time interval (for creating panel data for time-varying confounders and outcome), choice of confounders and (in pooled logistic regression) use of splines to estimate underlying risk. Results The structural failure time model could adjust for switches between trial treatments but had limited ability to adjust for the other treatment changes that occurred in this epilepsy trial. Inverse probability of censoring weighting was able to adjust for all treatment changes and <b>demonstrated</b> very <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> <b>with</b> Cox and pooled logistic regression models. Accounting for increasing numbers of time-varying confounders and reasons for treatment change suggested a more pronounced advantage of the control treatment than that obtained using intention to treat. Conclusions In a complex trial featuring a remission outcome, underlying assumptions of the structural failure time model are likely to be violated, and inverse probability of censoring weighting may provide the most useful option, assuming availability of appropriate data and sufficient sample sizes. Recommendations are provided for analysts when considering which of these methods should be applied in a given trial setting...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of C-type natriuretic peptide receptors {{in human}} mesangial cells. Our {{aim was to}} examine whether the human {{glomerulus}} was a target for C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and how A, B and C receptors of natriuretic peptides (ANPR-A, ANPR-B, ANPR-C) were distributed in glomerular mesangial and epithelial cells. CNP stimulated cyclic GMP production in cultured human mesangial and epithelial cells with similar threshold concentrations (1 nM) and maximum effects (basal value × 30 at 1 µM). In contrast, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was only stimulatory in epithelial cells. [125 I] CNP bound specifically to mesangial cells with a Kd of 0. 47 nM and Bmax of 42 fmol/mg. Equilibrium of binding was obtained after four to five hours at + 4 °C and nonspecific binding represented 10 to 20 % of total binding. HS 142 - 1 (100 µg/ml), a specific inhibitor of ANPR-A and ANPR-B, suppressed 90 % of CNP-dependent cyclic GMP production whereas it {{had little effect on}} [125 I]-CNP binding, suggesting that C receptors were largely predominant in mesangial cells. No biological effect of CNP on mesangial cells, including change in basal or angiotensin II-induced contractility and inhibition of basal or serum-dependent proliferation, could be <b>demonstrated.</b> <b>Similar</b> <b>results</b> were obtained <b>with</b> 8 -bromo-cyclic GMP and sodium nitroprusside. Intraglomerular localization of ANPR-A, ANPR-B and ANPR-C mRNA was studied using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with amplification of their corresponding cDNA by different primers. Amplification products were identified on gel electrophoresis by their predicted sizes and sequencing. ANPR-A, ANPR-B and ANPR-C mRNA were present in epithelial cells whereas only ANPR-B and ANPR-C mRNA were detected in mesangial cells. The presence of ANPR-C in both cell types was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. This study indicates that human mesangial cells, in contrast with epithelial cells, are not a target for ANP whereas both cell types respond to CNP and possess clearance receptors...|$|R
