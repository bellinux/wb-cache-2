5|$|Iodine is {{the least}} {{abundant}} of the stable halogens, comprising only 0.46parts per million of Earth's crustal rocks (compare: fluorine 544ppm, chlorine 126ppm, bromine 2.5ppm). Among the eighty-four elements which occur in significant quantities (elements 1–42, 44–60, 62–83, and 90–92), it ranks sixty-first in abundance. Iodide minerals are rare, and most deposits that are concentrated enough for economical extraction are <b>iodate</b> minerals instead. Examples include lautarite, Ca(IO3)2, and dietzeite, 7Ca(IO3)2·8CaCrO4. These are the minerals that occur as trace impurities in the caliche, found in Chile, whose main product is sodium nitrate. In total, they can contain at least 0.02% and at most 1% iodine by weight. Sodium <b>iodate</b> is extracted from the caliche and reduced to iodide by sodium bisulfite. This solution is then reacted with freshly extracted <b>iodate,</b> resulting in comproportionation to iodine, which may be filtered off.|$|E
5|$|Iodous {{acid and}} iodite are even less stable and exist {{only as a}} {{fleeting}} intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to <b>iodate,</b> if at all. Iodates {{are by far the}} most important of these compounds, which can be made by oxidising alkali metal iodides with oxygen at 600°C and high pressure, or by oxidising iodine with chlorates. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or fuming nitric acid. <b>Iodate</b> has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.|$|E

40|$|The author studied chemo-immunological {{specificity}} of <b>iodated</b> protein and phenylureido protein {{as well as}} sensibilization of iodine and phenylisocyanate and obtained the following results. 1) <b>Iodated</b> egg-albumin antibody reacts with <b>iodated</b> human serum albumin antigen and this reaction is inhibited by diiodotyrosine. Phenylureido egg albumin antibody reacts with phenylureido human serum albumin antigen and this reaction is inhibited by phenylureidolysine. 2) According to quantitative preicipitin reaction, in the inhibitory reaction of the monovalent antigen (semihapten) mentioned above, the quantity of precipitin nitrogen decreases {{in proportion to the}} increase in mono-valent antigen. 3) <b>Iodated</b> egg-albumin antibody reacts with <b>iodated</b> human-serum albumin antigen by the agar method of Oudin, and phenylureido egg-albumin antibody reacts with phenylureido human-serum albumin antigen. The number of the immunological reaction ring due to chemoimmunological specificity proves to be single. 4) The guinea pigs sensitized by <b>iodated</b> human-serum albumin demonstrate anaphylaxis by intravenous injection of <b>iodated</b> egg-albumin, and guinea pigs sensitized by phenylureido egg-albumin develop Arthus reaction by intracutaneous injection of phenylureido human-serum albumin. 5) When guinea pigs are sensitized subcutaneously with phenylisocyanate, they develop Arthus reaction by phenylisocyanate. Therefore, this is a substance that possesses sensibilization. On the other hand, in the case where Arthus reaction is made to take place by phenylureido human-serum albumin in the guinea pig previously sensitized by phenylureido egg-albumin, when the mixture of phenylureido human-serum albumin and phenylureido-lysine is injected, the reaction is weakened. Namely, there can be observed an inhibitory reaction by monovalent antigen. 6) From these results, it is assumed that allergic skin inflammation and anaphylaxis in the animals sensitized by iodine and phenylisocyanate is due to the antigen-antibody reaction of the determinant groups as diiodotyrosine and phenylureido-lysine respectively...|$|R
5|$|Francium coprecipitates {{with several}} caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, {{which results in}} small amounts of {{francium}} perchlorate. This coprecipitation {{can be used to}} isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the <b>iodate,</b> the picrate, the tartrate (also rubidium tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which provides other methods of separation. Nearly all francium salts are water-soluble.|$|E

5|$|Protactinium {{exhibits}} two valence states; the +5 is stable, and the +4 state easily oxidizes to protactinium(V). Thus tetravalent protactinium in solutions {{is obtained}} {{by the action of}} strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere. Tetravalent protactinium is chemically similar to uranium(IV) and thorium(IV). Fluorides, phosphates, hypophosphate, <b>iodate</b> and phenylarsonates of protactinium(IV) are insoluble in water and dilute acids. Protactinium forms soluble carbonates. The hydrolytic properties of pentavalent protactinium are close to those of tantalum(V) and niobium(V). The complex chemical behavior of protactinium is a consequence of the start of the filling of the 5f shell in this element.|$|E

5|$|Some {{table salt}} sold for {{consumption}} contain additives which address {{a variety of}} health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country. Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt {{has been used to}} correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide or sodium <b>iodate.</b> A small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.|$|E
5|$|Americium readily {{reacts with}} oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common {{oxidation}} state for americium is +3, in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, <b>iodate,</b> hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation {{states have been}} observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am4+ (yellow-reddish), AmV; (yellow), AmVI (brown) and AmVII (dark green). All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of a {{radioiodine}} release the ingestion of prophylaxis potassium iodide, if available, or even <b>iodate,</b> would rightly take precedence over perchlorate administration, and would be the first line of defence in protecting the population from a radioiodine release. However, in {{the event of}} a radioiodine release too massive and widespread to be controlled by the limited stock of iodide and <b>iodate</b> prophylaxis drugs, then the addition of perchlorate ions to the water supply, or distribution of perchlorate tablets would serve as a cheap, efficacious, second line of defense against carcinogenic radioiodine bioaccumulation.|$|E
40|$|Mbeya {{district}} council {{is among the}} districts in Tanzania where Iodine Deficiency Disorders is still a problem of public health significance. A {{study was conducted in}} Mbeya {{district council}} to determine the current iodine deficiency status by assessing the prevalence of goitre among school children and factors associated with the problem. A total of 553 school children aged 6 to 18 years were examined for goitre, using WHO classification and salt brought from their homes was tested for iodine content using MBI iodine test kit. A total of 311 households were randomly selected from the school villages for interviews on utilization and awareness on <b>iodated</b> salt and its relationship with level of education, urban and rural setting and type of salt used in their homes. The type and frequency of consumption of foods containing goitrogenic substances was also studied. The prevalence of total goitre was 25. 7 percent being higher in females than males and in adolescent children aged 13 to 18 years than those of 6 to 12 years. There {{was no significant difference in}} goitre among children in highlands or lowlands or those from urban and rural schools. About 97 percent of the households were using <b>iodated</b> salt although only 45 percent of salt samples tested were adequately <b>iodated.</b> Awareness on <b>iodated</b> salt and iodine deficiency disorders was higher among interviewees who were educated than those with no formal education. The other factors associated with <b>iodated</b> salt included type of salt preferred, urban and rural settings, and the price of salt. The most commonly consumed foods which contain goitrogens were sweet potatoes, cabbage, sorghum and peaches. The findings in this study indicate although a large proportion of salts at household level are <b>iodated,</b> people are still not aware of <b>iodated</b> salt (29. 6 %) and the problem ofIDD (26. 7 %), hence do not store salt properly resulting to loss of iodine.

25|$|Radium forms {{much the}} same {{insoluble}} salts as its lighter congener barium: it forms the insoluble sulfate (RaSO4, the most insoluble known sulfate), chromate (RaCrO4), carbonate (RaCO3), <b>iodate</b> (Ra(IO3)2), tetrafluoroberyllate (RaBeF4), and nitrate (Ra(NO3)2). With {{the exception of the}} carbonate, all of these are less soluble in water than the corresponding barium salts, but they are all isostructural to their barium counterparts. Additionally, radium phosphate, oxalate, and sulfite are probably also insoluble, as they coprecipitate with the corresponding insoluble barium salts. The great insolubility of radium sulfate (at 20°C, only 2.1mg will dissolve in 1kg of water) means that {{it is one of the}} less biologically dangerous radium compounds. The large ionic radius of Ra2+ (148pm) results in weak complexation and poor extraction of radium from aqueous solutions when not at high pH.|$|E
25|$|To {{completely}} {{block the}} uptake of iodine-131 by the purposeful addition of perchlorate ions to a population's water supply, aiming at dosages of 0.5mg/kg-day, or a water concentration of 17 ppm, would therefore be grossly inadequate at truly reducing radioiodine uptake. Perchlorate ion concentrations in a region's water supply would therefore {{need to be}} much higher, {{with at least a}} total dosage of 7.15mg/kg of body weight per day needing to be aimed for, with this being achievable for most adults by consuming 2 liters of water per day with a water concentration of 250mg/kg of water, or 250 ppm of perchlorate ions per liter; only at this level would perchlorate consumption offer adequate protection, and be truly beneficial to the population at preventing bioaccumulation when exposed to a radioiodine environment.

25|$|A common {{treatment}} method for preventing iodine-131 exposure is by saturating the thyroid with regular, non-radioactive iodine-127, as an iodide or <b>iodate</b> salt. Free elemental iodine {{should not be}} used for saturating the thyroid because it is a corrosive oxidant and therefore is toxic to ingest in the necessary quantities. The thyroid will absorb very little of the radioactive iodine-131 after it is saturated with non-radioactive iodide, thereby avoiding the damage caused by radiation from radioiodine. The most common method of treatment is to give potassium iodide to those at risk. The dosage for adults is 130mg potassium iodide per day, given in one dose, or divided into portions of 65mg twice a day. This is equivalent to 100mg of iodine, and is about 700 times bigger than the nutritional dose of iodine, which is 0.150mg per day (150 micrograms per day). See potassium iodide for more information on prevention of radioiodine absorption by the thyroid during nuclear accident, or for nuclear medical reasons. The FDA-approved dosing of potassium iodide for this purpose are as follows: infants less than 1 month old, 16mg; children 1 month to 3 years, 32mg; children 3 years to 18 years, 65mg; adults 130mg. However, some sources recommend alternative dosing regimens.|$|E
