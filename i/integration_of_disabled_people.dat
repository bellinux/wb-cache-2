She {{has worked to}} minister to the disabled of Hungary by [...] "training, employing, and housing disabled adults." [...] Beginning in the early 1980s, Szekeres began to strive toward greater opportunities {{for people with disabilities}}. Her own son, Tibor, had microcephalus and [...] "severe mental retardation." [...] Once Szekeres realized Tibor's chances of survival to adulthood were good, she determined to work toward providing her son and others with disabilities a fulfilling and productive adulthood. Such opportunities for people with disabilities were very rare; according to the Ashoka Innovators for the Public website, [...] "In Hungary, the lack of <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>people</b> into society is extreme. Disabled people...{can not} gain access to public buildings or public transportation....the state solution is institutionalization for life." [...] This state of affairs did not satisfy Szekeres. She began to connect with other parents of disabled children and established an [...] "informal cooperative business running out of her basement." [...] However, such business endeavors were not recognized legally until 1986, when Szekeres founded Összefogás Ipari SzÖvetkezet, or in English, the Alliance Industrial Union. Although progress was slow for a few years, in 1989 the Ministry of Welfare in Hungary awarded substantial funds to the Alliance. This helped to speed up the development of housing as well as facilities and supplies that would enable those with disabilities to earn money. Szekeres has worked to create an environment in which those with disabilities, including her son Tibor, could work and live as unimpeded by their handicaps as possible. According to Szekeres, [...] "...In institutions, you can't leave, you can't be in couples. Here {{you have a lot of}} freedom. Here you are challenged to become part of a community." [...] Szekeris was admitted as an Ashoka fellow in 1997 for her entrepreneurial approach to those with disabilities.|$|E
40|$|The {{official}} {{figures of}} the unemployment statistics reveal the problematic situation on the labour market {{in black and white}} every time they are updated. Another development to be taken equally seriously stands out for a particular group in this army of unemployed people: unemployed severely <b>disabled</b> <b>people.</b> These people, too, are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain an adequate position. Besides their disability the loss of a job comes as an additional difficulty for them and is frequently the first step on the path to social isolation. Since the 1980 s there has been a decline in the proportion <b>of</b> severely <b>disabled</b> <b>people</b> in the labour force as a whole in the Federal Republic of Germany - {{in spite of all the}} efforts made by labour administration and the main welfare institutions towards the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> this group into the primary labour market. Against the background of this a project was introduced in Rheinland-Pfalz in 1994 which focuses on the (re) <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> severely <b>disabled</b> <b>people</b> into working life. In order to achieve this, those participating in the project pursue two different paths. Firstly in the companies, representatives <b>of</b> the <b>disabled</b> and works councils and secondly those responsible for personnel matters and/or personnel managers are contacted and are each offered special support services for the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> severely <b>disabled</b> <b>people.</b> The effectiveness <b>of</b> these measures is additionally assessed by means of a scientific research parallel to this. What was of interest in the parallel research was first of all which area the integration efforts would affect. For this purpose a total of 4800 companies in four regions were asked to give an assessment <b>of</b> the <b>integration.</b> It is obvious that on the one hand the companies do not see anything in the existing qualifications which would constitute a serious obstacle to considering the recruitment <b>of</b> a <b>disabled</b> person. On the other hand it is clear that there is a considerable lack of information as to what support services and support opportunities are available for a company when opting to employ a disabled person.

40|$|Particularly {{the past}} two decades have {{witnessed}} the integration of people with disabilities into mainstream society. This {{is one of the top}} political issues in many countries. For a long time disabled people have been excluded from mainstream education, employment and various community activities on the grounds of individual disabilities. As a result many of them have been left unproductive and dependent. That society to some extent has a negative attitude towards disabled people cannot be disputed. Until recently all attention to disabled people had focussed on their physical wellbeing rather than on how to integrate them effectively into mainstream society. This negative attitude coupled with less integration has in many respects prevented disabled people from developing their potential and using their ability to live an independent life. In this respect library services for disabled people are regarded as part of the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>people</b> into mainstream society. Especially public libraries can be seen as the most important institutes for the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>people</b> into society. The purpose of this research is to identify current problems faced by mainstream libraries for the provision of library services for disabled people and also to present practical solutions that are appropriate to the Korean situation. Although the study covers other disabilities such as hearing and mobility impairment, it is mainly concerned with visual impairment. Visually impaired people are the most disadvantaged in libraries because they are unable to read printed materials. For purpose of data collection, the study relied on literature review, observation and interview. The study is organised into three parts. The first part outlines the background information about the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>people,</b> the characteristics and difficulties of disabled people, and the development of library services for disabled people from earliest time to the present.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} soundbased representations {{which have}} been designed, implemented and evaluated {{as part of the}} development of a computer workstation for blind mathematics students. Particular emphasis has been on supporting synthetic speech with non-verbal cues, in the forms of the prosodic component of the speech, `algebra earcons' and spatialized sounds. 2 INTRODUCTION Mathematics is a fundamental discipline. It is the basis of science and technology and is also used widely in other fields, such as social sciences which rely on statistics. Hence, to be excluded from learning and performing mathematics can be a severe handicap. Doing mathematics is very difficult for people with visual disabilities. This is not because they cannot perform the cognitive activity, but because they {{do not have access to}} the visual notations that are used to communicate mathematical information. Such communication is essential. Whenever mathematicians gather together, they must use pencil and paper or blackboard and chalk to communicate. While speech is good for communicating many ideas, it is not generally appropriate for the communication of mathematics. At the same time, a lone mathematician working on a problem will also use written notations for self communication. A person's memory is too limited and so the written notation will be used as an external memory, to retain intermediate steps in a proof, for instance. A blind person lacks the external memory and means of communication because non-visual equivalents of written mathematics do not exist. The Maths Project has been sponsored by the European Commission via its Tide Initiative (Technology for the <b>Integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Disabled</b> and Elderly <b>people)</b> to address this problem. The objective is to build a computer-based workstation for [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{philosophy}} of supported {{employment in the}} Czech Republic has been developing for over than twenty years. Nevertheless this service is still neglected {{and only a few}} non-profit organizations put it into practice. The service is not legislatively based and also the society does not have a clear opinion on employment of people with disabilities. Current labour market situation is not advantageous at all. Therefore some support <b>of</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>people</b> looking for a job is becoming more necessary and required. The employers {{are an important part of}} the whole problems, because their attitude to the idea of supported employment plays a significant role. The bachelor's thesis "Supported Employment from the Perspective of Employers" has pretentions to look into supported employment from the employers' point of view. They are not active initiators of the service, but they are important participants for its successful realization. The theoretical part of the thesis tries to describe the basic problems. It covers the service of supported employment from historical development to its importance. It focuses on special characteristics of disabilities and their social impact on human beings. The closing part is dedicated to working opportunities for people with disabilities in the circumstances of current legislative and economic situation. The practical part is written in the form of a qualitative research. The method of questioning and semi-structured interviews were used for the purposes of the research. Eight people were chosen intentionally for the survey. The data gained from the interviews were analysed with the method of open coding. The main aim of the thesis was to map out empoyers' experience with the service of supported employment. Motivation of employers to put this service into practice was the next part of the research. The question was: "What reasons for realization of supported employment do predominate by employers?" The research showed the most frequent facts, which predestine the <b>integration</b> possibility <b>of</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>people</b> in open labour market fundamentally. After the interviews and answering the questions of the research, it was possible to describe the employers' experience with the supported employment service and also their main incentives for its realization. It was found out that employers' experience with the supported employment service is quite limited. Employers often get to know it through the agency for supported employment, which is not only the initiator of cooperation, but it also plays an important role when a disabled person is being employed. An important point of successful employment is often how the emploeyer is satisfied with the agency. The employment <b>of</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>people</b> often brings certain risks connected with the limits of disabilities. Employers, who enable <b>disabled</b> <b>people</b> to work, are aware of that. The impulse for employment can vary from financial advantages, company philantrophy to personal solidarity of the employer. Social responsibility of the company is becoming a trend, that many employers start to know. But it can be presumed to influence the employment of more people with disabilities and at the same time the looking up the supported employment service by the employers. This bachelor's thesis can be contributive to understanding the importance <b>of</b> employment for <b>disabled</b> <b>people's</b> living. It brings information about the employers' experience with the realization of supported employment and motivation to the realization. It can also help to uncover <b>integration</b> obstacles <b>of</b> people with disabilities in open labour market...|$|R
