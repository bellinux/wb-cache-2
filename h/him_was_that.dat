5|$|Despite Mihardja's {{insistence that}} Atheis {{is meant to}} be realistic, several {{symbolic}} interpretations have been put forward. According to Mihardja, {{one of the most common}} interpretations readers conveyed to <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Hasan's death symbolised atheism defeating religion, with Hasan's death as the death of theism. According to Maier, Atheis serves as an allegory for the development of the Indonesian nation. Hasan, representing traditionalism, is killed by the Japanese, who changed the status quo when they invaded in 1942. Meanwhile, the anarchistic Anwar finds himself without a place in the modern world. Only the responsible modern character, Rusli, is able to bring the Indonesian nation, as represented by Kartini, to terms with the new world.|$|E
5|$|Mary was courted by Duke Philip of Bavaria {{from late}} 1539, {{but he was}} Lutheran and his suit for her hand was unsuccessful. Over 1539, the king's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, {{negotiated}} a potential alliance with the Duchy of Cleves. Suggestions that Mary marry the Duke of Cleves, who was the same age, came to nothing, but a match between Henry and the Duke's sister Anne was agreed. When the king saw Anne {{for the first time}} in late December 1539, a week before the scheduled wedding, he did not find himself attracted to her but was unable, for diplomatic reasons and in the absence of a suitable pretext, to cancel the marriage. Cromwell fell from favour and was arrested for treason in June 1540; one of the unlikely charges against <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he had plotted to marry Mary himself. Anne consented to the annulment of the marriage, which had not been consummated, and Cromwell was beheaded.|$|E
5|$|The legend {{surrounding}} <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he {{was killed}} while attempting a rescue; however, this is untrue. Barry retired to Bern, Switzerland and after his death his body was passed into {{the care of the}} Natural History Museum of Bern. His skin has been preserved through taxidermy although his skull was modified in 1923 to match the Saint Bernard of that time period. His story and name have been used in literary works, and a monument to him stands in the Cimetière des Chiens near Paris. At the hospice one dog has always been named Barry in his honor and since 2004 the Foundation Barry du Grand Saint Bernard has been set up to take over the responsibility for breeding dogs from the hospice.|$|E

25|$|In 1897, a Christian missionary, Henry Martyn Clark, filed {{a lawsuit}} of {{attempted}} murder against Ahmad at the court of District Magistrate Captain Montagu William Douglas {{in the city of}} Ludhiana.

25|$|Besides the blues, Frith started {{listening}} to any music that had guitar in it, including folk, classical, ragtime, and flamenco. He also listened to Indian, Japanese, and Balinese music and was particularly drawn to East European music after a Yugoslav school friend taught him folk tunes from his home. Frith went to Cambridge University in 1967, where his musical horizons were expanded further by the philosophies of John Cage and Frank Zappa's manipulation of rock music. Frith graduated from Christ's College, Cambridge with a BA (English literature) in 1970 (and by Cambridge custom received a pro forma MA in 1974), {{but the real}} significance of Cambridge for <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> that was where the seminal avant-rock group Henry Cow were formed.|$|E
25|$|Fregoli took London by storm. He did quick-fire performances, impersonating Wagner, Rossini, Verdi and Paderewski {{one after}} another. He would exit stage left as a street {{musician}} and appear almost immediately stage right as a woman. Everybody - including the great actors and performers of the day, such as Dan Leno - {{wanted to see}} him, and his run was extended and extended, as was the seating in the theatre; not bad for someone who didn't even speak English. The general view of <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> apart from his obvious abilities as a quick change artist he was - unlike his rivals - a consummate actor and a brilliant writer. He gave private performances for royalty and aristocrats (such as the Rothschilds, for whom he calmly explained all of his tricks). He inspired a host of imitators, male and female. Every theatre in London soon had its protean artist; even Biondi was there, performing at the same time. There were spoofers and parodists: journalists claimed tipsy theatregoers were demanding their money back upon discovering that all the performers they had just witnessed were actually just one man.|$|E

500|$|Michael Crichton {{originally}} conceived {{a screenplay}} about {{a graduate student}} who recreates a dinosaur; he continued to wrestle with his fascination with dinosaurs and cloning until he began writing the novel Jurassic Park. Even before publication, Steven Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the television series ER. Spielberg considered that what really fascinated <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Jurassic Park was [...] "a really credible look at how dinosaurs might someday be brought back alongside modern mankind", going beyond a simple monster movie.|$|E
500|$|Jones met Alex Seropian in {{his second}} year at the University of Chicago, {{studying}} computer science. In 1991 Seropian had founded Bungie and published his own game, Operation Desert Storm. Seropian was looking for another game to publish, and they decided to work together to finish Minotaur. While Seropian did design and marketing, Jones finished the programming. [...] shipped in April 1992; while the game sold only around 2,500 copies (it required a then-rare modem for network play), it developed a devoted following. After publishing Minotaur, Jones and Seropian formed a partnership; [...] "What I liked about <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he never wasted any money", Jones said of his partner.|$|E
500|$|Following his {{freshman}} season, Okafor {{was regarded as}} the second best college basketball prospect in the Chicago area behind Jabari Parker. The scouting report on <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he possessed an improved midrange jump shot, nimble feet, soft hands and physical skills at [...] {{that made him a}} mismatch against almost any high school competitor. Prior to his sophomore season Dave Spahn of SLAM Magazine described Okafor as a player with the footwork and ambidexterity to dominate his opponents, placing him in the conversation for the role of best player in the national class of 2014. In August 2011, ESPN ranked him as the third best player in the class of 2014.|$|E

500|$|SF writer Alfred Bester, {{an editor}} of Holiday Magazine and a {{sophisticated}} Manhattanite, recounted at some length his [...] "one demented meeting" [...] with Campbell, a man he imagined from afar to be [...] "a combination of Bertrand Russell and Ernest Rutherford." [...] The first thing Campbell said to <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Freud was dead, destroyed by the new discovery of Dianetics, which, he predicted, would win L. Ron Hubbard the Nobel Peace Prize. Campbell ordered the bemused Bester to [...] "think back. Clear yourself. Remember! You can remember when your mother tried to abort you with a button hook. You've never stopped hating her for it." [...] Bester commented: [...] "It reinforced my private opinion {{that a majority of}} the science-fiction crowd, despite their brilliance, were missing their marbles." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} that the Beagle set out for the Galápagos Islands on 7 September 1835, Darwin had thought out the {{essentials}} of his theory of atoll formation. While he no longer favoured the concept that atolls formed on submerged volcanos, he noted some points on these islands which supported that idea: 16 volcanic craters resembled atolls in being raised slightly more on one side, and five hills appeared roughly equal in height. He then considered a topic which was compatible with either theory, the lack of coral reefs around the Galápagos Islands. One possibility was a lack of calcareous matter around the islands, but his main proposal, which FitzRoy had suggested to <b>him,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the seas were too cold. As they sailed on, Darwin took note of the records of sea temperature kept in the ship's [...] "Weather Journal".|$|E
500|$|Hay was {{faster than}} Reid {{to realize that}} the race for these posts would be {{affected}} by Hanna's desire to be senator from Ohio, as with one of the state's places about to be occupied by the newly elected Joseph B. Foraker, the only possible seat for <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> held by Senator Sherman. As the septuagenarian senator had served as Treasury Secretary under Hayes, only the secretaryship of state was likely to attract him and cause a vacancy that Hanna could fill. [...] Hay knew that with only eight cabinet positions, only one could go to an Ohioan, and so he had no chance for a cabinet post. [...] Accordingly, Hay encouraged Reid to seek the State position, while firmly ruling himself out as a possible candidate for that post, and quietly seeking the inside track to be ambassador in London. Zeitz states that Hay [...] "aggressively lobbied" [...] for the position.|$|E

500|$|On 5 March 2010, Gordon Brown {{appeared}} before the inquiry. In a four-hour hearing he told the inquiry that he believed the war had been [...] "right" [...] and that intelligence briefings had convinced him that Iraq was a threat that [...] "had to be dealt with". He said that his predecessor Tony Blair had kept him informed despite Blair not being aware of some developments and that the main issue which concerned <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Iraq was in breach of UN resolutions. He feared the [...] "new world order {{we were trying to}} create would be put at risk" [...] if the international community did not act together to deal with Iraq. When asked about equipment, Brown said that British troops in Iraq had all the equipment they needed. The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said, [...] "Gordon Brown's aim today appears to be to look and sound different from Tony Blair whilst simultaneously opening up no gap of substance with him and the decisions he took".|$|E
500|$|Professional wrestler Bret Hart guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, {{and he was very}} insistent that he be shown wearing his pink wrestling outfit. He {{explained}} that [...] "It's so cool {{to be part of a}} show that makes people laugh really, really hard." [...] The media, aware that the animated Hart would want to purchase Mr. Burns' home, mistakenly anticipated that [...] "Bret offers to wrestle him [...] for the place." [...] In a 2009 interview with the A.V. Club's Dave Hofer, Hart explained that the reason why his animated counterpart sounds nothing like <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> initially, he was brought in to voice a generic wrestler. When Mark Kirkland realised how famous Hart actually was, he told Hart that if the artwork had not been started yet, he would be drawn in as himself. Later, Hart moved on to do voice work on the animated television series Jacob Two-Two. The press noted that at that time Hart was [...] "no stranger to cartoon-land," [...] having been [...] "immortalized" [...] by [...] "The Old Man and the Lisa".|$|E
500|$|After the {{departure}} of Duchovny, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, with many saying that the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show {{together for the first}} seven seasons of the show. Realizing his importance in the series, Chris Carter and his crew opened negotiations with Duchovny in the hopes that he would reprise his character for the finale. Initially, they were unsure if he would appear, but he eventually elected to return. Spotnitz said, [...] "My impression from talking to <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he still cares about the show. He's still invested in it and certainly cares about [...] And I think he recognized that {{it was the best thing}} for the show and the audience [...] to come back and give closure to nine years of the series." [...] Not only did Duchovny return for the finale, he also returned to write and direct the episode [...] "William"; he even had a small cameo in the episode, appearing as a reflection in Scully's eye. Three episodes later, Duchovny returned as an actor for the season finale, [...] "The Truth".|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Akhtar {{made his}} acting and singing debut {{in a musical}} film titled Rock On!!, for which he wrote the dialogues and also produced. The film was {{directed}} by Abhishek Kapoor. Prachi Desai, Arjun Rampal and Purab Kohli co-starred along with him. As he had been learning guitar ever {{since the start of}} his directing career, he had been well-versed with it and used it for the film. The role played by <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of Aditya, lead singer of the rock band [...] "Magik". He sang five songs for the soundtrack album. The film was acclaimed by critics and received positive reviews upon release. Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times wrote that the film seemed to be [...] "clearly designed by Farhan Akhar as his own acting debut and he doesn't let himself down. Lending voice to all his songs helps him to get into his character with effortless ease. One could certainly overlook the lisp in his dialogue delivery." [...] Manish Gajjar of BBC wrote of his performance: [...] "Director-turned-actor, Farhan Aktar surprises all with his superb, flawless performance, transforming from a hippy-style lead-singer to a subdued, dismal workaholic banker." [...] Akhtar received several accolades for his debut performance. The film, in addition won the National Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. However, it did not create an impact at the box office and {{turned out to be an}} [...] "average" [...] grosser.|$|E
500|$|In August, {{during a}} long weekend in the arts colony at Woodstock, Bryant began {{what was to be}} a long-term, {{intermittent}} love affair with painter Andrew Dasburg, with whom she had been close for a couple of years. Returning to the Village in September, Bryant and Reed rented a small house at 1 Patchin Place. Later in the month, Reed was arrested for giving a speech in which he denounced the use of Allied troops in Russia; the specific charge against <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he had used [...] "disloyal, scurrilous and abusive language about the Military and Naval Forces of the United States". He was released on $5,000 bail. In separate cases that year, Reed stood trial with Eastman, Floyd Dell, and others from the former staff of The Masses for conspiracy to obstruct the draft of men to fight in World War I and for other alleged offenses related to published articles and cartoons; Reed's alleged crime in the latter case was that he had written a headline, [...] "Knit a Strait-Jacket for Your Soldier Boy", for an article about mental illness among the U.S. troops. Bryant was questioned in The Masses cases but not charged. Both trials involving The Masses ended in hung juries, and the defendants were set free. In October, Bryant's first book, Six Red Months in Russia, was published to [...] "mostly favorable reviews," [...] and Reed resumed work on Ten Days That Shook the World after the government returned his notes. It would not be published until April 1919.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Matt Risley {{gave the}} episode {{a score of}} 9 out of 10, {{saying that it was}} [...] "arguably Moffat's most unashamedly fun Time Lord romp yet". While he praised the humour, plot and {{character}} development, he was critical of the Teselecta; though they [...] "score high on the sci-fi kitsch factor" [...] they were [...] "anything but memorable". SFX magazine critic Richard Edwards gave [...] "Let's Kill Hitler" [...] five out of five stars, thinking it [...] "has to rank among the cleverest Who episodes Moffat has ever written". While he praised Kingston's performance, he wrote that [...] "it's Matt Smith who steals the show, in one of his finest performances as the Doctor...he's utterly magnificent, whether acting the joker, or living out 32 minutes (ish) of death scene. The mix of optimism...and sadness is a tricky thing to pull off, yet Smith does it in a quintessentially Doctor way". Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club graded the episode as a B+, saying that he was [...] "a bit divided". He praised Moffat's River Song arc, which made [...] "the mind ...in a good way", as well as the dialogue and [...] "big concepts". On the other hand, he did not think the Teselecta's mission was developed and [...] "as characters they seem kind of bland". What [...] "really [...] " [...] <b>him</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it did not have the [...] "impact" [...] of some previous episodes and he thought it unlikely that Amy and Rory were willing to quickly accept that they were meant to raise their daughter as a school friend.|$|E
