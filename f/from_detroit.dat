5|$|After the 1954 New York State Thruway opened from Buffalo to New York City, Michigan {{officials}} encouraged Ontario {{to bypass}} Highway 3 {{as the most}} direct path <b>from</b> <b>Detroit</b> to Buffalo.

The freeway was closed until August 18, and a memorial was later installed near the interchange between I-94 and Middlebelt Road.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1924, {{officials}} in southeastern Michigan proposed building a highway <b>from</b> <b>Detroit</b> to run northwesterly {{across the state}} to Ludington, bisecting the angle created by Woodward and Grand River avenues. This roadway was named Northwestern Highway when {{it was built in}} 1929 to an endpoint at 14Mile Road. Further construction on Northwestern Highway was halted by the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|When the state's {{highway system}} was {{initially}} signed in 1919, M-19 was signposted <b>from</b> <b>Detroit</b> northeasterly to Port Huron before turning westward to run concurrently along M-21 and curving northerly {{to run to}} Bad Axe. From there it continued on to a terminus in Port Austin. When the United States Numbered Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926, the southernmost segment <b>from</b> <b>Detroit</b> to Port Huron {{was assigned to the}} then-new US Highway25 (US25). M-19 was removed from M-21 and realigned from Yale southward through Emmet to connect to US25 in Richmond. The northern end was truncated to end to the east of Bad Axe.|$|E

5|$|A film {{adaptation}} of Dreamgirls, starring Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, {{was released by}} DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures in December 2006. The film contains more overt references to Motown and the Supremes than does the play that inspired it: for example, in the film, many of the Dreams' album covers are identical in design to Supremes album covers, and the Dreams themselves hail <b>from</b> <b>Detroit</b> – not Chicago, as do their Broadway counterparts.|$|E
5|$|After {{his escape}} <b>from</b> <b>Detroit,</b> Hines went to Toronto where several other former Confederates lived. Not expecting {{to return to}} the United States, he sent for his wife Nancy. While in Toronto he studied law with General John C. Breckinridge, a former Vice President of the United States. Once U.S. President Andrew Johnson {{declared}} a pardon for most former Confederates, Hines went back to Detroit on July 20, 1865, to sign a loyalty oath to the United States. However, knowing that Union officials in Kentucky would consider him an exception to the pardon, he remained in Canada until May 1866.|$|E
5|$|Ann Arbor {{was founded}} in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders and the stands of Bur Oak trees. The University of Michigan moved <b>from</b> <b>Detroit</b> to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city grew at a rapid rate {{in the early to}} mid-20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a {{reputation}} as a center for left-wing politics. Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as various student movements.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the first}} expressways in Michigan predates the Interstate Highway System. During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) built the Willow Run and Detroit Industrial expressways (now part of I-94) to carry workers <b>from</b> <b>Detroit</b> to the defense plants at Willow Run Airport. The state created the Michigan Turnpike Authority (MTA) in 1951, which {{proposed}} {{the construction of a}} toll freeway to run north–south in the state. The original termini for the Michigan Turnpike were Bridgeport and Rockwood. Interagency politics stalled progress on any proposed turnpikes while MSHD had three freeways under planning or construction.|$|E
5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies <b>from</b> <b>Detroit</b> had already learned of the expedition, however, and gathered a force to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, the Americans found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but most of the Americans managed to find their way back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{built the}} Willow Run Expressway to carry workers <b>from</b> <b>Detroit</b> {{to the defense}} plants at Willow Run Airport. This {{expressway}} was numbered {{as a part of}} US112 initially. During the 1950s, additional highways were converted to freeways before the coming of the Interstate Highway System in 1957. The first highway renumbered as an Interstate was US24A in the southeastern corner of the state, which became part of Interstate 75 (I-75) in 1959.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s, the Lodge Freeway was {{proposed}} to run <b>from</b> <b>Detroit</b> {{as far as}} the Fenton–Clio Expressway (US23) at Fenton. The intersection with the Edsel Ford Freeway, next to Wayne State University was built in 1953 and was the first full freeway-to-freeway interchange built in the United States. The freeway was dedicated on November 7, 1957, and opened without any state trunkline designation between downtown and the Wyoming Curve. The section from the Edsel Ford Freeway (now I-94) into downtown Detroit was designated as US12 by the middle of 1960.|$|E
5|$|John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company was {{centered}} on Mackinac Island after the War of 1812 and exported beaver pelts for thirty years. By {{the middle of}} the 19th century, commercial fishing for common whitefish and lake trout began to replace the fur trade as the island's primary industry. As sport fishing became more popular in the 1880s, hotels and restaurants accommodated tourists coming by train or lake boat <b>from</b> <b>Detroit.</b>|$|E
5|$|London is a {{regional}} centre {{of health care}} and education, being home to the University of Western Ontario, Fanshawe College, and several hospitals. The city hosts a number of musical and artistic exhibits and festivals, which contribute to its tourism industry, but its economic activity is centred on education, medical research, insurance, and information technology. London's university and hospitals are among its top ten employers. London lies at the junction of Highway 401 and 402, connecting it to Toronto, Windsor (which is directly across the border <b>from</b> <b>Detroit),</b> and Sarnia. It also has an international airport, train and bus station.|$|E

5|$|Many former US Highways in Michigan {{have left}} an M-numbered highway {{with the same}} number as a relic of their existence. For example, M-27 runs along a portion of former US27. In addition, there are two occurrences of {{original}} M-numbered state routes which became US Highways with the same designations: all of M-16 became US16 and most of M-10 <b>from</b> <b>Detroit</b> to Saginaw was assumed into the route of US10 in 1926. In fact, each iteration of M-10 has existed in whole or part along a former or future alignment of US10.|$|E

5|$|Past the airport, Gratiot Avenue {{once again}} runs through {{residential}} neighborhoods while being immediately bordered by commercial properties.

Just before crossing M-102 (8Mile Road), Gratiot Avenue widens back to a boulevard. This intersection marks the transition <b>from</b> <b>Detroit</b> and Wayne County to Eastpointe in Macomb County.|$|E
