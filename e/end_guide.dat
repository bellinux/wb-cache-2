40|$|Supervision is {{dramatically}} growing domain {{in the past}} few years. There are many origins which influence its practice and psychotherapy models are one of them. It is important to be conscious of the influence of theoretical background, which can colour <b>end</b> <b>guide</b> course of supervision. We can find increasing use of systemic approach in the practice, therefore this work focus on its application in supervision. We can find lack of resources specific for using systemic approach in the supervision in the social and health care services, so it is important to turn the attetntion to experiences of supervisors using this approach in their practice in this field. The study is concentrating on - what are the stands of supervisors to systemic aproach and what are their experiences with using this approach in practice of supervision. Semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire are used for obtaining outcomes. The data were analysed in qualitative approach. Outcomes of this study indicate emphasis on stands of the supervisors, rather than on "simple" aplication of methodological operations. Practice of supervisors confirms, that systemic approach can be very well applied in supervision. We can consider interesting, that the modality of supervisors work corresponds with current integrative trend in [...] ...|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "grain auger" [...] {{is used in}} {{agriculture}} to move grain from trucks, grain carts or grain trailers into grain storage bins (from where it is later removed by gravity chutes at the bottom). A grain auger may be powered by an electric motor; a tractor, through the power take-off; or sometimes an internal combustion engine mounted on the auger. The helical rotates inside a long metal tube, moving the grain upwards. On the lower end, a hopper receives grain from the truck or grain cart.

40|$|For historical, sociological and {{technical}} reasons, *-calculi {{have been the}} dominant theoretical paradigm {{in the study of}} functional computation. Similarly, but to a lesser degree, pi-calculi dominate advanced mathematical accounts of concurrency.

To this <b>end,</b> <b>guided</b> by the assumption that distributed computing is concurrent computing with partial failures of various kinds, we extend the asynchronous ss-calculus with * a notion of sites, * the possibility of site failure, * a persistence mechanism to deal with site failures, * the distinction between inter-site and intra-site communication, * the possibility of message loss in inter-site communication and * a timer construct, as is often used in distributed algorithms to deal wit...|$|R

In the later years of his tenure, the law school successfully responded, under Lockhart 2 ̆ 7 s leadership, to a variety of challenges presented in the turbulence of the late 1960 s. By developing programs to equalize the opportunities for legal education, by implementing policies that increased student participation in the governance of the school, and by trying to accommodate the dramatic increase in the demand for legal education, the law school responded to the needs of its community without sacrificing its tradition of excellence...|$|R

The grainy black and white photograph, portraying six young girls of part Aboriginal descent, originally appeared under the heading "Homes are sought for these children" in a Darwin newspaper during the 1930 s. It is an iconic representation of the betrayal of innocence, signifying the human suffering caused by the inherent racism of the then Australian government’s Aboriginal assimilation policies. It is also an ironic image, communicating the incongruence between the meaning of social justice {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century and at its <b>end.</b> <b>Guided</b> by Michel Foucault’s oft-repeated caution that, "not everything is bad, but everything is dangerous" (Foucault 1991 : 343), my intention is to share a subjective reflexion, and thereby raise some issues about the way we interact with, and invest truth in visual objects, such as photographs and the discourses which embed them in historical, social, political and cultural contexts...|$|R
