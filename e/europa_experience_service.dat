40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this article}} is to propose a {{framework}} for a new perspective on the total <b>service</b> <b>experience,</b> which dimensions influence it, and how a <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> is linked to value in use. Design/methodology/approach – The article is conceptual and suggests a new theoretical frame of reference describing value in use through <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> in technology-based <b>services.</b> Findings – According to this article, a <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> is the total functional and emotional value of a consumed <b>service.</b> The <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> is unique to every individual customer and the service consumption situation. Value in use is the cognitive evaluation of the <b>service</b> <b>experience.</b> Research limitations/implications – The framework is discussed in the context of technology-based services and will provide a basis for future research. Empirical studies are called for concerning <b>service</b> <b>experiences</b> in different kinds of service contexts. Originality/value – This article contributes a new framework, illustrating the <b>service</b> <b>experience,</b> which dimensions influence the <b>service</b> <b>experience,</b> and how it is linked to value. The framework is placed in a context of technology-based services. Unique to these kinds of services is a lack of personal interaction between the service producer and the customer...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{advanced the}} development for {{a theoretical framework}} of <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> in <b>Service</b> Science discipline. <b>Service</b> <b>experience</b> is composed {{of a series of}} complicated services and influenced by many factors.

Accordingly, we proposed a theoretical framework of <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> based on the perspectives of customer expectation and emotion. Good customer expectation management for service providers will increase the opportunity of customer satisfaction of <b>service</b> <b>experience.</b> In order to ensure that customers can have positive behaviors and responses during <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> delivery, developing an atmospheric service context to generate positive customer emotion is also important.

Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted and the results revealed that the positive <b>experience</b> of <b>service</b> learning positively contributed to life satisfaction in pre-test and post-test of joining overseas service learning. Meanwhile, the results revealed the negative <b>experience</b> of <b>service</b> learning positively contributed to depression in pre-test of joining overseas service learning. This study implied that the acquiring positive <b>experience</b> of <b>service</b> learning could increase life satisfaction of college students.

40|$|During the 1970 s, {{industrial}} countries, {{including the}} US and continental <b>Europa,</b> <b>experienced</b> {{a combination of}} slow productivity growth and high unemplyoment. Subsequent {{research has shown that}} the standard model of unemployment actually gives counterfactual predictions. Motivated by the observation that the 1970 s were also characterized by high and rising inflation, Tesfaselassie and Wolters examine the effect of growth on unemployment in the presence of nominal price rigidity. The authors demonstrate that the effect of growth on unemployment may be positive or negative. Faster growth leads to lower unemployment if the rate of inflation is high enough. There is a threshold level of inflation below which faster growth leads to higher unemployment and above which faster growth leads to lower unemployment. The threshold level in turn depends on labor market characteristics, such as hiring efficiency, the job destruction rate, workers' relative bargaining power and the opportunity cost of work...|$|R

40|$|Service {{researchers}} and practitioners have repeatedly claimed that customer <b>service</b> <b>experiences</b> {{are essential to}} all businesses. Therefore comprehension of how <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> is characterised in research is an essential element for its further development through research. The importance of greater in-depth understanding of the phenomenon of <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> has been acknowledged by several researchers, such as Carú and Cova and Vargo and Lusch. Furthermore, Service-Dominant (S-D) logic has integrated <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> to value by emphasising in its foundational premises that value is phenomenologically (experientially) determined. The present study analyses how the concept of <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> has been characterised in previous research. As such, it puts forward three ways to characterise it in relation to that research: 1) phenomenological <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> relates to the value discussion in S-D logic and interpretative consumer research, 2) process-based <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> relates to understanding service as a process, and 3) outcome-based <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> relates to understanding <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> as one element in models linking a number of variables or attributes to various outcomes. Focusing on the phenomenological <b>service</b> <b>experience,</b> the theoretical {{purpose of the study}} is to characterise <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> based on the phenomenological approach. In order to do so, an additional methodological purpose was formulated: to find a suitable methodology for analysing <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> based on the phenomenological approach. The study relates phenomenology to a philosophical Husserlian and social constructionist tradition studying phenomena as they appear in our experience in a social context. The study introduces Event-Based Narrative Inquiry Technique (EBNIT), which combines critical events with narratives and metaphors. EBNIT enabled the analysis of lived and imaginary <b>service</b> <b>experiences</b> as expressed in individual narratives. The study presents findings of eight case studies within service innovation of Web 2. 0, mobile service, location aware service and public service in the municipal sector. Customers’ and service managers’ stories about their lived private and working lifeworld were the foundation for their ideal <b>service</b> <b>experiences.</b> In general, the thesis finds that <b>service</b> <b>experiences</b> are (1) subjective, (2) context-specific, (3) cumulative, (4) partially socially constructed, (5) both lived and imaginary, (6) temporally multiple-dimensional, and (7) iteratively related to perceived value. In addition to customer <b>service</b> <b>experience,</b> the thesis brings empirical evidence of managerial <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> of front-line managers <b>experiencing</b> the <b>service</b> they manage and develop in their working lifeworld. The study contributes to S-D logic, service innovation and service marketing and management in general by characterising <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> based on the phenomenological approach and integrating it to the value discussion. Additionally, the study offers a methodological approach for further exploration of <b>service</b> <b>experiences.</b> The study discusses managerial implications in conjunction with the case studies and discusses them in relation to service innovation...|$|R

This research is focused on the content, structure and consumer perceptions of online reviews for credence services. We start by examining how the content and structure of real online reviews of credence services systematically differs from those of <b>experience</b> <b>services</b> (Nelson, 1970). We find that online reviews of credence services are more likely to contain unsupported claims than reviews of <b>experience</b> <b>services.</b> We experimentally examine consumer perceptions of reviews, varying both their structure and content. Consumers rationally discount the credibility of credence claims when presented with short, simple reviews but we expect more complex argument structure and inclusion of experience attributes in the review to attenuate this effect...|$|R

The qualitative study (n = 149) explored reasons why customers do not complain after <b>experiencing</b> <b>service</b> failures. In the quantitative study (n = 530), two kinds of noncomplainers who either (a) received organization-initiated recoveries or (b) exited the encounters without recoveries were compared with three kinds of complaining customers who received (a) satisfactory recoveries, (b) dissatisfactory recoveries, or (c) no recoveries. The five customer groups were compared across repurchase intentions, negative affect, perceived regret, and intentions to engage in negative word of mouth. The results of the comparative analyses challenge existing views of noncomplainers’ repurchase intentions and negative outcome levels.

40|$|The {{interest}} in <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> {{in health care}} is increasing. This thesis has a focus on studying <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> and the applicability of service design approach to service development {{in the context of}} infertility services. The following research questions are studied: 1) How is a <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> constructed in infertility treatment services? 2) How can service design principles and methods be applied to service development in the context of infertility treatment services? The research was conducted as a qualitative single case study in a Finnish private infertility clinic. The focus of the research was on studying the <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> of Swedish and Norwegian couples going through oocyte donation treatment in the case clinic. The empirical research was conducted during May-November 2012 using design probes, participatory design workshops and semi-structured expert interviews as primary data collection methods. Also service blueprinting, customer journey method, and user personas were utilized during the research process. The findings of the thesis suggest that <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> in infertility <b>services</b> is constructed from five experience dimensions: operational dimension, informational dimension, participational dimension, emotional dimension, and physical dimension. The dimensions are overlapping and integrated meaning that the strengths and weaknesses in one dimension mutually reinforce or weaken the others. Furthermore, the empirical research implies that due to the high subjectivity and sensitivity of the infertility <b>service</b> <b>experience,</b> the <b>service</b> design principles and methods are well applicable for service development in this field...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to add {{to our understanding of the}} antecedents of customer satisfaction by examining the effects of service reliability (Is the service “correctly” produced?) and service validity (Is the “correct” service produced?) of search, <b>experience</b> and credence <b>services.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Service validity and service reliability were manipulated in scenarios describing service encounters with different types of services. Customer satisfaction was measured using questionnaires. Findings – Service validity and service reliability independently affect customer satisfaction with search <b>services.</b> For <b>experience</b> <b>services,</b> service validity and service reliability are necessary conditions for customer satisfaction. For credence services, no effects of service validity were found but the effects of service reliability on customers' satisfaction were profound. Research limitations/implications – Scenarios provided a useful method to investigate customer evaluation of different types of service situations. A limitation of this method was that the participants were not observed in a real service situation but had to give their opinion on hypothetical scenarios. Practical implications – For search and credence services, it is possible to compensate low service validity by providing a highly reliable service. However, managers of <b>experience</b> <b>services</b> should be aware that little can be gained when either service validity or service reliability is faulty. Originality/value – The present study provides empirical data on the effects of service reliability and the thus far neglected effects of service validity and integrates these (new) concepts in the model of information verification...|$|R

40|$|It is {{essential}} for service companies to understand how their customer <b>service</b> <b>experiences</b> are formed. This is especially important since <b>service</b> <b>experiences</b> are highly subjective and involve customers cognitively, emotionally and behaviorally. Although customer <b>service</b> <b>experiences</b> are a well recognised research topic in both, culinary arts and service research, dynamic interactions, activities and the customers’ active involvement have so far gained little attention. As a consequence the approach in previous research paints a rather static picture of customer <b>service</b> <b>experiences.</b> By introducing the principles of service dominant logic a first person view and the understanding of drivers of customer <b>service</b> <b>experiences</b> could be facilitated. The overall aim of the thesis is to extend and deepen the understandin of drivers of favourable and unfavourable customer <b>service</b> <b>experiences.</b> The context selected is the restaurant context. The overall aim is reflected in four intermediate aims. Two separate studies were conducted. First a two-stage questionnaire based study, describing the phone reservation encounter compared to dining satisfaction; second a critical incident technique study including 195 short narratives of customers’ favourable and unfavourable <b>service</b> <b>experiences</b> at restaurants. Interview data were analysed according to constant comparative analysis principles. The main empirical contributions of this thesis are the move from static descriptions of service to examining dynamic drivers of favourable and unfavourable customers’ <b>service</b> <b>experiences,</b> and especially the analysis of social interactions as a driver of <b>service</b> <b>experiences</b> and the categorisation of drivers. Theoretically the thesis introduces the experience driver constellation, reflecting the dynamic process of co-creation in specific situations,when favourable and unfavourable customer <b>service</b> <b>experiences</b> are formed. Suggestions are made to develop the Five Aspects Meal Model and the Experience Room Framework through the addition of actors, the exterior environment and organisational routines to the models...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{concept of}} online {{customer}} <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> (OCSE) has recently received great interest from academia and businesses alike. Despite {{the belief that}} providing superb online experiences will influence customers' online buying behavior, {{most of the research}} focuses solely on the controllable factors of the online experience. Based on its empirical findings, this article proposes a conceptual framework of online customer <b>service</b> <b>experience,</b> which incorporates the individual dimensions of the online experience according to the stage of the customer-service provider interaction. Design/methodology/approach – Using the means–end approach in 62 semi- structured interviews with a representative sample from three countries, and a new tool to elicit behavioral aggregation, the Emerging Consensus Technique (ECT), the author conceptualizes the online customer <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> (OCSE). Findings – The study identifies functionality and psychological factors as the two main dimensions of online customer <b>service</b> <b>experience.</b> Functionality encompasses the technical attributes of the web vendor, namely the sub-dimensions usability, product presence, communication, social presence, and interactivity. Psychological factors consist of the attitudinal based sub-dimensions context familiarity, trust, and value for money. The conceptual model extends and expands existing literature on online customer <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> models. In particular, the study identifies that the individual importance of the online customer <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> dimensions differ depending on which stage of the experience, namely prior to, during, or after the transaction the customer is in. Moreover, the study reveals the presence of one previously unexplored key component of the online customer service experience: social presence. Originality/value – Using and validating a new tool of extracting elicit behavioral aggregation, the ECT, the study conceptualizes the online customer <b>service</b> <b>experience</b> in a dynamic way. The model explores the importance of each identified dimension in relation to the stage of the interaction, i. e. before, during, or after the transaction/purchase, between the customer and the service provider.
