In comparison, an AMD Opteron 875HE processor consumes 55 watts, while the energy efficient Socket AM2 line fits in the 35 watt thermal envelope (specified a different way so not directly comparable). Merom, the mobile variant, is listed at 35 watts TDP for standard versions and 5 watts TDP for Ultra Low Voltage (ULV) versions.|$|E

In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself.

[...] "I'm Not Your Hero" [...] was written for the album, which was later named Heartthrob and recorded between February and May 2012. Sara, who wrote the lyrics, said the song was based on her life as a teenager when she was unable to identify with the lives of pop culture figures and had unforeseen thoughts about her future. She claimed the lyrics were about her political views from watching The West Wing, her identity and her sexuality. Tegan stated that when Sara showed the song to her and the producers, it was initially more of a love song and much more acoustic and slow than the final mix that would be released, and said she [...] "was haunted by it almost immediately.

500|$|During the Byzantine Empire, {{between the}} 10th and 14th centuries, a {{tradition}} of prayer called hesychasm developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and continues to the present. [...] St. Gregory of Sinai is considered by most to be {{the founder of the}} hesychastic approach to prayer. This tradition uses a special posture and breathing rituals, accompanied by the repetition of a short prayer (traditionally the 'Jesus Prayer') giving rise to suggestions that it may have been influenced by Indian approaches. [...] "While some might compare it [...] with a mantra, to use the Jesus Prayer in such a fashion is to violate its purpose. One is never to treat it as a string of syllables for which the 'surface' meaning is secondary. Likewise, hollow repetition is considered to be worthless (or even spiritually damaging) in the hesychast tradition." [...] Rather, it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the spirit of a true mantra. This style of prayer was at first opposed as heretical by Barlam in Calabria, but was defended by Saint Gregory Palamas. Coming from hesychia ("stillness, rest, quiet, silence"), hesychasm continues to be practiced in the Eastern Orthodox Church and some other Eastern Churches of the Byzantine Rite. Hesychasm has not gained significance in the Western churches.|$|E

Rick Garcia, an activist of the gay rights group Equality Illinois, said to the Chicago Tribune that the episode would likely affect society {{in a positive way}} because of the iconic status of the show which [...] "shape our attitudes". Unlike many of the conservative groups, Kennerley noted that [...] "in the show's tradition of equal-opportunity lampooning, the message is not all pro-gay. Irksome lesbian stereotypes abound, and Nelson the bully suggests they 'legalize gay funerals.' And naturally, Reverend Lovejoy shutters his church to the same-sex sinners." [...] According to Simpsons writer Mike Reiss, the episode also had supporters among conservative groups. He told Encore magazine that [...] "gay people came out very much in favor of it and were happy with the episode, but arch conservatives and right-wing Christians loved the episode, too, because they seemed to think we were making fun of gay people. We really had it both ways." ...|$|E
