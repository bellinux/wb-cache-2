5|$|A further type of (mostly strong red and yellow) {{emergence}} {{has recently}} been <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few Australian species (D. hartmeyerorum, D. indica). Their function is not known yet, although they may help in attracting prey.|$|E
5|$|A {{piece of}} a garment signed by Ivan Alexander and {{interwoven}} with gold was <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> noble's grave near Pirot in the 1970s; today it is preserved in the National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade. It is the first find of its kind, demonstrating a medieval tradition attested in writing according to which Orthodox rulers would present their most eminent dignitaries with a {{piece of a}} garment they had worn.|$|E
5|$|By 1966, Gygax {{was active}} in the wargame hobby world and was writing many {{magazine}} articles on the subject. Gygax learned about H. G. Wells' Little Wars book for play of military miniatures wargames and Fletcher Pratt's Naval Wargame book. Gygax later looked for innovative ways to generate random numbers, and he used not only common, six-sided dice, but dice of all five Platonic solid shapes, which he <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> school supply catalog.|$|E

In more recent publications, Carpenter no longer refers the Poison Strip animal to Sauropelta, only to the family Nodosauridae.|$|E
5|$|In August 1988, {{ten years}} after Levine's and Malden's visits, Episodes 1 and 4–6 of the six-part story The Ice Warriors, were <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{cupboard}} at Villiers House when the Corporation {{was in the process}} of moving out of the building.|$|E
5|$|Inkstone: The inkstone is a stone mortar used in Chinese {{calligraphy}} for grinding {{and mixing}} ink. Other than stone, inkstones are also manufactured from clay, bronze, iron, and porcelain. The device {{evolved from a}} rubbing tool used for rubbing dyes dating around 6000 to 7000 years ago. The earliest excavated inkstone is dated from the 3rd century BC, and was <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tomb located in modern Yunmeng, Hubei. Usage of the inkstone was popularized during the Han Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Santa Rosalía de Palermo – born in Palermo, Italy – is {{the patron}} saint of El Hatillo. Rosalía was {{recognised}} in 1624 when her remains were <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cave, brought to the Cathedral of Palermo, and displayed through the streets of Palermo during a plague. Within three days, the plague ended; Rosalía was credited with saving many from the plague and proclaimed patron saint of the city.|$|E

5|$|The {{cane toad}} {{is an old}} species. A fossil toad (specimen UCMP 41159) from the La Venta fauna of the late Miocene of Colombia is indistinguishable from modern cane toads from {{northern}} South America.

5|$|To {{the south}} of Egypt, in Lower Nubia, Nyuserre {{exploited}} the gneiss quarries of Gebel el-Asr near Aswan, which provided material for buildings and statues, as shown by a fragmentary stone stela inscribed with Nyuserre's Horus name that was <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> settlement adjacent to the quarries.|$|E
5|$|A 20-day study held by BirdLife International {{discovered}} 265 {{species of}} birds in the park. Of these, the yellow-bellied form of forest robin is widespread. In the study, a pair of Ja River scrub warblers was <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1 hectare patch of Rhynchospora marsh; its population must be small as there are few such marshes in Nki. Three species of forest nightjar have been observed in the park; Bate's and brown nightjars are common in southeastern Cameroon, while a rarer and unidentified third species' call has been heard twice. It is likely that this is Prigogine's nightjar, as its voice is identical {{to that of the}} only known specimen of this species which was found in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Two small owls, Sjostedt's and African barred owlets coexist in Nki, due to similar habitat requirements.|$|E

5|$|A temple {{dedicated}} to the goddess Satet, personification of the Nile floods, had stood {{on the island of}} Elephantine to the south of Egypt since at least the late Predynastic Period around 3200 BC. The temple was enlarged and renovated several times from the Early Dynastic Period onwards and was again rebuilt {{in the course of the}} Fifth Dynasty, possibly during Nyuserre's reign. A faience plaque bearing Nyuserre's name was <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> deposit of votive offerings located under the floor of the sanctuary. Unfortunately, this deposit does not represent the original context of the plaque, which could have once adorned the walls of the temple or could equally have been deposed in a foundational offering made in anticipation of the temple reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only about}} half of Volubilis has been excavated, a number of {{prominent}} public buildings are still visible and some, notably a basilica and a triumphal arch, have been reconstructed. Many private buildings, including the mansions of the city's elite, have also been uncovered. They are especially notable for the fine mosaics that have been <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of buildings and which are still in situ in the houses where they were laid. The buildings were mostly made from locally quarried grey-blue limestone. Very little remains of the original Punic settlement, as it lies under the later Roman buildings.|$|E
5|$|In 1786, subfossil Rodrigues {{solitaire}} bones encrusted in stalagmite were <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{cave and}} sent to Georges Cuvier in about 1830. For unknown reasons, he stated they had recently been found on Mauritius, which caused confusion, until they were compared with other bones from Rodrigues that were found {{to belong to the}} same species. These finds confirmed Leguat's descriptions, but at this time no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen live specimens. In 1831, a man who had lived on Rodrigues for 40 years said that he had never seen birds large enough to be Rodrigues solitaires. Rodrigues covers only , making it implausible that the bird would have survived undetected.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, Balch started {{investigating}} the Iron Age cave dwellers in Wookey Hole Caves, {{embarking on a}} four-year study of the caves along {{with other members of}} the Mendip Nature Research Committee. The group mapped the caves, drew illustrations of their finds and took photographs, collecting the information in the 1914 book Wookey Hole: its Caves and Cave-Dwellers. When giving lectures on the cave dwellers, he would compare them to Eskimos, drawing parallels in their art and hunting styles, and would show pictures of the tools used by the cave dwellers that he discovered in Wookey Hole Caves, as well as items such as brooches and child's play toys. He also told of a goat-herd he <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cave who had died, leaving his goats tethered, subsequently perishing.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Charles Kowal {{discovered}} 2060 Chiron, an icy planetoid with {{an orbit}} between Saturn and Uranus. He used a blink comparator, the same device that had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before. In 1992, another object, 5145 Pholus, was <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar orbit. Today, an {{entire population of}} comet-like bodies, called the centaurs, is known {{to exist in the}} region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs' orbits are unstable and have dynamical lifetimes of a few million years. From the time of Chiron's discovery in 1977, astronomers have speculated that the centaurs therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 an {{outbreak}} of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded. A new paramyxovirus was <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> victim's brain; it was named Nipah virus, after the village where he had lived. The infection {{was caused by a}} virus from fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation. The bats had moved to trees nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the virus from their droppings.|$|E
