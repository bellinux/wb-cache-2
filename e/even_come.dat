5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to <b>even</b> <b>come</b> near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming {{up with a way to}} display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E
5|$|Rudd was {{offering}} generous terms that few competitors {{could hope to}} <b>even</b> <b>come</b> close to. If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 Martini–Henry breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, a lump sum of £500), and £100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he {{had at the time}} between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic. The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own impis. Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times, in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written. None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document, making them legally unenforceable (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless.|$|E

25|$|These {{scholars}} {{felt that}} adherence to monogamy would minimise {{the risk of}} oppression because the requirement of meting out justice amongst a plurality of wives would be immensely challenging for any man. Therefore, they opined that it is preferable to avoid polygyny altogether, so one does not <b>even</b> <b>come</b> near the chance of committing the forbidden deed of dealing unjustly between the wives.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} such {{references}} that indicate that music {{was an integral}} part of the Greek perception of how their race had <b>even</b> <b>come</b> into existence and how their destinies continued to be watched over and controlled by the Gods. It is no wonder, then, that music was omnipresent at the Pythian Games, the Olympic Games, religious ceremonies, leisure activities, and even the beginnings of drama as an outgrowth of the dithyrambs performed in honor of Dionysus.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the most}} {{important}} social festival of Sambalpur. Generally it takes place during the month of August and September. Preliminary preparation of the festival starts 15 days before the occasion. The first grains of the paddy crop, cooked into various dishes, are offered to the deities. The eldest member of the family then distributes new rice to other members of the family. All the household articles are cleaned. People greet each other. It is a community festival celebrated by every Hindu family. The popularity of the festival is such that festival greetings <b>even</b> <b>come</b> from the honorable Prime Minister of India.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{description}} of Protoavis assumes that Protoavis has been correctly {{interpreted as a}} bird. Almost all palaeontologists doubt that Protoavis is a bird, or that all remains assigned to it <b>even</b> <b>come</b> from a single species, because of the circumstances of its discovery and unconvincing avian synapomorphies in its fragmentary material. When they were found at a Dockum Group quarry in the Texas panhandle in 1984, in a sedimentary stratum of a Triassic river delta, the fossils were a jumbled cache of disarticulated bones that may reflect an incident of mass mortality following a flash flood.|$|E
25|$|Marriage customs vary in Muslim {{dominated}} countries. Islamic {{law allows}} polygamy where a Muslim man can {{be married to}} four wives at the same time, under restricted conditions, {{but it is not}} widespread. As the Sharia demands that polygamous men treat all wives equally, classical Islamic scholars opined that it is preferable to avoid polygamy altogether, so one does not <b>even</b> <b>come</b> near the chance of committing the forbidden deed of dealing unjustly between the wives. Most modern Muslims view the practice of polygamy as allowed, but unusual and not recommended. In some countries, polygamy is restricted by new family codes, for example the Moudawwana in Morocco. Some countries allow Muslim men to enter into additional temporary marriages, beyond the four allowed marriages, such as the practice of sigheh marriages in Iran, and Nikah Mut'ah elsewhere in some Middle East countries.|$|E

25|$|Remaining {{challenges}} However, in {{the rush}} to construct planning mistakes were made. Demand was overestimated, the construction of sewerage lagged behind the construction of treatment plants, designs were sometimes inappropriate, there was no requirement for pre-treatment of industrial effluents thus affecting the effectiveness of treatment processes, and the sites chosen for the first priority investments within a river basin were not always those where the highest impact could have been achieved in terms of improving river water quality. As a result, many plants are underutilized or poorly functioning. According to the Ministry of Construction, more than 50 wastewater treatment plants in more than 30 cities operated at only 30 percent of their capacity or did not <b>even</b> <b>come</b> into operation. Consequently, the impact of the investment program on the water quality in rivers and coastal waters has been limited.|$|E
25|$|The Lightning {{picked up}} goalscorer Dino Ciccarelli from the Detroit Red Wings during the 1996 off-season, {{and he did}} not disappoint, scoring 35 goals in the 1996–97 season, with Chris Gratton {{notching}} another 30 goals. The team moved into a glittering new arena, the Ice Palace (now the Amalie Arena), and appeared destined for another playoff spot. However, the Lightning suffered a devastating rash of injuries. Puppa developed back trouble that kept him out of all but four games during the season; he would only play a total of 50 games from 1996 until his retirement in 2000. Bradley also lost time to a series of injuries that would limit him to a total of 49 games from 1996 until his retirement in December 1999. Center John Cullen developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and missed the last 12 games of the 1996–97 season; he would eventually be forced to retire in 1999. Decimated by these ailments, the Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs. It would be seven years before the Lightning would <b>even</b> <b>come</b> close to the playoffs again.|$|E

This idea garners mixed reactions from the employees, but when Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) jokingly asks Andy what prizes he will offer for inordinately large numbers of points, he offers to tattoo whatever his co-workers would like on his butt in exchange for 5,000 points, not anticipating that anyone {{will be able to}} <b>even</b> <b>come</b> close to this number.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers lauded M's {{appraisal}} of Bond as a [...] "sexist, misogynist dinosaur", with Todd McCarthy in Variety saying GoldenEye [...] "breathes fresh creative and commercial life" [...] into the series. John Puccio of DVD Town said that GoldenEye was [...] "an eye and ear-pleasing, action-packed {{entry in the}} Bond series" [...] and that the film gave Bond [...] "a bit of humanity, too". Ian Nathan of Empire said that GoldenEye [...] "revamps that indomitable British spirit" [...] and that the Die Hard movies [...] "don't <b>even</b> <b>come</b> close to 007". Tom Sonne of the Sunday Times considered GoldenEye the best Bond film since The Spy Who Loved Me. Jose Arroyo of Sight & Sound considered the greatest success of the film was in modernising the series.|$|E

In front of a television audience of 250 million, Jackson announced, [...] "Just think, nobody thought this would last", before embracing Presley in a kiss. Afterward, Presley became angered at her husband, feeling he had used her. The male pop singer reasoned that the liplock, which was dubbed [...] "The Kiss of the Century", would be talked about for decades, with people playing the clip over and over.

Furthermore, he wrote that there [...] "was a lot of really funny stuff tonight" [...] and highlighted [...] "the scene between Darryl and Michael" [...] due to Robinson's acting. Aubry D'Arminio from Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "Mike's embarrassment, and his unwillingness at first to admit he is disliked, was very very well played on Carell's part."

500|$|His wealth {{continued}} to grow significantly (in line with U.S. economic growth) after as the demand for gasoline soared, eventually reaching about $900 million {{on the eve of}} the First World War, including significant interests in banking, shipping, mining, railroads, and other industries. According to the New York Times obituary, [...] "it was estimated after Mr. Rockefeller retired from business that he had accumulated close to $1,500,000,000 out of the earnings of the Standard Oil trust and out of his other investments. This was probably the greatest amount of wealth that any private citizen had ever been able to accumulate by his own efforts." [...] By the time of his death in 1937, Rockefeller's remaining fortune, largely tied up in permanent family trusts, was estimated at $1.4 billion, while the total national GDP was $92 billion. According to some methods of wealth calculation, Rockefeller's net worth over the last decades of his life would easily place him as the wealthiest known person in recent history. As a percentage of the United States' GDP, no other American fortune — including those of Bill Gates or Sam Walton — would <b>even</b> <b>come</b> close.|$|E
