5|$|As a mother, Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically a mother to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies.

His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly aware of his wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured every detail of the daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she never complained at the forced separation.|$|E

5|$|During the Hellenistic period, mythology {{took on the}} {{prestige}} of elite knowledge that marks its possessors as belonging to a certain class. At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became even more pronounced. Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events.

5|$|However, the Jain {{conception}} of ahimsa {{is quite different}} <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> commonly understood by violence.

Furthermore, according to Jain Scriptures, destruction of less developed organism brings about lesser karmas than destruction of developed animals and karmas generated in observance of religious duties faultlessly disappears almost immediately. Hence, it is possible to observe complete nonviolence with right knowledge, even when some outward violence occurs to living beings in the course of performing religious duties by observing carefulness and pure mental disposition without any attachment.|$|E

5|$|Modern Britons are descended {{mainly from}} the varied ethnic groups that settled in the British Isles in and before the 11th century: Prehistoric, Brittonic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Normans.

Since 1922 and earlier, there has been immigration to the United Kingdom by people <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the Republic of Ireland, the Commonwealth, mainland Europe and elsewhere; they and their descendants are mostly British citizens, with some assuming a British, dual or hyphenated identity.|$|E

To minimise the risk of flooding, the new road was built on an embankment, for which the necessary gravel was extracted <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> today an artificial lake and water-sports centre.
