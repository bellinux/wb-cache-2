5|$|Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are {{sometimes}} {{used to determine}} the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than 4 to 5°C (7 to 9°F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past, and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time (Giganotosaurus). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did not. Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> mean that it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.|$|E

25|$|Bisexual erasure (or {{bisexual}} invisibility) is {{the tendency}} to ignore, remove, falsify, or reexplain evidence of bisexuality in culture, history, academia, news media and other primary sources. In its most extreme form, bisexual erasure includes denying that bisexuality exists. It is often a manifestation of biphobia, although <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> involve overt antagonism.|$|E

25|$|It appears, in short, that {{contradictory}} cartographic {{evidence in}} this field has been caused either by wartime mistakes, mere inattention or inadvertent proliferation of previous technical mistakes. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> reflect consistent legal opinions or policies of either side.

25|$|Schopenhauer's realist {{views on}} {{mathematics}} {{are evident in}} his criticism of the contemporary attempts to prove the parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry.

25|$|Furthermore, Möbius transformations map {{generalized}} circles to generalized circles since circle inversion {{has this}} property. A generalized circle {{is either a}} circle or a line, the latter being considered as a circle through the point at infinity. Note that a Möbius transformation does not necessarily map circles to circles and lines to lines: it can mix the two. Even if it maps a circle to another circle, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> map the first circle's center to the second circle's center.|$|E
25|$|Lagos {{has many}} {{hospitals}} and medical facilities, {{some of which}} have accomplished feats in Nigeria's medical history. For example, the oldest Nigerian hospital is located in the city as well as West Africa's first air-operated emergency medical service which commenced in the city. The Lagos healthcare system is generally divided into public and private sectors which provide medical services at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels. Although the private hospitals are usually more expensive, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> translate to better healthcare delivery.|$|E
25|$|Habeas corpus {{has certain}} limitations. Though a writ of right, {{it is not}} a writ of course. It is {{technically}} only a procedural remedy; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> protect other rights, such as the entitlement to a fair trial. So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law, then habeas corpus may not be a useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended under the pretext of war or state of emergency.|$|E

In the rubber tree bark, the conducting phloem is localized in the inner most of bark (D’Auzac et al. 1989), while the turgor pressures observed by phloem turgor pressure probes derive mainly from the latex vessels, <b>it</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> reflect the conditions within the translocation system (Buttery and Boatman 1964).|$|R
50|$|This grand consensus, however, was not {{the product}} of slavish sycophancy of courtiers, but of a genuine {{intellectual}} agreement in Dutch government circles {{that this was the}} right policy to follow, at least in the foreign policy field. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> extend to the domestic policy field in all respects, and this may explain the course of events after William's sudden death in early 1702.|$|R
50|$|The Court of Justice {{held that}} these were certain selling arrangements. While under Keck the measure applied universally to all traders in a territory, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> affect all traders the same in law and fact.

25|$|A {{small amount}} of anechogenic free fluid in the rectouterine pouch is {{commonly}} found in both intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies. The presence of echogenic fluid is estimated at between 28 and 56% of women with an ectopic pregnancy, and strongly indicates the presence of hemoperitoneum. However, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> result from tubal rupture, but is commonly a result from leakage from the distal tubal opening. As a rule of thumb, the finding of free fluid is significant if it reaches the fundus or {{is present in the}} vesico-uterine pouch. A further marker of serious intra-abdominal bleeding is the presence of fluid in the hepatorenal recess of the subhepatic space.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} be heard refers to the right for a party's case to be heard before a {{decision}} is made. Even if a statute does not state the requirement for a hearing, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> mean that a hearing will never be required. However, this right is neither automatic nor absolute. For instance, in Yong Vui Kong, the Court of Appeal noted that at common law a convicted offender seeking mercy had no {{right to be}} heard during the clemency process. In Singapore, this situation is reflected by the absence of any provision in Article 22P of the Constitution for an offender to be heard during the clemency process.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} the Senate provide that no senator may make more than two speeches on a motion or bill on the same {{legislative}} day. A legislative day begins when the Senate convenes and ends with adjournment; hence, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> coincide with the calendar day. The length of these speeches is not limited by the rules; thus, in most cases, senators may speak {{for as long as}} they please. Often, the Senate adopts unanimous consent agreements imposing time limits. In other cases (for example, for the budget process), limits are imposed by statute. However, the right to unlimited debate is generally preserved.|$|E

25|$|Some have {{described}} the women’s rights movement in Morocco as a movement of elites and criticized the new Mudawana on similar grounds. Most women’s organizations in Morocco receive external funding, whether from the government, various Moroccan political parties, or international actors such as USAID, the European Development Bank, and the World Bank, which has left them open to criticisms that their agendas {{are tied to the}} sources of their funding and therefore compromised. However, some scholars have argued that just because the movement was started among elites, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> follow that they are incongruent with grassroots interests. Still others point out that in an even broader sense, the universal notion of formal equality itself may not be evenly applicable or relevant to women from different social, cultural, and national backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|Extended {{consciousness}} is an animal's autobiographical self-perception. It {{is thought to}} arise in the brains of animals which have a substantial capacity for memory and reason. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> require language. The perception of a historic and future self arises from a stream of information from the immediate environment and from neural structures related to memory. The concept was popularised by Antonio Damasio and is used in biological psychology. Extended {{consciousness is}} said to arise in structures in the human brain described as image spaces and dispositional spaces. Image spaces imply areas where sensory impressions of all types are processed, including the focused awareness of the core consciousness. Dispositional spaces include convergence zones, which are networks in the brain where memories are processed and recalled, and where knowledge is merged with immediate experience.|$|E
25|$|Provide an {{algorithm}} that secures a win for one player, or a {{draw for}} either, against any possible moves by the opponent, {{from the beginning}} of the game. That is, produce at least one complete ideal game (all moves start to end) with proof that each move is optimal for the player making it. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> mean a computer program using the solution will play optimally against an imperfect opponent. For example, the checkers program Chinook will never turn a drawn position into a losing position (since the weak solution of checkers proves that it is a draw), but it might possibly turn a winning position into a drawn position because Chinook does not expect the opponent to play a move that will not win but could possibly lose, and so it does not analyze such moves completely.|$|E
