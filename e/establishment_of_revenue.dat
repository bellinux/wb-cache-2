40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, many {{countries}} in Anglophone Africa have established (semi-) autonomous revenue authorities (ARAs), organisationally distinct from ministries of finance, with some real operational autonomy, and with staff paid at rates {{similar to those in}} comparable private sector jobs. The introduction of revenue agencies has been seen by some as a step on the road to privatisation of the revenue collection process. We demonstrate in the article that this is a misreading of the story of revenue authorities in Anglophone Africa. This conclusion is reached by examining two related sets of questions. The first set concerns the transnational transfer of institutions. Is it a problem that ARAs have spread so fast under the influence of aid and of international financial institutions? The second set of questions relates to the more specific issue of the autonomy of revenue agencies. Is the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> agencies another way of fragmenting the authority of already weak central government institutions? Our answers are largely ‘no' to both sets of concerns. Addressing these questions enables us to explain what ARAs actually imply for state capacity in Anglophone Africa.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) in Ghana’s Northern Region in mobilising internally generated funds (IGF) to finance development projects. The study gathered both primary and secondary data from three MMDAs: Tamale Metropolitan Assembly, Yendi Municipal Assembly and Saboba District Assembly. It employed a multi-stage sampling technique of questionnaires, interviews, focus groups and key informant interviews to collect data from respondents and obtain a snapshot of their situation in the 2013 fiscal year. It established that fines, property rates, licences, annual rates, investment income, permits, sales of tender documents, and business taxes were potential sources of revenue for the assemblies. Also, the study identified a range of strategies employed by assemblies to raise revenue: engagement of revenue collectors, use of a mobile revenue taskforce, registration of businesses, visits to markets and business centres, commission payments for revenue collectors, security checkpoints, incentivisation of revenue collectors, <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> collection points, and rotation of revenue collectors. Nevertheless, {{the study found that}} the MMDAs studied could not meet their IGF revenue targets for the 2013 fiscal year, with all three falling below 50 %. This poor performance was attributed to: inadequate logistics to support effective IGF mobilisation; under-declaring of revenues; not enough revenue collectors; poor supervision and monitoring; poor compliance by ratepayers; corruption; political interference; inadequate knowledge and skills among revenue collectors; poor service delivery by the assemblies; ineffective collaboration; and lack of revenue data. ...|$|E

40|$|Tax revenue {{mobilisation}} {{is attracting}} increasing attention among researchers and policymakers in {{developed and developing}} countries alike. There is widespread recognition that increasing tax revenues {{should be at the}} core of development strategies, with the aim of reducing dependence on foreign aid, increasing domestic resources to finance development plans, and stimulating transparency and accountability in government–citizen relations. The recent global financial crisis has certainly given momentum to the issue. On the one hand, it made fiscal matters central to the policy debate in developed countries, which resulted in a higher priority in the development debate as well. On the other hand, it made the possibility of scaled-down aid more concrete. For their part, developing countries – and particularly aid-dependent African countries – have been giving higher priority to domestic revenue mobilisation. This has resulted in widespread reforms on the policy side (most notably with the introduction of value added tax, or VAT) and on the administration side (with the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> semi-autonomous <b>revenue</b> authorities, among other initiatives, to modernise tax administration).

40|$|PhDThis {{dissertation}} is {{an examination}} <b>of</b> the Irish <b>revenue</b> {{system in the}} reign of William III, concentrating {{on the extent to}} which the period witnessed the development of a modem, professional system, and the forces that shaped that change. The work is divided into an introduction, nine chapters, a conclusion, and five appendices. Chapter one focuses on the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> a Williamite <b>revenue</b> administration during the Irish war, 1689 - 91, and the extent to which that administration maintained or altered the existing Jacobite administration. Chapter two details the different revenue branches in Ireland, their origins and legislative foundations, and the comparisons with the English revenue branches. Chapter three examines revenue yield and expenditure, and the extent to which the increased costs of government in the aftermath of the war necessitated an expansion <b>of</b> the <b>revenue</b> sources. Chapter four provides an assessment of the role of the English government in the Irish revenue establishment. Chapter five profiles the personnel <b>of</b> the <b>revenue</b> commission, while chapter six examines the role of the commissioners. Chapter seven focuses on the function and personnel of the commissioners' country-wide collection service, while chapter eight looks at the diminishing role of the antiquated exchequer. Chapter nine details the developments within Irish politics and parliament in relation to the revenue, and examines how the government's increased need for money caused the advent of regular parliaments, and allowed for greater parliamentary scrutiny of the government's expenditure. The five appendices provide statistical information in support of these chapters, covering the yield <b>of</b> all <b>revenue</b> branches, expenditure, petition lists, office-holders in the exchequer, the revenue conmiission, the ancient customs offices, and the collection service, money issues from the English treasury to the Irish receiverand paymaster-general, and a list <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> officials sitting as M.

On June 17, 2010, Federal Transit Administrator Peter Rogoff required a formal commitment from Virginia to match its share of the federal funds if the federal funding is to continue. On July 1, 2010, the WMATA Board of Directors agreed to provide matching funds without regard to McDonnell's request for Board seats. [...] Based on this agreement, the federal funds were reconfirmed, and WMATA was able to proceed with a contract to purchase 428 new metrorail cars.
