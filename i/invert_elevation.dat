40|$|Alternative {{wastewater}} collection {{systems are}} often implemented {{in situations where}} conventional wastewater collection systems are not feasible. Typically, it is desirable to use conventional wastewater collection systems based on a proven track record. However, in areas of hilly or flat terrain, the use of conventional wastewater collection systems may require deep excavation, significantly increasing the cost of conventional collection systems. Conventional Wastewater Collection Systems Conventional wastewater collection systems {{are the most popular}} method to collect and convey wastewater. Pipes are installed on a slope, allowing wastewater to flow by gravity from a house site to the treatment facility. Pipes are sized and designed with straight alignment and uniform gradients to maintain self-cleansing velocities. Manholes are installed between straight runs of pipe to ensure that stoppages can be readily accessed. Pipes are generally eight inches or larger and are typically installed at a minimum depth of three feet and a maximum depth of 25 feet. Manholes are located no more than 400 feet apart or at changes of direction or slope. Alternative Wastewater Collection Systems Where deep excavation is a concern, it may be beneficial to use an alternative wastewater collection system. These systems generally use smaller diameter pipes with a slight slope or follow the surface contour of the land, reducing the amount of excavation and construction costs. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows a pipe following an inflective gradient (the contours of the ground). As long {{as the head of the}} sewer is at a higher <b>invert</b> <b>elevation</b> than the tail of the sewer’s <b>invert</b> <b>elevation,</b> flow will continue through the system in the intended direction. Alternative collection systems may be preferred in areas with high groundwater that may seep into the sewer, increasing the amount of wastewater to be treated.

40|$|A Professional Project {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Water Resources, Water Resources Program, University of New Mexico. The U. S. Geological Survey installed over 240 piezometers and 27 surface-water gages along the Rio Grande in Albuquerque, NM from 2003 to 2009, to monitor groundwater and surface-water levels and water temperatures. Spanning a 20 mile distance between the bridges at Alameda Blvd. and Interstate 25, there were 8 selected locations each consisting of paired east-west transects situated perpendicular to the river (Figure 1). Paired transects comprise two parallel cross-sections of the Rio Grande inner valley that were positioned approximately 500 ft. apart and extend to the riverside drains {{on both sides of}} the river. Each transect consisted of piezometers installed at various depths along the riverside drains, and in the Rio Grande riparian zone known as the bosque, and also included surface-water-stage gages installed in the Rio Grande and at both riverside drains. In the riparian zone, riverside piezometers were situated within 20 ft of the river bank whereas bosque piezometers were placed about halfway between the river bank and the riverside drain. Each transect contained piezometers along the river-side of the east and west riverside drains, on the side closer to the river and many of the transects contained piezometers located outside of the drains. Six transects contained piezometers located over 300 ft from the river. Every groundwater and surface-water site was instrumented with an electronic pressure transducer programmed to collect hourly water-level data. Depth to water data were processed through the USGS Automated Data Processing System (ADAPS) and later converted to water surface elevation. These water level elevations were then used to calculate horizontal and vertical groundwater gradients as related to seasonal variations in surface-water discharge in the Rio Grande. It is shown in this study that seasonal extremes of discharge significantly influence the direction and magnitude of groundwater gradients in the bosque. This study calculated hydraulic gradients at eight approximately equidistant locations in the study area, {{on both sides of the}} river, and from the river to the outside of both riverside drains at most locations. Gradients near the drains are particularly important because groundwater leakage from the river may at times flow at levels significantly below the drain <b>invert</b> <b>elevations.</b> When groundwater levels adjacent to the drains are well below the drain <b>invert</b> <b>elevations,</b> the drains cannot be recharged with river leakage - in fact, the drains here are implied to be losing surface water flow down into the groundwater system. There are likely several reasons for this. Pumpage from nearby municipal production wells may intermittently lower adjacent groundwater levels enough along drains to cause this. In addition, river water diverted out of the Rio Grande through the San Juan-Chama Drinking Water Project may reduce channel discharge and consequent leakage to the groundwater system enough to lower water levels in drain reaches as well as in the bosque through much of the Albuquerque area. Additionally, vertical and horizontal gradients at three locations in this study were analyzed for changes due to the influence of municipal production well pumpage from three of the nearest Albuquerque well fields. Other contributing factors to declining groundwater levels likely include climate change, bosque vegetation, soil stratigraphy, riverside drains, irrigation ditches, and domestic groundwater pumpage...|$|R

40|$|Transportation {{systems have}} been {{critical}} {{to the development of}} most societies. These systems form large networks and require large areas of land. Over the passage of time most transportation systems will continue to expand and technological advances will lead to new forms of transportation. Thus, our understanding of their effects on the environment {{and the best way to}} build, reconstruct, maintain, and mitigate these systems needs to be a priority. This presentation will focus on roadbed transportation systems and their effects on wetlands. The presentation will look at their direct and indirect influences on wetlands. Direct impacts from filling wetlands have been well documented for many land uses. Many existing transportation corridors developed from what were early trails and passages. These early routes often followed waterways due to the ease of travel. Even with passage of time many new transportation corridors have been built along waterways and in valley bottoms to take advantage of gentle grades. Most wetlands also are found in these landscape positions, thus transportation systems can contribute a higher rate of direct losses from filling per area of development. Further, wildlife mortality, pollutant runoff, and vegetation management are examples of other direct influences these corridors have on wetlands adjacent to them. Indirect impacts have not been well documented and further research is necessary. A wide array of factors such as ditching, design criteria, change to drainage patterns, fill effects, soil compaction, bridge location, culvert <b>invert</b> <b>elevations,</b> traffic patterns, and pollutant spills have influences on wetlands. Further, these factors influences depend on certain parameters of the adjacent wetlands such as soil type, hydrologic regime, depth to bedrock, water chemistry, plant community, and flow patterns. Some resulting indirect influences include changes in plant communities, species richness, water chemistry, wildlife habits, sediment transport, hydrologic changes, and increase of invasive plant species. This presentation will consider these effects resulting from transportation construction, maintenance, design, and policies (past, present, and future) that have and will influence future wetland diversity.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Three culverts, {{judged to}} be fish barriers, were {{replaced}} with "stream simulation" culverts on the Fremont National Forest of south central Oregon. The culvert sites {{are located in the}} Fort Rock Basin in streams that are home to resident Great Basin redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Great Basin redband trout is the common name for the native trout in the Great Basin and is informally recognized as O. m. newberrii. The design process is discussed and documented for the three culvert replacements. The fish passage conditions in the new culverts were compared to the old culverts both quantitatively and qualitatively. One assumption with stream simulation culverts is that fish will be able to move through a culvert if the flow conditions are {{similar to that of the}} natural channel. Velocity measurements and channel characteristics were compared between the natural stream and the culvert. The comparisons were used to define whether similarity was achieved between the culvert and the natural stream. Velocity and channel characteristic measurements were taken during one discharge condition of spring snowmelt, the migration period for spawning redband trout. The comparisons were further examined to determine which would be appropriate metrics in the determination of success or failure of the installation. Channel stability was quantified at each culvert through three systems of channel stability measurements. Regional design guidelines were found to lack information regarding the <b>invert</b> <b>elevation</b> placement for designing a stream simulation culvert. Invert placement is likely to be critical in terms of permanence of placed streambed material in a culvert. There was a qualitative and quantitative improvement of flow conditions at the replacement culverts over the old culverts. All new culverts satisfied the regulatory criteria for fish passage. Two of the three culverts appeared to be similar to the natural stream when comparing similar habitat unit types. The comparisons at the third culvert site were statistically different from the natural stream. The differences may be attributed to the narrow low flow channel that existed through the culvert. Longitudinal thalweg velocity, cross-sectional velocity, and thalweg velocity distribution comparisons between the culvert and the natural stream appear to be appropriate metrics in the determination of success or failure of stream simulation culverts. Streambed material in the culverts exhibited limited evidence of movement after a minimal spring snowrnelt discharge. Stability of streambed material in the culverts at higher discharges was not tested...|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} on a 1 : 25 -scale model of the San Ramon Bypass Channel, Contra Costa County, California, to develop an overflow weir to remove flows from the channel {{in excess of the}} 100 -year frequency discharge. The overflow weir would remove flows upstream of the covered channel reach to maintain open channel flow conditions through the covered reach and to not exceed channel capacity downstream of the covered reach. The model reproduced approximately 900 ft of the San Ramon Bypass Channel, 100 ft of the Sans Crainte Creek channel, and 400 ft of the catch channel. The model was constructed so that the slopes of the channels could be adjusted to reproduce various energy gradients equivalent to those resulting from different prototype Manning 2 ̆ 7 s n roughness factors. The slopes of the model were initially adjusted to produce an energy gradient resulting from a Manning 2 ̆ 7 s n roughness factor of 0. 012 in the prototype. Based on initial water-surface profiles measured in the model without the overflow weir installed, the weir height was set at 13. 25 ft above the center line <b>invert</b> <b>elevation</b> and the weir length was set at 200 ft. With the overflow weir installed in the model, water-surface profiles and discharges over the weir were recorded with various flow conditions. The weir length was shortened from the upstream end by 25, 50, and 75 ft. Test results indicated that a weir length of 125 ft set at 13. 25 ft above the center-line invert provided satisfactory results. Discharges over the weir were recorded with various channel discharges for each weir length. The slopes of the high-velocity channels were adjusted to reproduce the energy gradient resulting from a Manning 2 ̆ 7 s n roughness factor of 0. 014 in the prototype. These tests {{were conducted}} with an overflow weir length of 125 ft and weir height of 13. 25 ft. Water-surface profiles and discharges over the weir were recorded with various channel discharges. The divider wall at the downstream end of the weir was streamlined by reducing the angle 15 deg where the flow was being deflected and placing a 3 -in. radius on the nose of the divider to split the flow.

In the models, the pool depth had little effects on the hydraulic properties of the dropshaft, but larger rate of energy dissipation was consistently observed with 90 degree outflow direction. Neutrally-buoyant particles were used to record particle residence times in the shafts. For low flow rates and deep shaft pools, the probability distribution functions of residence times exhibited a bi-modal distribution in both model and prototype. Detailed air-water flow and acoustic measurements were conducted in one prototype dropshaft under controlled flow conditions. Void fraction measurements demonstrated a strong aeration of the shaft pool for all flow regimes, but regime R 2. The air-water content distributions were basically two-dimensional. At low flow rates, the data were successively compared with an analytical solution of the air bubble advective diffusion equation. Pseudo-bubble chord size measurements showed {{a broad range of}} entrained bubble sizes, from less than 0. 5 mm to more than 25 mm, with mean pseudo-bubble chords between 10 and 20 mm. The distributions of chord sizes were skewed with a preponderance of small bubbles compared to the mean. Analysis of the streamwise distributions of bubbles indicated a fair proportion of bubbles associated with a cluster structure and the large majority of clusters consisted of 2 bubbles only. Acoustic signatures of the bubbly flow characterised accurately the changes in flow regimes. However the transformation from acoustic frequencies to bubble radii underestimated the entrained bubble sizes and it did not predict the shape of bubble size probability distribution functions measured with intrusive conductivity probes. Although basic hydraulic characteristics were similar between model and prototype based upon a Froude similitude, observations of dimensionless bubble penetration depths and neutrally-buoyant particle residence times showed some discrepancies between model and prototype results.

40|$|Following large rain events, {{excess flow}} in {{sanitary}} sewers from inflow and infiltration (I/I) cause sanitary sewer overflows (SSO), resulting in significant problems for Pinellas County and the Tampa Bay area. Stormwater enters the sanitary sewers as inflow from improper or illegal surface connections, and groundwater enters {{the system as}} infiltration through cracks in subsurface infrastructure. This pilot {{study was designed to}} develop methods to separate and quantify the components of I/I and to build a predictive model using flowmeter and rainfall data. To identify surface inflow, daily wastewater production and groundwater infiltration patterns were filtered from the flow data, leaving a residual signal of random variation and possible inflow. The groundwater infiltration (as base infiltration, BI) was calculated using the Stevens-Schutzbach method, and daily wastewater flow curves were generated from dry weather flow (DWF) data. Filtered DWF values were used to construct a range of expected residuals, encompassing 95 % of the variability inherent in the system. Filtered wet weather flows were compared to this range, and values above the range were considered significant, indicating the presence of surface inflow. At all 3 flow meters in the pilot study site, no surface inflow was detected, and the I/I was attributed to groundwater infiltration (as BI). Flow data from 2 smaller sub-sewersheds within the greater sewershed allowed analysis of the spatial variability in BI and provided a method to focus in on the most problematic areas. In the sub-sewershed with the shallowest water table and most submerged sanitary sewer infrastructure, an average of 56 % of the average daily flow consisted of groundwater, compared to 44 % for the entire study site. Cross-correlation analysis suggests that rain impacts the water table for up to 9 days, with the highest impact 1 to 3 days after rain events, and the water table, in turn, impacts infiltration for up to 6 days. The highest correlation between rainfall and infiltration occurs 3 to 5 days after a rain event, which corroborates observations from Pinellas County that severe flows to the reclamation facility continue for 3 to 5 days after severe storms. These results were used to build a linear regression model to predict base infiltration (per mile of pipeline) during the wet season using the previous 7 days of daily rainfall depths. The model tended to under-predict infiltration response to large storm events with a R 2 value of 0. 52 and standard error of regression of 5. 3. The results of the study show that inflow can be detected using simple time series analysis instead of traditional smoke and dye testing. In this study site, however, groundwater infiltration is the only significant source of I/I. Additionally, water table and sewer <b>invert</b> <b>elevations</b> serve as useful indicators of potential sites of groundwater infiltration.
