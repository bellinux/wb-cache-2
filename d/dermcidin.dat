50|$|<b>Dermcidin,</b> {{also known}} as proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the DCD gene.

50|$|<b>Dermcidin</b> is a {{secreted}} {{protein that}} is subsequently processed into mature peptides of distinct biological activities. The C-terminal peptide is constitutively expressed in sweat and has antibacterial and antifungal activities.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate <b>dermcidin</b> expression in cell lines following simulation of tumour microenvironmental conditions and in a range of primary tumours. Tumour tissues were collected from patients with oesophageal (28 samples), gastric (20), pancreatic (five), bile duct (one) and prostatic (52) carcinomas as well as 30 benign tissue samples, for assessment of <b>dermcidin</b> mRNA levels using real-time PCR. <b>Dermcidin</b> expression was assessed in prostatic and pancreatic cancer cell lines, with and without induction of hypoxia or oxidative stress. <b>Dermcidin</b> mRNA expression was very low or absent in both unstressed and stressed prostate cell lines. None of the primary prostate tissue, benign or malignant, expressed <b>dermcidin</b> mRNA. Only two (4 %) of the gastro-oesophageal cancer samples expressed moderate quantities of <b>dermcidin</b> mRNA. However, three (60 %) of the pancreatic cancer samples and the single cholangiocarcinoma specimen had moderate/high levels of <b>dermcidin</b> expression. Of the two pancreatic cancer cell lines, one expressed <b>dermcidin</b> moderately but neither showed a response to hypoxia or oxidative stress. Expression of <b>dermcidin</b> in human primary tumours appears highly variable and is not induced substantially by hypoxia/oxidative stress in cell line model systems.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs) form {{an important}} part of the innate host defense. In contrast to most AMPs, human <b>dermcidin</b> has an anionic net charge. To investigate whether bacteria have developed specific mechanisms of resistance to <b>dermcidin,</b> we screened for mutants of the leading human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, with altered resistance to <b>dermcidin.</b> To that end, we constructed a plasmid for use in mariner-based transposon mutagenesis and developed a high-throughput cell viability screening method based on luminescence. In a large screen, we did not find mutants with strongly increased susceptibility to <b>dermcidin,</b> indicating that S. aureus has no specific mechanism of resistance to this AMP. Furthermore, we detected a mutation in a gene of unknown function that resulted in significantly increased resistance to <b>dermcidin.</b> The mutant strain had an altered membrane phospholipid pattern and showed decreased binding of <b>dermcidin</b> to the bacterial surface, indicating that <b>dermcidin</b> interacts with membrane phospholipids. The mode of this interaction was direct, as shown by assays of <b>dermcidin</b> binding to phospholipid preparations, and specific, as the resistance to other AMPs was not affected. Our findings indicate that <b>dermcidin</b> has an exceptional value for the human innate host defense and lend support to the idea that it evolved to evade bacterial resistance mechanisms targeted at the cationic character of most AMPs. Moreover, they suggest that the antimicrobial activity of <b>dermcidin</b> is dependent on the interaction with the bacterial membrane and might thus assist with the determination of the yet unknown mode of action of this important human AMP...|$|E

40|$|Tumour hypoxia {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to cause development of an aggressive tumour phenotype and is associated with increased patient mortality and poorer response to treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Previous studies have established that hypoxia exists within a nidus of prostate cancer. Based {{on the importance of}} the tumour microenvironment, especially hypoxia, in prostate cancer, the major aims of this thesis were to establish: (a) the role of a novel putative survival factor, <b>dermcidin,</b> in prostate cancer survival under hypoxia/oxidative stress; and (b) the effect of nitric oxide-donating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NO-NSAIDS), a new class of drugs, on the killing of prostate cancer cells subjected to hypoxia. A wide-range of confirmatory, cellular and molecular biology techniques were employed in this thesis. The PC- 3 hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cell line was used for the majority of studies as this cell line represents hormone-independent prostate cancer, treatment of which is currently palliative. Cell incubation at 0. 2 % oxygen for 48 hours was established as suitable conditions to stimulate the development of the hypoxia response. Upregulation of nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α protein was the main marker used to assess the hypoxia response. <b>Dermcidin</b> messenger RNA production was found to occur in a range of prostate cancer cell lines; was upregulated in cell lines by both hypoxic and oxidative stress; and found to act as a proliferation, survival and pro-invasion factor under hypoxia and oxidative stress in immortalised prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the portion of the <b>dermcidin</b> molecule responsible for the survival advantage was localised to the proteolysis-inducing factor core peptide subunit. However, subsequent analysis of primary cancer samples from prostate cancer patients revealed that <b>dermcidin</b> was not expressed in these tumours, although <b>dermcidin</b> mRNA was identified in analysis of other primary tumours. As such, the role of <b>dermcidin</b> in prostate cancer was not evaluated further in this thesis. Investigation of NO-sulindac (a NO-NSAID drug) in hypoxic PC- 3 cells showed that these agents were significantly more pro-necrotic, pro-apoptotic and anti-invasive than traditional, unnitrated sulindac. NO-sulindac was found to downregulate the hypoxia response mounted by PC- 3 cells under hypoxia via the Akt signalling pathway. Finally, analysis of the role of NO-sulindac in radiosensitising hypoxic PC- 3 cells showed that NO-sulindac caused significant radiosensitisation under normoxia, but particularly in hypoxic conditions. As such, NO-NSAIDs show great promise as neoadjuvant, concurrent and adjuvant treatments for patients with hypoxic prostate cancer. The findings of this thesis illustrate several potential novel strategies for treatment of hormone-independent prostate cancer. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dermcidin</b> (DCD) is a {{recently}} described antimicrobial peptide, which is constitutively expressed in eccrine sweat glands and transported via sweat to the epidermal surface. By postsecretory proteolytic processing in sweat the <b>dermcidin</b> protein {{gives rise to}} several truncated DCD peptides which differ in length and net charge. In {{order to understand the}} mechanism of antimicrobial activity, we analyzed the spectrum of activity of several naturally processed dermcidin-derived peptides, the secondary structure in different solvents, and the ability of these peptides to interact with or permeabilize the bacterial membrane. Interestingly, although all naturally processed DCD peptides can adopt an -helical conformation in solvents, they have a diverse and partially overlapping spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. This indicates that the net charge and the secondary structure of the peptides are not important for the toxic activity. Furthermore, using carboxyfluorescein-loaded liposomes, membrane permeability studies and electron microscopy we investigated whether DCD peptides are able to permeabilize bacterial membranes.

Plasma concentrations of HNP, <b>dermcidin</b> and AD-related Th 2 chemokines CCL 17, CCL 22 and CCL 27 were significantly elevated in AD patients compared with controls (all p < 0. 05). Plasma concentrations of CCL 27 and CCL 22 were found to correlate positively with SCORing atopic dermatitis (SCORAD), objective SCORAD, % area affected, lichenification and disease intensity, and CCL 27 also correlated positively with pruritus in AD patients (all p < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{eccrine gland}} {{is one of}} the major {{cutaneous}} appendages and secretes sweat. Its principal function is thermoregulation during exposure to a hot environment or physical exercise. In addition to this function, we show that LL- 37, a member of cathelicidin family of anti-microbial peptides, is expressed in sweat. LL- 37 protein and mRNA was seen in the eccrine structures of normal human skin by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. LL- 37 was localized to both the eccrine gland and sweat ductal epithelial cells, whereas <b>dermcidin,</b> a previously described natural antibiotic in sweat, was expressed only in the gland itself. The anti-microbial activity of LL- 37 and <b>dermcidin</b> against various bacteria in the sweat ionic environment was demonstrated by solution colony forming assay using synthetic peptides, and in sweat obtained from normal volunteers. These results indicate that cathelicidin is secreted in human sweat, has potent anti-microbial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and can, after processing from the preproform, provide a barrier for protection against infection.

Accordingly, we analyzed the eccrine sweat duct involvement in the mechanism of vesicle formation in PPP. Dermatoscopy showed that PPP vesicles are located {{on the top of the}} ridges but not in the furrows. The sweat secretion in the lesional area was much lower than that in the nonlesional area, with or without pain stimulation to induce sweating. Immunostaining of horizontal sections of the lesions using antibodies against gross cystic disease fluid protein- 15 (GCDFP- 15) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) showed that these markers were localized in the cells lining the intraepidermal vesicles.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{estimated}} that about 40 % of the Indian population are infected with tuberculosis (TB) and that ∼ 3, 000, 000 people die {{as a result of}} TB annually.

Immunolabeling can be used to extract information about the donor of the fingermark and it can also act as a fingermark development tool in sequence with the standard fingermark development techniques. However, before immunolabeling can be used in forensic practice more information on the possibilities and limitations of this technique is required. In this study, our aim was to investigate if immunolabeling is compatible with standard development protocols (indanedione-zinc, indanedione-zinc followed by ninhydrin spraying, physical developer, cyanoacrylate fuming, cyanoacrylate followed by basic yellow staining, lumicyanoacrylate fuming and polycyanoacrylate fuming).

One of these proteins, <b>dermcidin</b> (DCD), and its interaction with Nck 1, was further validated in vitro. GST-pull down assay revealed that Nck 1 SH 2 domain binds to the phosphotyrosine residue at position 20 (Y 20) of the DCD.

40|$|Using serial {{analysis}} of gene expression (SAGE), we identified a SAGE tag that was present only in invasive breast carcinomas and their lymph node metastases. The transcript corresponding to this SAGE tag, <b>dermcidin</b> (DCD), encodes a secreted protein normally expressed {{only in the}} pons {{of the brain and}} sweat glands. Array comparative genomic hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical analyses determined that DCD is overexpressed in ≈ 10 % of invasive breast carcinomas; in some cases its overexpression is coupled with a focal copy number gain of its locus at 12 q 13. 1, and its expression is associated with advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis. Expression of DCD in breast cancer cells promotes cell growth and survival and reduces serum dependency. Putative high- and low-affinity receptors for DCD are present on the cell surface of breast carcinomas and neurons of the brain. Based on these data we hypothesize that DCD {{may play a role in}} tumorigenesis by means of enhancing cell growth and survival in a subset of breast carcinomas...|$|E
40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to isolate and identify proteins of the granules of neutrophils of the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii. Stimulation with PMA, Ionomycin and calcium resulted in exocytosis of neutrophil granules as demonstrated with electron microscopy. However proteomic analysis using two dimensional gel electrophoresis, in-gel trypsin digestion followed by nano liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) failed to identify any anticipated granule proteins in the reaction supernatants. Subsequent use of differential centrifugation and lysis followed by the application of the same proteomic analysis approach resulted in the isolation and confident identification of 39 proteins, many of which are known to be present in the granules of neutrophils of eutherian mammals or play a role in degranulation. These proteins notably consisted of the known antimicrobials, myeloperoxidase (MPO), serine proteinase, <b>dermcidin,</b> lysozyme and alkaline phosphatase. A number of important known antimicrobials, however, were not detected and these include defensins and cathelicidins. This is the first report of the neutrophil granule proteins of any marsupial and complements previous reports on the cytosolic proteins. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of human body fluids or tissues through mRNA-based profiling is very useful for forensic investigations. Previous {{studies have shown}} mRNA biomarkers are effective to identify the origin of biological samples. In this study, we selected 16 tissue specific biomarkers to evaluate their specificities and sensitivities for human body fluids and tissues identification, including porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), hemoglobin beta (HBB) and Glycophorin A (GLY) for circulatory blood, protamine 2 (PRM 2) and transglutaminase 4 (TGM 4) for semen, mucin 4 (MUC 4) and human beta defensin 1 (HBD 1) for vaginal secretion, matrix metalloproteinases 7 and 11 (MMP 7 and MMP 11) for menstrual blood, keratin 4 (KRT 4) for oral mucosa, loricrin (LOR) and cystatin 6 (CST 6) for skin, histatin 3 (HTN 3) for saliva, statherin (STATH) for nasal secretion, <b>dermcidin</b> (DCD) for sweat and uromodulin (UMOD) for urine. The above mentioned ten common forensic body fluids or tissues {{were used in the}} evaluation. Based on the evaluation, a reverse transcription (RT) PCR multiplex assay, XCYR 1, whic...|$|E
40|$|A {{process of}} forming new blood vessels is {{necessary}} for tumour viability and expansion. Without vasculature, tumour stops growing at a size of millimeters. Some tumours, however, undergo an angiogenic switch and start to build up their own vascular architecture. The rate of apoptosis then decreases and the tumour becomes invasive. There are many factors that control the process of physiological angiogenesis. These {{might or might not}} relate to tumour tissue as well. Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII; EC 3. 4. 17. 21) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with two known enzymatic activities. GCPII expression is upregulated in prostate cancer and also highly expressed in tumour-associated neovasculature even though none of these enzymatic functions was observed on the endothelium. Although numerous researches suggested that GCPII might serve as a receptor, no natural ligand has been identified yet. Preliminary experiments performed in our laboratory indicated some proteins to be possible natural ligands of GCPII. Therefore, we chose one of them- <b>dermcidin,</b> cloned and expressed this protein in mammalian cells. We investigated its possible interaction with GCPII introducing new detection system utilizing FLAG-tag however, {{we were not able to}} approve neither disapprove its interaction in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Mammals protect {{themselves}} from inflammation triggered by microorganisms through secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). One mechanism by which AMPs kill bacterial cells is perforating their membranes. Membrane interactions and pore formation were investigated for α-helical AMPs leading to the formulation of three basic mechanistic models: the barrel stave, toroidal, and carpet model. One major drawback of these models is their simplicity. They {{do not reflect the}} real in vitro and in vivo conditions. To challenge and refine these models using a structure-based approach we set out to investigate how human cathelicidin (LL- 37) and <b>dermcidin</b> (DCD) interact with membranes. Both peptides are α-helical and their structures have been solved at atomic resolution. DCD assembles in solution into a hexameric pre-channel complex before the actual membrane targeting and integration step can occur, and the complex follows a deviation of the barrel stave model. LL- 37 interacts with lipids and shows the formation of oligomers generating fibril-like supramolecular structures on membranes. LL- 37 further assembles into transmembrane pores with yet unknown structure expressing a deviation of the toroidal pore model. Both of their specific targeting mechanisms will be discussed {{in the context of the}} “old” models propagated in the literature...|$|E
