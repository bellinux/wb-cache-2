Two alternative econometric strategies are followed. First, in a single equation framework the interest rate sensitivity of stock returns is tested, allowing for time-varying conditional volatility. Then, 'pooling ' information across stocks, a system-theoretic approach is employed where explicitly <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> is exploited. The findings from both methods were consistent providing evidence for significant sensitivity of bank stock returns to interest rate movements.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} cross-correlations <b>of</b> 67 <b>stock</b> market indices {{in the past}} 5 years. In order to capture the {{interaction}} <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> markets, we propose to take a complex network approach to analyzing the <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> the individual <b>stock</b> markets. Specifically, stock markets are considered as network nodes, and the network links (weights of links) are defined by the cross-correlations between market indices {{over a period of}} time (time window). Thus, the resulting network provides information about the <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> individual markets, with the network links representing the extents to which the markets are correlated. If we allow the time window to move in forward time and construct a network for each time window over a long period of time, we are able to capture the dynamics of the network. In our study, all networks are constructed from raw data of market indices, and our aim is to investigate how network properties can be used to infer market behavior. By examining the variation of the network parameters as time elapses, we show that <b>stock</b> markets <b>of</b> different countries have time-varying interaction, and that developed markets tend to demonstrate similar behavior while emerging markets are statistically independent of each other. Furthermore, we observe synchronization in the network <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> markets, which is an important universal property observed in many physical and man-made networks.

Using daily data on stock prices we analyze price and volatility spillovers in a vector autoregression-dynamic conditional correlations-multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedacticity (VAR-DCC-MVGARCH) framework. This approach enables us to measure {{the extent to which}} these equity markets are interrelated by taking into account the time-varying variance-covariance structure. Since the major trade partners of Turkey are EU countries it is of interest to examine any changes in the structure of volatility spillovers. To this end, we analyze the effects of customs union agreement between Turkey and EU on the dynamic <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> markets by dividing the sample into two periods. The analysis reveals that, although they are small in magnitude as compared to their counterparts in developed markets, the conditional correlations can be assumed to be constant in the pre-customs union agreement while it fluctuates significantly in the post-customs union agreement. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> {{markets in the}} Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany and the U. S. between 1994 and 2010. Its aim is to prove or disprove {{the hypothesis that the}} correlation <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> markets is growing. Furthermore, it aims to determine whether the benefits of international diversification are important in the 21 st century. The first part defines the basic terms related to this issue. The next section describes the historical development <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> markets and major stock indexes. The following is the longest chapter, which deals with the dependence of equity markets. The degree of dependence between markets is measured by correlation coefficients. In order to calculate the correlation coefficients 3 methods were used: 12 -month, 24 -month moving window and the exponential weighting. It was confirmed that correlation increases in periods of high market volatility and if the equity markets go up. Correlation decreases in periods of low market volatility and if the stock markets go down. There is a long-term increasing trend in the correlation development. The last chapter describes the recent study of P. Christoffersen, V. Errunza, K. Jacobs, and X. Jin, which also deals with this issue. Although the authors used more complex mathematical and statistical methods, their conclusions are similar. At the end of this chapter there is a study dealing with the benefits of international diversification in 2005 and 2009.

40|$|Purpose – Economic cross-linkages and the {{increased}} co-movement of asset prices across international markets are important outcomes {{as the result of}} globalization. Hereby, the nature <b>of</b> international <b>stock</b> markets {{and the extent to which}} the 1997 - 1998 East Asian turmoil had affected the market relationship of five countries of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN- 5) remain as probing questions. Design/methodology/approach – We resort to the standard time series econometrics analysis. These include the unit root, cointegration and the Granger causality tests. Hereby, further empirical analyzes is conducted upon two sub-periods of interest: (1) pre-crisis period from 1987 : 1 to 1997 : 7 and (2) post-crisis period from 1997 : 8 to 2007 : 12. This is to allow for possible transitional motion leading to and departing from the crisis. Findings – Using an array of econometrics analysis upon the stock price volatility series, we found partial market integration for the pre-crisis; whereas in the post-crisis, complete integration prevails. Hence, the financial meltdown in 1997 is said to be a contagion led crisis as markets integrate well off after the crisis than prior to it. Nonetheless, long run portfolio asset diversification benefits across the ASEAN- 5 basin are reduced as markets are integrated in both the pre- and post-crisis. Originality/value – The paper is of value by showing to uncover the issue <b>of</b> <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> market integration focusing on the ASEAN- 5 economies. The formation of the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA- 1998) parallel with the establishment of a developed ASEAN Index-Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) regional index is viable to foster deeper regional market convergence. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> fifteen world indices {{including}} an Indian market index {{in terms of}} return and volatility spillover effect. <b>Interdependence</b> <b>of</b> Indian <b>stock</b> market with other fourteen world markets in terms of long run integration, short run dependence (return spillover) and volatility spillover are investigated. These markets are that of are Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong-Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, Taiwan, United Kingdom and United States. Long run and short run integration is examined through Johansen cointegration techniques and Granger causality test respectively. Vector autoregressive model (VAR 15) is used to estimate the conditional return spillover among these indices in which all fifteen indices are considered together. The effect of same day return in explaining the return spillover is also modeled using univariate models. Volatility spillover is estimated through AR-GARCH in which residuals from the index return is used as explanatory variable in GARCH equation. Return and volatility spillover between Indian and other markets are modeled through bivariate VAR and multivariate GARCH (BEKK) model respectively. It is found that there is greater regional influence among Asian markets in return and volatility than with European and US. Japanese market, which is first to open, is affected by US and European markets only and affects most of the Asian Markets. Also, high degree of correlation among European indices namely FTSE, CAC and DAX is observed. US market is influenced by both Asian and European markets. Specific to Indian context, {{it is found that}} Indian market is not cointegrated with rest of the world except Indonesia. This may provide diversification benefits for potential investors. However, strong short run interdependence is found between Indian markets and most of the other markets. Indian and other markets like US, Japan, Korea, and Canada positively affect each others conditional returns significantly. Indian market also has significant effect on Malaysia, Pakistan, and Singapore return. This study found that there is significant positive volatility spillover from other markets to Indian market, mainly from Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, and Singapore and US market. Indian market affects negatively the volatility of US and Pakistan. It {{is interesting to note that}} Chinese and Pakistan markets are less integrated with other Asian, European and US markets. ...|$|R
