5|$|As {{well as the}} patient, {{the partner}} of an injured person {{frequently}} needs support and counseling. It can help with adjustment to a new relationship dynamic and self-image (such as being placed {{in the role of}} caretaker) or with stresses that arise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> relationship. Frequently, partners of injured people must contend with feelings like guilt, anger, anxiety, and exhaustion while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses. Counseling aims to strengthen the relationship by improving communication and trust.|$|E
5|$|Paula Kamen, {{author of}} Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution, placed the {{increasing}} {{popularity of the}} Magic Wand as an influential factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> revolution which took place {{towards the end of}} the 20th century. Cathy Winks and Anne Semans, coauthors of The Good Vibrations Guide to Sex, recommended the Magic Wand for use both during foreplay and intercourse and noted couples could feel pleasure through the device together at the same time. Wendy Caster wrote in the 2003 edition of The Lesbian Sex Book that lesbians have enjoyed using the Magic Wand due to its ability to concentrate powerful vibration on the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around {{the roots of}} the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S.spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine, Pitch Pine, and Loblolly Pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine, Chinese White Pine, Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White Pine. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July–September), although they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H.completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold {{on the surface of the}} cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.|$|E

25|$|Sexual abuse, {{is defined}} by World Health Organization as any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, {{unwanted}} sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person’s sexuality using coercion. It also includes obligatory inspections for virginity and female genital mutilation. Aside from initiation of the sexual act through physical force, sexual abuse occurs {{if a person is}} unable to understand the nature or condition of the act, unable to decline participation, or unable to communicate unwillingness to engage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> act. This could be because of underage immaturity, illness, disability, or the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or due to intimidation or pressure.|$|E
25|$|The Renaissance {{tradition}} of recondite emblem books had, {{in the hands}} of the 17th-century Dutch – almost universally literate in the vernacular, but mostly without education in the classics – turned into the popularist and highly moralistic works of Jacob Cats, Roemer Visscher, and others, often based in popular proverbs. The illustrations to these are often quoted directly in paintings, and since the start of the 20th century art historians have attached proverbs, sayings and mottoes to a great number of genre works. Another popular source of meaning is visual puns using the great number of Dutch slang terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> area: the vagina could be represented by a lute (luit) or stocking (kous), and sex by a bird (vogelen), among many other options, and purely visual symbols such as shoes, spouts, and jugs and flagons on their side.|$|E
