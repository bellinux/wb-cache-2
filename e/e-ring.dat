40|$|Cell-specific {{activation}} of transcription factor σF during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis requires {{the formation of}} the polar septum and the activity of a serine phosphatase (SpoIIE) located in the septum. The SpoIIE phosphatase indirectly activates σF by dephosphorylating a protein (SpoIIAA-P) in the pathway that controls the activity of the transcription factor. By use of a SpoIIE–GFP fusion protein in time-course and time-lapse experiments and by direct visualization of septa in living cells, we show that SpoIIE is present in the predivisional sporangium, where it often localizes near both cell poles in structures known as <b>E-rings.</b> We also present evidence consistent with the view that SpoIIE is present in both progeny cells after polar division. These findings are incompatible with a model for the control of σF activity in which the phosphatase is simply sequestered to one cell. Instead, we conclude that the function of SpoIIE is subject to regulation, and we present evidence that this occurs in two stages. The first stage, which involves the phosphatase function of SpoIIE, depends on the cell division protein FtsZ and could correspond to the FtsZ-dependent assembly of SpoIIE into <b>E-rings.</b> The second stage occurs after the dephosphorylation of SpoIIAA-P and is dependent on the later-acting, cell-division protein DivIC. Evidence based on the use of modified and mutant forms of the phosphatase protein indicates that SpoIIE blocks the capacity of unphosphorylated SpoIIAA to activate σF until formation of the polar septum is completed...|$|R

30|$|Toxoplasma gondii is an {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite {{of which}} infection {{can result in}} serious symptoms for fetuses or people who have weakened immune system. In our effort to discover novel anti-toxoplasma substances from tree barks, only outer bark extract from Quercus crispula Blume (mizunara) was revealed to show potent anti-toxoplasma activity. Isolation of the active principles was performed to identify three pentacyclic triterpenoids, namely 29 -norlupane- 3, 20 -dione, oleanolic acid acetate and ursolic acid acetate. These structures were determined by combining a series of spectral data, computational simulation and synthetic approach. All isolated compounds exhibited notable activities at IC 50 of 6.8 – 24.4  μM and high selectivities against the parasite. The structure–activity relationship study conducted to probe key structure(s) indicated {{that the lack of}} free hydroxyl group at 3 -position highly contributes to both the titer of activity and the selectivity. Moreover, skeleton and functionalities of <b>E-rings</b> were also suggested to affect to the activity. The present study demonstrated not only that the extract from Q. crispula Blume could be a promising source of toxoplasmacidal agent, but also that related extractive triterpenoids can be modified to furnish anti-toxoplasma activity.|$|R

2500|$|The {{surface of}} Tethys {{has a number}} of {{large-scale}} features distinguished by their color and sometimes brightness. The trailing hemisphere gets increasingly red and dark as the anti-apex of motion is approached. This darkening is responsible for the hemispheric albedo asymmetry mentioned above. The leading hemisphere also reddens slightly as the [...] of the motion is approached, although without any noticeable darkening. Such a bifurcated color pattern results in the existence of a bluish band between hemispheres following a great circle that runs through the poles. This coloration and darkening of the Tethyan surface is typical for Saturnian middle-sized satellites. Its origin may be related to a deposition of bright ice particles from the <b>E-ring</b> onto the leading hemispheres and dark particles coming from outer satellites on the trailing hemispheres. The darkening of the trailing hemispheres can also be caused by the impact of plasma from the magnetosphere of Saturn, which co-rotates with the planet.|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} camptothecin (CPT) derivative topotecan (TPT, hycamtin, NSC 609699) is {{a potent}} anticancer drug which realizes its activity through the stabilization of the DNA-topoisomerase I (topi) cleavable complex [1]. For many years, the CPTs were described as a unique antitumor compounds exhibiting no chemical reactivity towards DNA alone or the topi alone. In 1998 the mixed observations of the possible interaction between CPTs with the DNA have been reported [2, 3]. This work presents the first structural data on the TPT interaction with the calf thymus (CT) DNA without topi {{as well as with}} the nucleosides in solution. Raman spectroscopy reveals direct interactions between the molecular moieties of the E- and D-rings of TPT and dG and dl nucleosides. It should be noted that no any interactions of the quinoline part of the TPT chromophore (rings A and B) were detected within its TPT-nucleoside complexes.

40|$|Saturn's diffuse E ring {{consists}} of many tiny (micron and sub-micron) grains of water ice distributed between {{the orbits of}} Mimas and Titan. Various gravitational and non-gravitational forces perturb these particles' orbits, causing the ring's local particle density to vary noticeably with distance from the planet, height above the ring-plane, hour angle and time. Using remote-sensing data obtained by the Cassini spacecraft in 2005 and 2006, we investigate the <b>E-ring's</b> three-dimensional structure {{during a time when}} the Sun illuminated the rings from the south at high elevation angles (> 15 degrees). These observations show that the ring's vertical thickness grows with distance from Enceladus' orbit and its peak brightness density shifts from south to north of Saturn's equator plane with increasing distance from the planet. These data also reveal a localized depletion in particle density near Saturn's equatorial plane around Enceladus' semi-major axis. Finally, variations are detected in the radial brightness profile and the vertical thickness of the ring as a function of longitude relative to the Sun. Possible physical mechanisms and processes that may be responsible for some of these structures include solar radiation pressure, variations in the ambient plasma, and electromagnetic perturbations associated with Saturn's shadow.

They can be toxic to humans if consumed in high concentrations causing gastrointestinal disturbances. METHODS: The structural characterization of the major spirosolane glycoalkaloids, solasonine, solamargine, -tomatine and dehydrotomatine, were investigated by positive electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled with a hybrid linear ion trap (LIT) and Fouriertransform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of spirosolane glycoalkaloids was performed by both collision-induced dissociation (CID) within the linear ion trap and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) in conjunction with the FTICR cell. RESULTS: Several common product ions were observed, generated by losses of sugar moiety or aglycon fragmentation in B- or <b>E-rings,</b> that can provide information on the accurate mass of aglycon and the primary sequence and branching of the oligosaccharide chains. Thanks to the multistage CID it was possible to understand the fragmentation pathways and thanks to high resolution of IRMPD-FTICR the elemental composition of product ions was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Because the investigated tandem mass spectra data were acquired with high mass accuracy, unambiguous interpretation and determination of the chemical composition for the majority of detected fragment ions were feasible. From these data, generalized fragmentation pathways were proposed, providing guidance for the characterization of unknown glycoalkaloids in plants...|$|R
