50|$|The {{school was}} built in 1906 in the Wallingford {{neighborhood}} to handle {{the growth in the}} area. It opened in 1907 and until 1971 was a three-year senior high school (grades 10-11-12, sophomores/juniors/seniors), thereafter a four-year high school with grades 9 to 12. Lincoln High closed as a school in its own right after 74 years in 1981, and the building has been used several times since as a temporary <b>holding</b> <b>location</b> for other Seattle public schools as their own buildings underwent renovations / remodelings / rebuildings. The Lincoln building housed Ballard High School in 1997-1999 while their current facility was being built, then the Latona Elementary School (1999-2000) and Bryant Elementary School (2000-2001) while their respective buildings were also renovated. It next housed Roosevelt High School in 2004-2006 and Garfield High School in 2006-2008 while their respective buildings were being renovated and upgraded. September 2009 to June 2010, Lincoln was the home to the Hamilton International Middle School while the Hamilton building was renovated and housed the recently split APP North middle school cohort for one year with Hamilton in 2009-2010. McDonald Elementary occupied the old Lincoln building during the 2010 and 2011 school years while their building was being renovated. Beginning in September 2011, the Lincoln structure became the home of the elementary Highly Capable Cohort, for students who live in {{the north end of the}} city (including Queen Anne and Magnolia.) In September 2012, the site was renamed APP at Lincoln (now Cascadia Elementary) for the interim. Cascadia Elementary and the north-end Highly Capable Cohort will relocate to a newly constructed permanent location on the Wilson-Pacific campus in Fall of 2017. The old Lincoln High building will then undergo its own renovations and become an Attendance Area / zoned neighborhood comprehensive public high school once again in 2019.|$|E

40|$|The Ground Management Program at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) aims to {{leverage}} {{the availability of}} comprehensive airport surface surveillance data and airline schedule information to better manage the taxi-out process, reduce taxi times, and improve efficiency. During periods when departure demand exceeds capacity, departing aircraft are held at the gate or another <b>holding</b> <b>location,</b> and released to the runway in time to join a short departure queue before taking off. As a result, aircraft absorb delay with engines off, and decrease their fuel burn, emissions, and engine maintenance costs. This paper evaluates data from before and after departure metering was initiated at JFK, to assess its impacts. The results show that airport performance has improved, and that the departure metering is responsible for {{a significant portion of}} the improvements. The paper also finds that the new, more automated, Ground Management Program that was implemented in April 2012 has continued to yield significant benefits. The average taxi-out time savings at JFK due to departure metering in the summer of 2012 is estimated to be about 1. 5 - 2. 7 minutes per flight...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We coupled {{physiological}} biopsy and positional telemetry {{to examine}} survival to reach spawning grounds in re-lation to water temperature, timing, physiological condition, and <b>holding</b> <b>location</b> (river or lake) in adult migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). We tracked 83 fish across a large temperature range (13. 5 – 21. 5 8 C), which included record highs. Only early-timed migrants that held in Harrison Lake survived to reach spawning grounds (16 %, or n = 4). Normal-timed fish, those that migrated at historically observed times, survived {{at higher levels}} if they held in Harrison River (72 %, or n = 18). Mortalities were identified on the bottoms of both the lake and river. Hypothetical degree-day (DD) ac-cumulation revealed that early-timed river fish would have greatly surpassed (~ 800 8 C DD) a critical disease threshold value (~ 500 8 C DD). There {{was no difference in}} hypothetical DD accumulation between normal-timed river fish and early-timed lake fish. Early-timed sockeye had elevated physiological stress (e. g., plasma lactate, glucose, and hematocrit), which may have contributed to high levels of mortality. By using lakes as thermal refugia, early-timed fish likely reduce rates of disease development and may better recover from physiological stress associated with high encountered tempera-tures.

40|$|Pakistani {{farmers are}} facing many constraints, of which {{shortage}} of irrigation {{water is the}} major one. On-Farm Water Management Department has introduced Water Users' Associations (WUAs) throughout the country to operate, maintain and re-habilitate the water distribution system in an efficient and effective manner. Moreover, WUAs are also responsible for providing logistic support and communication bridge between the water users and the Govt. Departments. The present study deals with {{the importance of the}} WUAs for the efficient management of irrigation water. The study deals exclusively with the prevailing contingencies which may support or hinder farmers' participation through WUAs for the management of irrigation water. Thus the main focus of the study was on the analysis of the prevailing formal and informal interventions at farm level for the management of irrigation water through the active participation of water users. The socio-economic regulatory patterns such as age, education, land <b>holding,</b> <b>location</b> of land with respect to watercourse and 'biradary' (caste) play a dominant role in determining the direction and extent of activities of the WUAs. The institutional, socio-political and cultural factors were considered to be the main determinants of effective functioning of WUAs within the context of watercourse improvement/maintenance. The present study was carried out in all tehsils of district Sargodha in central Punjab. From each tehsil, one markaz was selected randomly. From each selected markaz, five improved watercourses were selected at random and from each selected improved watercourse, fifteen water users were selected randomly for interview. The data were collected through validated and pre-tested interview schedule. The data were analyzed with the help of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The results show that a large majority of the respondents rated WUAs' leadership as good, while slightly more than onefifth of the respondents were of the view that leadership was excellent. About half of the respondents provided both cash and labor as per requirement in the watercourse improvement. A vast majority of the respondents cleaned their watercourses by joint operation and was highly satisfied with the interval/frequency and quality of watercourse cleaning. Rivalry among different 'briadaries' (castes), water thefts and non-cooperative behavior of some farmers were the main causes of conflicts among the water users. All the respondents regarded 'biradary' (caste) heads' interventions to resolve the farmers' complaints. Lack of finance on the part of small/poor farmers, lack of interest on the part of big landlords and lack of unity among the water users were the main problems in the effective functioning of WUAs before the improvement of the watercourse. Majority of the respondents was highly satisfied with the contribution of WUAs in resolving the disputes and thought that WUAs never listened to the complaintee only while taking decision on various issues but listened to both the parties besides judging the situation at site with the view that level of effectiveness of WUAs in resolving the complaints was high. Participation of water users in watercourse improvement/maintenance got the highest score while productivity enhancement as a result of watercourse improvement/maintenance was ranked at the top. A large majority of the respondents thought that WUAs will continue to play effective role in future. There existed a highly significant relationship between the land holding of the respondents and their level of satisfaction in watercourse improvement activities. A highly significant relationship was found between the location of land of the respondents and their level of participation in watercourse improvement activities. There existed a highly significant relationship between age of the respondents and the frequency of watercourse cleaning...|$|E

Numerical studies which utilise dynamic programming and simulation testify to the benefits of using transshipments proactively. In comparison to a purely reactive approach to transshipment, service levels are improved while a reduction in safety stock levels is achieved. The aggregate costs incurred in managing the system are significantly reduced, especially so for large networks facing high levels of demand. ...|$|R
