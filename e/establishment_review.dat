We study several alternatives for implementing TCP connection <b>establishment,</b> <b>reviewing</b> approaches taken by existing TCP stacks as well as proposing new mechanisms to improve server throughput and reduce client response times under overload. We implement some of these mechanisms in Linux and evaluate their performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that connection establishment mechanisms that eliminate the TCP-level retransmission of connection attempts by clients can increase server throughput by up to 40 % and reduce client response times by two orders of magnitude. Additionally we evaluate the cost of supporting half-closed connections at the server and assess the impact of an abortive release of connections by clients on the throughput of an overloaded server. We observe that mechanisms that do not support half-closed connections additionally improve server throughput by more than 15 %. I...|$|R
40|$|Child support {{payments}} {{have the}} ability to influence the economic wellbeing of single parent families on low incomes. Erratic and unstable child support payments, experienced by a significant proportion of low income child support recipients, can greatly influence the everyday experiences and living conditions of these families. As such, it is imperative that child support policies are explored in order to identify their potential intended and unintended effects. The exploration of child support will be specific to single parent families. As such, discussion will commence with the identification of this population group. The theoretical perspective that will be incorporated into the exploration of child support will then be identified and discussed. Child support will first be explored in terms of its history and development within Australia. The historical analysis of the Australian Child Support Scheme will include its initial <b>establishment,</b> <b>reviews,</b> recommendations and alterations, and the current child support system.

The article then discusses what interpretation of the Establishment Clause should be controlling: strict-separationism, nonpreferentialism, enhanced federalism, or the incorporation doctrine. Next, the article details what is wrong with modern establishment clause jurisprudence, namely, the Court’s inconsistent application of different tests to assess government action under the <b>Establishment</b> Clause and <b>reviews</b> the Lemon test, the endorsement test, the neutrality test, and the coercion test. Following this discussion, the article notes how the Supreme Court’s most recent Establishment Clause case, Town of Greece v. Galloway, failed to clarify any of the above doctrinal confusion. Finally, the article concludes by suggesting steps to improve clarity in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. It suggests 1) that the Court take steps to remedy its doctrinal jumble by clearly declaring a definitive test as well as overruling incorrect precedent and 2) that the Court adjust the level of scrutiny applied in these cases to rationale basis or intermediate scrutiny...|$|R

First, a constrained demand is obtained by using an approach based on historical missions. Then, a complementary unconstrained demand is estimated through an approach associating a set of desired force elements to each CFDS mission. By contrasting these demands to the CAF establishment, key shortfalls in personnel occupation groups can be identified...|$|R
