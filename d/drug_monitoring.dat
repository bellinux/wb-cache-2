5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and <b>drug</b> <b>monitoring.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium {{recommends}} avoiding amitriptyline {{in patients}} who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk {{for a lack of}} efficacy and side effects, respectively.

A reduction in starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. If use of amitriptyline is warranted, therapeutic <b>drug</b> <b>monitoring</b> is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing initial dose in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} the pattern of usage of clozapine in Christchurch, New Zealand, including daily dose, indication and use of <b>drug</b> concentration <b>monitoring.</b> Method: Patients (n 353) were identified retrospectively from the phar-macy computer system. Data gathered included patient demographics, the daily clozapine dose and the number of occasions that clozapine <b>drug</b> concentration <b>monitoring</b> occurred. In addition, each psychiatrist who had prescribed clozapine was surveyed, regarding their indications for the use of clozapine and their use of clozapine <b>drug</b> concentration <b>monitoring.</b> Results: The majority (63 %) of patients on clozapine were male. The mean age of the patients was 43 years (range 1588 years). The mean daily dose of clozapine was 325 mg (range 12. 5900 mg). Patients over the age of 65 years were on a significantly lower dose (mean 143 mg, 95 % CI 103183 mg) compared with those under 65 years of age (mean 350 mg, 95 % CI 330 370 mg). The median duration of treatment on clozapine was 4 years. Fifty-one percent of patients had undergone <b>drug</b> concentration <b>monitoring,</b> the majority on multiple occasions. In females, increasing age correlated with an increase in dose-corrected plasma clozapine concentrations (r 20. 29, pB 0. 001). This was not demonstrated in the male population. Of the psychiatrists surveyed, 44 % prescribed clozapine for unlicensed indications and 79 % used clozapine <b>drug</b> concentration <b>monitoring</b> in their patients. This was most commonly performed to assess compliance or confirm toxicity. Conclusions: The mean daily dose of clozapine of 325 mg was similar to that found in other studies. An age-related decline in dose was observed, probably due to different indications, with many of the elderly patients receiving clozapine for Parkinsonian related symptoms. There was also an age-related decline apparent in clearance in females. Clozapine was often used for unlicensed indications, and a clear majority of psychiatrists use <b>drug</b> concentration <b>monitoring...</b>|$|R
25|$|As of 2015, {{prescription}} <b>drug</b> <b>monitoring</b> programs {{exist in}} every state but one. These programs allow pharmacists and prescribers to access patients’ prescription histories {{in order to identify}} suspicious use. However, a survey of US physicians published in 2015 found that only 53% of doctors used these programs, while 22% were not aware that the programs were available to them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was tasked with establishing and publishing a new guideline, and was heavily lobbied. In 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published its Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, recommending that opioids only be used when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks, and then used at the lowest effective dosage, with avoidance of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use whenever possible.|$|E
25|$|Patients with MDR-TB {{should be}} {{isolated}} in negative-pressure rooms, if possible. Patients with MDR-TB {{should not be}} accommodated on the same ward as immunosuppressed patients (HIV infected patients, or patients on immunosuppressive drugs). Careful monitoring of compliance with treatment {{is crucial to the}} management of MDR-TB (and some physicians insist on hospitalisation if only for this reason). Some physicians will insist that these patients are isolated until their sputum is smear negative, or even culture negative (which may take many months, or even years). Keeping these patients in hospital for weeks (or months) on end may be a practical or physical impossibility and the final decision depends on the clinical judgement of the physician treating that patient. The attending physician should make full use of therapeutic <b>drug</b> <b>monitoring</b> (particularly of the aminoglycosides) both to monitor compliance and to avoid toxic effects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Drug {{development}} and personalized therapy require accurate and frequent {{monitoring of the}} metabolic response by living tissues to treatments. In case of high risk side effects, e. g. therapies with interfering anti-cancer molecule cocktails, direct monitoring of the patient’s drugs metabolism is essential as the metabolic pathways efficacy is highly variable on a patient-bypatient basis. Currently, there are no fully mature point-of-care bio-sensing systems for <b>drugs</b> metabolism <b>monitoring</b> directly in blood. The aim of the paper is to investigate solutions to develop point-of-care systems for <b>drugs</b> <b>monitoring</b> in personalized therapy. P 450 enzymes are the considered probe molecules as they are key proteins directly involved in drugs metabolism of humans. Sensitivity improvement is ensured by means of enzyme integration onto electrodes structured with carbon nanotubes.

Results show that the proposed circuitry is suitable for the aim and confirm that nanotubes are detection enhancers. I...|$|R
2500|$|Attempts to {{establish}} rates of vancomycin-induced ototoxicity {{are even more}} difficult due to the scarcity of quality evidence. The current consensus is that clearly related cases of vancomycin ototoxicity are rare. The association between vancomycin serum levels and ototoxicity is also uncertain. While cases of ototoxicity {{have been reported in}} patients whose vancomycin serum level exceeded 80nbsp&µg/ml, cases have been reported in patients with therapeutic levels, as well. Thus, whether therapeutic <b>drug</b> <b>monitoring</b> of vancomycin for the purpose of maintaining [...] "therapeutic" [...] levels will prevent ototoxicity also remains unproven.|$|E
2500|$|Plasma level {{monitoring}} of vancomycin is necessary {{due to the}} drug's biexponential distribution, intermediate hydrophilicity, and potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially in populations with poor renal function and/or increased propensity to bacterial infection. Vancomycin activity {{is considered to be}} time-dependent; that is, antimicrobial activity depends on the duration that the serum drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [...] of the target organism. Thus, peak serum levels have not been shown to correlate with efficacy or toxicity; indeed, concentration monitoring is unnecessary in most cases. Circumstances in which therapeutic <b>drug</b> <b>monitoring</b> [...] is warranted include: patients receiving concomitant aminoglycoside therapy, patients with (potentially) altered pharmacokinetic parameters, patients on haemodialysis, patients administered high-dose or prolonged treatment, and patients with impaired renal function. In such cases, trough concentrations are measured.|$|E
