50|$|This term {{is used in}} Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina (not to be {{confused}} with natillas which is a separate but similar dish). It refers to a set of similar dishes traditionally made by slowly and gently cooking pure (normally non-homogenized) milk to thicken and reduce the volume, and <b>gradually</b> <b>adding</b> <b>sugar.</b> In some regions other ingredients such as vanilla bean, citrus juices, cinnamon, and even rice may also be added. Usually a double boiler of some sort is employed so as to prevent browning of the mixture (which would give it a different flavor). The result is a white or cream-colored, thick spread with a consistency much like that of a thick cake frosting although the flavor is more like that of sweetened cream (with accents of whatever additional ingredients may have been added). The cooking process is largely the same as for creating sweetened condensed milk except that the result is normally thicker.|$|R

40|$|Consumption of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> in Canada {{is often}} {{reported}} {{to be higher than}} data suggest. Both popular and scientific articles often incorrectly report unadjusted national food supply (availability) data as actual consumption data. Additionally, when describing Canadian eating habits, US data is often cited. This does not provide an accurate reflection of Canadian consumption patterns, as Canadian intakes of many foods and beverages containing <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> are substantially below US levels (1). Misinformation about <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> consumption may be linked to complications associated with their estimation.

High <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake may be {{associated}} with adverse health consequences. ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study identified sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics associated with <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake among US adults (18 years and older) using the 2010 National Health Interview Survey data (n= 24, 967). MethodsThe outcome variable was <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake from foods and beverages using scoring algorithms to convert dietary screener frequency responses on nine items to estimates of individual dietary intake of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> in teaspoons per day. Added sugars intake was categorized into tertiles (lowest, middle, highest) stratified by sex. The explanatory variables were sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios for the highest and middle tertile <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake groups as compared with the lowest tertile group. ResultsEstimated median <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake was 17. 6 tsp/d for men and 11. 7 tsp/d for women. For men and women, those who had significantly greater odds for being in the highest tertile of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake (men: 22 ̆ 030522. 0 tsp/d; women: 22 ̆ 030514. 6 tsp/d) were younger, less educated, had lower income, were less physically active, were current smokers, and were former or current infrequent/light drinkers, whereas non-Hispanic other/multiracial and those living in the West had significantly lower odds for being in the highest tertile of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake. Different patterns were found by sex. Non-Hispanic black men had lower odds for being in the highest tertile of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake, whereas non-Hispanic black women had greater odds for being in the highest tertile. ConclusionsOne in three men consumed 22 ̆ 030522. 0 tsp <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> and one in three women consumed 22 ̆ 030514. 6 tsp <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> daily.

40|$|BACKGROUND: High <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> {{consumption}} {{has been}} associated with the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The American Heart Association (AHA) diet is designed to prevent and treat MetS; however, it remains unclear whether the AHA diet is effective on decreasing <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> consumption. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of the AHA dietary counselling on <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> consumption among participants with MetS. METHODS: The AHA dietary counselling was conducted among 119 participants with MetS from June 2009 to January 2014 (ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT 00911885). Unannounced 24 -hour recalls were collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Added sugar consumption patterns over time were examined using linear mixed models. RESULTS: After 1 -year dietary counselling, intake of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> decreased by 23. 8 g/day (95 % CI 15. 1, 32. 4 g/day); intake of nonalcoholic beverages dropped from the leading contributor of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> intake to number 7 (from 11. 9 to 4. 4 %); the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) score increased by 5. 4 (95 % CI 2. 9, 8. 0); however, <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> intake for 48 % participants still exceeded the recommendation. Added sugar intake per meal among different meal type was similar (24. 2 - 25. 8 %) at baseline. After the 1 -year dietary counselling, breakfast became the major resource of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> intake (33. 3 %); the proportion of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> intake from snacks decreased from 25. 8 % (CI 23. 1, 28. 5 %) to 20. 9 % (CI 19. 6, 22. 3 %).

Sugar-Sweetened beverages or sugary drinks are the leading source of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> in the American diet. Added sugars include syrups and other caloric sweeteners. Other examples of <b>added</b> <b>sugars,</b> especially ones that can be listed as an ingredient, include brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, glucose, high fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, molasses, raw sugar, sucrose, trehalose, and turbinado <b>sugar.</b> The <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> content is associated with several health concerns like weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, dental implications, and gout. Naturally occurring sugars, {{such as those in}} fruit or milk, are not <b>added</b> <b>sugars.</b> Even though there are several beverages/drinks that have sugar in them, some beverages, such as milk, fruit juice, and diet drinks, fall into a [...] "gray" [...] area because of different contributions to health and weight gain is more complex. Sugar-sweetened beverages contain <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> such as sucrose or fructose, often in large amounts, which contribute to the overall energy density of diets. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidance on free sugars. Based on the impact of free sugars intake and its effects on weight gain and dental issues the WHO has taken action on such problems. Free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Current evidence suggests that increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with weight gain. Reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages can also reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain in adults. [...] For a normal calorie diet, calories from <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> should be less than 10 percent of the daily calorie limit. Eating habits that include a lesser amount of <b>added</b> <b>sugars,</b> that can be from reduced intake of sugary drinks, can be associated with reduced risk of CVD in adults, and moderate evidence indicates that these eating patterns are associated with reduced risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer in adults.|$|R

The American Heart Associations daily recommended intake of sugar for men {{is no more than}} 150 calories or nine teaspoons per day and for women no more than 100 calories or six teaspoons per day of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> (Sugar101). Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore’s Dilemma, says of <b>added</b> <b>sugar,</b> “…since 1985 our consumption of all added sugars-cane, beet, HFCS, glucose, honey, maple syrup, whatever-has climbed from 128 pounds to 158 pounds per person” (Pollan, pg. 104). Added sugars are hard to recognize due to not being clearly labeled. Some <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> labeled are brown sugar, corn syrup, fruit juice concentrates as well as sugar molecules: dextrose, glucose, lactose, maltose and sucrose. Common foods with <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> are a carbonated soft drinks (12 oz. can =132.5 calories) non-fat =77.5 calories), fruit punch drink (12 oz. can =62.1 calories), vanilla ice cream (1/2 cup = 48 calories), cake doughnut (1=74.2 calories [...] )and so forth (Sugar101).|$|R

40|$|Background: With the {{increased}} awareness of healthy diet among the population, the intake of fruit juices as health drinks has been increased. This study {{has been designed to}} check the potential cariogenicity of fruit drinks frequently consumed by infants and young children. Aim: To compare the acidogenic potential of sugar free fruit juices with fruit juices containing sugar by evaluating the plaque pH changes, following consumption of the above drinks. Design: The study was carried out on 10 children in the age group of 8 - 15 years. The four fruit juices used were 1) orange juice with <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> 2) orange juice with no <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> 3) apple juice with <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> 4) apple juice with no <b>added</b> <b>sugar.</b> Sucrose rinse of 10 % was used as control group. The endogenous pH of the fruit juices and control was assessed using digital pH meter. The plaque pH was assessed at the baseline and after the consumption of the drinks at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60 minutes time interval using the plaque-harvesting technique. The obtained results were compiled and subjected to statistical analysis using paired t-test. Result: All the fruit juices showed drop in plaque pH. A drop in pH was also observed in the juices despite of no <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> content. Conclusion: The fruit juices labeled with "no added sugar" or "free from added sugar", contained substantial quantities of sugar and are equally cariogenic as are fruit drinks with <b>added</b> <b>sugar...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} absolute micronutrient intake and the possibility of micronutrient dilution of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> in the diets of an African population in nutritional transition. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, comparative, population-based design was used. Respondents who consumed sugar were divided into four quartiles of percentage of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> intake. SETTING: The setting was 37 randomly selected rural and urban areas of the North West province. SUBJECTS: The subjects were 1 742 adult volunteers (739 men and 1 003 women), aged between 15 - 65 years. After exclusion of low-energy reporters, the sample comprised 1 045 subjects (472 men and 573 women). OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes measures were the macronutrient and micronutrient intakes of subjects in different quartiles of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> intake and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: The average intake of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> was 10. 01 % of total energy (67. 12 g) in men and 11. 2 % total energy (67. 10 g) in women. Respondents who consumed the most <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> had significantly lower mean intakes of alcohol, but higher intakes of energy, macronutrients and most micronutrients. The diets of those in the highest sugar intake group contained significantly less thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B 12, pantothenic acid, biotin, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc per 4. 18 MJ. At every level of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> consumption, the mean intakes of fibre (men only), folate, ascorbic acid and calcium (men and women) did not meet the dietary reference intakes [estimated average requirements (EAR) ] and pantothenic acid and biotin (women only) did not meet the adequate intake. There {{were no significant differences in}} mean BMI across the quartiles of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> intakes in men, but the mean BMI of women who consumed the most <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> was significantly higher than that of those who consumed less sugar. Respondents who consumed the most <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> had significantly higher intakes of fruit (men only), bread and soft drinks, and lower intakes of maize meal and alcohol (men and women). CONCLUSION: Absolute intakes of most micronutrients were significantly higher in consumers with a high sugar intake [Quartile (Q) 4] compared with the lowest consumers of sugar (Q 1). The lowest percentages of participants whose micronutrient intakes fell below the EAR were in Q 4 and Q 3. However, expression of micronutrient intake per 4. 18 kJ (micronutrient dilution) revealed significantly less of most micronutrients per 4. 18 MJ for men and women who consumed the most <b>added</b> <b>sugar,</b> compared with those who consumed the least.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{consumption}} of ultra-processed foods and analyse its association with the content of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> in the Chilean diet. Design: Cross-sectional study of national dietary data obtained through 24 h recalls and classified into food groups according to the extent and purpose of food processing (NOVA classification). Setting: Chile. Subjects: A probabilistic sample of 4920 individuals (aged 2 years or above) studied in 2010 by a national dietary survey (Encuesta Nacional de Consumo Alimentario). Results: Ultra-processed foods represented 28 · 6 (SE 0 · 5) % of total energy intake and 58 · 6 (SE 0 · 9) % of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake. The mean percentage of energy from <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> increased from 7 · 7 (SE 0 · 3) to 19 · 7 (SE 0 · 5) % across quintiles of the dietary share of ultra-processed foods. After adjusting for several potential sociodemographic confounders, a 5 percentage point increase in the dietary share of ultra-processed foods determined a 1 percentage point increase in the dietary content of <b>added</b> <b>sugars.</b> Individuals in the highest quintile were {{three times more likely}} (OR= 2 · 9; 95 % CI 2 · 4, 3 · 4) to exceed the 10 % upper limit for <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> recommended by the WHO compared with those in the lowest quintile, after adjusting for sociodemographic variables. This association was strongest among individuals aged 2 – 19 years (OR= 3 · 9; 95 % CI 2 · 7, 5 · 9). Conclusions: In Chile, ultra-processed foods are important contributors to total energy intake and to {{the consumption of}} <b>added</b> <b>sugars.</b> Actions aimed at limiting consumption of ultra-processed foods are being implemented as effective ways to achieve WHO dietary recommendations to limit <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> and processed foods, especially for children and adolescents...|$|R
