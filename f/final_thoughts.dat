5|$|Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos' own {{experiences}} {{played a significant}} role in his emphasis on human suffering. As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in Hijo de hombre. Later he saw the devastation of WWII at first hand in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, El trueno ebtre las hojas, set the stage for Hijo de hombre and Yo, el Supremo with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression. Two decades later, Yo, el Supremo was published, providing a prime example of Roa Bastos' idea of the engaged writer. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the <b>final</b> <b>thoughts</b> and ramblings of Paraguay's first dictator, at a time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of a regime that adopted many of the same policies of oppression and isolationism. Roa Bastos was not alone in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach. Together, these writers created the Dictator novel genre.|$|E
25|$|Inside the {{pedestal}} of the statue, the Man in Black, {{who has taken}} the form of Locke, sends Ben to get Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell). Richard, however, refuses to go inside and instead shows Locke's body to Ben. Bram (Brad William Henke) and his team from Flight 316 enter the statue with Ben. The Man in Black transforms into the Smoke Monster and easily kills Bram and his men, but spares Ben. The Man in Black then tells Ben what Locke's <b>final</b> <b>thoughts</b> were, and explains that his own true goal is to return home. The Man in Black finds this ironic because Locke wanted desperately to stay and live on the island. Outside, Richard sees the fireworks from the temple. The Man in Black then confronts Richard, who realizes who the man is, but the Man in Black quickly knocks him out and announces that he is disappointed in the Others as he carries Richard into the jungle.|$|E

Knight) in Grey's house, much to the displeasure of his roommates. A teenager patient with a large branch protruding through his abdomen is admitted into the hospital, and is revealed to have been thrown into a pile of tree clippings while street luging unprotected. The boy's distressed father Jeffrey Hernandez (Javier Grajeda) uses violence {{in order to make}} his son realize the danger he has gotten himself into. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) is assigned to the patient and unwillingly becomes emotionally involved in the case, banning further interaction between the two. Shepherd, Bailey and Yang treat a patient admitted in the neurosugical service, who has a tumor pressing against his frontal lobe. His condition forces him to verbally express each thought passing his mind, without being able to control it in any way. Realizing her inability to choose between the two men in her romantic background, Grey decides on dating both, therefore attempting to compare their dedication towards her. At the conclusion of the episode, Shepherd visits Montgomery in her hotel room, in order to share his <b>final</b> <b>thoughts</b> on their upcoming divorce, but is shocked at the revelation that she had sex with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane).|$|E

Stewie decides he likes being tanned and begins {{frequently}} to use a tanning bed in his room. He also holds a party for tanned people only.

Stewie is extremely sunburned, barely able to move and in great pain. When Stewie eventually begins to peel, Brian spots a mole on Stewie's stomach. Convinced it is skin cancer, Stewie begins to live out his dying wishes with Brian forced to help him since it was entirely his fault he caused the cancer in the first place. One of Stewie's requests was to visit the Chicago Museum of Art.

500|$|Yahoo!'s report differed, {{but still}} had many {{positive}} features. [...] Like GameSpy, Yahoo! also praised the effort {{put into the}} graphics and physics, but maintained that these are essentially eye-candy. [...] Both Yahoo! and Eurogamer were disappointed by the traditional economics-based strategy {{of the game and}} believed that this, with the lack of useful formation and tactics, meant that the game does not stand up to other modern real-time strategy games. Eurogamer shared these <b>final</b> <b>thoughts</b> and described the new Home City shipments, along with all the treasures scattered around the map, as silly and childish ways of trying to complement the game's lack of strategy and tactical choices. However, Eurogamer recognized that Ensemble Studios was brave to implement [...] "something quite different" [...] from other real time strategy games — the Home City concept.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} few pages of the book, in which Olivero prepares for his death and petrification, Read {{describes}} Olivero's <b>final</b> <b>thoughts</b> in a form adapted from Plato's Phaedo, but in an almost mirror image. Socrates, whose thoughts on the afterlife Plato was describing, argued that death was the ideal home of the soul, but Olivero longs for his body {{to be free from}} the torments of the soul, {{to become part of the}} crystalline solidity of the universe. Olivero regards life, not death, as the destroyer, [...] "for it [...] disrupts the harmony of inorganic matter". Socrates' suggestion, towards the end of the Phaedo, that our own world is but one of many, each a hollow in the earth connected by underground rivers, is a strikingly similar image to the subterranean land of the Green people that Read describes. Read however was [...] "almost certainly" [...] influenced in his depiction of the world of the Green people by [...] 1887 utopian novel A Crystal Age, a story in which people strive to [...] "live above their own mortality".|$|E

They come {{to us from the}} far-off--from all eras, and all lands--from Egypt, and India, and Greece, and Rome--and along through the middle and later ages, in the grand monarchies of Europe--born under far different institutes and conditions from ours--but out of the insight and inspiration of the same old humanity--the same old heart and brain--the same old countenance yearningly, pensively, looking forth.

60|$|Without being {{consciously}} {{that way}} pointed, through {{the desire of}} anticipating any objections {{on the part of}} Isabel to the assumption of a marriage between himself and her; Pierre was now impetuously hurried into an act, which should have the effective virtue of such an executed intention, without its corresponding motive. Because, as the primitive resolve so deplorably involved Lucy, her image was then prominent in his mind; and hence, because he felt all eagerness to hold her no longer in suspense, but by a certain sort of charity of cruelty, at once to pronounce to her her fate; therefore, it was among his first <b>final</b> <b>thoughts</b> that morning to go to Lucy. And to this, undoubtedly, so trifling a circumstance as her being nearer to him, geographically, than Isabel, must have contributed some added, though unconscious influence, in his present fateful frame of mind.|$|E

50|$|Firstly, {{there is}} an {{emphasis}} upon unfolding the latent processes of reasoning within {{the steps of the}} Talmudic sugya (matter at hand).

60|$|Ofttimes {{it is very}} {{wonderful}} to trace the rarest and profoundest things, and find their probable origin in something extremely trite or trivial. Yet so strange and complicate is the human soul; so much is confusedly evolved from out itself, and such vast and varied accessions come to it from abroad, and so impossible is it always to distinguish between these two, that the wisest man were rash, positively to assign the precise and incipient origination of his <b>final</b> <b>thoughts</b> and acts. Far as we blind moles can see, man's life seems but an acting upon mysterious hints; it is somehow hinted to us, to do thus or thus. For surely no mere mortal who has at all gone down into himself will ever pretend that his slightest thought or act solely originates in his own defined identity. This preamble seems not entirely unnecessary as usher of the strange conceit, that possibly the latent germ of Pierre's proposed extraordinary mode of executing his proposed extraordinary resolve--namely, the nominal conversion of a sister into a wife--might {{have been found in}} the previous conversational conversion of a mother into a sister; for hereby he had habituated his voice and manner to a certain fictitiousness in one of the closest domestic relations of life; and since man's moral texture is very porous, and things assumed upon the surface, at last strike in--hence, this outward habituation to the above-named fictitiousness had insensibly disposed his mind to it as it were; but only innocently and pleasantly as yet. If, by any possibility, this general conceit be so, then to Pierre the times of sportfulness were as pregnant with the hours of earnestness; and in sport he learnt the terms of woe.|$|E
