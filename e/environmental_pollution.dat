This research presents an assessment of noise levels on the main campus of the University of Arizona, based on noise measurements and noise maps, and defines problems associated with the high noise levels in specific areas. Then, strategically develops an acoustic panel, by using an environmentally friendly material which is called Polylactic Acid. PLA is a kind of biopolymers and it is biodegradable material made from renewable raw materials like corn starch. In addition, the University of Arizona's campus is surrounded by four streets with intense vehicle traffic, which contribute to causing the noise level to exceed the legal limits established for some of the educational areas. There are many methods for mitigating noise in urban areas, including the formation of the city, the geometry of buildings, vegetation, and sidewalk design, building façade design and using acoustic materials. All these responses for noise mitigation should be considered as environmentally friendly design concepts. The manufacturing of many materials can cause severe <b>environmental</b> <b>pollutions,</b> but by using Polylactic acid material we will save our planet...|$|R

Chen organized villagers in his hometown and 78 other villages to petition against the mill. The effort was successful, and resulted in the suspension of the paper mill. In addition, Chen contacted the British embassy in Beijing, informing them of the situation and requesting funding for a well to supply clean water to locals. The British government responded by providing £15,000 towards a deep water well, irrigation systems and water pipelines.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Correct and {{efficient}} use of various sources of energy and natural resources for sustainable development is necessary to achieve economic growth. Based on the importance preservation of non-renewable resources and reducing the negative impacts of industrial and economic activities more than ever are evident for governments. So, a descriptive study was conducted entitled “Tax and Environmental Experts Opinion in Yazd City about the Green Tax System Establishment and Reduce of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Pollutions.</b> Methods: In order to gather the survey information and verify our research hypothesis, we designed a questionnaire with the five-item Likert’s scale which was completed by 126 tax and environmental experts that has been chosen by stratified random sampling. The extracted information is analyzed by t-Student test in SPSS software.  Results: Given that all three statistics obtained by t-test for air pollution, water and soil is bigger than the critical Alpha value at level of 5 % (Z 0. 05 = 1. 645), according to experts opinion can be expressed with 95 % confidence that the establishment of green tax system reduce all three types of environmental  pollutions including; air, water and soil.

5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and <b>environmental</b> <b>pollution.</b> However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E
5|$|There are {{conflicting}} views whether {{improvements in}} technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling {{of economic growth}} from environmental degradation. On the one hand, it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit GDP) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution. On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in {{the efficiency of the}} use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, {{in large part because of}} the rebound effect (conservation) or Jevons Paradox resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution. Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., second law of thermodynamics) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions. Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and <b>environmental</b> <b>pollution,</b> i.e., economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by Herman Daly and others in the ecological economics community.|$|E
