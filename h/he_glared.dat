2500|$|In {{his opening}} {{argument}} {{in defense of}} the abortion restrictions, attorney Jay Floyd made what was later described as the [...] "worst joke in legal history." [...] Appearing against two female lawyers, Floyd began, [...] "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. It's an old joke, but when a man argues against two beautiful ladies like this, {{they are going to have}} the last word." [...] His remark was met with cold silence; one observer thought that Chief Justice Burger [...] "was going to come right off the bench at him. <b>He</b> <b>glared</b> him down." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} that Coleman was fighting extradition to New Jersey. A warrant was issued by New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, and Manhattan prosecutors decided to drop a 1997 charge against him for allegedly having a small knife. Coleman later appeared in State Superior Court where he had to face Moore's mother and her sister. <b>He</b> <b>glared</b> at them as he was led {{out of the courtroom}} in shackles. The Superior Court Judge, Sheila Venable, imposed a $2 million cash bail against him. [...] Coleman was extradited to New Jersey to face trial in October 2006.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Hart {{states in}} Hitman, that while conversing with Michaels: [...] "I added, 'I also {{want you to}} know that I have no problem {{dropping}} the belt to you if that's what Vince wants.' <b>He</b> <b>glared</b> back at me. 'I appreciate that, but I {{want you to know}} that I'm not willing to do the same for you.' And then he left. Jim [...] snorted, 'I can't believe that he just said that.' There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{too much}} to hope for that Alec Bedser would dismiss Arthur Morris cheaply {{for the third time in}} a row, but he did in his second over and the Australian vice-captain was taken by Len Hutton in the slips for 2. Neil Harvey (42) came in at 6/1 and Australia were 67/1 at lunch despite the bowling of Bedser (who bowled {{unchanged}} throughout the morning) and Bailey and surprisingly good English fielding. Hassett even apologised to Brown as the ball was constantly fell just short of the slips, or flew over their heads as Harvey rode his luck. After lunch Bedser tickled Harvey's edge with a ball that Godfrey Evans snapped up instinctively, but had he missed few would have realised was a chance. The big bowler then held onto Ken Archer (26) in the slips by throwing himself to the ground and taking the ball in his outstretched right hand and Australia were 89/3. Keith Miller, whose matinée idol looks greatly affected his teenager fans, made 18, but his potential boundaries were stymied by Cyril Washbrook in the covers and Reg Simpson on the boundary-fence and he was trapped lbw by Freddie Brown (1/28) to bring Australia down to 93/4 on a good pitch on a perfect sunny day. Lindsay Hassett played a careful captain's innings of 52, adding 84 in an hour and a half with Sam Loxton (32). Brian Close was a short-leg to Hassett and kept on edging closer until he was almost face-to-face. He was brought on to rest Bedser and Bailey before the new ball was taken and Loxton was given [...] "not out" [...] when he appeared to give Hutton a straightforward catch in the gully. Soon after Loxton was out to a catch by Evans off Close when he didn't make contact and <b>he</b> <b>glared</b> at the umpire; [...] "Tha' were lucky once, Sam" [...] said Hutton [...] "so don't grouse" [...] and Australia were 177/5, which soon became 177/6 when Bedser yorked Hassett while loosening up with the old ball. The new ball was taken and Bedser (4/37) and Bailey (4/40) promptly cleared up the tail for 17 runs and Australia were all out for 194 at stumps.|$|E
