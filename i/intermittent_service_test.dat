40|$|The {{subject of}} this diploma thesis is web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI. The main {{objective}} {{is to create a}} methodology for web <b>services</b> <b>testing.</b> The next objective (which {{is a part of the}} methodology) is to create a guidance for web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> using SoapUI. The guidance serves as a manual to web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI. The theoretical part of the thesis explains basic terms: <b>testing,</b> web <b>service</b> and methodology. This part is also devoted to the introduction of the SoapUI and Eclipse Process Framework Composer. The practical part of the thesis is focused on the methodology for web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> itself. The methodology is created in Eclipse Process Framework Composer and each element of the methodology is described here. Some of the methodology elements (the guidance, concepts, tools and some templates) are listed as an appendix...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI tool, {{particularly}} on verification methodology for Web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI. The main objective of this thesis is to verify the methodology. Specific goals include introduction to basic concepts and principles related to web services, {{a description of the}} testing process including types of the tests and specifics of <b>testing</b> web <b>services,</b> introduction of methodology for Web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI, practical verification of the methodology on the real information system and a suggestion of how to adapt the methodology {{on the basis of the}} verification. The theoretical part summarizes basic knowledge of the web services technology and web <b>services</b> <b>testing.</b> Especially it is devoted to description of the methodology for Web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI and to the introduction of the SoapUI tool. The practical part consists of the introduction of the test system in Česká pojišťovna, a. s. and Generali pojišťovna, a. s., where the methodology is verified. Next the methodology for Web <b>services</b> <b>testing</b> with SoapUI is verified. Based on this verification, there are suggestions of how to adapt or extend the methodology...|$|R

40|$|A {{real time}} control policy {{minimizing}} total intersection delays subject to queue length constraints at an isolated signalized intersection is developed in this paper. The policy {{is derived from}} a new traffic model which describes the simultaneous evolution of queue lengths of two conflicting traffic streams, controlled by a traffic light, in both time and space. The model {{is based on the}} examination of shock waves generated upstream of the stop lines by the <b>intermittent</b> <b>service</b> of traffic at the signal. The proposed policy was tested against the existing pre-timed control policy at a high volume intersection and it was found superior, especially when demands increase well above the saturation level. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Although small, rural water {{supplies}} may present elevated microbial risks to consumers in some settings, characterizing exposures through representative point-of-consumption sampling is logistically challenging. In order {{to evaluate the}} usefulness of consumer self-reported data in predicting measured water quality and risk factors for contamination, we compared matched consumer interview data with point-of-survey, household water quality and pressure data for 910 households served by 14 small water systems in rural Alabama. Participating households completed one survey that included detailed feedback on two key areas of water service conditions: delivery conditions (<b>intermittent</b> <b>service</b> and low water pressure) and general aesthetic characteristics (taste, odor and color), providing five condition values.

50|$|Race Day {{specials}} {{were very}} heavily patronised {{until well after}} WW2, as were other specials such as those serving Wakes Weeks and football matches. Although railways are always best suited to regular, day-in-day-out traffic, with cheap labour and plentiful old rolling stock available until the 1960s such <b>intermittent</b> <b>services</b> could make money and be seen as worthwhile. The corporate climate and economics were shifting, however. The station was closed in October 1963. An experiment in running race day specials was run in 1975, using the long-closed Ashton-in-Makerfield station some 500 yards to the west, with the trains passing through Haydock Park station's carcass. This was not repeated after that year.|$|R
50|$|The {{last major}} use of {{conventional}} cavalry by the Army {{was in the}} First World War. However, the anticipated war of manoeuvre on the Western Front never took place, and the cavalry forces were never employed in their intended role; instead, many saw <b>intermittent</b> <b>service</b> as dismounted infantry. This was especially true of the yeomanry regiments; indeed, the 74th (Yeomanry) Division was composed entirely of yeomanry regiments serving as infantry, and in 1918 many regiments began to be formally converted to infantry units. However, mounted cavalry did {{play a major role}} in the Sinai and Palestine theatre, most notably at the Battle of Beersheba.|$|R
