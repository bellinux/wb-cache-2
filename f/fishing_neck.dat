50|$|A head catcher is {{a device}} {{placed at the}} top of the {{lubricator}} section. Should the wireline tools be forced into the top of the lubricator section, the head catcher, which looks like a small 'claw,' will clamp down on the <b>fishing</b> <b>neck</b> of the tool. This action prevents the tools from falling downhole should the line pull out of the rope socket. Pressure is bled off of the head catcher to release the tools.|$|E
50|$|These are tools {{designed}} for fishing other wireline components {{which have been}} dropped or placed in the well down hole. All wireline tools are designed with 'fishing necks' on their top side, intended to be easily grabbed by pulling tools with a matching 'id' {{to that of the}} 'od' of the <b>fishing</b> <b>neck.</b> Pulling tools are also used for retrieving seated components such as plug prongs. Almost all pulling tools are equipped with a safety feature (shear pin) so they may release a stuck tool and allow the tool string to be brought to the surface for changes in components (hydraulic jars for example).|$|E

50|$|Her first Kraków {{performance}} was the piece Legs of pigeon {{presented at the}} Krzysztofory Gallery in Kraków in 1994. It was represented in 1995 at the Flying Art Festival at an abandoned factory in Solvay. This event {{was also the first}} large scale rave in Kraków. She followed this with the scenic works Granat, in 1996 The moon and <b>fish</b> <b>neck</b> in 1998, both at the Krzysztofory gallery. In 2001 she premiered Utsusemi at the Festival Rozdroze, in the Ujazdowski Castle Contemporary Art Centre in Warsaw.|$|R
50|$|Farr, a singer-songwriter, brought {{together}} {{a group of}} local Calgary musicians under the name Flu in 1997. The band played together for several years, including in Toronto during Music Week in 2001. They participated in the Cure's Greatest Hits tour and won a songwriting contest. Musicians included Farr, Mark Radloff and Paul Sperman. An album, <b>Fish</b> With <b>Necks,</b> containing mainly songs written by Farr, was self-released.|$|R
50|$|While JB {{fights and}} flees from Fish, Star is killed by Gein, and Ren is slain by the Zodiac. Simon is then {{attacked}} by <b>Fish,</b> whose <b>neck</b> he breaks, causing Fish to disintegrate into a dust that enters Simon's body. The other murderers (who begin succumbing to infighting) continue to run amok, with Gacy stabbing Bill, the Ripper dismembering Nicole, JB gutting Candi, and Gein knifing Dahmer, {{and in turn}} being bludgeoned by JB.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of "Harrison Mike", a Mono Indian boy, with {{a rainbow}} trout, Leeving, California, June 15, 1929. The small boy {{can be seen}} at center holding the <b>fish</b> by its <b>neck.</b> The boy is wearing a jacket and a fur cap, and has an American flag tucked into his pocket. The trout is almost as big as the child and has large spots on its skin. A wooden storage chest can be seen {{directly}} behind the boy, and a man is visible standing behind the container. A wire fence is visible at right, while the porch of a building is visible in the background at left...|$|R
50|$|In 1971 the Dutch University Delft {{completed}} a {{report for the}} Queensland State Government recommending {{the construction of a}} groyne at Narrow Neck. The Gold Coast City Council examined the idea of a groyne and instead constructed an artificial reef to stabilise the foreshore at Narrow Neck. So far the reef has worked well as a coastal control point, but has been disappointing in its secondary objective to improve surfing. A surprising benefit of the Narrow Neck Reef has been its ability to attract marine growth and reef fish and is now a popular diving and <b>fishing</b> location. Narrow <b>Neck</b> is particularly popular for kite surfing and longboarding.|$|R
6000|$|There {{are things}} {{in this world of}} which I can say seriously that I love them but I do not like them. The point is not merely verbal, but psychologically quite valid. Cats are the first things that occur to me as {{examples}} of the principle. Cats are so beautiful that a creature from another star might fall in love with them, and so incalculable that he might kill them. Some of my friends take quite a high moral line about cats. Some, like Mr. Titterton, I think, admire a cat for its moral independence and readiness to scratch anybody [...] "if he does not behave himself." [...] Others, like Mr. Belloe, regard the cat as cruel and secret, a fit friend for witches; one who will devour everything, except, indeed, poisoned food, [...] "so utterly lacking is it in Christian simplicity and humility." [...] For my part, I have neither of these feelings. I admire cats as I admire catkins; those little fluffy things that hang on trees. They are both pretty and both furry, and both declare the glory of God. And this abstract exultation in all living things is truly to be called Love; for it is a higher feeling than mere affectional convenience; it is a vision. It is heroic, and even saintly, in this: that it asks for nothing in return. I love all the eats in the street as St. Francis of Assisi loved all the birds in the wood or all the fishes in the sea; not so much, of course, but then I am not a saint. But he did not wish to bridle a bird and ride on its back, as one bridles and rides on a horse. He did not wish to put a collar round a <b>fish's</b> <b>neck,</b> marked with the name [...] "Francis," [...] and the address [...] "Assisi"&mdash;as one does with a dog. He did not wish them to belong to him or himself to belong to them; in fact, {{it would be a very}} awkward experience to belong to a lot of fishes. But a man does belong to his dog, in another but an equally real sense with that in which the dog belongs to him. The two bonds of obedience and responsibility vary very much with the dogs and the men; but they are both bonds. In other words, a man does not merely love a dog; as he might (in a mystical moment) love any sparrow that perched on his windowsill or any rabbit that ran across his path. A man likes a dog; and that is a serious matter.|$|R
5000|$|The Duke Nereidians, or Neredian Club, was a {{synchronized}} swimming team formed in 1930 {{by a group}} of eight students and a faculty advisor [...] "to promote interest and efficiency in rhythmic swimming, stunts, and diving among the women students of Duke University." [...] The team typically consisted of 35 to 50 swimmers chosen from tryouts in the fall and spring semesters. New members underwent a pledge ceremony called [...] "Fish Day," [...] where they were required to wear large paper <b>fishes</b> around their <b>necks</b> while carrying a glass of water and a fishing pole. The Nereidians held weekly practices, which culminated in a final performance or [...] "water pageant" [...] each spring, usually featuring a theme, elaborate costumes, props, and staging.|$|R
5|$|Tiktaalik {{generally}} had {{the characteristics}} of a lobe-finned fish, but with front fins featuring arm-like skeletal structures more akin to those of a crocodile, including a shoulder, elbow, and wrist. The fossil discovered in 2004 did not include the rear fins and tail. It had rows of sharp teeth indicative of a predator <b>fish,</b> and its <b>neck</b> could move independently of its body, which is not common in other fish (Tarrasius, Mandageria, placoderms, and extant seahorses being some exceptions; see also Lepidogalaxias and Channallabes apus). The animal had a flat skull resembling a crocodile's; eyes on top of its head, suggesting that it {{spent a lot of time}} looking up; a neck and ribs similar to those of tetrapods, with the ribs being used to support its body and aid in breathing via lungs; well developed jaws suitable for catching prey; and a small gill slit called a spiracle that, in more derived animals, became an ear.|$|R
50|$|After the Permaisuri is {{satisfied}} that Bidasari's beauty has been ruined, she asks the mirror who {{the most beautiful}} in the land is. When the mirror shows Bidasari, the Permaisuri tries to burn Bidasari's face with firewood, but is shocked when the fire magically goes out and Bidasari's face is unharmed. Bidasari begs for mercy and explains that her life is bonded to a fish that is kept in a bowl in her father's garden. That night the Permaisuri has a servant steal the fish, {{and as soon as}} it leaves the water, Bidasari stops breathing and collapses. The Permaisuri hangs the <b>fish</b> around her <b>neck</b> as a trophy, and {{is satisfied}} when the mirror now reveals her to be the most beautiful in the land. The next day the merchant realises the fish is missing, and is told that Bidasari died mysteriously at the palace. Her body is returned to him and he builds a tomb for her in the woods.|$|R
5000|$|In Florida, {{there is}} a season where the spiny lobster may be taken, usually from the {{beginning}} of August to the end of March, to protect the species during its main breeding season. A special [...] "mini season" [...] {{a few days before the}} start of the regular lobster season gives recreational divers a [...] "head start" [...] in catching them. Divers catch them by gloved hand, often [...] "tickling" [...] them out of their dens with a dowel or small stick. In the Bahamas and Caribbean, they are often also speared or gigged (Florida game regulations prohibit taking them by these methods). In Bermuda, licensed individuals can only take lobsters by free-diving and using an approved noose within designated areas; all other methods and use of air tanks are prohibited. Commercial fisherman typically use lobster traps similar to those used by lobster fishermen in New England. The traps are usually baited with dead <b>fish</b> or chicken <b>necks.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of skeletal disorders in larval and juvenile fish {{is linked to}} a poorly understood relationship between nutrition, environment and genetic factors. These disorders are often a complex mixture, including vertebral and spinal malformations. In marine <b>fish</b> hatcheries, <b>neck</b> deformities, and vertebral and spinal disorders are most abundant. Fish bones are found {{in all shapes and}} sizes. They have a wide diversity of cartilages and bones with chondro- and osteogenic cells. Bone and cartilages may develop during embryonic, larval, juvenile or adult stages under normal ontogeny as well as during pathological states, wound repair and bone regeneration. Three types of cells {{play a significant role in}} the bone remodeling process and bone formation, resorption and mineralization; osteoblasts (bone forming cells), osteocytes (entrapped inside the bone matrix), and osteoclasts (multinucleated bone resorbing cells). Unfortunately, limited research effort has been directed to characterize the pathological changes associated with disorders linked to nutrient deficiencies in fish. Fish contain a significant amount of lipid and micronutrients in skeletal tissues including collagen, which are particularly susceptible to lipid peroxidation. A brief review of the current state of knowledge on the role of key nutrients in the pathogenesis of skeletal deformities with an emphasis on minerals (calcium, phosphorus and trace elements), vitamins (A, D, C, E and K), lipid and nutrient interactions is presented. Bone deformities associated with nutrient deficiencies and toxicities in various fish can provide an excellent model to study gene action, cell differentiation, morphogenesis, species differences in phenotypic expression of genetic abnormalities, deposition of calcium, phosphorus and other trace elements in cartilage and skeletal tissues in response to vitamins and hormones and nutrient interactions.

50|$|Initially, long necked plesiosaurs {{were thought}} to be {{strictly}} fish eaters due to their conical teeth, a shared trait with modern piscivores. It was proposed that plesiosaurimophs would swim with a straight neck and attack pelagic <b>fishes.</b> The straight <b>neck</b> would have been used in order to avoid creating drag by arching its neck upward into the water column. Additionally, some researchers have proposed that by swimming with its head directly in front of its body, plesiosaurs would be able to reach pelagic fishes before they felt the change in water pressure caused by the large body of the plesiosaur. Essentially, the head would precede the pressure difference. It is also proposed that species like Muraenosaurus fed upon benthic fishes by floating above them and reaching its head down into the benthos. Plesiosauromorphs may also have employed a strategy called benthic grazing where they would harvest relatively immobile species such as cephalopods from the sea floor. Gastroliths have often been found within the stomachs of extinct marine reptiles and have been associated with the plesiosauromorph body type. One of the proposed uses for gastroliths is the grinding of tough, shelled foods like cephalopods.|$|R
5000|$|Injury and/or {{death by}} needlefish {{have also been}} {{documented}} in more recent years. A young snorkeler in Florida was nearly killed when a houndfish (Tylosurus crocodilus) leapt from the water and impaled her in the heart. In 2012, The German kitesurfer Wolfram Reiners, was seriously wounded in the foot by a needlefish near the Seychelles. In October 2013, a Saudi Arabian news website also reported {{the death of an}} unnamed young Saudi man who died of hemorrhaging that resulted from being hit by a needlefish {{on the left side of}} his neck. [...] In 2014, a Russian tourist was nearly killed by a needlefish in the waters outside Nha Trang, in Vietnam. The <b>fish</b> bit her <b>neck</b> and left pieces of its teeth inside her spinal cord, paralyzing her. In early January 2016, a local 39-year old Indonesian woman from Palu, Central Sulawesi was deeply wounded when a half-metre long needlefish jumped and pierced her just above the right eye. She was swimming in 80-cm deep water in Tanjung Karang, a popular recreational spot in the Donggala Regency, Central Sulawesi. She was subsequently pronounced dead a few hours later despite efforts to save her at a local hospital. Shortly after, pictures of her horrific injury spread through instant messaging applications, while several local news websites also reported the incident, some erroneously attributed the attack to a marlin instead. The Japanese film All About Lily Chou-Chou has a brief scene about needlefish and shows an actual picture from a nature guidebook of a needlefish who impaled a man in his eye.|$|R
