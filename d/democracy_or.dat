5|$|<b>Democracy,</b> <b>or</b> {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E

50|$|In the 1990s, {{international}} {{election observation}} focused on elections {{in countries with}} weak <b>democracies</b> <b>or</b> <b>democracies</b> in transition.

25|$|The Finnish Security Intelligence Service's (Supo) core {{functions}} are counter-intelligence, counter-terrorism and other national security-related work, such as counter-proliferation activities intended to impede {{the proliferation of}} weapons of mass destruction.

25|$|Cosmopolitan democracy, {{also known}} as Global <b>democracy</b> <b>or</b> World Federalism, is a {{political}} system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification {{for this kind of}} system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them.|$|E
25|$|He {{believes}} that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British imperialism have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions {{in order to}} present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading <b>democracy</b> <b>or,</b> in older instances, spreading Christianity; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them. Prominent examples that he regularly cites are {{the actions of the}} British Empire in India and Africa, and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.|$|E

25|$|Some modern democracies {{that are}} {{predominantly}} representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic. These democracies, which combine elements of representative democracy and direct democracy, are termed hybrid <b>democracies,</b> semi-direct <b>democracies</b> <b>or</b> participatory <b>democracies.</b> Examples include Switzerland and some U.S. states, where frequent use {{is made of}} referendums and initiatives.|$|R
50|$|Michael Haas {{has written}} {{perhaps the most}} trenchant {{critique}} of a hidden normative agenda (Haas 1997). Among the points raised: Due to sampling manipulation, the research creates the impression that democracies can justifiably fight nondemocracies, snuff out budding <b>democracies,</b> <b>or</b> even impose <b>democracy.</b> And due to sloppy definitions, there is no concern that democracies continue undemocratic practices yet remain in the sample as if pristine democracies.|$|R
25|$|The Dominican Republic is a {{representative}} <b>democracy</b> <b>or</b> democratic republic, with three branches of power: executive, legislative, and judicial. The {{president of the}} Dominican Republic heads the executive branch and executes laws passed by the congress, appoints the cabinet, and is {{commander in chief of}} the armed forces. The president and vice-president run for office on the same ticket and are elected by direct vote for 4-year terms. The national legislature is bicameral, composed of a senate, which has 32 members, and the Chamber of Deputies, with 178 members.|$|E
25|$|Daron Acemoğlu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson have {{achieved}} notoriety for demonstrating that diseases and terrain have helped shape tendencies towards democracy versus dictatorship, and through these {{economic growth and}} development. In their book Why Nations Fail, {{as well as a}} paper titled The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, the authors show that the colonial disease environment shaped the tendency for Europeans to settle the territory or not, and whether they developed systems of agriculture and labor markets that were free and egalitarian versus exploitative and unequal. These choices of political and economic institutions, they argue, shaped tendencies to <b>democracy</b> <b>or</b> dictatorship over the following centuries.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{government}} issued {{new rules}} on December 28, 2012 requiring Internet users {{to provide their}} real names to service providers, while assigning Internet companies greater responsibility for deleting forbidden postings and reporting them to the authorities. The new regulations, issued by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, allow Internet users to continue to adopt pseudonyms for their online postings, {{but only if they}} first provide their real names to service providers, a measure that could chill some of the vibrant discourse on the country’s Twitter-like microblogs. The authorities periodically detain and even jail Internet users for politically sensitive comments, such as calls for a multiparty <b>democracy</b> <b>or</b> accusations of impropriety by local officials.|$|E
50|$|The {{system of}} deliberative {{democracy}} is a mix between a majority ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative <b>democracies</b> <b>or</b> direct <b>democracies</b> to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage. It is a system which allows for legislators to discuss the issues in a productive manner trying to reach a consensus. If the group cannot reach a consensus then a majority-wins vote must be taken.|$|R

25|$|Franzen {{writes for}} The New Yorker magazine. His 1996 Harper's essay Perchance to Dream bemoaned {{the state of}} {{contemporary}} literature. Oprah Winfrey's book club selection in 2001 of The Corrections led to a much publicized feud with the talk show host. In recent years, Franzen has become recognized for his opinions on everything from social networking services such as Twitter ("the ultimate irresponsible medium") {{and the proliferation of}} e-books ("just not permanent enough") to the disintegration of Europe ("The people making the decisions in Europe are bankers. The technicians of finance are making the decisions there. It has {{very little to do with}} <b>democracy</b> <b>or</b> the will of the people") and the self-destruction of America ("almost a rogue state").|$|E
25|$|Wherein it {{concerns}} states and rulers, Plato has made interesting arguments. For instance he asks which is better—a bad <b>democracy</b> <b>or</b> a country reigned by a tyrant. He {{argues that it}} is better to be ruled by a bad tyrant, than by a bad democracy (since here all the people are now responsible for such actions, rather than one individual committing many bad deeds.) This is emphasised within the Republic as Plato describes the event of mutiny on board a ship. Plato suggests the ship's crew to be in line with the democratic rule of many and the captain, although inhibited through ailments, the tyrant. Plato's description of this event is parallel to that of democracy within the state and the inherent problems that arise.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Bakunin began warning {{friends about}} Nechayev's behavior, and broke off all {{relations}} with Nechayev. Others note, moreover, that Bakunin never sought to take personal {{control of the}} International, that his secret organisations were not subject to his autocratic power, and that he condemned terrorism as counter-revolutionary. Robert M. Cutler goes further, pointing {{out that it is}} impossible fully to understand either Bakunin's participation in the League of Peace and Freedom or the International Alliance of Socialist <b>Democracy,</b> <b>or</b> his idea of a secret revolutionary organisation that is immanent in the people, without seeing that they derive from his interpretation of Hegel's dialectic from the 1840s. The script of Bakunin's dialectic, Cutler argues, gave the Alliance the purpose of providing the International with a real revolutionary organisation.|$|E
50|$|Classical {{pluralism}} {{was criticized}} {{as it did}} not seem to apply to Westminster-style <b>democracies</b> <b>or</b> the European context. This {{led to the development of}} corporatist theories. Corporatism is the idea that a few select interest groups are actually (often formally) involved in the policy formulation process, to the exclusion of the myriad other 'interest groups'. For example, trade unions and major sectoral business associations are often consulted about (if not the drivers of) specific policies.|$|R
5000|$|The Chinese kongsi federations of Southeast Asia, {{also known}} as kongsi <b>democracies</b> <b>or</b> republics, were {{political}} entities that functioned like self-governing states. They were formed from the unions of mining kongsi (...) , commercial organizations consisting of members that provided capital and shared profits. By the mid-nineteenth century, the kongsi federations were the only states governing western Borneo. The three largest Kongsi federations in Borneo were the Lanfang Republic, the Fosjoen Federation, and the Samtiaokioe Federation.|$|R
5000|$|A Concert of <b>Democracies</b> <b>or</b> League of <b>Democracies</b> is an {{alternative}} international organization proposed by Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay in a May 2004 Washington Post op-ed. The concept is broader than a military organization, hence “concert” instead of “alliance.” In a subsequent article in The American Interest, they affirm that roughly 60 countries would qualify for membership under these criteria. They conceive such a [...] "Concert" [...] as a [...] "D-60" [...] group within the UN.|$|R
25|$|Fidel Castro {{made many}} {{statements}} insisting that Cuba is a <b>democracy</b> <b>or</b> has democratic features. In 1960, Castro {{made a speech}} to the General Assembly referring to Cuba in relation to other Latin American nations, “We are speaking of democracy. If Government is of people and democratic, people can be consulted, as we are doing here. What is more an example of pure democracy than meetings such as this one. If they cannot call such meetings they are not democracies.” Castro continued “Those who want to see people’s democracy let them come here and see this. We can speak to America and the world because we speak in names of a whole nation.” In this 1960 speech, Castro also criticized many Latin American liberal democracies, describing them as a “Pretense of democracy”, as, he claimed, they did not allow such gatherings.|$|E
25|$|Nasser, by contrast, {{thought that}} {{any talk of}} <b>democracy,</b> <b>or</b> of a multi-party system, or of the {{withdrawal}} of the army from politics, would allow the Wafd, the Muslim Brotherhood and the other political parties to regain the ground they had lost in 1952. In addition, although on paper Naguib appeared to wield a lot of power, being simultaneously president and prime minister, his authority was curtailed {{by the fact that he}} needed a majority vote of the RCC for any decision to be taken, and his opinion was often ignored by the other members of the RCC. The offices he occupied meant that Naguib was responsible for the government's decisions, even though he rarely sanctioned or supported them, and this meant that he was increasingly becoming merely the puppet of others. Eventually, Naguib presented Nasser, by now the real power in the RCC, with an ultimatum: either he was given real power, or he would resign.|$|E
25|$|Javanese kingship {{varies from}} Western kingship, which is {{essentially}} {{based on the idea}} of legitimacy from the people (<b>Democracy),</b> <b>or</b> from God (divine authority), or both. The Javanese language does not include words with these meanings. The concept of the Javanese kingdom is a mandala, or a centre of the world, in the sense of both a central location and a central being, focused on the person of the king (variously called Sri Bupati, Sri Narendra, Sang Aji, Prabu). The king is regarded as a semi-divine being, a union of divine and human aspects (binathara, the passive form of “bathara”, god). Javanese kingship is a matter of royal-divine presence, not a specific territory or population. People may come and go without interrupting the identity of a kingdom which lies in the succession of semi-divine kings. Power, including royal power is not qualitatively different from the power of dukuns or shamans, but it is much stronger. Javanese kingship is not based on the legitimacy of a single individual, since anyone can contest power by tapa or asceticism, and many did contest the kings of Mataram.|$|E

25|$|Kỳ and Thiệu were {{reluctant}} to campaign and meet the populace as they saw such events as liabilities rather than opportunities {{to win over the}} public, and showed little interest in gaining popular support in any case, as they could always count on a rigging of the ballot. The CIA reported that the pair had no intention of participating on the arranged rallies with the civilian candidates because they felt that “possible heckling from the audience that would be too humiliating.” Thiệu and Kỳ were correct; they made one public campaign appearance at a rally, where a very disapproving crowd in Huế assailed Kỳ as a “hooligan” and “cowboy leader.” Kỳ and Thiệu decided to campaign indirectly by appearing at set piece ceremonial appointments, such as transferring land titles to peasants, as hostile elements from the general population {{were less likely to be}} present. Thiệu took a restrained and more moderate stance during the campaign toward the issue of demoncracy, while Kỳ, the public face of the ticket and the incumbent government, went on the attack, damaging the pair’s image and supposed commitment to democracy. Kỳ did not hide his distaste for <b>democracy</b> <b>or</b> his opponents and “described the civilian candidates as 'ordure' , 'traitors,' and 'destroyers of the national interest.'” He continued on to say that if his opponents continued to attack him, he would cancel the poll. In the accompanying senate election, Kỳ openly endorsed 11 slates, but only one was successful in gaining one of the six seats.|$|E

500|$|Basque {{president}} José Antonio Ardanza Garro {{condemned the}} attack: [...] "attacks like this do not {{help us to}} consolidate <b>democracy</b> <b>or</b> overcome the problems of violence in our society. This attack could provoke a response and a further spiral of violence." [...] The Basque Nationalist Party voiced suspicion that the attacks {{were part of a}} dirty war being carried out by the Spanish state. Herri Batasuna, the political wing of ETA, also accused the Spanish secret services of complicity in such attacks and delivered a letter of protest to the French consulate in Bilbao, criticising the French for perceived inaction against the killers. The PSOE, at that time the governing party of Spain, condemned the incident as an attack on [...] "the freedom of the Basque people". Their chairman in the Basque Country, Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, stated that he did not believe that the solution to ETA violence was to have similar terrorists trying to even the score.|$|E
50|$|Amartya Sen {{argues in}} his book Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation (1980) that {{population}} expansion fails to cause famines or degradation as Malthusians or Neo-Malthusians argue. Instead, in documented cases a lack of political entitlement to resources that exist in abundance, causes famines in some populations. He documents how famines can occur {{even in the midst}} of plenty or in the context of low populations. He argues that famines (and environmental degradation) would only occur in non-functioning <b>democracies</b> <b>or</b> unrepresentative states.|$|R

30|$|With {{respect to}} the policy-relevant {{implications}} of existing forecasting models, one striking finding is that “partial democracies” {{were found to be}} at significantly increased risk for the onset of different types of political crises such as civil war, adverse regime changes, and political instability than either full <b>democracies</b> <b>or</b> autocracies across a range of studies [12 – 15]. Future policy-oriented research among cooperating futures institutes could thus shed further light on the question of which causal dynamics lead to instability onsets and to what extent external influences could mitigate the risk of instability onsets in these countries.|$|R
