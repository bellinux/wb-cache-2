40|$|Corpus callosotomy is a {{reasonably}} {{safe and effective}} palliative surgical procedure for some patients with intractable seizures who are not amenable to focal resection, it does not pretend to suppress seizures, but it aims at alleviating them, by reducing their severity [13, 14, 15]. This is a feasible and costeffective treatment for some patients, even those in developing countries and with limited resources [19]. It is useful for seizure control in adult and in children, particularly in children with catastrophic epilepsy syndromes. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome {{is the most common}} one and the result of seizure control is significant. Severe mental retardation is not a contraindication to perform callosotomy. As a reguard seizure type generalized seizures with fall (<b>Drop-Attack)</b> are the most responsive to callosotomy. Seizure control, when obtained, is stable over time [13]. Improved seizure control after callostomy is always associated with improved QOL, satisfaction of parents to the operation, and also satisfaction of family QOL. Significant neuropsychological deficits are evident only on formal testing, are usually ignored by patients/family members, and rarely cause impact on daily life...|$|E
40|$|Study design Multi-centre, {{prospective}} {{observational study}} Objectives Main {{objective is to}} verify the value of implantable loop recorder (ILR) in assessing the mechanism of syncope and {{the efficacy of the}} ILR-guided therapy after syncope recurrence. Inclusion criteria Patients who met the following criteria are included: suspected or definite neurally mediated syncope based on initial evaluation; {{greater than or equal to}} 3 syncope episodes in the last 2 years; severe clinical presentation of syncope requiring treatment initiation in the judgement of the investigator and age > 30 years. Exclusion criteria Patients with one or more of the following are excluded: carotid sinus syndrome; suspected or definite heart disease and high likelihood of cardiac syncope; symptomatic orthostatic hypotension diagnosed by standing blood pressure measurement; loss of consciousness different from syncope (e. g. epilepsy, psychiatric, metabolic, <b>drop-attack,</b> TIA, intoxication, cataplexy) and subclavian steal syndrome. End-points The primary end-points are the ECG-documented syncopal events and the syncope recurrences after application of ILR-guided therapy. Sample size and duration A minimum of 400 patients will be enrolled during an anticipated period of 3 years. (C) 2003 The European Society of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Aim To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of pacing therapy for preventing syncope recurrence in patients with a high probability of cardio-inhibitory neurally-mediated syncope (NMS). Methods Study design: Multi-centre, prospective, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study. Inclusion criteria: Eligible patients are at least 40 {{years of age and}} have suffered, in the prior 2 years, >= 3 syncope episodes of suspected NMS (with the exception of carotid sinus syndrome), which is considered by the attending physician to have a severe clinical presentation requiring treatment initiation. Patients with positive and negative tilt testing are included. Exclusion criteria: Patients with {{one or more of the}} following are excluded: carotid sinus syndrome; suspected or definite heart disease and high likelihood of cardiac syncope; symptomatic orthostatic hypotension diagnosed by standing blood pressure measurement; loss of consciousness different from syncope (e. g. epilepsy, psychiatric, metabolic, <b>drop-attack,</b> TIA, intoxication, cataplexy); subclavian steal syndrome. Study protocol: Eligible patients receive an Implantable Loop Recorder and are followed tilt the first documented syncopal recurrence or a significant asystolic event. Those patients who have an asystolic pause (sinus arrest or AV block) > 6 s or a syncopal asystolic pause >= 3 s receive a dual-chamber pacemaker implantation and are randomized to active therapy (Pm ON) or to placebo therapy (Pm OFF). End-points: Primary end-point is the first syncope recurrence after pacemaker implant. Sample size and duration: A maximum of 710 patients are to be enrolled during an anticipated period of 2 years to allow randomization of 60 patients in the Pm ON arm and 60 in the Pm OFF arm (total 120...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE:The {{literature}} on the efficacy and safety of rufinamide in childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes currently includes approximately 600 paediatric patients. This paper summarizes the views of a panel of experienced European epileptologists {{with regard to the}} current role of rufinamide in the treatment of childhood epilepsies. RESULTS: Rufinamide is effective in decreasing the seizure frequency in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), especially tonic and atonic seizures. It might consequently be preferred to other drugs as a second-line treatment for LGS when <b>drop-attacks</b> are frequent. The mean responder rate in the published studies is 38...|$|R
40|$|Among {{drug-resistant}} epilepsies, epileptic syndromes, {{characterized by}} combination of {{several types of}} seizures, {{are considered to be}} the most difficult in terms of treatment. Lennoxâ€“Gastaut syndrome is one of them. It manifests with polymorphic seizures (tonic axial, myatonic, atypical absence seizures, status epilepticus of minor motor seizures, myoclonic, generalized convulsive, and focal seizures). This is a heterogeneous disease, represented by a complex of clinical and electroencephalographic manifestations with various etiology. Current review is devoted to a novel antiepileptic drug rufinamide, which has a new mechanism of action. The drug has been registered in Russia in 2015. The authors also describe their own experience of rufinamide usage in the treatment of drug-resistant focal epilepsy as a part of multicomponent therapy for polymorphic seizures. One patient achieved clinical remission for 16 months; the second one had more than 50 % decrease in seizures frequency with a remission of <b>drop-attacks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective Available {{data on the}} {{efficacy}} of lacosamide in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) are scarce and controversial. We present our experience with lacosamide therapy in children affected by LGS. Material and Methods Medical charts of all children affected by LGS receiving oral lacosamide adjunctive therapy in six paediatric neurology centres were retrospectively evaluated. Efficacy was determined according to the frequency of countable seizures during the 4 weeks prior to treatment and the frequency in the last 4 weeks of observation. Patients whose seizure frequency was reduced by at least 50 % were defined as responders. Results Eighteen children (mean age 12. 3 years) were identified. After a mean follow-up period of 9 months, 33 % of patients were responders. None of them was seizure-free during the study period. The overall seizure reduction rate was 29 %. The percentage reductions from baseline in tonic seizures and <b>drop-attacks</b> rates were 31 % and 20 %, respectively. Adverse reactions occurred in 44 % of patients. The drug was discontinued in four (22 %) patients because of increased seizure frequency (three cases) and walking instability (another patient). Conclusions A third of children with LGS were responders after lacosamide adjunctive therapy. Although caution is still necessary when the drug is used in children with LGS, our preliminary observations suggest that lacosamide might be effective and represent a possible therapeutic option in children affected by LGS...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{report on}} the first multicenter Italian {{experience}} with rufinamide as adjunctive drug in children, {{adolescents and young adults}} with refractory childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathies other than Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Methods: Thirty-eight patients (19 males, 19 females), aged between 4 and 34 (mean 13. 7 +/- 8. 3, median 12. 5), all affected by different types of childhood-onset refractory epileptic encephalopathies other than Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, were treated with rufinamide as adjunctive drug for a mean period of 11. 4 months (range 3 - 26 months). Results: Fifteen of 38 patients (39. 5 %) had a >= 50 % seizure reduction in countable seizures. Complete seizure freedom was achieved in one of these patients (2. 6 %). Three patients (7. 9 %) had a 25 - 49 % seizure reduction, whilst seizure frequency remained unchanged in 15 (39. 5 %) and increased in five patients (13. 1 %). Eleven patients (28. 9 %) reported adverse side effects. Vomiting was reported in five patients (13. 1 %); drowsiness, decreased appetite and irritability with migraine manifested in other four patients. They were transient and mild in all cases. Conclusion: Rufinamide may be an effective and well-tolerated adjunctive drug for the treatment of refractory childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathies other than Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Rufinamide was most effective in patients with <b>drop-attacks</b> and (bi) frontal spike-wave discharges...|$|R
