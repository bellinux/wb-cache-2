40|$|Three demonstrations are presented, that {{highlight}} {{the need for}} interprocedural analyses such as preconditions and exact array regions, inorder to parallelize loops that contain subroutine calls or temporary arrays. These analyses are provided by PIPS in an interactive environment. 1 Interprocedural Parallelization AILE is an application from the ONERA, the French institute of aerospatial research. It has more than 3000 lines of FORTRAN code. It has been slightly modi ed to test the coherence of some input values. The aim of this demonstration {{is to show that}} interprocedural analyses are necessary for an automatic parallelization. For that purpose, we have chosen the subroutine (or module) EXTR, which is called by the module GEOM, itself called by the main routine AILE. An excerpt is given in Figure 1 (without the <b>intermediate</b> <b>call</b> to GEOM). 1. 1 EXT...|$|E
40|$|Ontogenetic {{changes and}} sexual {{differences}} in the acoustic structure of green woodhoopoe (Phoeniculus purpureus) ‘kek ’ calls were investigated in a wild population. At fledging, the calls {{of males and females}} were indistinguishable in terms of fundamental frequency, frequency modulation, peak frequency and call duration. After 3 - 5 months, however, the male voice ‘broke ’ (i. e. underwent a significant decrease in fundamental frequency), while there was no change in female call structure. Consequently, the fundamental frequency of adult male calls was 48 % lower than that of adult females, and there was no overlap in the call frequencies of the sexes in adulthood. The change in male voice occurred within a 2 - 3 week period and no <b>intermediate</b> <b>call</b> frequencies were recorded. The timing of the voice break did not correspond with a change in overall body size, suggesting that growth of the syrinx was not the proximate cause. However, it did coincide with the stage in development when male bill length grew to exceed that of all females and when males began to lose their distinctive brown throat patch, providing some indirect evidence that hormonal control may be important. 1...|$|E
40|$|Data {{throughput}} is {{an important}} metric used in the performance evaluation {{of the next generation}} cellular networks such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced. To evaluate the performance of these networks, Monte Carlo simulation schemes are usually used. Such simulations do not provide the throughput of <b>intermediate</b> <b>call</b> state, instead it gives the overall performance of the network. We propose a hybrid model consisting of both analysis and simulation. The benefit of the model is that the throughput of any possible call state in the system can be evaluated. Here, the probability of possible call distribution is first obtained by analysis, which is used as input to the event-driven based simulator to calculate the throughput of a call state. We compare the throughput obtained from our hybrid model with that obtained from event-driven based simulation. Numerical results are presented and show good agreement between both the proposed hybrid model and the simulation. The maximum difference of relative throughput between our hybrid model and the simulation is found in the interval of(0. 04 %; 1. 06 %) over a range of call arrival rates, meanholding times and number of resource blocks in the system...|$|E

40|$|Background: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe {{amplification}} (MLPA) is {{a powerful}} tool to identify genomic polymorphisms. We have previously developed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and large sequence polymorphisms (LSP) -based MLPA assay using a read out on a liquid bead array to screen for 47 genetic markers in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. In our assay we obtain information regarding the Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineage and drug resistance simultaneously. Previously we called {{the presence or absence}} of a genotypic marker based on a threshold signal level. Here we present a more elaborate data analysis method to standardize and streamline the interpretation of data generated by MLPA. The new data analysis method also identifies intermediate signals in addition to classification of signals as positive and negative. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>calls</b> can be informative with respect to identifying the simultaneous presence of sensitive and resistant alleles or infection with multiple different Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Results: To validate our analysis method 100 DNA isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis extracted from cultured patient material collected at the National TB Reference Laboratory of the National Center for Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases in Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia were tested by MLPA. The data generated were interpreted blindly and then compared to results obtained by reference methods.

40|$|The vocal {{repertoire}} of the Azure Jay Cyanocorax caeruleus (Vieillot, 1818) is approached from a quali-quantitative point of view. The qualitative analysis {{was carried out}} both {{in the field and}} in captivity: the quantitative analysis was made only in captivity. Social acoustic communication in the Azure Jay is achieved through the use of two types of call: basic and <b>intermediate</b> <b>calls.</b> Fourteen basic calls are identified and presented through sonograms: the sotto voce song (courtship call) is related only to courtship and the social call is interpreted as the song in the Azure Jay. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>calls</b> are recombinations of the basic calls uttered during an alteration in motivation level. Examples of them are presented through sonograms of vocalizations recorded during mobbing predators and intraspecific agonistic contexts. The social, social-alarm, contact, flight, proximity, threat and social identity calls were those most frequently uttered by daylight: the other calls represented around 15 % {{of the total number of}} utterances. The hypothesis of the evolution in American Jays, which tends to simplification of vocal repertoire (HARDY, 1961; 1969), is analysed; C. caeruleus seems to have a small actively-used repertoire...|$|R
