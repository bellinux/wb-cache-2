40|$|We {{show that}} the {{problems}} of <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> an arbitrary graph has a k-regular subgraph, for some given k 3; of <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a planar graph has a quartic subgraph; and of <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a planar graph has a quintic subgraph, are complete for NP via logspace reductions. There are no regular planar graphs of degree greater than 5. 1 Introduction Regular graphs have been extensively studied from a structural point of view (e. g., [1]) but negligible {{research has been done}} on <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a given graph contains, as a subgraph (not necessarily induced), a regular subgraph of some degree different from 3 : the only case studied in the past is that where the regular subgraph should have degree 3 (i. e., it should be cubic). The result that <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a graph contains a cubic subgraph is NP-complete was attributed to Chv`atal in [5], and was expanded upon in [6], where it was shown that the problem of <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a planar graph of degree at most 7 has a cubic subgraph is [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a 3 -regular graph has a {{hamiltonian}} cycle (or path) was proved NP-complete. In this paper, we prove that for any fixed k⩾ 3, <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a k-regular graph has a hamiltonian cycle (or path) is a NP-complete problem. When the k-regular graph is planar, <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> the graph has a hamiltonian cycle (or path) was proved NP-complete for k = 3 and polynomial for k⩾ 6.
