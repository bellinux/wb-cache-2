In particular, {{the effect of the}} olives delivery on the power consumption and quality of the extracted oil has been studied. The experimental trials, carried out on a laboratory plant during the 1993 - 94 and 1994 - 95 olive-oil seasons, show that, even though the diagram of power consumption has a parabolic increasing trend, the specific power decreases with the olives delivery. Anyway, studying the olives hammer crushing process also from the qualitative point of view (polyphenols number, acidity, peroxide number and induction time), it is possible to define an optimal range of olives delivery values.

UCSNPs were synthesized from discarded coconut shells (CSs) using top down approach. The sundried CSs were crushed, ground and then sieved using <b>hammer</b> <b>crusher,</b> a two disc grinder and set of sieves with shine shaker respectively. The CS powders retained in the pan below 37 µm sized sieve were milled for 70 hours to obtain UCSNPS. Samples for analysis were taken at 16 and 70 hours. UCSNPs were analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) with attached EDS and Gwyddion software. Samples of UCSNPs obtained at 16 and 70 hours show that the deep brown colour of the initial CS powder became fading as the milling hour increased. The size determination from TEM image revealed spherical particles with an average size of 18. 23 nm for UCSNPs obtained at 70 hour milling. The EDS spectrographs revealed {{an increase in the}} carbon counts with increased milling hours. This is attributable to dryness of the CS powders by the heat generated during the milling process due to absorption of kinetic energy by the CS powders from the milling balls.

30|$|Thermal {{desorption}} {{disposal of}} oily cuttings has attracted attention {{because of its}} advantages of high efficiency, less secondary pollution, strong adaptability of raw materials, and reusable of processed products (Jones et al. 2002; Stephenson et al. 2004; Júnior et al. 2017). For on-site continuous processing, heating mode and material carrier are two important technical links of the thermal desorption unit (TDU). Brandt Co. developed two basic types of thermal desorption units: the indirect fired rotary kiln type, and the screw or paddle type which used a heat transfer fluid (Pierce et al. 2006). The fuel for indirect fired is diesel or the recovered oil from oily cuttings, while the environmental regulatory agency might think that secondary pollution would be caused by combustion. The temperature carrying of the heat transfer fluid is limited, and the industrial heat transfer oil maximum operating temperature is usually around 350  °C. This temperature is only marginally hot to remove oil from raw materials to an acceptable limit. The thermomechanical cuttings cleaner (TCC) is another type of thermal desorption system, which adopts frictional heating (Murray et al. 2008). The TCC has a <b>hammer</b> mill, which <b>crushes</b> cuttings and generates heat by friction {{during the process of}} <b>hammering</b> and <b>crushing.</b> The friction heat generated by the hammer mill can make the cuttings temperature up to 300  °C. The oil phase with high boiling point might be difficult to remove due to the limited friction heating temperature, and the adaptability of materials is limited. Microwave heating of thermal desorption is another method that attracts more attention by researchers (Robinson et al. 2008; Falciglia and Vagliasindi 2015; Júnior et al. 2017). Microwave heating is a direct heating method with highly efficient, and the material is heated evenly. The absorption of microwave energy by materials affects the efficiency of liquid phases desorption. The physical and chemical properties of the materials and the dielectric constant of pollutants have great influence on microwave energy absorption (Falciglia et al. Falciglia and Vagliasindi 2015; Petri et al. 2017). Therefore, microwave heating has great selectivity for material composition. It is especially effective for the heating of polar compounds.|$|R
