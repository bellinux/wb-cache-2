2500|$|The money {{multiplier}} is a heuristic used {{to demonstrate the}} maximum amount of broad money that could be created by commercial banks for a given fixed amount of base money and reserve ratio. This theoretical maximum is never reached, because some <b>eligible</b> <b>reserves</b> are held as cash outside of banks. Rather than holding the quantity of base money fixed, central banks have recently pursued an interest rate target to control bank issuance of credit indirectly so the ceiling implied by the {{money multiplier}} does not impose a limit on money creation in practice.|$|E
50|$|The {{request for}} 2017 amounts to $48.8 billion. The system has 9.4 million beneficiaries, {{including}} active, retired, and <b>eligible</b> <b>Reserve</b> Component {{military personnel and}} their families, and dependent survivors.|$|R
50|$|The Reds signed Smith to a one-year, $400,000 {{contract}} on March 3, 2010. Smith was promoted from Carolina to the Cincinnati Reds on June 15. He was optioned to Triple-A Louisville, but {{returned to the}} Reds as a September call-up. Smith {{did not make the}} Reds 25-man post season roster, but is an <b>eligible</b> <b>reserve.</b>|$|R
25|$|All Israelis {{who served}} in the IDF and are under the age of 40, unless {{otherwise}} exempt, are <b>eligible</b> for <b>reserve</b> duty. However, only those who completed at least 20 days of reserve duty within the past three years are considered active reservists.|$|R
50|$|Participation {{is open to}} any club {{registered}} with the Polish FA, {{regardless of whether it}} competes in any league in the national pyramid. Reserve and veteran teams are also <b>eligible,</b> with <b>reserve</b> teams reaching the final on two occasions (and winning it once). The Cup is popular among lower level teams, as it gives them a chance to play better known sides. In some cases, the underdogs even reached the final, with the most famous example being Czarni Żagań, which in 1964-1965 season lost the final game 0-4 to Górnik Zabrze.|$|R
50|$|The Reserve Special Commendation Ribbon {{was issued}} to any {{officer of the}} Naval Reserve who had {{commanded}} a Naval Reserve Battalion for a period exceeding four years. To be <b>eligible</b> for the <b>Reserve</b> Special Commendation Ribbon, an officer must also have served greater than ten years in the Naval Reserve as a whole.|$|R
25|$|Not <b>eligible</b> {{for grants}} <b>reserved</b> for US built vessels, {{the ship is}} visible from and moored to Hyde Street Pier but is not {{open to the public}} for boarding. Despite this it is in a {{superior}} condition to , a similar paddle tug built in Scotland in 1931, currently lying at Chatham awaiting funds for restoration, having been sunk in 1994 and then salvaged some years later.|$|R
50|$|Like JROTC, the Army NDCC {{was founded}} {{following}} the National Defense Act of 1916. The National Defense Act of 1916 authorized Senior ROTC for colleges and Junior ROTC for high schools. The Army was to supply uniforms, equipment, and instructors (active duty members for colleges and active or retired members for high schools). At the time, JROTC graduates would earn certificates making them <b>eligible</b> for a <b>reserve</b> commission {{at the age}} of 21.|$|R
25|$|Although still {{available}} for call-up {{in times of}} crisis, most Israeli men, and virtually all women, do not actually perform reserve service in any given year. In 2015, only 26% of the population <b>eligible</b> for <b>reserve</b> duty held an active reserve status. The IDF has reduced the amount of reserve soldiers called up to improve efficiency and cut costs. Units do not always call up all of their reservists every year, {{and a variety of}} exemptions are available if called for regular reserve service. Virtually no exemptions exist for reservists called up in a time of crisis, but experience has shown that in such cases (most recently, the 2014 Operation Protective Edge) exemptions are rarely requested or exercised; units generally achieve recruitment rates above those considered fully manned.|$|R
50|$|Born in Genoa, Liguria region, Sampietro {{started his}} career {{at one of the}} two Serie A club of the city — U.C. Sampdoria. In summer 2012 Sampietro was no longer <b>eligible</b> to the <b>reserve</b> as underage player, as the rule had changed from U20 to U19 event, thus, born 1992 and 1993 players were left the reserve at the same time. On 31 August 2012 Sampietro joined Portogruaro along with Simone Patacchiola. The club also loaned several players from Sampdoria. Sampietro made his debut {{in the second round of}} 2012-13 Lega Pro Prima Divisione. (Portogruaro did not had fixture in round 1 due to 17 teams in Group A of the division).|$|R
50|$|In mid-2008 Degeri {{returned}} to Cremona for Cremonese Allievi U17 team in temporary deal. The team was eliminated by Inter {{in the round}} of 16, which Inter was the losing finalists that season. Degeri's deal was renewed in 2009. He scored 17 goals in Campionato Berretti for Cremonese reserve. Degeri was promoted to the first team in 2010 after the club signed him in co-ownership deal for €500. Degeri was also <b>eligible</b> to the <b>reserve</b> of Cremonese until 2011. He collected 16 presences during the season 2012-2013 playing with Cremonese. He loaned to Pavia from September to January collecting 9 presences and a goal. In January 2014, he was loaned to Rimini.|$|R
40|$|Only about 28 {{percent of}} the 177, 023 enlisted losses to the Active Army in FY 1993 either {{transferred}} to the Reserve Components (RC) or had completed all of their obligated service and were <b>eligible</b> for <b>reserve</b> service (RE). Of these 48, 000 RC and RE losses, 41, 000 were in paygrades E 4 and E 5, the target pool for USAR Troop Program Unit (TPU) prior service recruiting. Only 28 percent of RC and RE E 4 [...] E 5 s had an occupation considered a priority for TPU readiness. A typical Active Army loss to the RC was a single white male E 4 from the South census region with almost four years of service. He {{was a high school}} graduate in mental group category I-IIIA and had initially entered the Army for a four year term. A typical RE loss was a white male E 5 with nine years of service. He was older and more likely to be married with dependents, but was similar in other respects to his RC counterpart. Neither was in a reserve priority occupation. Women made up less than 20 percent of both groups. Blacks were more strongly represented and Hispanics less strongly represented among RC and RE losses than among the comparable civilian population.

50|$|Tricare Reserve Retired is a premium-based {{health plan}} that {{qualified}} retired {{members of the}} National Guard and Reserve {{under the age of}} 60 may purchase for themselves and eligible family members. Established in 2008 and opened for enrollment in 2010, it is similar to Tricare Reserve Select (TRS), but differs in that there is no premium cost-sharing with DoD as there is with TRS. As such, retired Reserve Component members who elect to purchase TRR must pay the full cost (100%) of the calculated premium plus an additional administrative fee. Payments could range as high as $900.00 a month. Although open to all <b>eligible</b> retired <b>Reserve</b> Component personnel under the age of 60, the program's principal focus is often perceived as being focused on recent Reserve Component retirees who are self-employed or otherwise ineligible for civilian employer provided/subsidized health insurance, especially those who were mobilized for full-time active duty service subsequent to 11 September 2001 in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn and/or Noble Eagle. Retired Reserve Component personnel who elect to participate in TRR will exit TRR when the service member reaches age 60 and he/she and their eligible dependent family members become eligible for the same Tricare Standard, Tricare Extra or Tricare Prime options as Active Component retirees and, in the case of Tricare Prime, at the same cost as Active Component retirees. Qualification questions should be referred to Tricare.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} reserve {{requirements}} of OECD countries. Reserve requirements are the minimum percentages or amounts of liabilities that depository institutions {{are required to}} keep in cash or as deposits with their central banks. To facilitate monetary policy implementation, twenty-four of the thirty OECD countries impose reserve requirements to influence their banking systems’ demand for liquidity. These include twelve OECD countries that are also members of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and twelve non-EMU OECD countries. All EMU countries employ a single reserve requirement system, which is treated as one entity.; The reserve requirement system {{for each of the}} twelve non-EMU countries is discussed separately. The similarities and differences among the thirteen reserve requirement systems are highlighted. The features of reserve requirements covered include: reservable liabilities, required reserve ratios, reserve computation periods, reserve maintenance periods, types of reserve requirements, calculations of required <b>reserves,</b> <b>eligible</b> assets for satisfying reserve requirements, remuneration on reserve balances, non-compliance penalties, carry-over of reserve balances, and required clearing balances.

50|$|Not <b>eligible</b> {{for grants}} <b>reserved</b> for US built vessels, {{the ship is}} visible from and moored to Hyde Street Pier but is not {{open to the public}} for boarding. Despite this it is in a {{superior}} condition to , a similar paddle tug built in Scotland in 1931, currently lying at Chatham awaiting funds for restoration, having been sunk in 1994 and then salvaged some years later. Reliant was dismantled by the National Maritime Museum and sectioned for display in pride of place in the Museum's Neptune Hall, where it remained on display until 2005. The tug was then controversially removed and scrapped as a cost reduction exercise, with only a single engine and a sectioned representation of one paddle wheel remaining on display (as had been originally intended back in 1969). Further controversy followed as members of the public complained to have been told that the tug, having been visited by many during its nearly 25 years on display, had been put into 'storage' when this was not the case.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Milan, Lombardy, Daldosso {{started his}} {{professional}} career at Lombard side Monza. He played 6 games in 2000-01 Serie B. In June 2001 Daldosso, Daniele Degano, Massimo Ganci and Cristian Maggioni {{were sold to}} Parma in co-ownership deal for 1 billion each (€516,457), which made Monza had a player selling revenue of 8 billion lire (€4,131,655) to boost the financial situation of 2000-01 financial year. Daldosso, Degano, Ganci and Maggioni were also returned to Monza in temporary deal for the 2001-02 Serie C1 season. As a player <b>eligible</b> to both <b>reserve</b> and first team, Daldosso played 7 times that season. Monza relegated again in May 2002 {{as the last of}} group A. In June 2002 Daldosso and Ganci were sold back to Monza for undisclsoed fee; co-currently, Degano and Maggioni were signed by Parma outright for undisclosed fee. However both Daldosso and Ganci left Monza in new temporary deal while Maggioni returned to Monza in temporary deal. Daldosso played 19 games for Alessandria in 2002-03 Serie C2. Alessandria finished as the last of group A and Monza seventh of the same group. On 1 July 2003 the loan expired and Daldosso returned to Monza. He played one game less comparing to the last season for Monza, which saw Monza finished eighth of the group. However the club also bankrupted during the season, which the license of the club was transferred to new company [...] "AC Monza Brianza 1912 SpA" [...] from [...] "Calcio Monza SpA". Under new ownership, Daldosso was released.|$|R
