5|$|Each half of {{the pitch}} is then divided again by a line, {{referred}} to as the 23metre line or 25yard line, positioned 22.90m from each back line. Historically, this was first used to resume play after the ball passed over the back line and marked by flags {{at the side of the}} pitch. In 1949, deliberate defensive offenses in this area resulted in a penalty corner. From 1961, players on the defensive team who were not involved at the penalty corner stood behind this line (this was then moved to the half-way line two years later). The line was also used for the offside rule between 1987 until the rule was abolished in 1996. Nowadays, there are <b>detailed</b> <b>rules</b> regarding fouls and free-hits in the 23metre region of the pitch. Since 2015, the 23metre line has also been used for the attacking team to resume play when it has gone over the back line (this replaced long corners).|$|E

25|$|Roman law {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by Greek philosophy, but its <b>detailed</b> <b>rules</b> were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated. Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the Roman Empire, law was adapted {{to cope with the}} changing social situations and underwent major codification under Theodosius II and Justinian I. Although codes were replaced by custom and case law during the Dark Ages, Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin legal maxims (called brocards) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of precedent which later became the common law. A Europe-wide Law Merchant was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property. As nationalism grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The Napoleonic and German Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging. EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the European Court of Justice.|$|E

500|$|The {{manufacturing}} processes {{of both the}} boxes and the parchment scrolls are intricate and governed by hundreds of <b>detailed</b> <b>rules.</b> In earlier Talmudic times, tefillin were either cylindrical or cubical, but later the cylindrical form became obsolete. Nowadays the boxes should be fashioned from {{a single piece of}} animal hide and form a base with an upper compartment to contain the parchment scrolls. They are made in varying levels of quality. The most basic form, called peshutim ("simple"), are made using several pieces of parchment to form the inner walls of the head tefillin. The higher quality tefillin, namely dakkot ("thin"), made by stretching a thin piece of leather, and the more durable gassot ("thick") are both fashioned from the single piece of hide. Black leather straps (retsu'ot) pass through the rear of the base and are used to secure the tefillin onto the body. On both sides of the head-tefillin, the Hebrew letter shin (...) is moulded; the shin on the wearer's left side has four branches instead of three. The knot of the head-tefillin strap forms the letter dalet (...) or double dalet (...) (known as the square-knot) while the strap that is passed through the arm-tefillin is formed into a knot {{in the shape of the}} letter yud (...)
