500|$|... "True social-cost pricing of {{metropolitan}} travel {{has proven to}} be a theoretical ideal that so far has eluded real-world implementation. The primary obstacle is that except for professors of transportation economics and a cadre of vocal environmentalists, <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> in favor of considerably higher charges for peak-period travel. Middle-class motorists often complain they already pay too much in gasoline taxes and registration fees to drive their cars, and that to pay more during congested periods would add insult to injury. In the United States, few politicians are willing to champion the cause of congestion pricing for fear of reprisal from their constituents. Critics also argue that charging more to drive is elitist policy, pricing the poor off of roads so that the wealthy can move about unencumbered. It is for all these reasons that peak-period pricing remains a pipe dream in the minds of many." ...|$|E

After Mercedes' {{stalking}} of Mitzeee, Stephen went on to say: [...] "No one could deny that Mercedes has had one heck of an exciting life. Siege victim, kidnap victim, depressive, stalker..." [...] Stephen urged Mercedes to realise that [...] "there are other guys in the world apart from Riley. True, you've had them all, but you could simply start going round the circuit again". She added that Mercedes does not have much to lose in her life. After her stalking of Mitzeee, Mercedes went on to stab herself, on this Carena Crawford of All About Soap said the episode itself was a [...] "huge shocker" [...] due to Mercedes' actions. Crawford added that when Mercedes realises she will be blamed for knocking Mitzeee unconscious she sees the knife and [...] "mad Mercedes {{came up with the}} perfect plan and we winced as she plunged the blade into her own stomach, knowing everyone would think Mitzeee did it!

500|$|The {{concept for}} using an {{underwater}} theme park as the game's setting {{came from a}} conversation Uchikoshi had with a friend, who mentioned it being nice to be in Disneyland parks when it is raining, as very <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> there then, making it feel like the park is reserved to oneself. Uchikoshi agreed that empty theme parks are nice, and considered setting the game in an empty theme park on land, but moved it underwater after realizing that the characters could escape by climbing the fence and that some further obstacle was needed. This setting, described by Uchikoshi as [...] "you're trapped somewhere and trying to escape", was made to embody two of humanity's instinctive desires: the unconscious desire {{to return to the}} safety of one's mother's womb and shut oneself away from the world, and the desire to escape from and overcome one's current condition. German elements were used a lot in the game's setting, including German terminology. This was decided on for multiple reasons: the developers thought that English was [...] "too ordinary", and when they decided to use the pharmaceutical company Leiblich in the story, they also thought that Germany and Switzerland were known for pharmaceuticals. Additionally, Uchikoshi had visited Germany and was influenced by the 1999 animated film , and how the friend he had the theme park conversation with spoke German. Each of the game's heroines were assigned a related attraction in the park, where their [...] "impactful events" [...] would occur. The one exception was Coco, as [...] "her speech and conduct was already as delightful as an attraction".|$|E

If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It’s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols.

That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say “Subtract income tax from pay” instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols.

2500|$|The {{people of}} Mukurweini are mainly farmers and whereas coffee {{is the main}} cash crop in the area, most of them {{practice}} subsistence farming due to {{the small size of}} family holdings. The north-west tip of the District adjacent to Othaya has a few farmers who grow tea. The area is well endowed and has several permanent rivers and numerous springs and streams. The include Rwarai, Gura, Mugono, Thagana, Gikira, Ndurumo, Thiha, Gathera and Ithanji rivers. There is however very little irrigation activity in spite of the dry spells which are now more frequent. The failure to harness these abundant water resources for irrigated farm production is a draw back to District's economic development and food self security. The Division does not experience extreme weather-related disasters beyond occasional droughts. Wajee Nature Park, a bird conservancy, located in Giathugu Location is a good site for all nature and bird watchers. There are a number of falls along Rwarai river with scenic beauty and area sight to behold. The river valleys in Mukurweini are home to many bird species a number of which are preserved at Wajee Nature Park. The camp has a high class restaurant and Boarding facilities which include pitched luxury tents. The lower parts of the Division particularly Rutune and Thanu Locations have sandy loam soils which are not conducive to subsistence farming. A <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> however involved in the growing of tobacco in the area. There is also an upcoming trade in the clay soil that is being used in Nairobi for manufacture of ceramic products ...|$|E
