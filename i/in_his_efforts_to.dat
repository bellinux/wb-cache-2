5|$|As a {{minister}} of finance, Banza directed {{much of his}} energy and time into lifting the country out of bankruptcy. Banza was also successful <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> build the government's reputation abroad, all the while establishing himself as a respected and well-liked leader. Many believed that the natural-born leader would not remain as Bokassa's right-hand man for much longer. After Banza was promoted from Captain to Lieutenant Colonel in 1965, Bokassa realized that his greatest political threat wasn't from the remaining group of Dacko supporters, but from Banza himself.|$|E
5|$|Events of {{the later}} years of the reign showed that Constantinople itself was not safe from barbarian incursions from the north, and even the {{relatively}} benevolent historian Menander Protector {{felt the need to}} attribute the Emperor's failure to protect the capital to the weakness of his body in his old age. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> renew the Roman Empire, Justinian dangerously stretched its resources while failing {{to take into account the}} changed realities of 6th-century Europe.|$|E

The bishops' castles refused to {{surrender}} to the king, therefore Stephen threatened to starve Alexander and Roger until they did. Sleaford and Newark surrendered and were given into the custody of Robert, the Earl of Leicester. Earl Robert also seized some of Lincoln's episcopal estates that had been disputed between the earl and the bishop. Alexander subsequently excommunicated Earl Robert when the earl refused to return the castle to Alexander's custody. Alexander then successfully applied to Pope Innocent II in 1139 for support <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> recover Newark castle from Earl Robert.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Kerst {{worked at}} General Electric Company for a year, {{working on the}} {{development}} of x-ray tubes and machines. He found this frustrating, as x-ray research required high energies that could not be produced at the time. In 1938 he accepted an offer of an instructorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where the head of the physics department, F. Wheeler Loomis encouraged Kerst <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> create a better particle accelerator. The result of these efforts was the betatron. When it became operational on July 15, 1940, Kerst became the first person to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction, reaching energies of 2.3 MeV.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> {{intercept}} {{the convoy}} at anchor, Willaumez determined {{to meet it}} at sea, sailing to the Bahama Banks. There {{he waited for the}} convoy, seizing any ships that came within sight of his squadron, including neutral vessels, in case they revealed his position. For several weeks Willaumez's lookouts saw nothing, the British holding the convoy back until they obtained some information about the location of the French squadron. During the night of 31 July, bored with waiting for the convoy, Captain Jérôme Bonaparte sailed northwards away from the squadron, acting without orders or even notifying his admiral. When dawn broke on 1 August, Willaumez was panicked by the disappearance of Vétéran and, assuming that the ship had somehow been accidentally separated, began to search for the missing vessel and its important commander.|$|E

5|$|Ganteaume's {{surviving}} squadron gradually outran Keith's pursuit and on 24 June was sailing off Cape Derna when a sail was sighted to the northeast. Ganteaume {{ordered his}} ships to pursue, {{and the strange}} ship was discovered to be the British ship of the line HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell, which had been despatched by Keith to warn Warren's squadron that Ganteaume was in the Eastern Mediterranean. Although he attempted a series of increasingly desperate manoeuveres <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> escape, Hallowell's ship was in poor repair and under-crewed and after a short exchange of fire, was forced to surrender. Without any warning, Warren {{was not able to}} intercept Ganteaume's return, and the French squadron was able to reach Toulon unharmed on 22 July.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{with the}} 1932–33 series in mind, the {{selectors}} had appointed Jardine as England's captain. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> build a strategy whereby he could threaten the Australian supremacy, the new captain consulted widely. Along with other observers, including Duckworth (who had kept wicket for England during the 1930 Oval Test) {{he thought that}} Bradman showed a dislike for fast, rising balls, and had been shaken when one such delivery from Larwood had {{hit him in the}} chest. This matter had been widely discussed among cricketers; a clip of film from the Oval match appeared to confirm that Bradman had flinched. This, to Jardine, suggested the basis of a plan: a sustained attack of fast leg theory that might unsettle not just Bradman but the Australian batsmen generally.|$|E

5|$|Netherlandish artists found {{increasingly}} inventive ways {{to highlight}} and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored {{the interplay between}} the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text. An example is the Nassau book of hours (c.1467–80) by the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy, in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland (possibly Gerard Horenbout), known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred {{the line between the}} miniature and its border, frequently using both <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> advance the narrative of his scenes.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1798 a British {{fleet of}} 13 ships {{of the line}} and one fourth rate ship under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson {{discovered}} a French fleet of 13 ships {{of the line and}} four frigates at anchor in Aboukir Bay on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. Nelson had been in pursuit of the French for three months, crossing the Mediterranean three times <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> locate the fleet and a convoy under its protection which carried the French army commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte intended for the invasion of Egypt. The convoy successfully eluded Nelson and the army landed at Alexandria on 31 June, capturing the city and advancing inland. The fleet was too large to anchor in Alexandria harbour and instead Bonaparte ordered its commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers to take up station in Aboukir Bay.|$|E
5|$|The episode's story {{focuses on}} married couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). In late 2004, on the island, they debate whether to defect to the rival faction of {{survivors}} led by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn). Intercut throughout the episode, {{a series of}} off-island scenes show Sun about to give birth and Jin experiencing a series of difficulties <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> reach {{the hospital with a}} gift of a stuffed panda. The ending shows that Jin's and Sun's scenes do not focus on the same birth; Jin's scenes are flashbacks to events before the plane crash, while Sun's are flashforwards to sometime after she escapes the island. A subplot follows Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) on board the Kahana, where they learn more about the freighter's mission and find somebody they once knew.|$|E

5|$|Although Mapenor's time as bishop was short– {{just over}} two years– over 20 of his {{charters}} survive. These include a number for Leominster Priory and Reading Abbey. He also dealt with a dispute over the rights of a Norman abbey, Lyre Abbey, over churches it possessed in the diocese of Hereford, settling it by making the churches part of a prebend in Hereford Cathedral held by the abbot of Lire. Mapenor supported the new king Henry III <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> suppress the rebellion begun under Henry's father, King John. Mapenor was with {{the forces of the}} king before the Battle of Lincoln in May 1217. The bishop was also present when the king and Llywelyn of Gwynedd, a Welsh prince, concluded a peace treaty at Worcester in March 1218. The king employed Mapenor in April as a diplomatic escort, ordering the bishop to bring some of the southern Welsh princes to Woodstock to swear fealty to Henry III. In June of that year, Mapenor attended the consecration of the new Worcester Cathedral. He was the recipient of {{one of a series of}} writs sent to bishops to stop the persecution of Jews. These writs may have resulted from a decision of the king's council to oppose some acts of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, which placed restrictions on Jews.|$|E
5|$|Among Wetherby's other accomplishments {{were the}} {{creation}} of a Department of Mental Health and the construction of fifteen hospitals and thirty health centers throughout the state. In 1952, he created the Youth Authority as a central point for the administration of services to delinquent children. He constructed new state prisons, modernized the probation and parole systems, and established a more orderly system of selecting grand and petit juries. He also oversaw some voting reform measures, including the provision of funds to purchase voting machines in areas where they were desired. He was not as successful in the area of government reform. He failed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> amend the state's constitution to allow the governor to succeed himself in office. He was also unable to win support for a plan to consolidate some of Kentucky's counties. In 1955, the state's voters approved a constitutional amendment granting suffrage to eighteen-year-olds over Wetherby's objections.|$|E
5|$|Barrowclough {{rejoined the}} 6th Infantry Brigade in October 1940 and, {{disappointed}} with its quality, put considerable emphasis on training. This {{meant that it}} generally performed well during the campaign in Greece in April 1941. After {{the conclusion of the}} fighting in Greece, he refused to join in the criticism directed by some senior officers of the 2nd New Zealand Division at Freyberg's leadership during the battle. He later fought in Operation Crusader, the campaign to lift the Siege of Tobruk. At one point in the battle, his brigade captured elements of the headquarters of the Afrika Korps. However, he was impetuous <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> capture Point 175, a strategically important hill to the south of Tobruk, and this led to heavy losses in one of the battalions of his brigade. Although Point 175 was seized, Barrowclough's brigade was only able to hold it for a few days before being forced to withdraw due to German attacks. He received a Bar to his DSO for his leadership during the Crusader offensive, having already been awarded the Greek War Cross and a mention in despatches for his work in Greece.|$|E

5|$|During {{the wars}} against Napoleonic France, Gibraltar served {{first as a}} Royal Navy base from which {{blockades}} of the ports of Cádiz, Cartagena and Toulon were mounted, then as a gateway for British forces and supplies in the Peninsular War between 1807 and 1814. In July 1801 a French and Spanish naval force fought the two Battles of Algeciras off Gibraltar, which ended in disaster for the Spanish when two of their largest warships each mistook the other for the enemy, engaged each other, collided, caught fire and exploded, killing nearly 2,000 Spanish sailors. Two years later Gibraltar served {{as a base for}} Lord Nelson <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> bring the French Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve to battle, which culminated in the Battle of Trafalgar in which Nelson was killed and Villeneuve captured. Nelson sailed to Gibraltar in June 1803 to launch the Trafalgar Campaign and oversee the blockades against France and Spain, though he spent little time ashore. On 28 October 1805, a week after the Battle of Trafalgar, the badly damaged HMS Victory returned to Gibraltar with Nelson's body aboard; Admiral Collingwood's dispatch to General Fox, announcing the victory and Nelson's death, was printed {{in the pages of the}} Gibraltar Chronicle. It thus became the first newspaper in the world to report the victory at Trafalgar, two weeks ahead of The Times.|$|E

He contested the federal election {{as a candidate for}} the Nationalist Party of Australia on 13 December 1919. He achieved the greatest popular vote of any Victorian candidate for the Senate. Moreover, he repeated this success at the 1925 election. Although not naturally suited to life in the federal parliament, he made significant contributions, and was outspoken <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> assist returned servicemen, particularly those with whom he had served. This outspokenness often took the form of arguing in the Senate in relation to the new legislation being brought before it, when such legislation involved the defence forces.

5|$|To do this, Rincewind is told to {{discover}} who they are, and recover a golden item from each, since these items {{are what they}} use to control the dragon. Learning that a book about summoning dragons had been stolen from the library at Unseen University the night before, Rincewind gains access to L-Space, allowing him to journey into the past, witness the theft, and follow the thief back to the brotherhood's hideout. After gaining entry in disguise, Rincewind learns that each member holds {{a role in the}} city — Chucky the Fool, the Thief, the Mason, the Chimney Sweep, the Fishmonger, and the Dunny King — and seeks to change the city so they can have a better future for themselves. Acquiring their golden items, Rincewind brings them to the dragon, only to learn it will not return to its dimension but seek revenge on the brotherhood before coming after him. Wishing to stop this, Rincewind decides to prevent the summoning book from being stolen, by switching it for one that makes love custard. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> be recognised for stopping the dragon, Rincewind gets into an argument with the Patrician over the existence of dragons, summoning the very same one back to Discworld.
