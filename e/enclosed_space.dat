5|$|The Pomeranian is a {{small but}} {{energetic}} breed of dog. Although Pomeranians benefit from frequent attention, they need relatively little exercise: it is recommended to take them on a short daily walk or let them run around an <b>enclosed</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5|$|Umbul Pasiraman, {{also known}} as Umbul Binangun or Umbul Winangun, is a bathing complex for the royal family. The bathing complex is an <b>enclosed</b> <b>space</b> {{surrounded}} by tall structures. It consists of three pools decorated with mushroom-shaped springs and large flower pots.|$|E
5|$|Bynesian decay usually starts when {{specimens}} {{are stored}} or displayed for considerable {{periods of time}} in an <b>enclosed</b> <b>space.</b> The storage method itself usually causes this problem, when containers, cabinets or display cases are entirely or partially made of wood, plywood or other wood products such as Masonite, or when the specimens are surrounded by, or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are cellulose-based and can turn water vapor acidic.|$|E

5|$|The Privy Garden of the Palace of Whitehall {{was a large}} <b>enclosed</b> <b>space</b> in Westminster, London, {{that was}} {{originally}} a pleasure garden used by the late Tudor and Stuart monarchs of England. It was created under Henry VIII and was expanded and improved under his successors, but lost its royal patronage after the Palace of Whitehall was almost totally destroyed by fire in 1698.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an <b>enclosed</b> <b>space</b> it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E
5|$|Because the liquid-to-gas {{expansion}} ratio of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20°C, {{a tremendous amount}} of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an <b>enclosed</b> <b>space.</b> In an incident on January 12, 2006 at Texas A University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2m off their foundations.|$|E

5|$|The British Armed Forces use CS gas {{annually}} {{to test their}} CBRN equipment. During initial training they introduce recruits to CS gas by introducing them into a small <b>enclosed</b> <b>space</b> known as a Respirator Testing Facility (RTF) and igniting chemical tablets to induce CS production. After recruits have carried out their CBRN drills, they must remove their respirators {{so that they are}} exposed to the CS for up to 20 seconds to experience its effects and become confident their respirators work.|$|E
5|$|The female {{raises the}} young alone. One to six, but usually two to four, kittens are born in April or May, after roughly 60 to 70 days of gestation. Sometimes, a second litter is born {{as late as}} September. The female {{generally}} gives birth in an <b>enclosed</b> <b>space,</b> usually a small cave or hollow log. The young open their eyes by the ninth or tenth day. They start exploring their surroundings at four weeks and are weaned at about two months. Within three to five months, they begin to travel with their mother. They hunt by themselves by fall of their first year, and usually disperse shortly thereafter. In Michigan, however, they have been observed staying with their mother {{as late as the}} next spring.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of {{moisture in the}} air {{in order for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the <b>enclosed</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{garden of}} Catherine de' Medici was an <b>enclosed</b> <b>space</b> five hundred metres long and three hundred metres wide, {{separated}} from the new chateau by a lane. It was divided into rectangular compartments by six alleys, and the sections were planted with lawns, flower beds, and small clusters of five trees, called Quinconces; and, more practically, with kitchen gardens and vineyards.|$|E
25|$|A {{courtyard}} or {{court is}} a circumscribed area, often {{surrounded by a}} building or complex, that {{is open to the}} sky. Such spaces in inns and public buildings were often the primary meeting places for some purposes, leading to the other meanings of court. Both of the words court and yard derive from the same root, meaning an <b>enclosed</b> <b>space.</b> See yard and garden for the relation of this set of words.|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{commencement}} of the smoking ban in England in 2007, it became illegal to smoke in red telephone boxes (types K2 to K8), due to these boxes being completely <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces.</b> The smoking ban requires owners to display no smoking signs, which has resulted in BT displaying a no smoking sticker which refer to the telephone box as [...] "premises". Despite smoking in red telephone boxes being banned, smoking in other telephone boxes remains legal as these boxes are not completely <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces.</b>|$|R
25|$|In acoustics, comb {{filtering}} {{can arise}} in some unwanted ways. For instance, when two loudspeakers are {{playing the same}} signal at different distances from the listener, there is a comb filtering effect on the signal. In any <b>enclosed</b> <b>space,</b> listeners hear a mixture of direct sound and reflected sound. Because the reflected sound takes a longer path, it constitutes a delayed version of the direct sound and a comb filter is created where the two combine at the listener.|$|E
25|$|A door is {{a moving}} {{mechanism}} used to block off, and allow access to, an entrance to or within an <b>enclosed</b> <b>space,</b> {{such as a}} building, room or vehicle. Doors normally consist {{of one or two}} solid panels, with or without windows, that swing on hinges horizontally. These hinges are attached to the door's edge but there are also doors that slide, fold or spin. The main purpose of a door is to control physical access.|$|E
25|$|The pillow {{plate is}} {{constructed}} using a thin {{sheet of metal}} spot-welded {{to the surface of}} another thicker sheet of metal. The thin plate is welded in a regular pattern of dots or with a serpentine pattern of weld lines. After welding the <b>enclosed</b> <b>space</b> is pressurised with sufficient force to cause the thin metal to bulge out around the welds, providing a space for heat exchanger liquids to flow, and creating a characteristic appearance of a swelled pillow formed out of metal.|$|E

25|$|A setup of the {{architecture}} also shifts {{the focus of the}} building. The entry to the outdoor narthex of the Chapel is created with a tent-like flap extending over the entry, creating an <b>enclosed</b> <b>space</b> that is still outdoors. The entrances to the Chapel are faced away {{from the center of the}} building and towards the tabernacle as a reminder to all who enter that the central point of the Chapel is not the altar or the crucifix, but rather the location of the Eucharist.|$|E
25|$|The Butterfly Rainforest is {{a display}} of live {{butterflies}} in a large, outdoor <b>enclosed</b> <b>space</b> attached to the museum. It is the main exhibit in the McGuire Center which is accessed from the main entrance of Powell Hall. At any given time, the exhibit contains 60 to 80 butterfly and moth species, totaling some 1,000 individuals. The butterflies are brought {{from around the world}} as chrysalises and released into the exhibit after emerging as adults. The butterfly exhibit is currently the only permanent exhibit that requires an entrance fee.|$|E
25|$|Peruzzi’s {{most famous}} {{work is the}} Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne in Rome. The unusual {{features}} of this building are that its façade curves gently around a curving street.
