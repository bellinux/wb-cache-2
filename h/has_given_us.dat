He has transmitted to every one of us a new appreciation of America, and a keener, more realistic understanding of our country's greatest enemy– godlessness, now stalking the world in the form of communism. He has bequeathed a picture of Christ-like life. What Fr. Kapaun willed to us cannot be contained in memorials, however costly or beautiful. It is a treasure for the human soul– the spirit of one who loved and served God and man– even unto death.|$|E

500|$|Priestley {{contended that}} Walpole had {{fulfilled}} his early potential, unlike Compton Mackenzie, Gilbert Cannan and other promising young novelists of his generation. This view was not universal among critics: Walpole sometimes divided opinion. Writing of Walpole's Russian novels the contemporary critic and novelist Douglas Goldring commented, [...] "Russia {{has been the}} grave of many reputations; and our Napoleon of the drawing-room novel has fared no better than other would-be conquerors of that disconcerting land." [...] Goldring's complaint was that Walpole's Russian (and English) characters were clichéd stereotypes. The reviewer in Punch, by contrast, wrote, [...] "I consulted a Russian, who is very much alive, and received the opinion that, if Mr. Walpole has not succeeded in drawing the real average Russian, he <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> a type whose faults and virtues sound the keynote of the situation as it is to-day." [...] The Observer rated The Dark Forest as [...] "one of the finest novels of our generation".|$|E
500|$|Dear M. Rousseau, Bordeaux–Paris is {{approaching}} and this great annual event which {{has done so}} much to promote cycling <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> an idea. What would {{you think of a}} training race which preceded Bordeaux–Paris by four weeks? The distance between Paris and Roubaix is roughly 280km, so it would be child's play for the future participants of Bordeaux–Paris. The finish would take place at the Roubaix vélodrome after several laps of the track. Everyone would be assured of an enthusiastic welcome as most of our citizens have never had the privilege of seeing the spectacle of a major road race and we count on enough friends to believe that Roubaix is truly a hospitable town. As prizes we already have subscribed to a first prize of 1,000 francs {{in the name of the}} Roubaix velodrome and we will be busy establishing a generous prize list which will be to the satisfaction of all. But for the moment, can we count on the patronage of Le Vélo and on your support for organising the start? ...|$|E
500|$|There {{has also}} been {{the fact that the}} {{composer}} did not follow sonata form strictly, relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups. Maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality. Even with what Schonberg termed [...] "a professional reevaluaton" [...] of Tchaikovsky's work, the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely, while his intent of writing music that would please his audiences is also sometimes taken to task. In a 1992 article, New York Times critic Allan Kozinn writes, [...] "It is Tchaikovsky's flexibility, after all, that <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> a sense of his variability.... Tchaikovsky was capable of turning out music—entertaining and widely beloved though it is—that seems superficial, manipulative and trivial when regarded {{in the context of the}} whole literature. The First Piano Concerto is a case in point. It makes a joyful noise, it swims in pretty tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows (or even requires) a soloist to make a grand, swashbuckling impression. But it is entirely hollow." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{critical}} {{reviews of}} the work came from scientists who objected to Bakker's looseness with scientific fact. The paleontologist Thomas Holtz noted that Bakker combined fauna in ways not directly supported by the fossil record; for example, several of the dinosaurs featured in the books lived millions of years after Utahraptor died out. Michael Taylor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the National Museums of Scotland, panned the book, saying that [...] "Raptor Red is an accurate portrayal only {{within the context of}} uncertainties over the reconstruction of fossil animals as living forms ... Bakker's postscript never really admits these uncertainties." [...] David B. Norman criticized the book as [...] "no more than a children's adventure story—and a rather poorly written one at that ... The merging of science and fantasy is at its worst in books like Raptor Red because none but the experts can disentangle fact from fiction; this type of nonsense turns an uninformed reader into a misinformed one." [...] Jay Ingram, from the Discovery Channel, published a rebuttal, saying, [...] "The most important point is that Bakker's portrayal of the dinosaurs in Raptor Red is vivid—vivid in a way few museum displays or factual accounts can be. And if it turns out in the long run that some of the speculation is unwarranted, who cares? Bob Bakker <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> a unique window onto the era of dinosaurs." ...|$|E
500|$|Joseph McCabe of Nerdist stated on the episode, [...] "This week’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is so {{good that}} it leaves me {{in a state of}} pessimism. Because I can’t see any way to follow it up that gives a {{satisfying}} resolution to the story it so beautifully presents." [...] He called it [...] "one of the very finest episodes S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>us,</b> {{and one of the few}} a viewer with almost no prior knowledge of the show can fully appreciate", and praised the handling of Simmons' and Daniels' relationship, saying that Henstridge and Casey [...] "complement one another marvelously". Discussing the episode for Vox, Caroline Framke called it [...] "astonishing", praising the decision to dedicate an episode to Simmons' ordeal rather than just reveal it through flashbacks in [...] "normal" [...] episodes, as well as the efforts of Bochco, Titley, and Henstridge, and the use of the [...] "sinister" [...] on-screen hour counter. Also reviewing the episode for Den of Geek, Marc Buxton scored it 4.5 stars out 5, calling it [...] "the most experimental episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to date, and ... it might have been the finest hour of the series so far". Buxton felt that the episode retroactively improved the earlier season three episodes, which he had called [...] "anticlimactic" [...] due to their handling of Simmons' storyline, and praised Henstridge's performance. He also positively compared the episode's villain, which he described as [...] "hard to grasp, mysterious, and ever present", to [...] "the best Steven Moffat Doctor Who villains".|$|E
500|$|A more {{favorable}} review came from Richard Watts, Jr. of the New York Herald Tribune, who called Greed [...] "the most important picture yet produced in America... It {{is the one}} picture of the season that can hold its own {{as a work of}} dramatic art worthy of comparison with such stage plays as What Price Glory? and Desire Under the Elms." [...] The April 20, 1925, edition of The Montreal Gazette claimed it [...] "impresses as a powerful film" [...] and described the [...] "capacity audience" [...] screening as [...] "one of the few pictures which are as worthy of serious consideration...which offer a real and convincing study of life and character and that secure their ends by artistic and intellectual means rather than by writing down {{to the level of the}} groundlings." [...] The review went on to describe the direction as [...] "masterly", citing [...] "its remarkable delineation of character development and the subtle touches which convey ideas through vision rather than the written word, an all too-rare employment of the possibilities of the cinema play as a distinct branch of art capable of truthful and convincing revelation and interpretation of life's realities." [...] A review in Exceptional Photoplays stated that [...] "Mr. von Stroheim has always been the realist as Rex Ingram is the romanticist and Griffith the sentimentalist of the screen, and in Greed he <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> an example of realism at its starkest. Like the novel from which the plot was taken, Greed is a terrible and wonderful thing." ...|$|E
