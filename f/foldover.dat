40|$|Objective: The optimal {{positioning}} of electrode arrays in the cochlea is extremely important. Our standard {{approach is to}} use a 3 -dimensional rotational x-ray for the intraoperative determination of the position of the electrode array. We wanted to see if spread of excitation (SOE) is useful for determining the electrode array position within the cochlea. Study Design: Prospective blind study design. Setting: Tertiary University Referral Center (Cochlear Implantation Center Amsterdam-Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam). Patients: Seventy-two implanted ears with a Cochlear Freedom device. Intervention: After cochlear implantation, we compared the 3 -dimensional rotational x-ray imaging and SOE measurements. The investigators were blinded for the intraoperative surgeon findings and also for the imaging findings. Outcome Measure(s) : Electrode array <b>foldovers</b> within the cochlea and the reliability of the SOE measurements. Results: We placed implants in 72 ears in this study, and all procedures seemed to be surgically uneventful. To our surprise, we discovered 4 electrode <b>foldovers</b> in this group. Of the 4 <b>foldovers,</b> 3 were corrected intraoperatively. Conclusion: We found that intraoperative imaging and/or electrophysiologic measurements such as the SOE provide very useful information regarding electrode position within the cochlea.

In this paper, we first present a theoretically robust, foldover-free 2 D mesh warping algorithm. Then, we apply this warping algorithm to handle mapping texture onto 3 D meshes with hard constraints. The proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art method for examples with more challenging constraints.

Our deformation energy generalizes that found in the prior art, while still admitting an efficient algorithm for its optimization. The key advantage of our energy function is the flexibility with which the set of “legal transformations ” may be expressed; these transformations are the ones which are not considered to be distorting. This flexibility allows us to pose the problems of image resizing and 2 D shape deformation in a natural way and generate minimally distorted results. It also allows us to strongly reduce undesirable <b>foldovers</b> or self-intersections. Results of both algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

40|$|Texture mapping {{has been}} widely used in image {{processing}} and graphics to enhance the realism of CG scenes. However to perfectly match the feature points of a 3 D model with the corresponding pixels in texture images, the parameterisation which maps a 3 D mesh to the texture space must satisfy the positional constraints. Despite numerous research efforts, {{the construction of a}} mathematically robust foldover-free parameterisation subject to internal constraints is still a remaining issue. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a two-step parameterisation method. First, we produce an initial parameterisation with a method traditionally used to solve structural engineering problems, called the bar-network. We then derive a mathematical foldover-free condition, which is incorporated into a Radial Basis Function based scheme. This method is therefore able to guarantee that the resulting parameterization meets the hard constraints without <b>foldovers...</b>|$|R

Dependencies to avoid mesh <b>foldovers</b> in manifold regions of the input object are stored in the view-dependence tree in an implicit fashion. We have observed that this not only reduces the space requirements by a factor of two, it also highly localizes the memory accesses at run time. The view-dependence tree is used at run time to generate the triangles for display. We also propose a cubic-spline-based distance metric that can be used to unify the geometry and topology simplifications by considering the vertex positions and normals in an integrated manner...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the varied possibilities for following a two-level fractional factorial with another fractional factorial {{half the size}} of the original experiment.

Peter John coined the term "semifolding" to describe using half of a <b>foldover</b> design.

After a quick examination of the estimation details for semifolding the 1 - 4 IV 2 design, we focus on following 16 -run fractions with a semifold design of eight runs. Two such examples are considered - one where the initial fraction is resolution IV, the other resolution III. A general result is proven for semifolding p k - IV 2 designs.

40|$|Image warping {{refers to}} the 2 -D {{resampling}} of a source image onto a target image. In the general case, this requires costly 2 -D filtering operations. Simplifications are possible when the warp can be expressed as a cascade of orthogonall-D transformations. In these cases, separable transformations have been introduced to realize large performance gains. The central ideas in this area were formulated in the 2 -pass algorithm by Catmull and Smith. Although that method applies over an important class of transformations, there are intrinsic problems which limit its usefulness. The goal of this work is to extend the 2 -pass approach to handle arbitrary spatial mapping functions. We address the difficulties intrinsic to 2 -pass scanline algorithms: bottlenecking, <b>foldovers,</b> {{and the lack of}} closed-form inverse solutions. These problems are shown to be resolved in a general, efficient, separable technique, with graceful degradation for transformations of increasing complexity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a template fitting method for 3 D surface meshes. A given template mesh is deformed to closely approximate the input 3 D geometry. The connectivity of the deformed template model is automatically adjusted {{to facilitate the}} geometric fitting and to ascertain high quality of the mesh elements. The template fitting process utilizes a specially tailored Laplacian processing framework, where in the first, coarse fitting stage we approximate the input geometry with a linearized bi-harmonic surface (a variant of LS-mesh [39]), and then the fine geometric detail is fitted further using iterative Laplacian editing with reliable correspondence constraints and a local surface flattening mechanism to avoid <b>foldovers.</b> The latter step is performed in the dual mesh domain, which is shown to encourage near-equilateral mesh elements and significantly reduces the occurrence of triangle fold-overs, a well known problem in mesh fitting. To experimentally evaluate our approach, we compare our method with relevant state-of-the-art techniques and confirm significant improvements of results. In addition, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to the application of consistent surface parameterization (also known as cross-parameterization).

This paper proposes a method for compressing TIN model to create multi-resolution TIN model (LOD) dynamically. Here, multi-resolution TIN model means different level of details TIN model that can be transformed dynamically by the proposed solution, specifically based on TIN edge collapse and vertex split among different levels of TIN models. First, edge collapse and vertex split is determined according to the minimum distance to an average plane. An edge fulfill this requirement will be collapsed, in the same time, the angle between two triangles is used as an additional criterion for this judgment. Secondly, the vertex tree model is proposed to manage and store the vertex relationship between different level of TIN models. The corresponding encoding method is proposed based on the bracketing method (Donaghey, 1980) [...] each vertex is represented only with 0 or 1 to encode the position relationship in a tree. Thirdly, two new regulations for edge collapse and vertex split are defined to prevent the problem of surface <b>foldovers</b> during running time...|$|R

For fractional factorial experiments, methods such as the addition of orthogonal runs, the optimal design approach, and the <b>foldover</b> technique have been developed to construct follow-up experiments. In this paper, we extend the <b>foldover</b> technique to break the alias chains of split-plot experiments. Since it is impractical and not economically possible to <b>foldover</b> whole-plot factors as they are hard-to-change and costly-to-change factors, the focus of this paper is on folding over only one or more subplot factors in order to de-alias those effects that are either aliased with other subplot factors or with whole-plot factors.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel external-memory {{algorithm}} to support view-dependent simplification for datasets {{much larger than}} main memory. In the preprocessing phase, we use a new spanned sub-meshes simplification technique to build view-dependence trees I/O-efficiently, which preserves the correct edge collapsing order and thus assures the run-time image quality. We further process the resulting view-dependence trees to build the meta-node trees, which can facilitate the run-time level-of-detail rendering and is kept in disk. During run-time navigation, we keep in main memory only the portions of the meta-node trees {{that are necessary to}} render the current level of details, plus some prefetched portions that are likely to be needed in the near future. The prefetching prediction takes advantage {{of the nature of the}} run-time traversal of the meta-node trees, and is both simple and accurate. We also employ the implicit dependencies for preventing incorrect <b>foldovers,</b> as well as main-memory buffer management and parallel processes scheme to separate the disk accesses from the navigation operations, all in an integrated manner.

40|$|Texture is an {{essential}} component of computer generated models. For a texture mapping procedure to be effective it has to generate continuous textures and cause only small mapping distortion. The Angle Based Flattening (ABF) parameterization method is guaranteed to provide a continuous (no <b>foldovers)</b> mapping. It also minimizes the angular distortion of the parameterization, including locating the optimal planar domain boundary. However, since it concentrates on minimizing the angular distortion of the mapping, it can introduce relatively large linear distortion. In this paper we introduce a new procedure for reducing length distortion of an existing parameterization and apply it to ABF results. The linear distortion reduction is added as a second step in a texture mapping computation. The new method is based on computing a mapping from the plane to itself which has length distortion very {{similar to that of the}} ABF parameterization. By applying the inverse mapping to the result of the initial parameterization, we obtain a new parameterization with low length distortion. We notice that the procedure for computing the inverse mapping can be applied to any other (convenient) mapping from the three-dimensional surface to the plane in order to improve it. The mapping in the plane is computed by applying weighted Laplacian smoothing to a Cartesian grid covering the planar domain of the initial mapping. Both the mapping and its inverse are provably continuous. Since angle preserving (conformal) mappings, such as ABF, locally preserve distances as well, the planar mapping has small local deformation. As a result, the inverse mapping does not significantly increase the angular distortion...|$|R
40|$|This work's {{aim was to}} {{minimize}} the acquisition time of a radial 3 D ultra-short echo-time (UTE) sequence and to provide fully automated, gradient delay compensated, and therefore artifact free, reconstruction. The radial 3 D UTE sequence (echo time 60 μs) was implemented as single echo acquisition with center-out readouts and improved time efficient spoiling on a clinical 3 T scanner without hardware modifications. To assess the sequence parameter dependent gradient delays each acquisition contained a quick calibration scan and utilized the phase of the readouts to detect the actual k-space center. This calibration scan does not require any user interaction. To evaluate the robustness of this automatic delay estimation phantom experiments were performed and 19 in vivo imaging data of the head, tibial cortical bone, feet and lung were acquired from 6 volunteers. As clinical application of this fast 3 D UTE acquisition single breath-hold lung imaging is demonstrated. The proposed sequence allowed very short repetition times (TR~ 1 ms), thus reducing total acquisition time. The proposed, fully automated k-phase based gradient delay calibration resulted in accurate delay estimations (difference to manually determined optimal delay - 0. 13 ± 0. 45 μs) and allowed unsupervised reconstruction of high quality images for both phantom and in vivo data. The employed fast spoiling scheme efficiently suppressed artifacts caused by incorrectly refocused echoes. The sequence proved to be quite insensitive to motion, flow and susceptibility artifacts and provides oversampling protection against aliasing <b>foldovers</b> in all directions. Due to the short TR, acquisition times are attractive {{for a wide range}} of clinical applications. For short T 2 * mapping this sequence provides free choice of the second TE, usually within less scan time as a comparable dual echo UTE sequence...|$|R
