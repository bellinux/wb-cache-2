50|$|Comrie's early {{prosperity}} <b>derived</b> from <b>weaving.</b> This {{was mostly}} done as piecework in people's own homes. Comrie was also {{important as a}} droving town. Cattle destined for the markets of the Scottish Lowlands and ultimately England would be driven south from their grazing areas in the Highlands. River crossings, such as at Comrie, were important staging posts on the way south. Much of the land around Comrie was owned by the Drummond family, Earls of Perth, latterly Earls of Ancaster, whose main seat was Drummond Castle, south of Crieff. Another branch of the Drummonds owned Drummondernoch (Gaelic: Drumainn Èireannach - Drummond of Ireland), {{to the west of}} the town. Aberuchill Castle, however, just outside Comrie was originally a Campbell seat.|$|R

This type of <b>weave,</b> <b>derived</b> from space shuttle pressure suits, assures practically equal strength in every direction; has essentially no bias, or weak dimension offering greater resistance to tear and shear along with significant weight reduction. Applications of the Triax line include inflatable equipment, life vests, aircraft evacuation slides, helicopter flotation devices, tension structures, safety clothing and sailcloth for boats. Ability to accept compound curvatures with no {{distortion of the}} weave configuration makes it useful in manufacturing molded composites...|$|R

40|$|A {{plethora of}} aspect {{mechanisms}} exist today. All of these diverse mechanisms integrate concerns into artifacts that exhibit crosscutting structure. What we lack and {{need is a}} characterization of the design space that these aspect mechanisms inhabit and a model description of their weaving processes. A good design space representation provides a common framework for understanding and evaluating existing mechanisms. A well-understood model of the weaving process can guide the implementor of new aspect mechanisms. It can guide the designer when mechanisms implementing new kinds of weaving are needed. It can also help teach aspectoriented programming (AOP). In this paper we present and evaluate such {{a model of the}} design space for aspect mechanisms and their weaving processes. We model weaving, at an abstract level, as a concern integration process. We <b>derive</b> a <b>weaving</b> process model (WPM) top-down, differentiating a reactive from a nonreactive process. The model provides an in-depth explanation of the key subprocesses used by existing aspect mechanisms...|$|R
500|$|From {{the middle}} of the 14th century, money that had {{previously}} been spent on luxury goods like lavish embroidery was redirected to military expenditure, and imported Italian figured silks competed with native embroidery traditions. [...] Varieties of design in textiles succeeded each other very rapidly, and they were more readily available than the more leisurely produced needlework. [...] The work produced by the London workshops was simplified {{to meet the demands of}} this deteriorating market. [...] The new techniques required less work and smaller quantities of expensive materials. [...] Surface couching replaced underside couching, and allover embroidery was replaced by individual motifs worked on linen and then applied to figured silks or silk velvets. Increasingly, designs for embroidery were <b>derived</b> directly from <b>woven</b> patterns, [...] "thus losing not only their former individuality and richness, but also their former ... story-telling interest." ...|$|R
40|$|In 1991, Uzbekistan {{declared}} {{independence from}} the SSSR. The resultant transition from a planned economy {{to a market economy}} has {{had an impact on the}} daily life of ordinary people living in Uzbekistan. People have been experiencing increasingly severe economic conditions on a daily basis, due to the rise in both inflation and unemployment. In contrast, culturally, there has been a revival of "traditional" Uzbekistani skills in the renewed nationalistic climate that emerged following the independence. This paper analyzes the role that carpet weaving plays in the lives of the weavers themselves by focusing on a carpet factory in Khiva, a town in the Khorezm province of Uzbekistan. In Chapter I, I explain the transformation that occurred in the life of Uzbekistani women under Soviet rule. In Chapter II, I explain the historical change that occurred in the carpet industry in Khiva. In Chapter III, based on data obtained through participant observation, I describe the relationships between the weavers working at the factory. In Chapter IV, I analyze the various roles that carpet weaving plays in the lives of the weavers. The conclusion of the study can be summarized in the following points. First, weavers earn a moderate income for weaving at the factory, which they are free to spend as they wish. Second, the relationships between the weavers are comparatively equal. Third, the equal nature of the relationships forged at the factory serve as a model that they can introduce, should they move factories, or establish a new factory. Fourth, the weavers are motivated daily by the enjoyment and satisfaction they <b>derive</b> from <b>weaving</b> carpets...|$|R

His images were {{carefully}} ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, procreation, new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas <b>derived</b> his closely <b>woven,</b> sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, Welsh folklore, preaching, and Sigmund Freud. Explaining the source of his imagery, Thomas {{wrote in a letter to}} Glyn Jones: [...] "My own obscurity is quite an unfashionable one, based, as it is, on a preconceived symbolism derived (I'm afraid all this sounds wooly and pretentious) from the cosmic significance of the human anatomy".|$|R

40|$|Concatenation {{of several}} {{conventional}} convolutional encoders is a both powerful and practical method to obtain encoding schemes that are attractive {{for use in}} communication systems where very low error probabilities are needed. This thesis is devoted to woven convolutional codes, a construction where the constituent codes are woven together {{in a manner that}} resembles the structure of a fabric. A family of active distance measures for convolutional codes is defined. It is shown that the error correcting capability of a convolutional code is determined by the active distances. Lower bounds on the active distances are derived for the ensemble of periodically time-varying convolutional codes. The simplest construction of serially concatenated convolutional codes is considered, viz., a direct cascade of two convolutional encoders. Important structural properties for the cascaded convolutional encoder is shown both for the case of matched and for unmatched rates. Several interesting examples of cascaded convolutional codes are considered and examined. Lower bounds on the active distances and the free distance are derived for the ensemble of periodically time-varying cascaded convolutional codes. Woven convolutional codes {{can be viewed as a}} generalization of cascaded convolutional codes. The general construction is called the twill and it is described together with two important special cases, viz., woven convolutional codes with outer and inner warp. The woven convolutional encoder inherits many of its structural properties, such as minimality, from the constituent encoders. Distance properties for the constructions are examined and upper and lower bounds on the free distance are <b>derived.</b> Decoding of <b>woven</b> convolutional codes should be performed iteratively and, for that reason, the BCJR algorithm is rederived. Simulation results show that woven convolutional codes are attractive alternatives to the celebrated Turbo codes. Finally, a review of bounds, such as error exponents and bounds on the active distances, is given for woven convolutional codes...|$|R
