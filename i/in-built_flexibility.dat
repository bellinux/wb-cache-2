It {{was built by}} Cyberabad Convention Center Private Limited (CCCPL), {{a joint venture between}} the Dubai-based Emaar Properties and the (APIIC). Stretching across 15 acre, the HICC is an integrated 291000 sq ft. facility managed by Accor. Located next to the HICC is the Novotel Hyderabad hotel, which opened in May 2006. The 287-room business hotel has also been developed by Emaar, and is managed by Accor. HICC offers 4,000 seating capacity with an <b>in-built</b> <b>flexibility</b> to expand to 6,500 seats. The HICC, built at a cost of US$39 million and the Novotel Hyderabad at a cost of US$27 million together constitute a total project investment of US$66 million. HICC is located adjacent to HITEC City, home to large national and international technology companies.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a flexible and free image processing and analysis solution, based on the Public Domain ImageJ platform, for the segmentation and analysis of complex biological plant root systems in soil from x-ray tomography 3 D images. Contrasting root architectures from wheat, barley and chickpea root systems were grown in soil and scanned using a high resolution micro-tomography system. A macro (Root 1) was developed that reliably identified with good to high accuracy complex root systems (10 % overestimation for chickpea, 1 % underestimation for wheat, 8 % underestimation for barley) and provided analysis of root length and angle. <b>In-built</b> <b>flexibility</b> allowed the user interaction to (a) amend any aspect of the macro to account for specific user preferences, and (b) take account of computational limitations of the platform. The platform is free, flexible and accurate in analysing root system metrics...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{transformation}} of crop plants offers {{the possibility of}} testing hypotheses about the function of individual genes {{as well as the}} exploitation of transgenes for targeted trait improvement. However, in most cereals, this option has long been compromised by tedious and low-efficiency transformation protocols, {{as well as by the}} lack of versatile vector systems. After having adopted and further improved the protocols for Agrobacterium-mediated stable {{transformation of}} barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), we now present a versatile set of binary vectors for transgene overexpression, as well as for gene silencing by double-stranded RNA interference. The vector set is offered with a series of functionally validated promoters and allows for rapid integration of the desired genes or gene fragments by GATEWAY-based recombination. Additional <b>in-built</b> <b>flexibility</b> lies in the choice of plant selectable markers, cassette orientation, and simple integration of further promoters to drive specific expression of genes of interest. Functionality of the cereal vector set has been demonstrated by transient as well as stable transformation experiments for transgene overexpression, as well as for targeted gene silencing in barley...|$|E
40|$|As journalism {{programmes}} {{continue to}} grow, journalism research - especially {{that which is}} practice-based - is declining. In Australia this is recognised by fewer universities submitting research outputs to the &# 039;Journalism and Professional Writing&# 039; Field of Research Code, and in the latest Excellence in Research for Australia evaluation, no university scoring above 3 (&# 039;at world standard&# 039;) out of 5 (&# 039;well above world standard&# 039;). For journalists transitioning from industry to academy, it is becoming an issue that their professional successes are largely unable to be translated into legitimate and important research identities. One core issue underpinning the arrested growth of journalism practice research is the approach to preparing and assessing ethics applications. Often perceived at odds with professional and personal codes of ethics, university processes informed by the National Statement in Australia, and other guidelines internationally, deter practitioner-researchers from undertaking quality journalism. In this paper we discuss the challenges of undertaking journalism {{as a mode of}} research, suggesting it is entirely feasible {{to take advantage of the}} <b>in-built</b> <b>flexibilities</b> of the National Statement. By doing this, not only can journalist-researchers build distinctive research identities, but also institutions can take advantage of the core fabric of journalism to generate research with cultural, social and political impact...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years {{regulatory}} regimes have become more flexible, adopting risk-based approaches and shifting from rules to principles where regulatees are given a degree of discretion in how they comply. In this way “one size fits all”. Flexibility such as this is however under threat. The current financial crisis has given rise to calls for more and stronger regulation. Policymakers have to respond but are well aware there are limits - lack of flexibility can hinder innovation and economic growth. So, when does flexible regulation work and when does it not? In what circumstances are regulatees likely to strive to comply with underlying regulatory principles and when are they not? What factors affect regulatee ‘buy-in?’ To address these questions we examined the use of comply-or-explain in corporate governance. This mechanism can be considered the ultimate in flexible regulation. It allows noncompliance, but only where regulatees provide a convincing explanation acceptable to shareholders. Previously we analysed the compliance records of 260 of the largest UK and German companies (Seidl et al. 2012). For this paper we analyse the accompanying interviews with selected senior managers and directors. We conclude the lessons for policymakers are that successful application of flexible regulation mechanisms such as this is contingent on the presence of powerful and influential monitors and that regulatee buy-in to flexible regulation depends primarily {{on the extent to which}} (i) ‘soft’ regulation is understood as a traditional means of control and, (ii) regulatees are involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of regulation. However, whatever the conditions or circumstances, large companies tend to believe they are under considerable pressure to be seen to fully comply which may ultimately render any <b>in-built</b> operational <b>flexibility</b> redundant. This is more likely to be the case under conditions of uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|This {{extensively}} illustrated paper {{sets the}} context for the presentation of {{a new approach to}} the formal classification of type. The approach reassesses the value of previous contributions to the historiography of the field, re-evaluates the basis for type classification and re-conceptualises methods for accurate typeform description. Key developments in classificatory thinking during the twentieth century are identified to outline the difficulties of description within current contexts. An analysis of recent type design practice reveals a set of analytic tools for evaluation of existing description methods and identification of the key requirements for contemporary description. A historical review proposes that the theoretical model for understanding typeform developments in response to market advances in the nineteenth century as proposed by Nicolete Gray (1938, revisited 1976) has wider applicability. Applied to the late twentieth century market situation, this model contributes to the understanding of a fracture in contemporary discourse which prevents recent practice from being related to that of the past. The paper describes my own work in which I developed an approach to practice –based research which uses theoretical insight to inform a rigorous mapping of classificatory ideas from which to derive a new model for description. The significance of the new model lies in the micro and macro description possibilities for types offered and its <b>in-built</b> <b>flexibility,</b> which allows for adaptation in response to changes in the field...|$|E
40|$|Emissions from ships {{exhausts}} {{into the}} atmosphere can potentially be harmful to human health,cause acid rain and may also contribute to global warming. The marine industry takes action on this matter by implementing strict regulations. IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) has given extensive consideration to control of GHG emissions from ships and finalized in July 2009 a package of specific technical and operational reduction measures. In March 2010 MEPC started the consideration of making the technical and operational measures mandatory for all ships irrespective of flag and ownership. MEPC 67 approved the Third IMO GHG Study, providing updated emission estimates for greenhouse gases from ships. According to estimates presented in this study, international shipping emitted 796 million tonnes of CO 2 in 2012, that is, about 2. 2 % of the total global CO 2 emissions for that year. By contrast, in 2007, before the global economic downturn, international shipping is estimated to have emitted 885 million tonnes of CO 2, that is, 2. 8 % of the total global CO 2 emissions for that year. By moving to hybrid or electric propulsion, marine vessels ensure <b>in-built</b> <b>flexibility</b> that can not only reduce emissions and optimize fuel consumption, but they are lighter and take up less space, with lower noise and vibration levels and reduced maintenance costs. The industry is moving towards this path we ought to contribute in achieving this. The abovementioned is what motivated this thesis, whose structure is discussed in the following sentences. Chapter 2 presents the hybrid propulsion technologies that are available, some concepts and case studies of marine vessels that comprise mechanical and electrical elements. This chapter also analyzes the hybrid configuration under study and in details the basic elements that is consisted of. The third chapter describes battery’s functions and how to evaluate each battery’s technology characteristics. In addition, the most important lithium ion battery technologies alongside with their specifications and applications are presented {{in order to help}} us evaluate the appropriate battery chemistry for the hybrid ship. Conceptual design of electrical topologies on board, on shore and cost calculation method is described on chapter 4. Possible electrical diagrams and infrastructures either on shore or on the boat depending to different scenarios/energy demands (existing electrical grid, high voltage/low voltage etc.) are explained as well. Chapter 5 is consisted of three parts. The first part describes the physics and available mathematical models, derived through experimentation, which define the thermal/electrochemical analysis. The second part describes the methodology we followed with the help of ANSYS to simulate the battery cell’s operational behavior, and the third the analysis of the results acquired. Chapter 6 analyses our retrofit design philosophy and the methodology developed for the estimation of the required battery capacity and PTO output power installed on board. Its inputs and equations are described in detail and the most important guidelines generated from the methodology are outlined. Chapter 7 discusses the results from the implementation of the methodology in the case study of: medium size passenger vessel. Topology designs, number of batteries installed according to operational profile and overall hybrid configurations are also included along with some diagrammatic predictions for the discharge behavior of the battery cells. Chapter 8 contains the criteria we considered, for evaluating the investment required for this project and some very important coefficients describing the dynamic relationship of capital and products through time. In addition this chapter entails an annual cash flow analysis followed by a sensitivity analysis, regarding the discount rate, and feasibility determination. The final chapter contains the conclusions for both the case study and the simulation analysis and recommendations for future work...|$|E
