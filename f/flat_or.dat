5|$|Banksia grossa mainly occurs {{from west}} of Yandanooka in the north, south to Badgingarra National Park, and east almost to Coorow. It grows in shallow sand over laterite, in deep sand, and {{occasionally}} atop lateritic rises, on <b>flat</b> <b>or</b> gently undulating land, among kwongan shrubland. Around 40% of plants occur on road verges.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa {{grows on}} <b>flat</b> <b>or</b> gently sloping ground on deep white or grey sand. It {{is often the}} {{dominant}} shrub in shrubland, commonly found with such species as Lambertia inermis, Banksia pulchella, and B. petiolaris.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sphaerocarpa is {{distributed}} widely across southwestern Western Australia—from Eneabba in the north, {{south to the}} Whicher Range, Nannup, Albany and Jerramungup, and eastwards to the vicinity of Hyden. It is mainly found on sandy soils in <b>flat</b> <b>or</b> gently sloped areas in shrubland, mallee or open woodland.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is <b>flat,</b> <b>or</b> the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of Argentinean ferugliotheriids {{come from}} the Los Alamitos (Ferugliotherium), La Colonia (Ferugliotherium and Argentodites), and Allen Formations (Trapalcotherium). All three are {{approximately}} the same age, dating to the Campanian (84–71mya) or more likely the Maastrichtian (71–66mya), but the La Colonia Formation is perhaps a little younger. The Los Alamitos and Allen Formations may have been deposited in a marshy environments, and the depositional environment of the La Colonia Formations {{may have been an}} estuary, tidal <b>flat,</b> <b>or</b> coastal plain.|$|E

5|$|The Isidore H. Heller House {{is a house}} {{located at}} 5132 South Woodlawn Avenue in the Hyde Park {{community}} area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The house was designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The design is credited {{as one of the}} turning points in Wright's shift to geometric, Prairie School architecture, which is defined by horizontal lines, <b>flat</b> <b>or</b> hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves, windows grouped in horizontal bands, and an integration with the landscape, which is meant to evoke native Prairie surroundings.|$|E
5|$|The La Colonia Formation {{outcrops}} in north-central Chubut Province, and the mammalian fossils {{come from}} the Mirasol Chico valley. The formation includes fluvial (river), deep-sea, and near-shore deposits, and the mammalian fauna probably comes from an estuary, tidal <b>flat,</b> <b>or</b> coastal plain. The La Colonia Formation also contains dryolestoids, such as Coloniatherium and Reigitherium, {{as well as a}} ferugliotheriid and the putative multituberculate Argentodites. In addition, the La Colonia Formation has yielded fossils of a wide array of other animals, including crocodiles, plesiosaurs, lungfish (Ceratodus), and dinosaurs (including Carnotaurus).|$|E

5|$|The {{depiction}} of the galero in arms can vary greatly depending on the artist's style. The top of the hat may be shown <b>flat</b> <b>or</b> round. Sometimes the brim is shown much narrower; with a domed top it can look like a cappello romano with tassels, but in heraldry it is still called a galero. The tassels may be represented as knotted cords.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture roosts on high, exposed {{dead trees}} to observe {{surrounding}} terrain. When flying, it travels in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with its wings held <b>flat</b> <b>or</b> very slightly above horizontal, {{in what is}} called the dihedral position. The flight of the greater yellow-headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings.|$|E
5|$|The river otter, {{a member}} of the {{subfamily}} Lutrinae in the weasel family (Mustelidae), is equally versatile in the water and on land. It establishes a burrow close to the water's edge in river, lake, swamp, coastal shoreline, tidal <b>flat,</b> <b>or</b> estuary ecosystems. The den typically has many tunnel openings, one of which generally allows the otter to enter and exit the body of water. Female otters give birth in these underground burrows, producing litters of one to six young.|$|E
50|$|The numbers {{inside the}} circle show {{the number of}} sharps <b>or</b> <b>flats</b> in the key signature, with the sharp keys going clockwise, and the flat keys {{counterclockwise}} from C major (which has no sharps <b>or</b> <b>flats.)</b> The circular arrangement depends on enharmonic relationships in the circle, usually reckoned at six sharps <b>or</b> <b>flats</b> for the major keys of F = G and D = E for minor keys. Seven sharps <b>or</b> <b>flats</b> make major keys (C major or C major) {{that may be more}} conveniently spelled with five <b>flats</b> <b>or</b> sharps (as D major or B major).|$|R

5|$|Only the {{two largest}} regular moons have been imaged with a {{resolution}} sufficient to discern their shapes and surface features. Larissa, about 200km in diameter, is elongated. Proteus is not significantly elongated, but not fully spherical either: it resembles an irregular polyhedron, with several <b>flat</b> <b>or</b> slightly concave facets 150 to 250km in diameter. At about 400km in diameter, it {{is larger than the}} Saturnian moon Mimas, which is fully ellipsoidal. This difference may be due to a past collisional disruption of Proteus. The surface of Proteus is heavily cratered and shows a number of linear features. Its largest crater, Pharos, is more than 150km in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Pita {{bread is}} a {{double-layered}} <b>flat</b> <b>or</b> pocket bread traditional in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is baked plain, {{or with a}} topping of sesame or nigella seeds or za'atar. Pita is used in multiple ways, such as stuffed with falafel, salads or various meats as a snack or fast food meal; packed with schnitzel, salad and French fries for lunch; filled with chocolate spread as a snack for schoolchildren; or broken into pieces for scooping up hummus, eggplant and other dips. A lafa is larger, soft flatbread that is rolled up with a falafel or shawarma filling. Various ethnic groups continue to bake traditional flat breads. Jews from the former Soviet republic of Georgia make the flatbread, lavash.|$|E
5|$|Race {{director}} Angelo Zomegnan {{commented that}} the route {{was designed to be}} easier than that of the extremely climbing-intensive 2006 Giro. The Giro's twenty-one stages were divided into the following classifications: three time trials (one team and two individual), eleven <b>flat</b> <b>or</b> undulating stages (officially there was no distinction made between flat and undulating), four intermediate stages, and three mountain stages. The race began with a team time trial on the island of Sardinia. This was followed by two flat stages and an unusually early rest day to transfer from Sardinia to Italy's mainland. The riders transferred by plane while the Giro caravan, race officials and team cars made the trip by boat. The final stage, as was tradition, was a flat, mostly ceremonial road stage to Milan, finishing with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia of the Via Montenapoleone.|$|E

5|$|The men's {{individual}} {{time trial}} {{event at the}} UCI Road World Championships is the men's world championship for the road bicycle racing discipline of time trial. Introduced in 1994 by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the world's governing body of cycling, the event consists of a time trial covering a distance of approximately 45 kilometres (28mi) over <b>flat</b> <b>or</b> rolling terrain. Riders start separated by two-minute intervals; the one that completes the course in the shortest time is the winner, and is entitled to wear the rainbow jersey in time trial events for the forthcoming season.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily <b>flat</b> <b>or</b> featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E
5|$|The advent in {{the mid-1990s}} of ’no-frills’ carriers, such as easyJet, has had a {{significant}} impact on air travel in the UK. In 2005 these airlines carried 77.5million passengers, up from just 4.3million in 1996. They are responsible for the growth of regional airports, operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in 1996, and increasing the choice of international destinations, serving 150 in 2006, compared to 12 a decade earlier. The annual rate of growth in the overall demand for air travel has remained stable since 1975, averaging 5.8 per cent annually. Recent growth is being serviced by the no-frills airlines at the expense of traditional carriers which, since 2000, have experienced <b>flat</b> <b>or</b> declining traffic levels. In response, traditional carriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively on price, leading to lower prices on the short haul routes serviced by this sector, especially in business fares. They have also limited or reduced capacity and in some cases launched no-frills subsidiaries of their own.|$|E
