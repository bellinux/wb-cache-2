5|$|Lions {{prefer to}} {{scavenge}} {{when the opportunity}} presents itself with carrion providing more than 50% of their diet. They scavenge animals either dead from natural causes (disease) or killed by other predators, and keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, being <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> that they indicate an animal dead or in distress. In fact, most dead prey on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by the hyenas instead of the lions.|$|E
25|$|Despite his humble origins, Whitney was <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of {{the value}} of social and {{political}} connections. In building his arms business, he took full advantage of the access that his status as a Yale alumnus gave him to other well-placed graduates, such as Oliver Wolcott, Jr., Secretary of the Treasury (class of 1778), and James Hillhouse, a New Haven developer and political leader.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic clergy at {{the time}} of the new Republic were <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> that anti-British {{sentiment}} made their canonical allegiance to Bishop Richard Challoner, the vicar-apostolic of the London district, somewhat suspect. As a result, they explored various options. When Bishop Challoner died in 1781, his successor, James Talbot, refused to exercise jurisdiction in the new nation. But the American clergy, then numbering some two dozen, did not feel the time was right to have a bishop appointed in the new nation.|$|E
25|$|Further west, the Umayyads were <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of Sicily's {{strategic}} importance and Muawiya {{was the first}} caliph to begin raiding the island in 670. That same year, the Umayyad general Uqba ibn Nafi founded the garrison town Kairouan in Ifriqiya (modern Tunisia). It was used both {{as a base for}} military operations and as an administrative centre for north Africa, replacing Carthage. A few years later the Umayyads also crossed over into Spain and southern France under the command of Tariq ibn Ziyad and Musa bin Nusayr.|$|E
25|$|Around 1910, De Haan {{developed}} {{an interest in}} Judaism, the Land of Israel and Zionism. This seems to have begun {{as a result of}} the mass imprisonment of Jews in Tsarist Russia, suspected of Bolshevism, and his work to free them. According to historical records, de Haan went to Russia armed with a letter of recommendation from the Queen of the Netherlands and was able to negotiate leniency for his Jewish clients. His work for Russian Jews lasted two years and made him <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of the evils of anti-Semitism.|$|E
25|$|June and Ward are <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> {{of their}} duty to impart traditional, but proven, middle-class family values to their boys. They do so by serving as {{examples}} in word and deed, rather than using punitive means. Ward and June are models of late-1950s, conscientious parenting. Stay-at-home June maintains a loving, nurturing home and Ward consistently supervises the behavior and moral education of his sons. While the series portrays {{the world through the}} eyes of a young boy, it sometimes dealt with controversial and adult subjects such as alcoholism and divorce.|$|E
25|$|<b>Keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of the {{potential}} for bad press and liability, University administrators have used a variety of techniques to moderate negative behaviors. The Administration's more recent tighter relationship with the Greeks provides leverage to the small Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life, which sponsors a variety of programming designed to raise awareness and teach essential skills. Undergraduate members, alumni advisors, national fraternities and University administration regularly collaborate on the shared goal of reducing risks. Self-policing by peer moderators and the incorporation of live-in adult mentors have been important tools in addressing this goal.|$|E
25|$|Korolev was <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of {{the orbital}} {{possibilities}} of the rockets being designed as ICBMs. He conceptualized using the R-7 to launch Sputnik as early as 1953, and suggested to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR the concept for sending a dog into space. The Communist Party was uninterested until the United States press began discussing a possible satellite launch for the International Geophysical year. While the US government debated the idea of spending {{millions of dollars on}} this concept. Korolev's group suggested the international prestige of launching a satellite before the United States could act. The spirit of cold war competition was adequate to secure approval for the project.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, {{he won a}} {{competition}} to become professor of Romanian language and literature at Saint Sava National College. Later that year, {{with the help of}} his former professor Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, he received a scholarship to study Romance philology in Milan and Paris. He met the Romanist Émile Picot, took courses with Graziadio Isaia Ascoli and Gaston Paris, but the lasting impact of his sojourn lay in the eye-opening visits to libraries. Impressed by the Palazzo Brera, the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, libraries across Italy, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the British Museum and the Bodleian Library, he at the same time became <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of the poor state of Romania's libraries and gathered ideas for their improvement.|$|E
25|$|Flying faster {{means that}} the {{aircraft}} passes through the range of a gun more rapidly, {{reducing the number of}} rounds a particular gun can fire at that aircraft. Flying at higher altitudes has a similar effect, as it requires larger shells to reach those altitudes, and this typically results in slower firing rates for a variety of practical reasons. Aircraft using jet engines basically double the speed and altitude of conventional designs, so limiting the number of shells that the chance of hitting the bomber essentially dropped to zero. As early as 1942, German flak commanders were <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of the problem, and expecting to face jet bombers, they began a missile development program to supplant their guns.|$|E
25|$|<b>Keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of {{her lack}} of a formal education, during these years, Lane read voraciously and taught herself several languages. Her writing career began around 1908, with {{occasional}} freelance newspaper jobs that earned much-needed extra cash. In 1913 and 1914, the Lanes sold farm land {{in what is now}} the San Jose/Silicon Valley area of northern California. Conditions often required them to work separately to earn greater commissions, and Lane {{turned out to be the}} better salesperson than her husband. The marriage foundered; there were several periods of separation, and eventually an amicable divorce. Lane's diaries reveal subsequent romantic involvements with several men in the years following her divorce, but she never remarried, and eventually chose to remain single and free of romantic attachments.|$|E
25|$|The Civil War {{had taken}} its toll on Baltimore, however, as did the yellow fever and cholera {{epidemics}} that repeatedly ravaged the nation's cities, killing 853 in Baltimore {{in the summer of}} 1832 alone. Hopkins was <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of the city's need for medical facilities, particularly in light of the medical advances made during the war, and in 1870 he made a will setting aside seven million dollars — mostly in B stock — for the incorporation of a free hospital and affiliated medical and nurse's training colleges, as well as an orphanage for colored children and a university. Many board members were on both boards. The hospital and orphan asylum would each be overseen by the 12-member hospital board of trustees, and the university by the 12-member university board of trustees. Johns Hopkins' bequest was used to posthumously found the Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum first as he requested, in 1875; the Johns Hopkins University in 1876; the Johns Hopkins Press, the longest continuously operating academic press in America, in 1878; the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in 1889; the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine 1893; and the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1916.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time as the role of the Panchayat was declining, a number of other {{institutions}} arose that would replace the Panchayat's role in contributing to the sense of social cohesiveness that the community desperately sought. By the mid-19th century, the Parsis were <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> that their numbers were declining and saw education as a possible solution to the problem. In 1842 Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy established the Parsi Benevolent Fund with the aim of improving, through education, the condition of the impoverished Parsis still living in Surat and its environs. In 1849 the Parsis established their first school (co-educational, which was a novelty at the time, but would soon be split into separate schools for boys and girls) and the education movement quickened. The number of Parsi schools multiplied, but other schools and colleges were also freely attended. Accompanied by better education and social cohesiveness, the community's sense of distinctiveness grew, and in 1854 Dinshaw Maneckji Petit founded the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund with the aim of improving conditions for his less fortunate co-religionists in Iran. The fund succeeded in convincing a number of Iranian Zoroastrians to emigrate to India (where they are known today as Iranis) and the efforts of its emissary Maneckji Limji Hataria may have been instrumental in obtaining a remission of the jizya for their co-religionists in 1882.|$|E
25|$|<b>Keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of {{the need}} to seize the {{initiative}} and to get the process under firm judicial control, de Gaulle appointed Justice Minister François de Menthon to lead the Legal Purge (Épuration légale) to punish traitors and to clear away the traces of the Vichy regime. Knowing that he would need to reprieve many of the 'economic collaborators'—such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy {{in order to keep the}} country running as normally as possible—he assumed, as head of state, the right to commute death sentences. Of the near 2,000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, fewer than 800 were executed. De Gaulle commuted 998 of the 1,554 capital sentences submitted before him, including all those involving women. Many others were given jail terms or had their voting rights and other legal privileges taken away. It is generally agreed that the purges were conducted arbitrarily, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down. It was also notable that the less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated. As time went by and feelings grew less intense, a number of people who had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy government—such as Maurice Papon and René Bousquet—escaped consequences by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of France by serving the established order.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, the Confederate dollar cost 90¢ worth of gold (Union) dollars. By the war's end, its price had dropped to only [...]017¢. Overall, the price level in the South increased by over 9000% during the war. The Secretary of the Treasury of the Confederate States, Christopher Memminger, was <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of the economic problems posed by inflation and loss of confidence. However, political considerations limited internal taxation ability, {{and as long as the}} voluntary embargo and the Union blockade were in place, it was impossible to find adequate alternative sources of finance.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1860s, Luxembourgers {{had been}} <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of German ambition, and Luxembourg's {{government}} {{was well aware}} of the implications of the Schlieffen Plan. In 1911, Prime Minister Paul Eyschen commissioned an engineer to evaluate Germany's western railroad network, particularly the likelihood that Germany would occupy Luxembourg to suit its logistical needs for a campaign in France. [...] Moreover, given the strong ethnic and linguistic links between Luxembourg and Germany, it was feared that Germany might seek to annex Luxembourg into its empire. [...] The government of Luxembourg aimed to avoid this by re-affirming the country's neutrality.|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} a {{biography}} for a tree was well received. The writing was called engaging, lyrical, and compelling. Robert Wiersema wrote, [...] "Tree is science writing at its finest. It's sweeping but focused, <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> {{of both the}} minutiae and the big picture. ...Although some of the concepts are complex, the writing is always accessible... Scientific matters are explained in layman's terms, and the text never bogs down or bottlenecks." [...] However, some reviewers found the language too technical. In the Montreal Gazette, Bronwyn Chester wrote that the scientific language [...] "dilut our feeling and concern for this tree through too much information". Robert Bateman's black and white illustrations, while skilled, were said to add little to the narrative.|$|E
500|$|During {{all of this}} drama, Gygax {{became a}} father again. Over the past year, he had formed a romantic {{relationship}} with Gail Carpenter, his former assistant at TSR. In November 1986, {{she gave birth to}} Gygax's sixth child, Alex. Biographer Michael Witwer believes the birth of Alex forced Gygax to reconsider the equation of work, gaming and family that, up until this time, had been dominated by work and gaming. [...] "Gary, <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> that he had made mistakes as a father, and husband in the past, was determined not to make them again... Gary was also a realist, and knew what good fatherhood would demand, especially at his age." [...] On August 15, 1987, on what would have been his parents' 50th wedding anniversary, Gygax married Gail Carpenter.|$|E
500|$|The {{television}} show was noted {{as a part}} of the mid-2000s films, television, and books that drove a resurgence of the public popularity of magic. Criss Angel Mindfreak was the first weekly magic {{television show}} to air in forty years. Daily Variety reviewed the premiere writing, [...] "The stunts alone are impressive. But what makes the show fascinating are the down-home touches in which we see the kid from New York, who first honed his magic skills at the age of 6. <b>Keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of the camera at all times, Angel manages to offer some personality, especially where family is involved. Viewers follow the illusionist as he contemplates new and more dangerous stunts, while his crew, including his often-fretful brothers, offer insight as to what, other than ego, drives someone in this profession." ...|$|E
500|$|General Prem Chand was {{particularly}} anxious about Bunche's visit. <b>Keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of this, Bunche {{did his best}} to alleviate the general's worries, asking to stay at his residence in Élisabethville instead of a hotel. Prem Chand was alarmed when Bunche presented him with a letter from Thant, but Bunche reached into his pocket and pulled out a suggested response. The general was surprised by the accuracy of the draft in its considerations of the military situation of UN troops during the advance, though the following day he gave Bunche a full explanation of what had occurred. In his official report on the events in Katanga, Bunche concluded, [...] "I have found beyond doubt that it is our machinery that is at fault, far more than the individuals." [...] He returned to UN Headquarters on 10 January with an official apology from ONUC commanders. Thant later commented on the matter, writing, [...] "I felt that it was I, not they, who should have apologised for my miscalculation and apprehensions based on scare reports from London and Brussels." ...|$|E
500|$|Killer7 {{received}} divisive {{reviews and}} sparked debates about depictions {{of sex and}} violence in video games {{and the status of}} video games as art. James Mielke of 1UP.com likened the game's high-contrast art style to noir and neo-noir film such as Se7en. He found that despite poor pacing and stilted gameplay, the [...] "quirky scripting and edgy plot" [...] were strong draws, and called Killer7 one of [...] "most artfully designed footnotes in gaming history". Edge magazine's reviewers echoed this sentiment and predicted that the game would [...] " [...] for future creative leeway", crediting the director with an unwavering artistic vision. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of the game's limited appeal, calling it [...] "a concept game, an arthouse game, a simple game, an often beautiful game, but most certainly never an everyman's game". Yahtzee Croshaw of The Escapist commends the game for [...] "showing exactly what can be done when you flaunt all established convention and just start exploring what can really be done with gaming as an art form".|$|E
500|$|Washington, Jefferson, and James Madison, then a {{representative}} from Virginia, all supported a permanent capital on the Potomac; Hamilton backed a temporary capital in New York City, and a permanent one in Trenton, New Jersey. At the same time, Hamilton's funding proposal, a plan in which {{the federal government would}} assume debts incurred by states in waging the Revolutionary War was failing to garner enough support to pass. Jefferson, understanding that Hamilton needed southern votes to pass his funding plan, and <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> that the Potomac capital concept would fail without additional northern support, made use of an opportunity provided by a chance encounter with Hamilton to an informal dinner meeting at which interested parties could discuss a [...] "mutual accommodation." [...] The deal subsequently struck, known as the Compromise of 1790, cleared the way for passage, in July 1790, of the Residence Act. The act transferred the federal capital to Philadelphia for 10 years, while a permanent capital along the Potomac was under construction. Hamilton's debt assumption plan became law {{with the passage of the}} Funding Act of 1790.|$|E
500|$|Maggie has {{performed}} {{a number of}} feats that suggest she is a genius. She has spelled out E=MC² with her baby blocks, driven Homer's car, escaped from the Springfield daycare center, written her name on an Etch A Sketch, played Internet poker, and treated her pacifier like a cigarette. However, {{the rest of the}} Simpsons family are unaware of Maggie's maturity and Marge carries Maggie wherever they go rather than letting her walk by herself. Maggie is <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. She shows a high degree of dexterity, and she once hit Homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of Itchy and Scratchy. Despite her age, Maggie is a formidable marksman, as seen in [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] where she shoots Mr. Burns with a handgun that falls into her hands, and in a more intentional manner during [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" [...] where she is able to non-fatally shoot a group of mobsters in rapid succession with a rifle that she apparently hides in her crib.|$|E
500|$|In September 1757 Pownall {{travelled}} to New Jersey {{to attend}} the funeral of Governor Jonathan Belcher, and stopped in New York to meet with Loudoun. [...] The commander-in-chief was upset that the Massachusetts General Court had not fully implemented a variety of demands he had made, and he held Pownall responsible. [...] Pownall objected to the interference {{of the military in}} civilian affairs, the threat of which Loudoun used to implement his agenda, maintaining that it was necessary for the governor to lead, not drive, the provincial assembly. [...] The meeting was acrimonious, and Loudoun afterward wrote a letter to London harshly criticising Pownall's position, calling his ideas on governance [...] "high-handed". [...] Loudoun encountered opposition in the General Court (the provincial assembly) to a demand that British troops be billeted with civilians in Boston, and threatened to march additional troops into the province and take housing by force. [...] Pownall requested that the General Court accede in some way to Loudoun's demands, eventually signing a bill authorizing the quartering of troops in inns and other public spaces. [...] This bill was unpopular, and Pownall was negatively cast in the local press as supportive of Loudoun and his policies. [...] Pownall's exchanges with Loudoun, however, show that he was <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of the colonists' position: [...] "the inhabitants of this province are intitled to the natural rights of English born subjects ... the enjoyment of these rights ... will animate and encourage them to resist ... a cruel, invading enemy". [...] He was equally clear on the relationship between the royal governor and his assembly: [...] "a governor must endeavour to lead those people for he cannot drive them and must lead them step by step as he can gett [...] footing." [...] He was so committed to these ideas that he offered to resign; however Loudoun encouraged him to remain in the post. [...] Pownall would later author portions of the 1765 Quartering Act, a Parliamentary bill whose implementation was widely resisted in the colonies.|$|E

2500|$|Ion Luca Caragiale {{was also}} <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> and {{receptive}} of his contemporaries' works and of fin de siècle innovations. The literary creations of Émile Zola were a noted source of inspiration, and the parallel led George Călinescu to propose him and Barbu Ştefănescu Delavrancea {{as the main}} representatives of Zola's style in local literature. At the same time, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea believed that both Năpasta and O făclie de Paşte showed the [...] "obvious enough influence" [...] of Fyodor Dostoevsky.

2500|$|Like {{other artists}} of his age, Noverre was {{probably}} influenced by Horace's Ars Poetica, a manual of aesthetics referenced in Europe since the Renaissance. In his treatise, Horace cautions poets and painters against depicting monstrous or fantastic aberrations of nature such as Medea's slaughter of her children. [...] Noverre was <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of problems of decorum and suitability, and, resisting conventional conservatism, pushed his works from their early academic character {{to one of}} picturesquely vivid and plastic pantomime with the English actor, David Garrick, his stylistic ideal.

2500|$|According to V. Nezdvedtsky, {{the reason}} behind the two writers' {{conflict}} was [...] "the typological resemblances of both and Goncharov's jealousy {{of his more}} fortunate rival." [...] The author poined out that, while working on a completely new type of Russian novel (and leaving behind Grigorovich and Pisemsky with their traditionalism), both Goncharov (who first {{came up with the}} idea of plotline's [...] "poetisation") and Turgenev were up against common challenges and were therefore <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> of each other's works. This by no means involved plagiarism: Goncharov himself in An Uncommon Story drew nothing but parallels, the critic argued. Nezdvetsky thought the conflict might have been easily resolved should Turgenev have been more straightforward in admitting his earlier influences. N. Budanova thought such thing would have been impossible at the time for it would have been perceived by the public as a confession of plagiarism.|$|E
