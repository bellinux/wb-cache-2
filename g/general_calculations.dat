He does not know my Ferdinand as I know him. Papa, too, though the dearest, kindest, fondest father that ever lived, though he has no thought but for my {{happiness}} and lives only for his daughter, papa naturally is not so young as we are. He is, too, {{what is called a}} man of the world. He has seen a great deal; he has formed his opinions of men and life. We cannot expect that he will change them in your, I mean in our favour. Men of the world are of the world, worldly. I do not think they are always right; I do not myself believe in their infallibility. There is no person more clever and more judicious than papa. No person is more considerate. But there are characters so rare, that men of the world do not admit them into their <b>general</b> <b>calculations,</b> and such is yours, Ferdinand.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{few minutes}} that intervened between {{the order to}} advance, and {{the moment when the}} boats got within {{a quarter of a mile}} of the rock, were passed in a {{profound}} quiet, neither side making any noise, though Raoul had no small difficulty in restraining the constitutional impatience of his own men to begin. A boat presents so small an object, however, to artillerists as little skilled as seamen generally are, who depend more on <b>general</b> <b>calculations</b> than on the direct or scientific aim, the latter being usually defeated by the motion of their vessels, that he was unwilling to throw away even his canister. A Frenchman himself, however, he could refrain no longer, and he pointed a carronade, firing it with his own hand. This was the commencement of the strife. All the other guns in the ruin followed, and the lugger kept time as it might be by note. The English rose, gave three cheers, and each launch discharged her gun. At the same instant, the two men who held the matches in the felucca applied them briskly to the vents of their respective pieces. To their surprise, neither exploded, and, on examination, it was discovered that the priming had vanished. To own the truth, he of the Granite State had slyly brushed his hand over the guns, and robbed them of this great essential of their force. He held the priming-horns in his own hands, and resolutely refused to allow them to pass into those of any other person.|$|E

60|$|But I go farther. The Old-Age Pensions Act, so {{far from}} being in {{conflict}} with a scheme of contributory insurance, is really its most helpful and potent ally. The fact that at seventy the State pension is assured {{to all those who}} need it, makes a tremendous difference to every form of insurance confined to the years before seventy, whether for old age or for invalidity. I asked an eminent actuary the other day to make me some calculations. They are rough, <b>general</b> <b>calculations,</b> and no doubt they might be more exact. But roughly, I believe it to be no exaggeration to say that the rates to cover a man till seventy are in many cases scarcely half what they would be, if they had to cover him till death. Do you see what that means? It is a prodigious fact. It is the sort of fact by the discovery of which people make gigantic fortunes; and I suggest to you that we should make this gigantic fortune for John Bull. It means that the whole field of insurance has become much more fruitful than it ever was before, that there is a new class of insurance business possible which never was possible before. It means that the whole field of insurance is far more open to the poorest class of people than it was before, and that with a proper system the benefits of the Old-Age Pensions Act would not be confined to the actual pensioners who are drawing their money, but would extend forwards in anticipation to all other classes and to all other people, and that so far as five shillings a week is concerned--that is not much unless you have not got it--the actuarial position of every man and woman in this country has been enormously improved by the Old-Age Pensions Act.|$|E

40|$|For a caged spiral power spring, its {{moment of}} inertia varies with the time in energy storage and {{is closely related to}} the states of spring strip. Due to {{continuous}} changing of the shape in energy storage, calculation of variable {{moment of inertia}} for spiral power spring is a highly challenging but important issue. A general analytical model and calculation method of variable moment of inertia for spiral power spring are proposed in this article. First, the contraction process of spiral power spring in energy storage is clearly revealed and analytical model of spiral power spring on the basis of contraction process is presented. In terms of the contraction characteristic, a <b>general</b> <b>calculation</b> method based on divisions of stage and state for variable moment of inertia is put forward. Finally, a spiral power spring is designed, and a prototype of the spring is developed.

50|$|A {{recently}} exploited {{technique to}} accelerate traditional volume rendering algorithms such as ray-casting {{is the use}} of modern graphics cards. Starting with the programmable pixel shaders, people recognized the power of parallel operations on multiple pixels and began to perform general-purpose computing on (the) graphics processing units (GPGPU). The pixel shaders are able to read and write randomly from video memory and perform some basic mathematical and logical calculations. These SIMD processors were used to perform <b>general</b> <b>calculations</b> such as rendering polygons and signal processing. In recent GPU generations, the pixel shaders now are able to function as MIMD processors (now able to independently branch) utilizing up to 1 GB of texture memory with floating point formats. With such power, virtually any algorithm with steps that can be performed in parallel, such as volume ray casting or tomographic reconstruction, can be performed with tremendous acceleration. The programmable pixel shaders can be used to simulate variations in the characteristics of lighting, shadow, reflection, emissive color and so forth. Such simulations can be written using high level shading languages.|$|E
