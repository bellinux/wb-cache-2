She rebuffs his {{attempts}} to talk to her, and after gaining employment at the local diner, is further dismayed to find that Newt works there. She tries to have him fired, but eventually accepts that they must work together. After she is locked in a cupboard by Lauren, Rae reveals that she is claustrophobic and believes she is cursed. She tells Newt that both of her sisters died before their 18th birthdays and she believes the same will <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Newt helps Rae to overcome her fear of the curse, and she agrees to move to Scotland with him. However, her grandmother suffers a stroke shortly before her planned departure, so she decides to stay in Hollyoaks to care for her.|$|E

So that's what's in the box ... something along those lines." [...] On how it will affect May now that she is infected by it, Wen said, [...] "You never want May out of control. You don't want her to be paranoid." [...] Whedon added, [...] "You can assume that what happened to those other people might <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> It's not good." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mars, Bars" [...] {{features}} the reappearance {{of the character}} of Bronson, who had previously appeared in [...] "Show Me the Monkey". Mac loses her virginity to Bronson in the episode. However, the writers had initially planned a storyline in which Mac would be taken advantage of by a professor due to her fragile emotional state following her romance with Beaver (Kyle Gallner). However, the storyline was removed, partially {{due to the fact that}} Thomas and the crew wanted Mac to have something positive <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Prior to the filming of this episode, Thomas counseled Jason Dohring and Julie Gonzalo, who play Logan and Parker, respectively, on the two characters' interpersonal chemistry in the episode. Specifically, he did not want them to make their flirting obvious, but rather give [...] "a whiff of connection".|$|E

500|$|The {{experience}} saw {{a change}} in the dog, with Frank later writing, [...] "She wasn't that tame, obedient dog anymore, she was a skinny animal that kept herself alive through cunning and instinct." [...] Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She saved my life in so many ways. The greatest way of all was giving me a reason to live. All I had to do was look at her and into those weary, bloodshot eyes and I would ask myself: What would <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> if I died? I had to keep going. Even if it meant waiting for a miracle." [...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews, {{but also}} criticism for {{several aspects of}} the production. The Morning Telegraph stated, [...] "The photography {{at the beginning of}} the film is poor. It seems queer that the child should be able to escape from the orphan asylum in such an easy manner and that no search be made by the institution. It seemed very theatrical and hardly possible that the child should make the first stop at the house of the father's intended. Why did not the producer have the child make a few more stops or have something <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> instead of making the first stop at the woman's house?" [...] The Moving Picture World spared little coverage of the actual film in its review, noting that the emotional story might be a plausible. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave a detailed review that found the acting favorable, but found the plot and its resolution to be fantastical by stating, [...] "The manifest absurdity of this plot lies in the adoption. No girl just betrothed would ever adopt a runaway orphan." ...|$|E
500|$|The move to {{the sixth}} series also meant Gaiman had to include Rory, who had ceased {{to exist in the}} {{original}} slot in the fifth series. With Rory included, Gaiman had to [...] "reshape" [...] much of {{the second half of the}} episode, featuring Amy being on the run in the TARDIS. In the original draft where Amy was the only companion, Gaiman added a [...] "heartbreaking monologue" [...] by the character, further stating [...] "you get to see what it's like to be the companion from the companion's point of view, and she got to talk about essentially in that version how sad it is, in some ways. One day something will <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> she'll get married, she'll get eaten by monsters, she'll die, she'll get sick of this, but he'll go on forever." [...] At a certain point, Gaiman became tired of rewriting drafts and asked Steven Moffat for help. Moffat wrote in what Gaiman called [...] "several of [...] best lines" [...] and rapidly rewrote several scenes when budget problems harmed filming locations.|$|E

500|$|Noting the realism in {{the writing}} for the series, Gilchrist stated: [...] "It's as if Rhimes and Co. {{harnessed}} the sublime and the mundane of our daily experiences, that strange sense of drama that emerges from even the most unimportant daily conflicts, and it transported it on {{a world that is}} legitimately fraught with life and death decisions." [...] However, he expressed disappointment in {{the end of the second}} season, which he deemed surprisingly less strong, compared to the [...] "powerful" [...] first half and the [...] "immaculate" [...] first season, describing Stevens' [...] "awkward and self-destructive" [...] relationship with a patient as a way to [...] "slow episodes to a screeching halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama", while expressing the predictability of Duquette's death. Gilchrist stated in response to Stevens' development in the last part of the second season: [...] "Izzie's descent into abject hysteria, which followed her season-long sanctimoniousness about everything, actually made me want something terrible to <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> too." [...] He described how some episodes were not among the show's strongest, noting that the some plot lines created poignancy, and connected in an unfamiliar way.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be my hope, that we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E
500|$|The book {{is divided}} into six chapters: It begins with author Alina Simone walking around Bay City, Michigan and pondering why {{there was not a}} single {{commemoration}} to be found in the city about Madonna, who was born there. Simone's research began from that point and the essay continues analyzing Bay City and its culture. In the next chapter the author moves on to talk about 1980s music, Madonna's contribution and popularity after the release of albums, Like a Virgin (1984) and True Blue (1986). One of the questions reiterated by Simone is about the singer's legacy and what would <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> wealth and fortune after her death, seeing that Madonna was not receiving the respect she deserved. With this in mind, Simone talks about how pop culture has moved from one fad to another, and her analysis of the musical landscape in Bay City. In the last chapter titled as Flying Wedge, the author reviews hard rock music and the punk rock bands of the city, and finally how relentless artists can be to produce music. She researches the one-hit wonder bands like Question Mark and the Mysterians—best known for [...] "96 Tears"—and Flying Wedge, a Detroit band that released their record through Creem magazine in 1972 but disappeared. The author ends the book on a happy note that whether Madonna is remembered or not in her hometown, her musical outputs would never be forgotten. Final chapters are devoted to an epilogue about Simone's writing of the book and a thank-you section.|$|E

After Lena was killed, Stine Sofie must have heard the defendants quarreling about who was going to kill her. Jan Helge Andersen explained that Stine Sofie took Lena's arm and later peered onto her. She probably understood at that time that Lena was dead. As the District Court has referred in its judgment, {{it is not possible to}} comprehend the fear and the suffering that the two girls went through before they finally died." ...|$|E
