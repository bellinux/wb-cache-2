5|$|Ragusa Ibla, {{the lower}} city, boasts an <b>impressive</b> <b>array</b> <b>of</b> Baroque architecture, which {{includes}} the Church of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi, designed in 1738 (Illustration 12). In the design of this church Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site. The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps, a Baroque feature, especially exploited in Sicily due to the island's topography. The tower seems to explode from the façade, accentuated by the columns and pilasters canted against the curved walls. Above the doorways and window apertures, pediments scroll and curve {{with a sense of}} freedom and movement which would have been unthinkable to those earlier architects inspired by Bernini and Borromini. The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820.|$|E

25|$|Despite this <b>impressive</b> <b>array</b> <b>of</b> defenses, Washington was {{in truth}} rather lacking in its {{defensive}} capabilities. General John G. Barnard, Grant's engineering officer, noted {{that many of}} the troops were not actually fit for duty as many were new recruits, untried reserves, men recovering from injury, or worn-out veterans. Bernard estimated that instead of 31,000, the actual number of usable troops was around 9,600. The Capital was more vulnerable to Confederate attack than it seemed: with around 10,000 troops, the Confederacy's strength was almost matched by that of the Union.|$|E

25|$|The {{important}} strategic {{location of}} Maastricht {{resulted in the}} construction of an <b>impressive</b> <b>array</b> <b>of</b> fortifications around the city during this period. The Spanish and Dutch garrisons became an important factor in the city's economy.

For over fifty years the Spanish crown took over the role of the dukes of Brabant in the joint sovereignty over Maastricht. In 1632 the city was conquered by Prince Frederick Henry of Orange and the Dutch States General replaced the Spanish crown in the joint government of Maastricht.|$|E
25|$|According to the liberals, the schism left Carlism on {{its last}} legs {{and close to}} total ruin. Nocedalistas claimed that their {{supporters}} were to be counted by the thousands. What actually constituted their potential was rather a few names and especially an <b>impressive</b> <b>array</b> <b>of</b> periodicals, as the breakaways were overrepresented across the Carlist editorial boards. Nocedal led the exiled dissidents into a new organization; initially to be named Partido Tradicionalista, in early 1889 it materialized as Partido Integrista Español. The name was supposed to underline integral unity between Christian and political goals. Though in August 1889 the party renamed itself to , the group was usually referred to as Integristas. Structure of the party stabilised in 1893; each Spanish region was led by a junta, with their work co-ordinated by the party jefe. The post was assumed by Nocedal, which clearly demonstrated his personal grip on Integrism.|$|E
25|$|Tom Petersson and Jol Dantzig of Hamer Guitars {{created the}} idea for a twelve-string bass. Tom Petersson {{previously}} had used an Alembic and Hagstrom 8-string basses, and asked Dantzig to make a 12-string bass. The company initially made him a 10-string bass. Following the successful trial use of that bass, the prototype 12-string bass, The Hamer 'Quad', was produced. Petersson later used 12-string basses made by Kids (a Japanese guitar maker), Chandler, and signature models from Waterstone and from The Electrical Guitar Company. During 2015 and 2016, his primary 12-string bass was one of a pair of prototype Gretsch White Falcon basses in all white and also cream / green finishes. They have been said to be envisaged as a future 'signature' production model. His primary choice of 4-string bass is a Gibson Thunderbird, though he also owns a very <b>impressive</b> <b>array</b> <b>of</b> 4, 5 and 8 stringed basses from other guitar makers. He is also an endorser of Hofner basses.|$|E

25|$|After {{beginning}} his junior football in Bell Park, Bartel left to attend St. Joseph's College, where his talent for sports became evident early. Bartel displayed initial promise as a cricketer, representing the 'Joeys' in 1st XI cricket as a 16-year-old, {{and winning the}} school's batting awards in both 2000 and 2001. This led to selection in the state under-17 team, before a switch in focus toward football instead saw Bartel selected {{to play for the}} Geelong Falcons team in the TAC Cup competition.

40|$|ABSTRACT TO screen {{invertebrate}} tissues for {{the possible}} expression of intermediate filaments (IFs), immunofluorescence microscopy with the monoclonal antibody anti-IFA known to detect all mammalian IF proteins was used (Pruss, R. M., R. Mirsky, M. C. Raft, R. Thorpe, A. J. Dowding, and B. H. Anderton. 1981. Cell, 27 : 419 - 428). In a limited survey, the lower chordate Branchiostoma {{as well as}} the invertebrates Arenicola, Lumbricus, Ascaris, and Helix pomatia revealed a positive reaction primarily on epithelia and on nerves, whereas certain other invertebrates appeared negative. To assess the nature of the positive reaction, Helix pomatia was used since a variety of epithelia was strongly stained by anti-IFA. Fixation-extraction procedures were developed that preserve in electron micrographs <b>of</b> esophagus <b>impressive</b> <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> IFs as tonofilament bundles. Fractionation procedures performed on single cell preparations document large meshworks of long and curvilinear IF by negative stain. These structures can be purified. One- and two-dimensional gels show three components, all of which are recognized by anti-IFA in immunoblotting: 66 kD/pl 6. 35, 53 kD/pl 6. 05, and 52 kD/pl 5. 95.
