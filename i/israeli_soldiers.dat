5|$|The 2006 Lebanon War was a 34-day {{military}} conflict in Lebanon and northern Israel. The principal parties were Hezbollah paramilitary {{forces and the}} Israeli military. The conflict was precipitated by a cross-border raid by Hezbollah during which they kidnapped and killed <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers.</b> The conflict began on 12 July 2006 when Hezbollah militants fired rockets at Israeli border towns as a diversion for an anti-tank missile attack on two armored Humvees patrolling the Israeli {{side of the border}} fence, killing three, injuring two, and seizing two <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers.</b>|$|E

According to Enderlin, the soldiers were Druze.|$|E
5|$|The Sa'iqa company {{achieved}} the only discernible {{success of the}} attack. It managed to land four kilometers east of the fort without facing any aerial resistance (as the company was sailing in civilian fishing boats). The company managed to prevent Israeli reinforcements from reaching the fort, destroying a number of tanks and vehicles. It also captured six <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Lebanon, al-Wazir was {{responsible}} for coordinating high-profile operations.

In this attack, six Fatah members hijacked a bus and killed 35 Israeli civilians.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to an attack against a military convoy comprising Hezbollah and Iranian officers on 18 January 2015 at Quneitra in south of Syria, Hezbollah launched an ambush on 28 January against an Israeli military convoy in the Israeli-occupied Shebaa Farms with anti-tank missiles against two Israeli vehicles patrolling the border, killing 2 and wounding 7 <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers</b> and officers, as confirmed by Israeli military.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 2000, three <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers</b> – Adi Avitan, Staff Sgt. Benyamin Avraham, and Staff Sgt.

Israel Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz has, however, said that Hezbollah abducted the soldiers and then killed them. The bodies of the slain soldiers were exchanged for Lebanese prisoners in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} officially {{began when}} a lone Israeli S-199 bombed Egyptian positions in Isdud at 18:00 on June 2. Five light planes—two Fairchild 24s, two Rapides and one Bonanza—also made bombing runs between 20:25 and 21:30. The bombardment {{did not make}} an impression on the readying <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers,</b> and {{in light of the}} noise created by the Egyptian anti-aircraft guns, the Israelis considered that the plane was lucky to have survived the run. In addition, the troops were exhausted, not having had proper sleep in the four days preceding the operation. At 22:00, the Israeli forces started moving against the Egyptian positions.|$|E

5|$|The troops {{tasked with}} {{isolating}} Fort Lahtzanit began crossing the canal in dinghies at 2:15p.m.. Ten minutes later {{they reached the}} east bank and proceeded to climb the sand wall. They succeeded in attracting Israeli fire, thereby facilitating the main assault force in its mission to attack the fort later on. The troops tasked with isolating the fort from the east reached and occupied a firing ramp prepared for tanks, and raised the Egyptian flag over it. This severely demoralized the <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers</b> inside Fort Lahtzanit. Soon after the Sa'iqa company (less one platoon) arrived at the firing ramp as well.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Palestinian historiography and {{collective}} memory {{point out that}} during the exodus of Palestinian Arab population of the 1948 War the massacres and forced expulsions that happened {{could be seen as}} ethnic cleansing. In the Latrun zone, this affected about 20 villages and ten thousand Palestinian Arabs. Some inhabitants fled during the fights of April but most fled when the Israelis attacked their village during the following operations. After capturing a village, the <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers</b> systematically expelled the non-combatants, intimidating them to leave and demolishing houses. A massacre of between thirty and seventy Arabs took place some days after Abu Shusha was taken. Most villages were levelled, {{so as not to be}} used by the Arab volunteers and to prevent the inhabitants returning. In some cases Jewish settlements were established on village land.|$|E
5|$|On 25 July 1993, {{following}} Hezbollah's {{killing of}} seven <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers</b> in southern Lebanon, Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War), {{during which the}} IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern Lebanon since 1982. The aim of the operation was to eradicate {{the threat posed by}} Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the Lebanese Government to restrain Hezbollah. The fighting ended when an unwritten understanding was agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would not fire rockets at northern Israel, while Israel would not attack civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Chinese Farm {{took place}} during October 15 to October 17, 1973 between the Egyptian Army and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), {{as part of the}} Yom Kippur War. It was fought in the Sinai Peninsula, north of the Great Bitter Lake and just east of the Suez Canal, near an Egyptian {{agricultural}} research station. The farm featured specialized Japanese-made machinery; <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers</b> mistook Japanese characters on this equipment for Chinese, leading to the area being labeled 'Chinese Farm' on Israeli military maps. The battle began when the IDF launched Operation Abiray-Lev ("Stouthearted Men"), attempting to establish a corridor to the canal and allow bridges to be laid for a crossing. Accordingly, the Israelis attacked Egyptian forces in and around the Chinese Farm.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers,</b> nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E
5|$|Despite Negev's achievements, {{they were}} also given an order to retreat, as the Israeli command {{did not wish to}} fight in broad daylight. The {{retreating}} forces {{had no choice but to}} use a route similar to the ones they came from, which slowed down their movement. Most of the machine guns that they had brought had broken down in the sandy environment, and could not provide them with cover. They were also carrying a multitude of wounded soldiers. Muhammad Naguib decided to use the armored vehicles in his operational reserve against the retreating forces, fearing a possible cut-off from the rest of the Egyptian forces in Palestine. According to Simha Shiloni, commander of the Negev Beasts battalion, the Israelis, especially the wounded, thought that all was lost when this happened. However, the vehicles stopped eventually as they got bogged down in the sands, and the troops made it back to Nitzanim. Sixteen <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers</b> were killed in the retreat.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} of October 2000, the IDF {{prohibited}} Israeli access to the tomb. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, Nablus was reoccupied by the IDF in April 2002, with severe damage to the historic core of the city, where 64 heritage buildings suffered serious damage or were destroyed. Some Breslov hasidim and others began {{to take advantage of}} the new circumstances to visit the site clandestinely under the cover of darkness, evading army and police checkpoints. Eventually Joseph’s tomb was once more open to visits. In May 2002, <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers</b> mistakenly opened fire on a convoy of settlers taking advantage of an ongoing incursion in Nablus to visit the tomb. Seven settlers were arrested by the army for illegally entering a combat zone. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, the tomb was retaken by the IDF and shortly afterwards, in response to numerous requests, they renewed guarded tours of the tomb. One day every month at midnight as many as 800 visitors were allowed to pray at the gravesite. These visits were designed to prevent unauthorized and unprotected clandestine visits, mainly by Breslav Hassidim. However, in October, citing security reasons, Israel re-imposed a ban on Jewish pilgrims obtaining special permits and travelling to the tomb.|$|E
5|$|At around 2:50p.m., the B-10 rifles on {{the west}} bank managed to open a breach in the barbed wire {{surrounding}} the fort, and also destroyed other significant targets, such as the observation equipment. Meanwhile, combat engineers were breaching further openings using Bangalore torpedoes, under heavy small arms fire and hand grenades. The battalion's main assault force was crossing at the same time. The main assault force then funneled through the breaches and entered the Israeli trenches. The Israeli command in Northern Sinai kept receiving frantic calls for help from the fort's radio operator, and gunfire could also be heard. The Egyptians captured the southern sector of the fort by 3:05p.m.. Five minutes later, the assault force moved against the northern sector of the fort. Within fifteen minutes, the Egyptians were in control of the fort. The power generator inside the fort was destroyed, and all electricity and communication lines leading to the fort were severed. At 3:30p.m., Maj. Gen. Khaled was informed that Lahtzanit had been seized and that <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers</b> had been captured. The Israelis reported losing radio contact with the fort at around 4:00p.m.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the Lexicon-Tirtur {{junction}} was the village of al-Galaa. Prior to the 1967 Six Day War, the village had been {{the site of an}} agricultural project. This agricultural station incorporated several irrigation ditches and specialized Japanese-made machinery. When the Sinai came under Israeli occupation, <b>Israeli</b> <b>soldiers</b> unwittingly mistook the Japanese characters for Chinese ones, leading to the location being labeled 'Chinese Farm' on military maps. Just north and north-west of Chinese Farm was a hill mass known by its Israeli codename 'Missouri'. During Operation Badr, al-Galaa and the Chinese Farm fell within the designated bridgehead of the 16th Infantry Division. Abd el-Hamid's 16th Infantry Brigade occupied and defended these locations. After partaking in the initial canal-crossing, the brigade, {{along with the rest of}} the division, faced an attack by Raviv's brigade on October 9. The Israelis achieved some initial gains, but were repelled by the end of the day. Also located within 16th Division's bridgehead, as of October 13, was the 21st Armored Division. Its units were positioned in the center and the {{north of the}} bridgehead. The 14th Brigade had been involved in the crossing and, along with the 1st Brigade, participated in the Egyptian offensive on October 14; as a result, it had lost half of its operational tank strength. In the aftermath, Oraby's efforts to reorganize and replace armored losses were hampered by frequent artillery barrages and air strikes. On October 15, there were 136 tanks in the Egyptian bridgehead, unevenly split among Oraby's brigades: 66 with the 1st Armored Brigade, 39 with the 14th Armored Brigade, and 31 in the 18th Mechanized Brigade. Despite their heavy losses, the Egyptian forces in the bridgehead outnumbered Reshef's force.|$|E
