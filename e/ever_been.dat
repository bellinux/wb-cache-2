5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> obtained.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the last}} {{remaining}} major poets of the Silver Age, she was newly acclaimed by the Soviet authorities as a fine and loyal representative of their country and permitted to travel. At the same time, by virtue of works such as Requiem, Akhmatova was being hailed at home and abroad as an unofficial leader of the dissident movement, and reinforcing this image herself. She was becoming representative of both the Soviet Union and Tsarist Russia, more popular in the 1960s than she had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> before the revolution, this reputation only continuing to grow after her death. For her 75th birthday in 1964, new collections of her verse were published.|$|E

5|$|Davison was {{a staunch}} feminist and passionate Christian, and {{considered}} that socialism was {{a moral and}} political force for good.

Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse; none has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> proven.|$|E

50|$|Now, if {{we assume}} that the number of humans who will <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> born equals N1, the {{probability}} that X is amongst the first 60 billion humans who have <b>ever</b> lived <b>is</b> of course 100%.

Since X is in fact amongst the first 60 billion humans who have ever lived, this means that the total number of humans who will <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> born {{is more likely to be}} much closer to 60 billion than to 6,000 billion. In essence the DA therefore suggests that human extinction is more likely to occur sooner rather than later.|$|R
