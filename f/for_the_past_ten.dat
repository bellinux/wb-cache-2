40|$|Soil {{stabilization}} {{was applied}} by using quick lime {{in order to}} increase the strength and prevent the frost heave of weak subgrade at a road construction site. The site investigation revealed that the soil was deposited due to repeated landslides of the surrounding unstable slope consisting of sand and silt <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>tens</b> of thousands of years. This paper presents the quick lime stabilization design of the subgrade from the bearing strength point of view based on the CBR test results <b>for</b> <b>the</b> quick lime mixed soil. A series of laboratory frost heave tests was also performed to confirm the frost heave control effects of quick lime <b>for</b> <b>the</b> soil samples. A new and simple frost heave test apparatus was developed and used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> present test <b>for</b> convenience to deal large number of test in future. According to the test results, the amount of frost heave decreased with increasing additive amount of lime. The frost heave control effect of quick lime stabilization is presently investigated on-site through measurements of depth distributions of temperature and displacement under the road...|$|R

Numerous headstones and mausoleums {{had been}} defaced by graffiti, many gravestones had been toppled and some destroyed, and the grounds were strewn with trash and liquor bottles.

[...] When Plain Dealer reporters interviewed Jim Glending, acting city properties chief, about the cemetery, he ordered {{an assessment of}} each cemetery so a repair and maintenance plan could be developed.

Vicki Blum Vigil, {{author of a book}} on Cuyahoga County cemeteries, claimed that maintenance at Woodland Cemetery was better than at many privately owned cemeteries. Vigil blamed vandalism and an increasing number of cemetery visitors for Woodland's problems. The Plain Dealer report led to extensive maintenance improvements at Woodland over the next three months.
