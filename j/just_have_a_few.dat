60|$|Hardly {{any part}} of the body, which can be unnaturally modified, has escaped. The amount of {{suffering}} thus caused must have been wonderfully great, for many of the operations require several years for their completion, so that the idea of their necessity must be imperative. The motives are various; the men paint their bodies to make themselves appear terrible in battle; certain mutilations are connected with religious rites; or they mark the age of puberty, or the rank of the man, or they serve to distinguish the tribes. As with savages the same fashions prevail for long periods,[421] mutilations, from whatever cause first made, soon come to be valued as distinctive marks. But self-adornment, vanity, and the admiration of others, seem to be the commonest motives. In regard to tattooing, I was told by the missionaries in New Zealand, that when they tried to persuade some girls to give up the practice, they answered, “We must <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> lines on our lips; else when we grow old we shall be so very ugly.” With the men of New Zealand, a most capable judge[422] says, “to have fine tattooed faces was the great ambition of the young, both to render themselves attractive to the ladies, and conspicuous in war.” A star tattooed on the forehead and a spot on the chin are thought by the women in one part of Africa to be irresistible attractions.[423] In most, but not all parts of the world, the men are more highly ornamented than the women, and often in a different manner; sometimes, though rarely, the women are hardly at all ornamented. As the women are made by savages to perform the greatest share of the work, and as they are not allowed to eat the best kinds of food, so it accords with the characteristic selfishness of man that they {{should not be allowed to}} obtain, or to use, the finest ornaments. Lastly it is a remarkable fact, as proved by the foregoing quotations, that the same fashions in modifying the shape of the head, in ornamenting the hair, in painting, tattooing, perforating the nose, lips, or ears, in removing or filing the teeth, &c., now prevail and have long prevailed in the most distant quarters of the world. It is extremely improbable that these practices which are followed by so many distinct nations are due to tradition from any common source. They rather indicate the close similarity of the mind of man, to whatever race he may belong, in the same manner as the almost universal habits of dancing, masquerading, and making rude pictures.|$|E

5000|$|Zeppo's {{parts were}} always {{intended}} to be a parody of the juvenile role often found in sappy musicals of the 1920s-30s era. Sometimes, he would <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> lines, and he would otherwise be reduced to standing in the background with a big smile on his face. In these roles, he was a lampoon of the infamous extra, always grinning widely as a needless decoration, and always stiff and wooden. In other films, Zeppo would have a more significant role as the romantic lead, but he would still always be stiff, wooden, and, yes, with a big smile on his face. Either way, he could never be considered a real straight man. He was a sappy distortion of the real thing, and sort of the gateway through which we connected with the other Brothers. We perceived him as the [...] "normal, good-looking" [...] one of the bunch, but was he really? Wasn't there something about that line from The Cocoanuts, 'You can depend upon me, Mr. Hammer,' that was a little too ... happy? Roger Ebert called Zeppo 'superfluous,' and that is the point of his character in the five Paramount films. He was the straight man only in pure Marxian sense—while his Brothers spat on movie clichés, he imitated them, proving in his own way to be quite a brilliant comedian.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a Bayesian restoration method for low-resolution images {{combined with a}} geometry-driven smoothness prior and a new global multimodal prior. The multimodal prior is proposed for images that normally <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dominant colours. In spite of this, most images contain much more colours due to noise and edge pixels {{that are part of}} two or more connected smooth regions. The Maximum A Posteriori estimator is worked out to solve the problem. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed global multimodal prior for images with a strong multimodal colour distribution such as cartoons. We also show the visual superiority of our reconstruction scheme to other traditional interpolation and reconstruction methods: noise and compression artifacts are removed very well and our method produces less blur and other annoying artifacts...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at {{exploring}} issues relating to power system security analysis particularly arising under an open access deregulated environment. Numerical methods and computation algorithms locating the critical security condition points and visualizing the security hyper-plane in the parameter space are proposed. The power industry is undergoing changes leading to restructuring and privatizing in many countries. This restructuring consists in changing the power industry from a regulated and vertically integrated form into regional, competitive and functionally separate entities. This is done {{with the prospect of}} increasing efficiency by better management and better usage of existing equipment and lower price of electricity to all types of customers while maintaining a reliable system. As a result of deregulation and restructuring, power suppliers will increasingly try to deliver more energy to customers using existing system facilities, thereby putting the system under heavy stress. Accordingly, many technical and economic issues have arisen, for example, all or some of transient instability, aperiodic and oscillatory instability, insufficient reactive power supply, and even voltage collapse problems may coexist. This situation introduces the requirement for comprehensive analytical tools to assess the system security conditions, as well as to provide optimal control strategies to overcome these problems. There are computational techniques for assessing the power system stability critical conditions in given loading directions, but {{it is not enough to}} <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> critical points in the parameter space to formulate an optimal control to avoid insecurity. A boundary or hyper-plane containing all such critical and subcritical security condition points will provide a comprehensive understanding of the power system operational situation and therefore can be used to provide a global optimal control action to enhance the system security. With the security boundary or hyper-plane available, the system operators can place the power system inside the security boundaries, away from instability, and enhance its security in an optimal way. Based on proper power system modelling, a general method is proposed to locate the power system small signal stability characteristic points, which include load flow feasibility points, aperiodic and oscillatory stability points, minimum and maximum damping points. Numerical methods for tracing the power system bifurcation boundaries are proposed to overcome nonconvexity and provide an efficient parameter continuation approach to trace stability boundaries of interest. A Delta-plane method for visualizing the power system load flow feasibility and bifurcation boundaries is proposed. The optimization problem defined by assessing the minimal distance from an operating point to the boundaries is considered. In particular, emphasis is placed on computing all locally minimal and the global minimum distances. Due to the complexity of any power system, traditional optimization techniques sometimes fail to locate the global optimal solutions which are essential to power system security analysis. However, genetic algorithms, due to their robustness and loose problem pre-requisites, are shown to fulfill the task rather satisfactorily. Finally, a toolbox is described which incorporates all these proposed techniques, and is being developed for power system stability assessment and enhancement analysis...|$|E

40|$|Background: Because of {{the various}} defects of malarplasty, includ-ing a large incision, much bleeding, visible scars after the operation, and so on, caused by the {{conventional}} coronal incision or the temporal incision with the intraoral incision approach, the malarplasty by sim-ple intraoral approach is an innovative development. Methods: Through the intraoral approach and subperiosteal dissection, we can reach the osteotomy point on the zygomatic body directly and arrive at the osteotomy point at the zygomatic arch end along the medial side of the zygoma. A newL osteotomy is appliedwith the reciprocating saw. In addition, the osteotomy {{was performed on the}} zygomatic arch from the inside out with an angle of 20 degrees horizontally. Results: From 1997 to 2010, we were satisfied with the results of 114 cases of malarplasty with the intraoral approach and L osteotomy as the observed objects. There are 103 cases for women and 11 for men. Ages ranged from 16 to 48 years. The mean operation time is ap-proximately 1 hour. We <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> complications: 3 nonunion at the tomy for zygoma reduction can reduce prominent zygoma while maintaining the natural curves of the zygomatic body and arch.
