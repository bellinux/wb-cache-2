By means of the <b>embedded</b> <b>coils</b> and a least squares fitting algorithm the location of these electrodes can be specified in both head and cryostat based coordinate systems.

40|$|In this paper, high-efficiency silicon-embedded core-less coupled {{inductors}} {{are demonstrated}} for power supply on chip applications. The embedded coupled inductors have two interleaved thick inductor coils {{embedded in the}} bottom layer of the Si substrate and four copper vias formed in the top substrate layer. The embedded coupled inductors can be stacked underneath the active circuitry for compact on-chip integration, while small resistances can be achieved with the thick <b>embedded</b> <b>coils,</b> which lead to high efficiency. As a demonstration, embedded coupled inductors with a small area of 0. 5 mm(2) were designed and fabricated according to the on-chip dc-dc converter with the highest reported efficiency. The fabricated embedded coupled inductors show a much higher efficiency of 93 % compared to the 84 % efficiency of the originally used on-substrate coupled inductors, allowing the total converter loss to be reduced by 38 % and the converter efficiency to be improved from 78 % to 85 %...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{solution}} to avoid unwanted piercing and cutting of tubular structures, in particular ureters, in robotic surgery. We propose a surgical navigator that allows surgeons to understand in real time the path of tubular structures in respect to surgical instruments during the intervention. In humans, the ureters are ducts made of smooth muscle fibers that propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. Since they are embedded in the surrounding structures, their identification during surgery is difficult. Particularly, for surgeries whose area of interest {{is very close to}} ureters, as for hysterectomy, the risk of piercing the ureter is high because the surgeon doesn’t have information about its exact path. We can <b>embedded</b> <b>coils</b> in urologic catheters, in order to insert them in ureters during surgery, and to determine ureters path (in 3 D space) by means of a commercially available electromagnetic tracking system. The catheters contain a chain of sensors that will remain in the ureters as a beacon to address the effect of tissue motion and deformation. By tracking the surgical instruments tips, we can develop a system equipped with graphic interface and alarms, avoiding the cutting of ureters, safeguarding patients and preventing related disorders. In this feasibility study we evaluated the compatibility of electromagnetic tracking with a robotic device frequently employed for this kind of interventions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFacing {{the heavy}} organisational, {{financial}} and environmental constraints imposed by usual winter maintenancesalting operations, pavement engineers have {{been led to}} look for alternative solutions to avoid ice or snow depositat pavements surface. Among the solutions, one is self-de-icing heating pavements, for which two technologieshave been developed so far: one is based on <b>embedded</b> <b>coils</b> circulating a heated calorific fluid under the pavementsurface; the other one relies {{on the use of}} embedded resistant electric wires. The use and operation of such systemsin the world is still limited and was only confined to small road stretches or specific applications, such as bridgeswhich are particularly sensitive to frost. One of the most significant “coil technology” example in Europe is theSERSO-System (Solar Energy recovery from road surfaces) built in 1994, on a Switzerland bridge. Many ofthese experiences are referenced in the technical literature, which provides state-of-the art papers (see for instanceEugster) and useful detailed information dealing with the construction and operational management of suchinstallation. The present study is taking part of the Forever Open Road Concept addressed by the R 5 G: 5 th Generation Road, one of the major project supported by IFSTTAR. It considers a different design of self-de-icing road thatsimplify its mode of construction and maintenance, compared to the two technologies mentioned above. It shouldalso be noted that similar to pavements instrumented with coils, such structure could be used in the reversible wayto capture the solar energy at the pavement surface during sunny days and store it, to either warm the pavementat a later stage or for exogenous needs (e. g. contribution to domestic hot water). To complete our study we alsoconsidered the use of semi-transparent pavement course wearing in place of the traditional opaque one. In the present study, a 2 D model was developed using FEM approach. It combines 2 numerical models. Oneis dedicated to the calculation of the heat transfer inside the porous layer between the fluid and the structureaccording to the geometry studied and the physical properties of the components of the system. The second oneaddresses the heat transfer inside the different layer of the pavement and was adapted to allow the insertion of asemi-transparent surface layer (for sun radiation). The temperature spatial distribution within the structure and itssurface is calculated at different time step according to the evolution of boundary conditions at its surface. Variouslocation in France were selected and calculation of the temperature field was carried-out over a year. Discussionon the performances of such system versus its location is proposed.

40|$|The use {{of metals}} and alloys with melting point near room temperature, called here as liquid metals, allows the {{integration}} of complex three-dimensional metallic micro structures in lab-on-chip devices. The process involves the injection molten liquid metal into microchannels and subsequent solidification at room temperature. The paper reports a technique for the fabrication of three-dimensional multilayer liquid-metal microcoils by lamination of dry adhesive films. The adhesive-based liquid metal microcoil {{could be used for}} magnetic resonance relaxometry (MRR) measurement in a lab-on-a-chip platform. Not only that the coil has a low direct-current resistance, it also has a high quality factor. In this paper, we investigate the sensing and actuating capabilities of the liquid metal microcoil. The sensing capability of the microcoil is demonstrated with the coil working as a blood hematocrit level sensor. In a MRR measurement, the transverse relaxation rate of the blood sample increases quadratically with the hematocrit level due to higher magnetic susceptibility. Furthermore, a vibrating adhesive membrane with the <b>embedded</b> <b>coil</b> was realized for electromagnetic actuation.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{design of the}} W 7 -AS confinement system {{was made in the}} years 1983 / 84. Using the symmetry of mechanical loads within each of the five modules, a finite element model for one half module was generated. Structure shell, supporting elements and coils were simulated by a relatively coarse model consisting of 1095 FE's, 6948 nodes and 25956 degrees of freedom. The FE-modelling and simulation of magnetic and thermal loads had been done by IABG, Ottobrunn, Munich, using the program MSC/NASTRAN. A refined analysis with the cut out of the individual coils taking into account the actual <b>embedding</b> of the <b>coils</b> with sliding surfaces had the aim to get more detailed calculations of internal stress and strain components of the winding pack. The critically stressed circumferential portion of MF-coil No. 3 together with a possible slippage of that coil within the structure was recognized. A solution for the <b>embedding</b> of the <b>coil</b> was worked out based on the calculated results. Following the FE-results at that time, no radial <b>embedding</b> of <b>coil</b> No. 3 seemed to be necessary along the outward coil circumference. During the commissioning of W 7 -AS with full field some local problems appeared in the coil system of the experiment with the effect of some slipping of coil No. 3 together with unallowed stress and strain levels in the compound material of the winding pack. The tangential stresses at the region of minimum coil curvature and the shear stress in the mid-plane of the pancake reached values of twice compared to the allowed ones. With the aim to get {{a better understanding of the}} local strain and stress behaviour of the coil No. 3 the original IABG model of the coil system had been reactivated using another FE-programme ANSYS and comparisons had been made with models based on a new slipping capability between coils and surrounding structure. Results of these calculations show a good correspondence to the measured values. Additionally a radial <b>embedding</b> of <b>coil</b> No. 3 had been introduced with the effect of a reduction of stresses of the overloaded coil by a factor of 2. (orig.)
