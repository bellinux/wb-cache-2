5|$|Christian metal {{groups such}} as Barnabas and Extol have criticized bands within the {{industry}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> innovation and for isolating bands within the industry. Pastor Bob Beeman of Sanctuary International stated {{that this is a}} compliment to secular music, as it lets people to listen to the music they enjoyed without feeling like they are giving up on the style they love and allows bands to crossover into mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Ernest Aris would blatantly plagiarise {{not only}} the Peter Rabbit {{character}} in his The Treasure Seekers but Jemima in his Mrs. Beak Duck. Potter was restrained when alerted to the imitations: she praised his technical artistry but chastised him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> originality. At the time, her eyesight was deteriorating and her days were heavily invested in operating her farm; her restraint with Aris {{may be attributed to}} her desire to enlist him as a collaborator.|$|E

5|$|On July 24, 2013, Kennedy was one {{of seven}} members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) {{who voted against the}} Amash-Conyers {{amendment}} to limit Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which tried to restrict NSA surveillance programs. In contrast, a majority of both CPC members and of Democratic members of Congress voted for the amendment, while Kennedy stood out as a supporter of the party leadership. His vote has been criticized as a sign <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> commitment to civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|The album's musical {{style is}} {{primarily}} urban and R, {{in contrast to}} the pop sounds of Milian's previous albums, a change suggested by Island Def Jam. Following criticism over her previous albums <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> consistency, Milian had ten of the album's tracks produced by Cool & Dre. Lyrically, the album was inspired by Milian's breakup with Nick Cannon. So Amazin was completed within a three-month period, and Milian received writing credit for nine of the album's songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in North America on November 2, 2012. Critics were divided over the film's homage to martial arts films, considering it well-choreographed and representative of the genre, but offering nothing original, and the direction was criticized <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> refinement. The performances of Crowe and Mann were well received. The film earned $19 million at the box office.|$|E

5|$|After facing {{criticism}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{production in}} the first two weeks, Smith turned in a record-setting performance against the St. Louis Rams in Week 3. In the first quarter, he scored on each of his first three career receptions with 74-, 41-, and 18-yard touchdowns. The 74-yard score was the longest completion of quarterback Joe Flacco's career. He became the first NFL rookie, and only the twelfth player, to amass three touchdown receptions in a single quarter. Smith finished the game with five receptions for 152yards in the 37–7 victory. It remains a Ravens rookie record, as does Smith's 30.4 yards per catch that day.|$|E
5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on the Orient Express which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called the voice acting excellent, {{with the voice}} actors bringing the characters to life, thanks largely to David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who {{said that it was}} tense at moments, but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from the Orient Express itself, and other environmental noises such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized the game <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of flashbacks, Karman's life is told. He lost his pro-Dutch father during the Indonesian National Revolution and was raised in poverty before {{going to work for}} the rich {{merchant}} Haji Bakir as a child, babysitting his daughter Rifah. In the two years Karman lived with them, the family raised him to be a devout Muslim; Karman, for his part, was a diligent worker and cared deeply for Rifah. When his uncle returned from the front, Karman was brought back home and educated until junior high school, dropping out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> funds. When he was in his twenties Karman found a job at the local village chief's office {{with the help of a}} civil employee named Triman and a teacher named Margo.|$|E
50|$|Such {{efforts are}} {{critical}} as the US {{has often been}} criticized <b>for</b> having <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coherent family policy for all its people (e.g., health care, housing, employment, leisure, community and economic development).|$|R
50|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews. While critics praised Antoine Monod's cinematography, they criticised {{the story}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> perceived <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> originality, {{comparing it to}} The English Patient and The Sheltering Sky.|$|R

5|$|Prime Minister Petr Nečas defended Drobil, {{and called}} Michálek untrustworthy despite his public {{reputation}} as a whistleblower. Since the Civic Democrats vowed to fight corruption, losing its first minister to corruption charges was {{a blow to the}} party's standing. The Drobil incident was the first of several high-profile resignations. On December 21, 2010, Czech Police Chief Oldrich Martinu resigned after Interior Minister Radek John's month-long call for his ouster in part due to the Drobil case's mishandling. Michálek returned to the State Environmental Fund as a financial analyst in 2011. The Drobil case is on indefinite hiatus <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> evidence as of September 2012. As of February 2013, the case against Knetig is on a similar hiatus for insufficient evidence.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{started in}} December 1971 at Morgan Studios, London. Unlike {{previous}} albums, where Anderson had generally written songs in advance, only the initial {{section of the}} album had been worked out when the band went into the studio. The remainder of the suite was written during the recording sessions. To compensate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> material, Anderson got up early each morning to prepare music {{for the rest of}} the band to learn during that day's session. The lyrics were written first, with the music constructed to fit around them. Anderson recalls the album took about two weeks to record and another two or three for overdubs and mixing. The final work spanned the entire length of an LP record, split over two sides.|$|E
5|$|The Stick of Truth {{was subject}} to {{censorship}} in some regions because of its content, which includes abortions and Nazi imagery; Parker and Stone replaced the scenes with detailed explanations of what occurs in each scene. The game was released to positive reviews, which praised the comedic script, visual style, and faithfulness to the source material. It received criticism <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> challenging combat and technical issues that slowed or impeded progress. A sequel, , was released on October 17, 2017. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of The Stick of Truth were released with The Fractured but Whole.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} criticized <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{production}} {{during the regular}} season and was ranked 103rd in total offense. The Hokies gained just 301 yards of offense on average {{during the regular season}}. Despite the meager statistical performance, Tech did have some standout players. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who had been expected to sit out the season in reserve, finished the year as the team's starter. Running back Darren Evans was named a second-team All-ACC selection, as was guard Sergio Render. Taylor's favorite passing targets were wide receivers Danny Coale and Jarrett Boykin. Coale entered the ACC Championship Game having caught 32 catches for 352 yards, while Boykin grabbed 27 passes for 407 yards.|$|E
5|$|Born in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz, Kirchner studied {{law at the}} National University of La Plata. He met {{and married}} Cristina Fernández at this time, {{returned}} with her to Río Gallegos at graduation, and opened a law firm. Commentators have criticized him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> legal activism during the Dirty War, an issue he would involve himself in as president. Kirchner ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987 and for governor of Santa Cruz in 1991. He was reelected governor in 1995 and 1999 due to an amendment of the provincial constitution. Kirchner sided with Buenos Aires provincial governor Eduardo Duhalde against President Carlos Menem. Although Duhalde lost the 1999 presidential election, he was appointed president by the Congress when previous presidents Fernando de la Rúa and Adolfo Rodríguez Saá resigned during the December 2001 riots. Duhalde suggested that Kirchner {{run for president in}} 2003 in a bid to prevent Menem's return to the presidency. Menem won a plurality {{in the first round of}} the presidential election but, fearing that he would lose in the required runoff election, he resigned; Kirchner became president as a result.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{production}} {{problems and}} the fact that the I-250 had yet even to be submitted for State acceptance trails, an order had been placed for fifty more aircraft on 26 February (these aircraft have been referred to as the MiG-13, which presumably would have been their designation if they had actually entered service). A new deadline of 5 July 1946 was set for the delivery of the first pre-production aircraft, but it was stymied, again, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> an engine. By this time seven airframes had been completed, but all lacked engines. The first I-250 was finally accepted on 8 August and flown for the first time three days later, although its engine seals failed and a number of ignition cables were scorched. The engine replacement and repairs forced the aircraft to miss its scheduled appearance at the Tushino Air Display. It was handed over to the NII VVS (Air Force Institute) on 15 September to finally begin its State acceptance tests. All ten aircraft had been delivered by 30 October, although construction number 3810107 (Factory No. 381, first batch, seventh aircraft) was used as a static test airframe and 3810110 became a static engine testbed.|$|E
50|$|However, the CAS {{was criticized}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{perceived}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> public input, perverse incentives between media corporations and ISPs, harsh mitigation measures, and reversal of {{burden of proof}} standards. The EFF made particularly detailed criticisms.|$|R

5|$|On 30 July, {{to protect}} Cobra's flank {{and prevent the}} {{disengagement}} and relocation of further German forces, the British VIII Corps and XXX Corps launched Operation Bluecoat south from Caumont toward Vire and Mont Pinçon. Bluecoat kept German armoured units fixed on the British eastern front and continued the wearing down {{of the strength of}} German armoured formations in the area. The breakthrough in the centre of the Allied front surprised the Germans, when they were distracted by the Allied attacks {{at both ends of the}} Normandy bridgehead. By the time of the American breakout at Avranches, there was little to no reserve strength left for Unternehmen Lüttich (Operation Liège), the German counter-offensive, which had been defeated by 12 August, leaving the 7th Army with no choice but to retire rapidly east of the Orne river, with a rearguard of the remaining armoured and motorised units, to allow time for the surviving infantry to reach the Seine. After the first stage of the withdrawal beyond the Orne, the manoeuvre collapsed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> fuel, Allied air attacks and the constant pressure of the Allied armies, culminating in the encirclement of German forces in the Falaise pocket.|$|E
