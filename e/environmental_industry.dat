The Tsang government also quickly formed a Task Force on Economic Challenges to deal with the crisis. Tsang came up with six economic sectors to explore with the recommendations of the Task Force in his 2009–10 policy address: (1) testing and certification, (2) medical services, (3) innovation and technology, (4) cultural and creative industries, (5) <b>environmental</b> <b>industry,</b> and (6) educational services. The government pledged to provide more concrete support in those sectors and called them as the [...] "new economic pillars". After a year of negative record of GDP growth rate, the Hong Kong economy recovered quickly from 2010, despite the poverty population keep growing under Tsang tenure.|$|E

This study analyzes the regional growth of <b>environmental</b> <b>industries</b> {{based on the number of}} firms and employment growth from 2007 to 2012. Using employment data and employing a shift-share analysis, this study examines changes in the relative competitiveness of <b>environmental</b> <b>industries</b> by region(metropolitan cities and provinces), and by industry (manufacturing, construction, trade, and service industries). The results show that <b>environmental</b> <b>industries</b> experienced faster growth than other industries over the past 5 years. In particular, the environmental service sector showed a substantial growth rate. The analysis indicates that the relative competitiveness of <b>environmental</b> <b>industries</b> in local provinces rather than metropolitan cities has increased significantly since 2007. <b>Environmental</b> <b>industries</b> can thus be considered as a potential new economic base for economically-stagnant provinces in South Korea. In addition, the results show that each province is competitive in different <b>environmental</b> <b>industries.</b> This suggests that policy makers should pursue economic growth initiatives by identifying the <b>environmental</b> <b>industries</b> in their region with relatively high competitive potential...|$|R

This methodology, based on technical system evolution, is comprised of various types of methods, calculations in aspects of solving technical problems, innovative exploration, as the problem comprehensive solving system. And this system mainly includes 4 separation principles, 8 technical evolution models, 39 general engineering parameters, 40 inventive principles, 39 × 39 solving contradiction matrix, 76 standard solutions, the algorithm of inventive problem solving (ARIZ), engineering knowledge effect base, a series of comprehensive methodology system. TRIZ theory has been applied into more and more fields, such as management, society, and also is useful of <b>environmental</b> protection <b>industry</b> with characteristics of uncertainty confliction, inter-discipline and so on. It is well-known that <b>environmental</b> protection <b>industry</b> has becoming more and more important in national economic development and industrial structure adjustment. This kind industry has exhibited both economic and environmental protection characteristics, and been paid great attention by the nation and public.

40|$|Global {{environmental}} problems and increasing oil prices {{due to the}} depletion of fossil resources are forcing today’s economy to shift to more sustained businesses. Because the development of <b>environmental</b> <b>industries</b> and alternative energy usage in the Netherlands is below average compared with other EU countries, this sustainable transition seems to be undeveloped. To explain this phenomenon, this article analyzes the influence of factors that facilitate entrepreneurial performance in the <b>environmental</b> <b>industries</b> in the Netherlands, as the entrepreneurs are first in exploiting the rather new market and provide a lead role to other firms. A quantitative comparative analysis is done with 25 variables, structured by a combined OECD model, using 647 firms in the Netherlands of which 74 are operating in <b>environmental</b> <b>industries.</b> Analysis shows that, as ecopreneurs are operating in a more dynamic environment, R&D expenditure and alertness in this industry leads to higher performance while subsidies tend to have no direct influence on the performance at all. This implies that governmental influence does not directly lead to the desired improvement of ecopreneurial performance. Next to that, there is no empirical evidence that regular entrepreneurs are outperforming ecopreneurs, indicating that further research will {{have to look for}} other causes of the slow transition in the Netherlands...|$|R
