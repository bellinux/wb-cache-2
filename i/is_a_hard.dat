5|$|Vanadium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol V and atomic number 23. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> silvery grey, ductile, and malleable transition metal. The elemental metal is rarely found in nature, but once isolated artificially, {{the formation of}} an oxide layer (passivation) stabilizes the free metal somewhat against further oxidation.|$|E
5|$|In its raw form, {{tungsten}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> {{steel-grey metal}} {{that is often}} brittle and hard to work. If made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds that of many steels), and becomes malleable enough {{that it can be}} worked easily. It is worked by forging, drawing, or extruding. Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering.|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{throws a}} mix of four pitches. His main pitch, a four-seam fastball was once thrown in the mid-to-upper 90s, but now settles between 91 and 94mph. His main {{breaking}} ball <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> slider in the upper 80s, occasionally even touching 90. He uses the slider less frequently against left-handed hitters, preferring to use a curveball in the low 80s. He also uses a two-seam fastball against lefties. His slider is his best swing-and-miss pitch, with a whiff rate of 42% since 2007.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> silvery, ductile, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide uranium, to the left of the actinide plutonium and below the lanthanide promethium. Neptunium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> metal, having a bulk modulus of 118GPa, comparable to that of manganese. Neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability. When exposed to air at normal temperatures, it forms a thin oxide layer. This reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases. Neptunium has been determined to melt at 639±3°C: this low melting point, a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium (which has melting point 639.4°C), is due to the hybridization of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal. The boiling point of neptunium is not empirically known and the usually given value of 4174°C is extrapolated from the vapor pressure of the element. If accurate, this would give neptunium the largest liquid range of any element (3535K passes between its melting and boiling points).|$|E
5|$|Rhodium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> silvery, durable {{metal that}} has a high reflectance. Rhodium metal does not {{normally}} form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium, but is released on solidification. Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids: it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|The bat is a hitting tool, {{traditionally}} {{made of a}} single, solid {{piece of}} wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> round stick, about 2.5inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around 34inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42inches (106 centimeters).|$|E

5|$|The local bedrock <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> red sandstone, {{which the}} {{inhabitants}} {{used in the}} construction of monuments and architecture. This local sandstone is very strong and not prone to shearing or fracturing, allowing the sculptors at Quiriguá to erect the tallest freestanding stone monuments in the Americas. Quiriguá was built directly over the Motagua Fault and the city suffered damage in ancient times as a result of major earthquakes.|$|E

His youngest son, Sam, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> worker at the mill, but has fallen in with bad companions, and is often absent from home. Sam's sister Carry is worse off yet: having yielded to a seducer, she has been disowned by her father, and is living a life of sin in an unknown location.|$|E
5|$|Curium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> dense, silvery metal with a {{relatively}} high melting point and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is paramagnetic at ambient conditions, it becomes antiferromagnetic upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits valence +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. Curium readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element. It forms strongly fluorescent complexes with various organic compounds, {{but there is no}} evidence of its incorporation into bacteria and archaea. When introduced into the human body, curium accumulates in the bones, lungs and liver, where it promotes cancer.|$|E

5|$|The thorax is {{segmented}} {{into the}} two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. The pterothorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separated in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the prothorax. When viewed from below, the thorax {{is that part}} from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax. When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle section <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> rubber {{or plastic}} cover which fits over {{the base of}} a diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
5|$|A synthetic, {{radioactive}} element, curium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> dense metal with a silvery-white {{appearance and}} {{physical and chemical}} properties resembling those of gadolinium. Its melting point of 1340°C is significantly higher than that of the previous transuranic elements neptunium (637°C), plutonium (639°C) and americium (1173°C). In comparison, gadolinium melts at 1312°C. The boiling point of curium is 3110°C. With a density of 13.52 g/cm3, curium is significantly lighter than neptunium (20.45 g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8 g/cm3), but is heavier than most other metals. Between two crystalline forms of curium, the α-Cm is more stable at ambient conditions. It has a hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters a = 365 pm and c = 1182 pm, and four formula units per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum. At pressures above 23 GPa, at room temperature, α-Cm transforms into β-Cm, which has a face-centered cubic symmetry, space group Fmm and the lattice constant a = 493 pm. Upon further compression to 43 GPa, curium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Cm structure similar to that of α-uranium, with no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa. These three curium phases are also referred to as Cm I, II and III.|$|E

5|$|May is 13, but {{she knows}} nothing, is unable to talk fluently, nor walk with ease due to for her bandy legs. Her father is dead and she has four elder brothers, all mentally retarded... The {{students}} are all disabled, retarded and of different ages. Teaching them <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> job. They are of the 3rd grade {{but many of them}} find it hard to do the reading. Only a few of them can. Their pronunciation is distorted due to their twisted lips and their memory is quite short. They easily forget what they've learned... In the Village, it is quite hard to tell the kids' exact ages. Some in their twenties have a physical statures as small as the 7- or 8-years-old. They find it difficult to feed themselves, much less have mental ability or physical capacity for work. No one can hold back the tears when seeing the heads turning round unconsciously, the bandy arms managing to push the spoon of food into the mouths with awful difficulty... Yet they still keep smiling, singing in their great innocence, at the presence of some visitors, craving for something beautiful.|$|E
5|$|The male's song {{is a rich}} musical warbling, often {{ending in}} a loud high-pitched crescendo, which is given in bursts of up to 30seconds. The song is {{repeated}} for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, peninsulas and valleys in the Alps, a simplified fluting song occurs, named the Leiern (drawling) song by the German ornithologists who first described it. The song's introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two notes, as in a great tit's call but more fluting. The main song is confusable {{with that of the}} garden warbler, but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is even more difficult to separate. The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the common nightingale. The main call <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> tac-tac, like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a squeaking sweet alarm, and a low-pitched trill similar to that of a garden warbler.|$|E
