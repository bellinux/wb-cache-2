5|$|During February 1, as Cyclone <b>Gene</b> {{was moving}} to the west, <b>Gene</b> {{recurved}} and started moving towards the south and missed Vanuatu. The next day cyclone <b>Gene</b> started to temporarily weaken again by becoming a category two cyclone with winds speeds of 95km/h (60mph 10 min). This came as cyclone <b>Gene</b> approached 25°S which marks the edge of RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility, {{to the south of}} 25°S the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand, monitors tropical cyclones, south of 25°S. As <b>Gene</b> crossed in to TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility, Cyclone <b>Gene</b> started to re-intensify becoming a severe tropical cyclone again with peak winds of 120km/h (105mph 10 min) however this re-intensification only lasted for 12 hours before <b>Gene</b> began to weaken for the final time by becoming a tropical cyclone that day. <b>Gene</b> slowly weakened {{over the next couple of}} days as it moved towards the south east. The JTWC then issued its final warning on February 6 as Cyclone <b>Gene</b> was finishing its extratropical transition, and had also become fully embedded within the baroclinic zone. TCWC Wellington continued to monitor the extratropical remnants of <b>Gene</b> until February 9, after the sustained windspeeds had dropped to below 65km/h (40mph).|$|E

Symbols are chosen to be unique, and each <b>gene</b> has only one symbol (although approved symbols sometimes change). Symbols are preferably kept consistent with other members of a <b>gene</b> family and with homologs in other species, particularly the mouse due to its role as a common model organism.|$|E

50|$|The {{patterning}} {{from the}} maternal <b>genes</b> work {{to influence the}} expression of the segmentation <b>genes.</b> The segmentation <b>genes</b> are embryonically expressed <b>genes</b> that specify the numbers, size and polarity of the segments. The gap <b>genes</b> are directly influenced by the maternal <b>genes</b> and are expressed in local and overlapping regions along the anterior/posterior axis.

30|$|A {{total of}} 100 defense-related <b>genes</b> were {{identified}} within the intervals of the 32 QTLs (Additional file 4 : Table S 4).

50|$|Nif and fix are {{important}} <b>genes</b> involved in nitrogen fixation among Bradyrhizobium species. Nif <b>genes</b> {{are very similar}} to <b>genes</b> found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, a free-living diazotroph. The <b>genes</b> found in bradyrhizobia have similar function and structure to the <b>genes</b> found in K. pneumoniae. Fix <b>genes</b> {{are important}} for symbiotic nitrogen fixation and were first discovered in rhizobia species. The nif and fix <b>genes</b> are found in at least two different clusters on the chromosome. Cluster I contains most of the nitrogen fixation <b>genes.</b> Cluster II contains three fix <b>genes</b> located near nod <b>genes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is thought to}} be caused by a mutation in a <b>gene</b> on the X chromosome. A 2007 study concluded, based on analysis of microsatellite markers (small <b>gene</b> sequences found in common among individuals having the same ethnicity, ancestry or genetic disease) of the family described by Keipert, that this <b>gene</b> was likely located on the long arm of the X chromosome between positions Xq22.2q28. This is not definitive, however, and no specific <b>gene</b> has been named.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, a {{tropical}} disturbance formed within the Fijian Archipelago and was designated as Tropical Disturbance 12F. The {{next day it}} was upgraded to {{a tropical}} depression, whilst on January 27, RSMC Nadi named the depression as Cyclone <b>Gene.</b> Later that day <b>Gene</b> made landfall on Fiji, and caused 8 deaths and $51 million (2008, F$). Cyclone <b>Gene</b> then slowly intensified to a category three cyclone on both the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale and the Australian Cyclone Intensity Scale. <b>Gene</b> then took a turn to the south moving towards 25°S which marks the edge of RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility with the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. <b>Gene</b> then crossed 25°S on February 3 and Nadi released their final advisory. Cyclone <b>Gene</b> continued as a Tropical Cyclone for three days before becoming an extratropical cyclone. Early on February 6 TCWC Wellington released their final advisory on tropical cyclone <b>Gene</b> as they declared it as extratropical.|$|E
5|$|The APOA5 <b>gene</b> resides on {{chromosome}} 11 at {{the band}} 11q23 and contains 4 exons and 3 introns. This <b>gene</b> uses alternate polyadenylation sites and is located proximal to the apolipoprotein <b>gene</b> cluster on chromosome 11q23.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the terms}} being {{commonly}} interchanged, not all homeotic <b>genes</b> are Hox genes; the MADS-box <b>genes</b> are homeotic but not Hox <b>genes.</b> Thus, the Hox <b>genes</b> {{are a subset}} of homeotic <b>genes.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} DNA sequence {{variation in}} 72 candidate <b>genes</b> in maize landraces {{and the wild}} ancestor of maize, teosinte. The candidate <b>genes</b> were chosen because they exhibit very low sequence diversity among maize inbreds and have sequence homology to known regulatory <b>genes.</b> We observed signatures of selection in 17 candidate <b>genes,</b> indicating that they were potential targets of artificial selection during domestication. In addition, 21 candidate <b>genes</b> were identified as potential targets of natural selection in teosinte. A comparison of the proportion of selected <b>genes</b> between our regulatory <b>genes</b> and <b>genes</b> unfiltered for their potential function (but also with very low sequence diversity among maize inbreds) provided some weak evidence that regulatory <b>genes</b> are overrepresented among selected <b>genes.</b> We detected no significant association between the positions of <b>genes</b> identified as potential targets of selection during domestication and quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for maize domestication traits. However, a subset of these <b>genes,</b> those identified by sequence homology as kinase/phosphatase <b>genes,</b> significantly cluster with the domestication QTL. We also analyzed expression profiles of <b>genes</b> in distinct maize tissues and observed that domestication <b>genes</b> are expressed on average at a significantly higher level than neutral <b>genes</b> in reproductive organs, including kernels...|$|R
5|$|Essential <b>genes</b> are {{the set of}} <b>genes</b> {{thought to}} be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's <b>genes</b> are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 <b>genes</b> are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their <b>genes.</b> Half of these <b>genes</b> are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential <b>genes</b> is slightly higher, at 1000 <b>genes</b> (~20% of their <b>genes).</b> Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential <b>genes</b> (~10% of their <b>genes).</b> The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential <b>genes</b> and quasi-essential <b>genes</b> (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|R
5|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>gene</b> {{continues}} to be refined as new phenomena are discovered. For example, regulatory regions of a <b>gene</b> can be far removed from its coding regions, and coding regions can be split into several exons. Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some <b>gene</b> products are functional non-coding RNAs. Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of a <b>gene</b> is any discrete locus of heritable, genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of <b>gene</b> expression.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} source of new genes in {{eukaryotic}} lineages is <b>gene</b> duplication, which creates copy number variation {{of an existing}} <b>gene</b> in the genome. The resulting genes (paralogs) may then diverge in sequence and in function. Sets of genes formed in this way comprise a <b>gene</b> family. <b>Gene</b> duplications and losses within a family are common and represent {{a major source of}} evolutionary biodiversity. Sometimes, <b>gene</b> duplication may result in a nonfunctional copy of a <b>gene,</b> or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function; such nonfunctional genes are called pseudogenes.|$|E
5|$|A normal {{variation}} in the PRNP <b>gene</b> can modify {{the course of the}} disease by delaying the age of onset and affecting the type of symptoms that develop. This <b>gene</b> produces prion protein, which is active in the brain and other tissues and also appears to be involved in transporting copper. A role for the ApoE <b>gene</b> was initially suspected but could not be confirmed.|$|E
5000|$|In bacteria, {{essential}} <b>genes</b> {{appear to}} be more conserved than nonessential <b>genes</b> [...] but the correlation is not very strong. For instance, only 34% of the B. subtilis essential <b>genes</b> have reliable orthologs in all Firmicutes and 61% of the E. coli essential <b>genes</b> have reliable orthologs in all Gamma-proteobacteria. Fang et al. (2005) defined persistent <b>genes</b> as the <b>genes</b> present in more than 85% of the genomes of the clade. [...] They found 475 and 611 of such <b>genes</b> for B. subtilis and E. coli, respectively. Furthermore, they classified <b>genes</b> into five classes according to persistence and essentiality: persistent <b>genes,</b> essential <b>genes,</b> persistent nonessential (PNE) <b>genes</b> (276 in B. subtilis, 409 in E. coli), essential nonpersistent (ENP) <b>genes</b> (73 in B. subtilis, 33 in E. coli), and nonpersistent nonessential (NPNE) <b>genes</b> (3,558 in B. subtilis, 3,525 in E. coli). Fang et al. found 257 persistent <b>genes,</b> which exist both in B. subtilis (for the Firmicutes) and E. coli (for the Gamma-proteobacteria). Among these, 144 (respectively 139) were previously identified as essential in B. subtilis (respectively E. coli) and 25 (respectively 18) of the 257 <b>genes</b> are not present in the 475 B. subtilis (respectively 611 E. coli) persistent <b>genes.</b> All {{the other members of the}} pool are PNE <b>genes.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Genes</b> {{that are}} {{differentially}} expressed {{between the sexes}} (sex-biased <b>genes)</b> are among the fastest evolving <b>genes</b> in animal genomes. The majority of sex-biased expression is attributable to <b>genes</b> that are primarily expressed in sex-limited reproductive tissues, and these reproductive <b>genes</b> are often rapidly evolving because of intra- and intersexual selection pressures. Additionally, studies of multiple taxa have revealed that <b>genes</b> with sex-biased expression are also expressed in {{a limited number of}} tissues. This is worth noting because narrowly expressed <b>genes</b> are known to evolve faster than broadly expressed <b>genes.</b> Therefore, {{it is not clear whether}} sex-biased <b>genes</b> are rapidly evolving because they have sexually dimorphic expression, because they are expressed in sex-limited reproductive tissues, or because they are narrowly expressed. To determine the extend to which other confounding variables can explain the rapid evolution of sex-biased <b>genes,</b> I analyzed the rates of evolution of sex-biased <b>genes</b> in Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus in light of tissue-specific measures of expression. I find that <b>genes</b> with sex-biased expression in somatic tissues shared by both sexes are often evolving faster than non–sex-biased <b>genes,</b> but this is best explained by the narrow expression profiles of sex-biased <b>genes.</b> Sex-biased <b>genes</b> in sex-limited tissues in D. melanogaster, however, evolve faster than other narrowly expressed <b>genes.</b> Therefore, the rapid evolution of sex-biased <b>genes</b> is limited only to those <b>genes</b> primarily expressed in sex-limited reproductive tissues...|$|R
5000|$|RK2 is {{approximately}} 60 kbp long and contains <b>genes</b> for replication, maintenance, conjugation and antibiotic resistance.

In addition, RK2 contains a set of potentially lethal (to the cell) <b>genes,</b> called kil <b>genes,</b> {{and a set of}} complementary transcriptional repressor <b>genes,</b> called kor (short for [...] "kil-override") <b>genes,</b> which inactivate the kil <b>genes.</b> The kil and kor <b>genes</b> together are suspected {{to play a role in}} the broad host range of RK2.|$|R
5|$|<b>Gene</b> {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant <b>gene</b> encoding a toxic protein. <b>Gene</b> silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO <b>gene</b> silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce <b>gene</b> silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, <b>gene</b> splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous <b>gene</b> that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gene</b> therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The <b>gene</b> used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using <b>gene</b> therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of <b>gene</b> therapy is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E

50|$|In {{the worm}} C. elegans, non-essential <b>genes</b> are highly {{over-represented}} among duplicates, possibly because duplication of essential <b>genes</b> causes overexpression of these <b>genes.</b> Woods et al. found that non-essential <b>genes</b> {{are more often}} successfully duplicated (fixed) and lost compared to essential <b>genes.</b> By contrast, essential <b>genes</b> are less often duplicated but upon successful duplication are maintained over longer periods.|$|R
5|$|Limousins in {{different}} countries are bred according to different selection practices or objectives, and are connected by limited international <b>gene</b> flows. Poor genetic connectedness between countries has negative implications for estimation accuracies of international genetic prediction programmes. As a result of genetic drift or different selection, each country's population of Limousins is becoming genetically differentiated, but which is counterbalanced to a limited extent by <b>gene</b> flows from other countries. A study of over 2.4million Limousin pedigree files of five European countries (France, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, United Kingdom) showed moderate <b>gene</b> flows from France to the United Kingdom and Denmark, but negligible <b>gene</b> flows to Sweden. Except for <b>gene</b> flows originating from France, and some limited <b>gene</b> flows between Denmark and Sweden in the 1990s, bull and semen exchanges between European countries has been scarce, especially since about 2000. Cow and embryo flows {{have been even more}} scarce. Conversely, the genetic contribution of North American Limousins to European countries has increased since the late 1990s, which has occurred because of their use in breeding programmes to introduce the polled <b>gene.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>gene</b> for apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5, <b>gene</b> ID 116519, OMIM {{accession}} number – 606368) was originally found by comparative sequencing {{of human and}} mice DNA as a last member of the <b>gene</b> cluster of apolipoproteins APOA1/APOC3/APOA4/APOA5, located on human chromosome 11 at position 11q23. The creation of two mice models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knock-out) confirmed {{the important role of}} this <b>gene</b> in plasma triglyceride determination.

25|$|Different {{from the}} {{analysis}} on differentially expressed individual genes, another type of analysis focuses on differential expression or perturbation of pre-defined <b>gene</b> sets and is called <b>gene</b> set analysis. <b>Gene</b> set analysis demonstrated several major advantages over individual <b>gene</b> differential expression analysis. <b>Gene</b> sets are groups of genes that are functionally related according to current knowledge. Therefore, <b>gene</b> set analysis is considered a knowledge based analysis approach. Commonly used <b>gene</b> sets include those derived from KEGG pathways, <b>Gene</b> Ontology terms, <b>gene</b> groups that share some other functional annotations, such as common transcriptional regulators etc. Representative <b>gene</b> set analysis methods include GSEA, which estimates significance of <b>gene</b> sets based on permutation of sample labels, and GAGE, which tests the significance of <b>gene</b> sets based on permutation of <b>gene</b> labels or a parametric distribution.|$|E
