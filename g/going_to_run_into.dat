25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E
500|$|Due to [...] "protective and {{occasionally}} nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant for Bela {{to be introduced}} in [...] "small doses". He wanted fans to know the show would always be just about Sam and Dean Winchester, and stated, [...] " [...] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor {{is it about the}} four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys." [...] However, he felt the writers pushed it too far in the episode [...] "Red Sky at Morning", stating his opinion that it [...] "was by far the least successful episode this year because it really kind of became the Bela show". The writers also did not take the time to consider how to tie her into the Winchesters' storylines. As Kripke pointed out, [...] "It's a road show and we're in a different town every week, so if you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> the same character over and over again, you better have a damn good reason..." [...] They were eventually [...] "crushed {{under the weight of the}} absurdity of it" [...] because it became more difficult to justify her reappearances within the narrative. Another key problem stemmed from their conceptualization of her as an antagonistic character rather than a potential love interest for the brothers. The writers, [...] "so taken with a woman who could screw the boys over at every turn", ended up making Bela too antagonistic without establishing a balance. Any chance for a [...] "funny effervescent episode where they all work together" [...] was lost after the character attempts to have the Winchesters killed on multiple occasions. They eventually decided to drop the character from the series, opting to [...] "send her off in an appropriate and dramatic way" [...] which would [...] "show a couple of cards [...] been holding onto all season" [...] by revealing her backstory [...] "in a way that will surprise the audience and kind of tie her into the story." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her? We ain't got no problem. It's not like we were having a problem out on the racetrack with her. It's not like I just drew her name out of a hat and decided she was the one I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> tonight." ...|$|E

But I came out, and as her father said she might fish if she didn't have {{to walk into the}} water, old Menendez took a spare piece of line from his pocket and tied it on to the end of mine, and he put on some fresh bait and gave it a {{tremendous}} send out into the surf. Then he put the other end around the girl and tied it. I suppose he thought that it didn't matter if a girl should be lost, but he may have considered that her father was there to seize her if she got jerked in.|$|R

Then they were to tip the football to another receiver. Flutie scrambled to his right, narrowly averting a sack. He threw the football from his own 37, requiring the 5' 9" [...] quarterback {{to throw the ball}} at least 63 yards against 30 mph winds, after having already thrown the football 45 times during the game.|$|R
500|$|In 1998, Kilborn left The Daily Show {{to replace}} Tom Snyder on CBS's The Late Late Show. He claimed the [...] "Five Questions" [...] {{interview}} segment as intellectual property, disallowing any future Daily Show hosts from {{using it in}} their interviews. Correspondents Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown left the show shortly before him, {{but the majority of}} the show's crew and writing staff stayed on. Kilborn's last show as host aired on December 17, 1998, ending a 386 episode tenure. Reruns were shown until Jon Stewart's debut four weeks later. Kilborn made a short appearance on Jon Stewart's final edition of the Daily Show saying [...] "I knew you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> this thing <b>into</b> the ground." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the fall}} 2006 {{issue of the}} EMU alumni magazine, {{university}} president Loren Swartzendruber wrote a four-page essay on refusing the mantle of either liberal or conservative and daring to be [...] "different from other colleges," [...] in keeping with Anabaptist tradition and theology. [...] "How do we define ourselves within a cultural context that wants to reduce complex realities to simplistic clichés?" [...] he asked rhetorically. He told the online journal Inside Higher Ed: [...] "We are, I think, {{a different kind of}} Christian... If [...] assume they’re going to find at EMU what they would also find at Liberty University [...] they’re not going to be very happy here. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> it headlong. They’re going to hear about the peace tradition. They’re going to hear a lot of language {{about what it means to}} be a follower of Jesus in this world. From our perspective, that means less nationalism, and a much more global perspective, care for creation. What they would find here is a concern for personal piety … but we’re not willing to stop there because we also believe that the New Testament is pretty clear that there is a social dimension to what Jesus called us to be and to do.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Titans {{were the}} first NFL team to play a preseason game, in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game on August 9, 2009. Ringer played his NFL debut there. Ringer {{discussed}} the game earlier, saying, [...] "I am very excited. I have never even been to an NFL game as a fan, so my first experience I {{am going to be}} playing in one, I am looking forward to it." [...] Ringer had 4 carries for 14 yards, along with 2 catches for 9 yards, while the Titans won 21-18. On August 15, in a preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Ringer lead the team in rushing with 7 attempts for 51 yards, including a 36 yard touchdown run. The Titans won 27-20. Ringer said of the run, [...] " [...] I saw a linebacker prepare to blitz, and I thought the offense was going to check out of the play. But as the cadence kept going, I realized we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> that blitz". In a 10-30 loss against the Dallas Cowboys, the first game in Cowboys Stadium, Ringer again led the team in rushing, this time with 33 yards on 5 attempts. He had what would have been a 17-yard touchdown run called back due to a penalty. He also had 2 catches for 6 yards, and averaged 34 yards on two kickoff return.|$|E

5000|$|... 5-15 March 1942: VP-92 began a transcontinental {{flight from}} NAS Alameda, Calif., to NS San Juan, Puerto Rico. The {{unassigned}} flight crews and ground support staff departed for Florida by train. On 15 March, these personnel boarded [...] for transportation to San Juan. Upon arrival the squadron {{came under the}} operational control of PatWing-3. When the first aircraft of VP-92 landed at San Juan, the beaching party had never seen an amphibious Catalina. The aircraft landed in the bay and proceeded at taxi speed for the beaching apron while lowering their wheels into the water. The beaching crews panicked, thinking that the crews were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the aircraft <b>into</b> the concrete. They were amazed when the aircraft emerged from the water on dry land with wheels already attached.|$|R

I can tell you he has rued the work he made about it ever since. On the other hand, let it get abroad through yonder prating fellow, Heatherthwayte, or any other, that Master Richard Talbot had in his house a child with, I know not what Popish tokens, and a scroll in an unknown tongue, and I should be had up in gyves for suspicion of treason, or may be harbouring the Prince of Scotland himself, when it is only some poor Scottish archer's babe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Neither {{thinking}} nor fog conduced {{to seeing}} where I was going; {{and when my}} ankle began to give out, and I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> turn, I <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a hedge, which, looming through the mist, I had been taking for a fine range of distant mountains--rather my {{way of dealing with}} other objects. Being without a horse on whose neck to lay the reins, I could only coast the hedge, hoping it might lead me back to Oakstead Park, which I had abandoned in my craving for space and dread of being dogged by the Ensign. But the treacherous hedge led me nowhere but to a horsepond; and when I had struggled out of the adjacent mire, and attained a rising ground, I could only see about four yards square of bare down, all the rest being grey fog. Altogether, the scene was worth something. I heard what I thought the tinkling of a sheep bell through the cloud, which dulled the sound like cotton wool; I pursued the call, when anon, the veil began to grow thin, and revealed, looking just like a transparency, a glimpse of a little village in a valley almost under my feet, trees, river, church-spire and all, and the bell became clearer, and showed me what kind of flock it was meant for. I turned that way, and had just found a path leading down the steep, when down closed the cloud--a natural dissolving view--leaving me wondering whether it had been mirage or imagination, till presently, the curtain drew up in earnest. Out came, not merely form, but colour, as I have seen a camera clear itself--blue sky, purple hills, russet and orange woods, a great elm green picked out with yellow, a mass of brown oaks, a scarlet maple, a beech grove, skirting a brilliant water meadow, with a most reflective stream running through it, and giving occasion for a single arched bridge, and a water mill, with a wheel draperied with white foam; two swans disporting on the water (I would not declare they were not geese), a few cottony flakes of mist hanging over damp corners, the hill rising green, with the bright whitewashed cottages of this district, on the side a rich, red, sandstone-coloured church, late architecture, tower rather mouldering--all the more picturesque; churchyard, all white headstones and ochreous sheep, surmounted by a mushroom-shaped dark yew tree, railed in with intensely white rails, the whole glowing in the parting coup-de-soleil of a wet day, every tear of every leaf glistening, and everything indescribably lustrous. It is a picture that one's mental photograph ought to stamp for life, and the cheering and interest it gave, no one but you can understand. I wished for you, I know. It looks so poor in words.|$|R

6000|$|But [...] "drinking the waters" [...] {{was only}} a small portion of the torture I {{experienced}} during that memorable month--a month which was, without exception, the most miserable I have ever spent. During the best part of it I religiously followed the doctor's mandate and did nothing whatever, except moon about the house and garden and go out for two hours a day in a Bath chair. That did break the monotony to a certain extent. There is more excitement about Bath-chairing--especially if you are not used to the exhilarating exercise--than might appear to the casual observer. A sense of danger, such as a mere outsider might not understand, is ever present to the mind of the occupant. He feels convinced every minute that the whole concern is going over, a conviction which becomes especially lively whenever a ditch or a stretch of newly macadamized road comes in sight. Every vehicle that passes he expects is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> him; and he never finds himself ascending or descending a hill without immediately beginning to speculate upon his chances, supposing--as seems extremely probable--that the weak-kneed controller of his destiny should let go.|$|E

Fortunately, the same vessel which brought the news of General Braddock's defeat also brought your letter, and we learned the news {{only a few hours}} before your letter reached us.

Mr. Wilks did his best to cheer us all, but I could see that he, too, felt it very greatly. However, when your letter came we were all made happy again, though, of course, we cannot be but anxious, as you say you are just going to join another expedition; still, we must hope that that will do better, as it won't be managed by regular soldiers. Mr. Wilks was quite angry at what you said about the folly of making men stand in a line to be shot at, he thinks so much of drill and discipline. The squire and he have been arguing quite fiercely about it; but the squire gets the best of the argument, for the dreadful way in which the soldiers were slaughtered shows that, though that sort of fighting may be good in other places, it is not suited for fighting these wicked Indians in the woods.|$|E
