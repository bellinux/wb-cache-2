6000|$|I {{would come}} back through the January mire or fog from Vincent Square {{to the door of}} 79, and reach it at last with a quite childish {{appreciation}} of the fact that its solid Georgian proportions and its fine brass furnishings belonged to MY home; I would use my latchkey and discover Margaret in the warm-lit, spacious hall with a partially opened packing-case, fatigued but happy, or go up to have tea with her out of the right tea things, [...] "come at last," [...] or be told to notice what was fresh there. It wasn't simply that I had never had a house before, but I had really never been, except in the most transitory way, in any house that was nearly so delightful as mine promised to be. Everything was fresh and bright, and softly and harmoniously toned. Downstairs we had a green dining-room with gleaming silver, dark oak, and English colour-prints; above was a large drawing-room that could be made still larger by throwing open folding doors, and it was all carefully done in greys and blues, for the most part with real Sheraton supplemented by Sheraton so skilfully imitated by an expert Margaret had discovered as to be indistinguishable except to a minute scrutiny. And for me, above this and next to my bedroom, there was a roomy study, with specially thick stair-carpet outside and thick carpets in the bedroom overhead and a big old desk for me to sit at and work between fire and window, and another desk specially made for me by that expert if I chose to stand and write, and open bookshelves and bookcases and every sort of convenient fitting. There were electric heaters beside the open fire, and everything was put for me to make tea at any time--electric kettle, <b>infuser,</b> biscuits and fresh butter, so that I could get up and work at any hour of the day or night. I could do no work in this apartment for a long time, I was so interested in the perfection of its arrangements. And when I brought in my books and papers from Vincent Square, Margaret seized upon all the really shabby volumes and had them re-bound in a fine official-looking leather.|$|E

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} the clinical impact of meropenem instability in continuous infusion (CI) devices {{may contribute to}} inconsistent uptake of this method of administration across outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) services. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical efficacy and safety of CIs of meropenem in two Australian tertiary hospitals and assessed its stability under simulated OPAT conditions including in elastomeric infusion devices containing 1 % (2. 4 g) or 2 % (4. 8 g) concentrations at either 'room temperature' or 'cooled' conditions. Infusate aliquots were assayed at different time-points over 24 hours. Forty-one (82 %) of 50 patients had clinical improvement or were cured. Adverse patient outcomes including hemato-, hepato- and nephrotoxicity were infrequent. Cooled <b>infusers</b> with 1 % meropenem had a mean 24 -hour recovery of 90. 3 %. Recoveries of 1 % and 2 % meropenem at room temperature and 2 % under cooled conditions were 88 %, 83 % and 87 %, respectively. Patients receiving 1 % meropenem are likely to receive > 95 % of the maximum deliverable dose (MDD) over a 24 -hour period whilst patients receiving 2 % meropenem should receive 93 % and 87 % of the MDD under cooled and room temperature conditions, respectively. Meropenem <b>infusers</b> are likely to deliver ∼ 95 % MDD and maintain effective plasma concentrations throughout the dosing period.

40|$|Regular {{blood transfusions}} for beta-thalassaemia {{patients}} {{lead to the}} accumulation of iron deposits in the body. In order to remove such deposits, iron chelation therapy is required. Subcutaneously administered deferoxamine has been the gold standard chelation therapy for over 40  years. Deferasirox is a newer chelation therapy that is taken orally once daily. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the long-term costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with deferoxamine and deferasirox in a cohort of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia patients from a UK health service perspective. A 50 -year annual cycle state transition model comprised three core health states: alive without cardiac complications, alive with cardiac complications, and dead, as well as representing other chronic complications of iron overload: diabetes, hypogonadism, hypoparathyroidism and hypothyroidism. The model was calibrated to identify sets of convergent input parameter values that predicted observed overall survival by mean lifetime compliance with chelation therapy. A pivotal non-inferiority trial informed the main estimates of the effectiveness of deferasirox, which were applied to the calibrated model. Using cost values for the year 2011, costs and utilities were summed over patients' lifetimes to estimate lifetime costs and QALY gains. Mean lifetime treatment costs for patients receiving deferoxamine were £ 70, 000 higher than deferasirox. Drug acquisition costs were £ 100, 000 higher for deferasirox, but administration costs associated with deferoxamine were £ 170, 000 higher. Higher compliance associated with oral deferasirox administration led to fewer complications. Combined with the quality-of-life effects of an oral mode of administration, an average gain of 4. 85  QALYs for deferasirox was estimated. In the base case, deferasirox dominates deferoxamine, i. e., costs less and patients gain more QALYs. The key parameter is the proportion of deferoxamine patients using balloon <b>infusers.</b> Sensitivity analyses showed that even when the proportion of patients using balloon <b>infusers</b> is decreased from 79 to 25  %, the incremental cost per QALY gained remains well under £ 20, 000. Higher drug acquisition costs for deferasirox are offset by the avoidance of infusion-related equipment costs. Combined with health benefits derived from an oral mode of administration and improved compliance, deferasirox has a high probability of being a cost-effective intervention compared with deferoxamine.

5000|$|The exact {{composition}} of Essiac is unclear, but it reportedly contains burdock (Arctium lappa), sheep sorrel (Rumex acetosella), slippery elm bark (Ulmus rubra), and Indian rhubarb (Rheum officinale) or turkey rhubarb (Rheum palmatum). Some formulations may also contain watercress, blessed thistle, red clover, and kelp. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Essiac was promoted as a cancer treatment by Rene Caisse, a Canadian nurse, {{who claimed that}} it had been given to her by an Ontario Ojibwa patient she treated. However, this has never been substantiated. There is no evidence that Essiac is a Native American or First Nations remedy, and there are multiple factors that indicate the formula is not from any Native American culture.

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus is an autoimmune chronic disease that has undergone drastic changes on its clinical {{natural history in}} the last decades. Until the early XX century, the diagnosis of diabetes would mean a fatal outcome in few weeks or months. The evidence of hyperglycemia associated with abrupt polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia and weight loss in a child or a young person determined a diagnosis of failure of insulin secretion, metabolic catabolism and death. The introduction of treatments with exogenous insulin was the first important change in the natural clinical history of diabetes. Subjects affected by diabetes experienced then a hope of treatment and life. The main initial concern of physicians and scientists was to avoid important episodes of hypo or hyperglycemia, {{which could lead to}} hypoglycemic coma or diabetic ketoacidosis. Different classes of insulins were tested and used with success, offering better life expectancy for the affected persons. In parallel with the provided increase of life expectancy, chronic complications related to diabetes were prone to appear. Those patients who, at that moment, benefit from the exogenous insulin, but maintained many episodes of hyperglycemia and glycemia fluctuations, developed chronic complications leading to blindness, renal failure, limbs amputations and/or cardiovascular complications as heart attack or stroke. Aware of the consequences of hyperglycemia, researchers started to design studies promoting a more strict control of glucose levels, with the intention of minimizing chronic complications related to diabetes. Studies for type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) like DCCT, published in 1993 (The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group, 1993) and its follow-up EDIC (Nathan et al., 2005), and others alike for type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) (UK Prospective Diabetes Study, UKPDS Group 1998), proved the reduction of complications rates and marked a new change in the natural clinical history of diabetes. Recently, tighter glycemic control became possible with the help of new insulins, insulin <b>infusers,</b> glucose sensors and nutrition research. The incidence of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and their consequent serious outcomes as blindness, end renal stage disease and lower limb amputations, reduced in the past two decades, as described in the US patients with diabetes (Gregg et al., 2014). The excess risk of mortality in individuals over 20 years old with diabetes (T 1 D and T 2 D) if compared with the risk of individuals without diabetes has decreased over time in both Canada and the UK, as shown in data recently published (M Lind et al., 2013). This may be, in part, due to the earlier diagnosis, as well as to improvements in diabetes care (M Lind et al., 2013). In patients with T 1 D, a reduction of all-cause mortality and also of specific cardiovascular mortality could be verified, especially if associated with a good glycemic control; these rates, nevertheless, are still the double of the ones seen in subjects without diabetes (Marcus Lind et al., 2014). Physical activity is considered as a health promoter procedure for general population and a therapeutic tool for prevention and/or treatment of several chronic diseases, like T 2 D, cardiovascular disease or cancer. Persons with T 1 D are stimulated to participate in exercise training programs and competition events. Nowadays, with the current knowledge, several elite athletes with T 1 D are able to compete in the same categories that the ones without diabetes, but requiring for that a strict balance among insulin adjustments, carbohydrate intake and physical activity characteristics. Many questions may be formulated at the present time: are persons with T 1 D being beneficiated from physical activity as persons without diabetes? Do the subjects with T 1 D present the same physical conditions for exercise performance than the non-diabetic ones? Do they present different metabolic response when performing a session of exercise? Does physical activity improve lipoprotein profile generating cardiovascular benefits for the subjects with T 1 D? What are the characteristics of muscular composition of patients with T 1 D, and are they different from subjects without diabetes? What are the factors that could be interfering? These questions are discussed in the present thesis. Some answers were achieved and some other questions emerged. Nowadays, the availability of new technological approaches, the improvements on basic research, and the possibility to integrate the information of basic research with clinical research are improving the knowledge in biomedical science. A better understanding of physiopathology can be obtained, and with it, a better care, a better quality of life, and longer life expectancy can be offered to persons who have type 1 diabetes...|$|R

50|$|Phased plasma torpedoes can {{phase out}} of normal space-time to bypass shields, then phase {{back in to}} {{detonate}} on a ship's hull, thus making shields worthless against them. They only appeared in the PC game Star Trek: Bridge Commander. Shortly after {{the recovery of the}} Pegasus device, the phasing properties used in the design were seen as a delivery system for torpedoes. Since Borg ships are almost impossible to destroy by Starfleet's current technology, it made sense to their engineers to design a torpedo that could phase itself and enter the body of a Borg cube, causing devastating damage. However, reducing the size of the phasing coils used to accomplish an intangible state proved difficult. Further, the antimatter within the warhead had a destabilizing effect on the phasing coil. A new kind of explosive material was needed, and it was found using the principles behind the first observed Romulan plasma weapons. The installation of a high-energy plasma <b>infuser</b> would allow a torpedo casing to be filled with a warhead charged with high-energy plasma from the ship's warp nacelles. Warp plasma is highly unstable and can be easily detonated. Until recently, it was considered an undeliverable medium that could not be controlled. However, using a nanite-controlled trigger for reactant release now allows vessels to deliver a high-energy plasma warhead payload within a Mark IV torpedo casing.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Children {{who require}} fluid {{resuscitation}} {{for the treatment}} of shock present to tertiary and non-tertiary medical settings. While timely fluid therapy improves survival odds, guidelines are poorly translated into clinical practice. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the attitudes, preferences and beliefs of health care providers working in acute care settings regarding pediatric fluid resuscitation performance. METHODS: A single-centre survey study was conducted at McMaster Children's Hospital from January to May, 2012. The sampling frame (n = 115) included nursing staff, physician staff and subspecialty trainees working in Pediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM) or Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (PCCM). A self-administered questionnaire was developed and assessed for face validity prior to distribution. Eligible participants were invited at 0, 2, and 4 weeks to complete a web-based version of the survey. A follow-up survey administration phase was conducted to improve the response rate. RESULTS: Response rate was 72. 2 % (83 / 115), with 83 % (68 / 82) self-identifying as nursing staff and 61 % (50 / 82) as PCCM providers. Resuscitation experience, frequency of shock management, and years in specialty, were similar between PCCM and PEM responders. Physicians and nurses had differing opinions regarding the most effective method to achieve rapid fluid resuscitation in young children presenting in shock (p< 0. 001). Disagreement also existed regarding the age and size of patients in whom rapid <b>infuser</b> devices, such as the Level- 1 Rapid <b>Infuser,</b> should be used (p< 0. 001). Providers endorsed a number of potential concerns related to the use of rapid <b>infuser</b> devices in children, and only 14 % of physicians and 55 % of nursing staff felt that they had received adequate training in the use of such devices (p = 0. 005). CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of consensus among health care providers regarding how pediatric fluid resuscitation guidelines should be operationalized, supporting a need for further work to define best practices...|$|E
