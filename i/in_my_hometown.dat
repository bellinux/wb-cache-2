500|$|In 1955, {{after the}} fighting, the {{successful}} South Korean action film Piagol [...] about leftist guerrilla atrocities encouraged other film-makers. The 1960s military government punished pro-communist film-makers and gave Grand Bell Awards to films with the strongest anti-communist message. Censorship loosened in the 1980s. The Taebaek Mountains (1994) dealt with leftists {{from the south}} who fought for the communists, while Silver Stallion (1991) and Spring <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Hometown</b> (1998) showed the destructive impact of American military presence on village life. The violent action films Shiri (1999) and Joint Security Area (2000) presented North Korea in a favourable light.|$|E

You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hometown,</b> because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others.
