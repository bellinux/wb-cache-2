5|$|In November of the 2010–11 season, Parise {{tore the}} {{meniscus}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee,</b> underwent surgery and was {{deemed to be}} likely out {{for the remainder of}} the season. On March 2, 2011, Parise was cleared to start skating and returned to play on April 2, the same night the Devils were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention.|$|E
5|$|Early in the season, Bure {{sustained}} {{the first of}} several serious knee injuries during his career. On November 9, 1995, in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, Bure was grabbed around the head by defenceman Steve Smith while approaching the end boards. Falling to the ice, he caught his skate against the boards, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee.</b> Requiring arthroscopic surgery, in which tendon was removed from his hamstring to repair the ACL, he was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|He damaged ligaments <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> {{during a}} {{regional}} tour of Akita in August 2009 (the {{first time he}} has injured his knee), hampering his preparations for the September tournament. Despite this, {{he won his first}} 14 matches, before finally losing to Hakuhō, leaving both wrestlers at 14–1. Asashōryū would win the resulting playoff to win his 24th yūshō, tying him with Kitanoumi for third on the all-time yūshō list. The triumph took place on his 29th birthday. He finished on 11–4 in the Kyushu tournament in November, losing his last four matches.|$|E
50|$|Zeke II {{returned}} to halftime {{action for the}} 2006 football season, but prior to the November 11 game against Minnesota he tore the anterior cruciate ligament <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> rear <b>knee</b> and was again admitted to the MSU Small Animal Clinic. Dr. Loic Dejardin, an orthopedic surgeon at MSU’s Veterinary Teaching Hospital, repaired the damage. Two months of rehabilitation followed.|$|R
5000|$|However, in {{the episode}} [...] "The Inquisitor" [...] (1992), as Kryten tells Lister that he {{believes}} <b>in</b> Silicon Heaven, <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> then starts jiggling (a reflex to lying) suggesting that Lister has shaken <b>his</b> belief. <b>In</b> [...] "Krysis" [...] (2016), Kryten states that he's [...] "just lately... started" [...] to think {{the idea of an}} afterlife for machines is [...] "preposterous".|$|R
50|$|In May 2009, {{when the}} Dallas Cowboys' {{training}} facility collapsed during rookie mini-camp, Buehler {{was one of}} the few players injured. Standing on the sideline at the time of the collapse, he ran out a side door and was sprinting across a practice field when a pole from the structure crashed into him. The impact caused a minor concussion, gashes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> forehead and <b>right</b> <b>knee,</b> and had skin ripped off his ear; he required three stitches on his kicking knee.|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Öhlund began {{experiencing}} inflammation <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee.</b> The Lightning placed him on injured reserve on October 4, 2011; a week later, he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees. After there was optimism he was close to returning to the lineup in December, he suffered a setback with his left knee and underwent further surgery in February 2012. During his recovery, he told reporters with Swedish newspaper Expressen that he was unsure whether he could continue playing.|$|E
5|$|With Warnock {{replacing}} Ternent as Bury {{manager and}} Ternent {{moving on to}} manage Burnley, this signalled a return to Turf Moor for Swan. Ternent moved Swan back into defence, but could only give him eleven starts and six substitute appearances following a combination of suspensions, illness and injury. A collision with Wycombe Wanderers' Jason Cousins on 20 February 1999 spelt {{the beginning of the}} end for Swan's career, as the result of a scan showed he had snapped the cruciate ligament <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nevin {{suffered}} a dislocated shoulder {{in spring training}} in 2003 while making a diving catch. He had surgery on his left shoulder {{and returned to the}} Padres in June. The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin, and White went on to have an All-Star season in left field. Ryan Klesko filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well at third base, Nevin's favorite position. Nevin offered to be used in a utility role, alternating with White, Klesko, and Burroughs, as well as Xavier Nady in right field. In 2004, Nevin had more than 100 RBI {{for the third time in}} his career, but underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> in July.|$|E
25|$|The K-1 World Grand Prix 2007 Final {{was held}} on December 8, 2007 at the Yokohama Arena. After a quick {{knockout}} of Junichi Sawayashiki in the quarter-finals, he met two-time K-1 World Grand Prix winner Remy Bonjasky in the semis and dominated him {{en route to a}} unanimous decision (30-29, 30-27, 30-28) win which would take him into the final for a rubber match with defending champion Sem Schilt. Midway through the first round, Aerts went down <b>in</b> pain clutching <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee.</b> He was unable to continue due to injury once again and Schilt regained the title.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the Rose Bowl, Koceski's knee became the subject of {{extensive}} coverage in the press. On Christmas Eve, the Los Angeles Times reported that Coach Bennie Oosterbaan's hopes for Koceski faded when Koceski complained of a [...] "'very tired' feeling <b>in</b> <b>his</b> gimpy <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> and was excused early in the forenoon workout."

40|$|Inaccuracies in [William] Hudson's ["Flora Anglica"]. Hudson's '[Carex] inflata' is not Smith's '[Carex] laevigata', recalls Hudson taking {{specimens}} {{of what he}} now knows to be '[Carex] filiformis' and believes this may be Hudson's 'C. inflata'. Notes that Hudson's 'Carex tomentosa', [in brackets 'C. filiformis'], is introduced, along with others, in the appendix, entirely on the authority of [John] Lightfoot who was unaware that this plant was the same. The '[Carex] vesicaria' and '[Carex] inflata' of his first edition were both varieties of the same plant. Comments on the pressure Hudson was under to produce a second edition, which along with his poor state of health accounts for the inaccuracies. Thanks Smith for the specimen of 'Poa bulbosa'. Encloses specimen of 'Cerastium latifolium' "from Dr Richardson's own habitat". Complains that [James] Dickson is being "tedious" with his fourth part of "Fasiculus", laments that "emolument should at any time be the sole object of publication, as then it is too apt to promote multiplication of species".

5|$|Gascoigne {{was named}} on the PFA Team of the Year in the 1990–91 season as Tottenham reached the FA Cup Final, with {{victories}} over Blackpool, Oxford United, Portsmouth, Notts County and North London derby rivals Arsenal. He scored the opening {{goal of the}} 3–1 victory over Arsenal at Wembley with a free-kick, one of six goals he scored in the competition. Going into the final against Nottingham Forest he had already agreed terms to join Italian club Lazio in an £8.5million deal. However just 15 minutes into the game he committed a dangerous knee-high foul on Gary Charles and ruptured his own cruciate ligaments <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee.</b> England teammate Stuart Pearce scored from the resultant free kick, and Gascoigne subsequently collapsed after the kick-off, forcing {{him to leave the}} match on a stretcher. Tottenham {{went on to win the}} Cup in extra-time.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1918 Dyer {{was awarded}} a points victory over Frankie Mack in Boston, which he {{followed}} up with another win this time over Terry Brooks. At {{the start of the}} Brooks fight, as Dyer was getting into the ring, he was handed a telegram informing him that he had been appointed as a boxing instructor for the National Army. Dyer had been refused admission into the British and American Armies on account of the broken cartilage <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee.</b> Dyer was eventually based at Camp Grant in Illinois, but fought one more bout, a win over Walter Butler of Boston before beginning his commission. Dyer did not fight outside the armed forces {{during the rest of the}} war, but he proved successful in his role as camp boxing instructor with Camp Grant performing well in boxing tournaments. Dyer also continued his charity work, singing and boxing in front of the public and the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 2010 Balotelli came on as a {{substitute}} to score in his debut against Politehnica Timișoara in a 1–0 away win in the Europa League, but during the match injured the lateral meniscus <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> and on 8 September underwent surgery that sidelined him until October. Balotelli eventually made his Premier League debut on 24 October as {{a substitute}} in a 3–0 home defeat to Arsenal and made his first Premier League start on 30 October in a 2–1 away defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Balotelli scored his first and second Premier League goals on 7 November in a 2–0 away win to West Brom. In the same game Balotelli received a red card for violent conduct {{as the result of}} a clash with Youssuf Mulumbu, which his manager Roberto Mancini described as unfair. Balotelli scored the first two of City's three goals in the 3–0 win over FC Red Bull Salzburg in Manchester City's Europa League group stage match.|$|E

50|$|Akins was {{selected}} in the 11th round of the 1976 NFL draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. He spent his rookie season on the scout team playing quarterback, defensive back, punter and place-kicker. He was then traded to the New Orleans Saints <b>in</b> 1977. <b>His</b> injured <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> never recovered. He played in several exhibition games for the Saints but was only able to play at 85 percent. Akins was set to play hurt, but before the season started he decided to give up pro ball and become a lawyer. He studied law at the University of Houston College of Law, graduated with high honors and became a very successful trial lawyer dealing with environmental, consumer protection, and personal injury cases.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2005, young star Amar'e Stoudemire of the NBA's Phoenix Suns {{underwent}} {{one of the}} highest-profile microfracture surgeries to date. He {{returned to}} the court in March 2006 and initially appeared {{to have made a}} full recovery, but subsequently started feeling stiffness <b>in</b> both <b>knees</b> (<b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> had been overcompensating for the injured left knee). He and the team doctor decided he needed more time to rehab and he did not return until the 2006-2007 NBA season. During the 2006-2007 season, Stoudemire returned to form, averaging 20.4 points and 9.6 rebounds per game while playing in all 82 regular-season games and the 2007 NBA All-Star Game. His recent success has brought positive publicity to the procedure, further distancing it from a previous reputation as a possible [...] "career death sentence" [...] in the sports world, though {{he was one of the}} youngest of the aforementioned players to undergo the surgery.|$|R
5|$|On September 25, 2001, Jordan {{announced}} {{his return to}} the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, he led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.42 spg). However, torn cartilage <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> ended Jordan's season after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season. Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 points, 5.4 assists, and 6.0 rebounds, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a winning}} record, {{injuries}} hobbled {{the team for}} the 2009–2010 season. Reserves Batum and Fernández started the season on the inactive list and forward Travis Outlaw soon followed after a serious foot injury early in the season. Most notably, centers Oden and Joel Przybilla suffered season-ending knee injuries, while Roy and Aldridge played through shoulder, hamstring, ankle and knee injuries. Head Coach Nate McMillan was likewise not spared, suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon during practice and was in a walking boot. Because of the void at the center position, Blazers general manager Kevin Pritchard worked out a deal to acquire Marcus Camby from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Steve Blake and Outlaw. Although wins did not come as easily as the season before, the Blazers rallied to finish at 50–32, and finished 6th in the West. Roy underwent surgery after suffering a torn meniscus <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee,</b> but returned for Game 4 {{of the first round}} series against the Phoenix Suns. However, the accumulation of injuries was too much to bear, and the short-handed Trail Blazers lost the series 4–2 to the Suns.|$|E
5|$|In February, the 76ers had Okafor and Nerlens Noel swap {{positions}} as Okafor moved from center to power forward. On February 6, he recorded 22 points and a season-high 17 rebounds in a 103–98 {{win over the}} Brooklyn Nets. The position swap was considered an improvement over the two players splitting time or having Noel play out of his natural position. On February 21 against the Dallas Mavericks, Okafor posted a career-high 31 points in a 129–103 loss, surpassing not only his NBA career high, but also his 30-point game at Duke. On February 28, Okafor posted 26 points against the Orlando Magic, but he endured a shin contusion in a collision with teammate Isaiah Canaan that was only expected to sideline him for a game. As he missed his fifth consecutive game, 76ers head coach Brett Brown noted that Okafor had a CT scan on his knee. On March 11, Okafor was ruled out {{for the rest of}} the season after tests revealed that he had sustained a small tear of the meniscus <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On June 13, Sabathia {{left the}} game after an {{apparent}} left hamstring injury. It was eventually revealed that his left hamstring {{was diagnosed with}} a Grade 2 strain, landing him on the disabled list. He returned on July 4, starting against the Toronto Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium. On July 21, Sabathia earned a win on his 37th birthday, throwing [...] scoreless innings. On August 1, Sabathia made his 500th career start in loss against the Detroit Tigers. He was the second player in Major League history to make 500 starting pitching appearances in the regular season without ever appearing as a reliever; the feat was previously achieved by Tom Glavine. On August 8, he was taken out of a game after the third inning after experiencing pain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> surgically repaired <b>right</b> <b>knee.</b> On August 11, Sabathia landed on the 10-day disabled list again due to the lingering knee problem.|$|R
50|$|Jurrjens {{began the}} 2011 {{season on the}} {{disabled}} list, but {{got off to a}} strong start after he was activated. He was named Pitcher of the Month in May. He pitched his first career shutout on July 1, 2011 against the Baltimore Orioles, allowing one hit and one walk. It was his eleventh win of the season and improved his ERA to a league-best 1.89 ERA. Jurrjens led the National League in wins and ERA at the All-Star break, and was chosen to play <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first All-Star Game. He pitched 1 scoreless innings in the NL's 5-1 win. Following the All-Star break, Jurrjens went 0-1 with a 6.26 ERA in four starts. On August 6, the Braves placed him on the 15-day DL due to pain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> surgically repaired <b>right</b> <b>knee.</b> The move was retroactive to August 2. He returned briefly, but did not play for the Braves in September.|$|R

5|$|Jesé {{was handed}} his Champions League debut on 2 October 2013 by new club manager Carlo Ancelotti, coming on as a 81st-minute {{substitute}} for Karim Benzema in a 4–0 group stage victory over F.C. Copenhagen. He scored his first competitive goal for Real Madrid {{in his first}} El Clásico appearance on 26 October, netting in injury-time from a Ronaldo assist in a 2–1 loss at Barcelona. On 23 November, Jesé came on as a second-half substitute against UD Almería and contributed with his first two assists for the first team in a 5–0 away win. He enjoyed a fine run of form between {{the back end of}} 2013 and March 2014, where he netted a late winner at Valencia, scored his first Copa del Rey goal in a 2–0 win over CA Osasuna and netted in league encounters against Athletic Bilbao, Villarreal and Getafe. On 18 March, however, just two minutes into Real Madrid's Champions League's round-of-16 second leg game against Schalke, Jesé suffered a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> following a challenge from Sead Kolašinac and was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season. He ended the season with 5 goals and 4 assists to his name in 18 league appearances, and 8 goals in 31 matches across all competitions as Real Madrid went on to lift the Copa Del Rey and Champions League trophies.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{began the}} 2007–08 {{season with a}} minor wrist injury {{suffered}} during a game during the pre-season; he chose to play through the injury for months. He extended his ironman streak to 542 games before opting for wrist surgery on December 12, 2007. The streak, which had begun on February 27, 2000 with the Devils, was the 11th longest in NHL history, 404 games short of Doug Jarvis' NHL record. Morrison was succeeded as the league's active ironman by Flames defenceman Cory Sarich, who had played in 419 consecutive games {{at the time of}} Morrison's injury. Morrison's Canucks record of 534 consecutive games played was later surpassed by Henrik Sedin on December 26, 2011 (the game in which Sedin tied the record was played between the Canucks and Morrison's Calgary Flames). After undergoing wrist surgery in December 2007, Morrison returned to the Canucks lineup in February 2008, having missed 38 games. The following month, Morrison tore the ACL <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> during a game on March 28, forcing him to miss the remaining four contests of the regular season. He underwent knee surgery 10 days later. Limited to 39 games due to his injuries, Morrison recorded nine goals and 25 points in 2007–08. The Canucks finished out of the playoffs {{for the second time in}} three seasons.|$|E
5|$|On June 25, 2010, {{during the}} 2010 NHL Entry Draft, Ballard {{was traded to}} the Vancouver Canucks along with Victor Oreskovich, for Michael Grabner, Steve Bernier, and Vancouver's first round pick, the 25th overall selection, used to select Quinton Howden. After {{spending}} two months of the off-season on crutches while recovering from surgery, he reported to the Canucks' training camp, but struggled in the pre-season. Four games into the regular season, he suffered a concussion after being hit into the boards by Los Angeles Kings forward Brad Richardson on October 16, 2010. He was subsequently sidelined for five games. Upon returning to the lineup, however, his play continued to struggle. Averaging 13 minutes of ice time a game, he was eventually taken out of the lineup for four games in November by Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault. It marked {{the first time in his}} career he was a healthy scratch. After being re-insterted into the lineup, he scored his first goal as a Canuck in a 6–1 win against the San Jose Sharks on November 26. Several months later, Ballard suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament (MCL) <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> during a game against the Ottawa Senators on February 7, 2011. The injury resulted from opposing forward Milan Michalek tripping him from behind, which Canucks general manager Mike Gillis pointed out did not occur anywhere near the puck, alluding to the play as illegal and disrespectable. Ballard finished his first regular season with career lows in games played (65), goals (2), assists (5), points (7) and average ice time per game (15 minutes and 14 seconds). His individual struggles came amidst a franchise record season for the Canucks, who won the Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's regular season champion for the first time in team history. Entering the playoffs as the first seed in the West, the Canucks advanced past the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks to qualify for the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. Facing the Boston Bruins, Vancouver lost the Stanley Cup in Game 7. Over the team's 25 playoff games, Ballard dressed for 10. Playing only one game of the final two rounds, he dropped in the depth chart behind Aaron Rome and rookie Chris Tanev.|$|E
