5|$|Given {{that the}} {{matching}} vocabulary and astronomical content {{is drawn from}} throughout Polynesia, <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> from Easter Island, this supports the argument that rongorongo was not a recent, localized development; rather it {{was a product of}} thriving Polynesian trade and cultural interaction throughout the Pacific. There is additional evidence in favor of this theory, such as the identification of Polaris among the glyphs, which is only visible from the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The Grand National {{is always}} a major event for bookmakers, {{particularly}} in the United Kingdom. An estimated £300million in bets {{were said to have}} been placed on the 2011 race, including some from as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Australia, Bermuda and Kazakhstan, with British troops in Afghanistan also joining in. It is estimated that nearly half of the adult population of the UK bets on the Grand National.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} regular {{training}} activities, F/A-18 Hornets operate {{in different parts of}} Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. Regular deployments are made to Singapore and RMAF Butterworth in Malaysia as part of Integrated Air Defence System exercises. In addition, RAAF F/A-18s have participated in exercises in the Philippines, Thailand and the United States. These deployments have seen Australian fighter squadrons range as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, where they took part in Red Flag – Alaska exercises in 2008 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the {{purchasing}} power of Byzantine merchants became such that it could influence prices in markets as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Cairo and Alexandria. In reflection of their success, emperors gave merchants the right to become members of the Senate, that is to integrate themselves with the ruling elite. This had an end {{by the end of}} the eleventh century when political machinations allowed the landed aristocracy to secure the throne for a century and more. Following that phase, however, the enterprising merchants bounced back and wielded real clout during the time of the Third Crusade.|$|E
5|$|Focused only several {{kilometres}} {{below the}} surface, the earthquake resulted in significant shaking {{over a large}} portion of central-eastern South Island. Maximum ground motions registered at VIII (severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in Christchurch, while strong shaking (MM VI) was felt in adjacent populated areas such as Rolleston and Lincoln. The landforms of Sumner recorded intensified shaking due to the effects of its topographic setting. Widespread lighter motions were observed throughout much of the remaining region, with slight property damage reported from as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Dunedin. The earthquake was felt as far away as New Plymouth and Invercargill.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all members}} of its family, the Pacific swift feeds {{exclusively}} on insects caught in flight. It tends to hunt higher than most of its relatives other than the white-throated needletail. The Pacific swift has a large population and extensive breeding area, and faces few threats from predators or human activities. It is classed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It has occurred as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as the US and New Zealand, {{and it is a}} very rare vagrant in Europe, where it has been recorded in Denmark, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Syrrhaptes {{are found in the}} steppes of central Asia. Their range extends from the Caspian Sea through {{southern}} Siberia, Tibet and Mongolia to northern and central China. They are normally resident, but Pallas's sandgrouse can be locally migratory and very occasionally is irruptive, appearing in areas well outside its normal range. This happened in 1863 and 1888, and a major irruption took place in 1908 when many birds were seen as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Ireland and the United Kingdom where they bred in Yorkshire and Moray.|$|E
5|$|The league {{was formed}} in 1889 as the Birmingham & District League to cater for teams in Birmingham and the {{surrounding}} area, but soon became established {{as one of the}} strongest leagues outside the Football League itself, with teams from as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Bristol and Wales taking part. After the Second World War it absorbed the rival Birmingham Combination to become firmly established as the leading league in the area, but a gradual decline in its status began in the late 1950s and it now operates at a much lower level than in its heyday.|$|E
5|$|The seas around Gibraltar {{continued}} to be dangerous {{for decades to come}} as Barbary pirate raids continued; although a small squadron of Spanish galleys was based at the port to counter pirate raids, it proved to be of limited effectiveness and many inhabitants were abducted and sold into slavery by the pirates. The problem worsened significantly after 1606, when Spain expelled the Moriscos;– Muslims who had converted to Christianity. Many of the expellees were evacuated to North Africa via Gibraltar but ended up joining the pirate fleets, either as Christian slaves or reconverted Muslims, and raided as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|No. 76 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing that {{operated}} during World War II. Initially {{based in}} Far North Queensland, its headquarters transferred to Darwin, Northern Territory, in September 1944 {{to take control}} of three PBY Catalina units: Nos.20, 42, and 43 Squadrons. The prime task of these squadrons was minelaying in the South West Pacific theatre, and they conducted these operations as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Java, Borneo, the Philippines, and China. As well as minelaying, No.76 Wing's Catalinas flew bombing, patrol, and transport missions, and dropped millions of propaganda leaflets in the closing months of the war. The wing headquarters disbanded in November 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Gododdin, {{known in}} Roman times as the Votadini, held territories {{in what is}} now {{southeast}} Scotland and Northumberland, part of the Hen Ogledd (Old North). The poem tells how a force of 300 (or 363) picked warriors were assembled, some from as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Pictland and Gwynedd. After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn, now Edinburgh, they attacked Catraeth, which is usually identified with Catterick, North Yorkshire. After several days of fighting against overwhelming odds, nearly all the warriors are killed. The poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry, with the emphasis on the heroes fighting primarily for glory, but is not a narrative.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the manufacture of iron goods to Birmingham's economy was recognised as early as 1538, and grew rapidly as the century progressed. Equally significant was the town's emerging role as a centre for the iron merchants who organised finance, supplied raw materials and traded and marketed the industry's products. By the 1600s Birmingham formed the commercial hub {{of a network of}} forges and furnaces stretching from South Wales to Cheshire and its merchants were selling finished manufactured goods as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as the West Indies. These trading links gave Birmingham's metalworkers access to much wider markets, allowing them to diversify away from lower-skilled trades producing basic goods for local sale, towards a broader range of specialist, higher-skilled and more lucrative activities.|$|E
5|$|Various other German {{industrial}} enterprises, such as Krupp and Siemens-Schuckert, built factories {{with their}} own subcamps. There were 45 such satellite camps, 28 of which served corporations involved in the armaments industry. Prisoner populations ranged from several dozen to several thousand. Subcamps were built at Blechhammer, Jawiszowice, Jaworzno, Lagisze, Mysłowice, Trzebinia, and other centers as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Satellite camps were designated as Aussenlager (external camp), Nebenlager (extension or subcamp), or Arbeitslager (labor camp). Industries with satellite camps included coal mines, foundries and other metal works, chemical plants, and other industries. Prisoners were also made to work in forestry and farming.|$|E
5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E
5|$|The {{last of the}} company's dray horses was {{retired in}} 1947. Horses had {{delivered}} beer to all the areas surrounding the brewery, as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Pateley Bridge. From 1948 the company exported beer to Belgium where it was bottled and distributed by Tilkens brewery. In 1950 {{there was a general}} strike in Belgium, and John Smith's hired two Handley Page Halifax heavy bomber aircraft to carry 7 ton loads twice-daily of their beers into the country in order to ensure supply. In 1953 the firm became a public company, with fixed assets of around £5 million, 1,000 licensed premises and around 1,100 employees. In 1958, Whitworth, Son & Nephew of Wath-upon-Dearne was acquired with 165 licensed houses, and the brewery was immediately closed down. In 1959 the company began to bottle imported Alken lager at Tadcaster, in response to growing customer demand. In 1961 the company also began to bottle Carlsberg lager. By 1960 the company had an estate of 909 public houses.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} so popular that in 1999 the East Sussex county council made an appeal to Disney as the old wooden bridge had been worn down by an {{overwhelming}} number of visitors. The company provided a substantial donation towards the estimated £30,000 needed to replace the bridge. Partly rebuilt in 1979, the donations from Disney, building firms {{and members of the}} public funded its complete reconstruction. The newly built and modernised bridge retained its precursor's original style. A plaque was also placed to commemorate the occasion and thank those who financially contributed to the project. The sport can still be played in Ashdown Forest to this day and the site regularly attracts tourists from as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as the United States and Japan. However, visitors are now advised to bring their own sticks, as previous visitors have caused damage to the trees in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} in {{the south}} and west of Europe and south of latitude 40°N are mainly resident, although other populations migrate from regions where the winter is harsh, the ground frozen and food scarce. Large numbers of birds from northern Europe, Russia and Ukraine migrate south westwards or south eastwards. In the autumn, when immigrants are arriving from eastern Europe, many of Britain's common starlings are setting off for Iberia and North Africa. Other groups of birds are in passage across the country and the pathways of these different streams of bird may cross. Of the 15,000 birds ringed as nestlings in Merseyside, England, individuals have been recovered at various times of year as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Germany and the Low Countries. Small numbers of common starling have sporadically been observed in Japan and Hong Kong but it is unclear from where these birds originated. In North America, northern populations have developed a migration pattern, vacating much of Canada in winter. Birds in the east of the country move southwards, and those from further west winter {{in the south}}west of the US.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, {{the club}} {{followed}} Salisbury and {{stepped up to}} the Western League. This proved to be quite a different challenge—whereas before they had only competed against local teams in league competition, they now faced opposition from teams as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Avon, Somerset and Devon as well as the reserve teams of league clubs such as Bristol Rovers, Bristol City and Torquay United. They generally fared well, only failing to finish in {{the top half of the}} table twice during their time at this level. Their first season in the Western League saw the club reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the only time in their history after defeating Hendon 5–4 in a fourth qualifying round replay. On 3 November, Fourth Division side Gillingham came to the Walled Meadow and won 1–0 in front of 3484 spectators, a figure which would remain as the club's largest attendance for a home game. In the league Andover finished fourth, but that was their highest placing until 1969–70 when they finished as runners-up.|$|E
5|$|Pieces of {{the rope}} which was used to hang Corder sold for a guinea each. Part of Corder's scalp with an ear still {{attached}} was displayed in a shop in Oxford Street. A lock of Maria's hair sold for two guineas. Polstead became a tourist venue with visitors travelling from as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Ireland; Curtis estimated that 200,000 people visited Polstead in 1828 alone. The Red Barn and the Martens' cottage excited particular interest. The barn was stripped for souvenirs, down to the planks being removed from the sides, broken up, and sold as toothpicks. It was slated to be demolished after the trial, but it was left standing and eventually burned down in 1842. Even Maria's gravestone in the churchyard of St Mary's, Polstead was eventually chipped away to nothing by souvenir hunters; only {{a sign on the}} shed now marks the approximate place where it stood, although her name is given to Marten's Lane in the village. Pottery models and sketches were sold and songs were composed, including one quoted in the Vaughan Williams opera Hugh the Drover and Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus.|$|E
5|$|Y Gododdin {{is not a}} {{narrative}} poem {{but a series of}} elegies for heroes who died in a battle whose history would have been familiar to the original listeners. The context of the poem has to be worked out from the text itself. There have been various interpretations of the events recorded in the poem. The 19th-century Welsh scholar Thomas Stephens identified the Gododdin with the Votadini and Catraeth as Catterick in North Yorkshire. He linked the poem to the Battle of Degsastan in c. 603 between King Æthelfrith of Bernicia and the Gaels under Áedán mac Gabráin, king of Dál Riada. Gwenogvryn Evans in his 1922 edition and translation of the Book of Aneirin claimed that the poem referred to a battle around the Menai Strait in 1098, emending the text to fit the theory. The generally accepted interpretation for the Battle of Catraeth is that put forward by Ifor Williams in his Canu Aneirin first published in 1938. Williams interpreted mynydawc mwynvawr in the text to refer to a person, Mynyddog Mwynfawr in modern Welsh. Mynyddog, in his version, was the king of the Gododdin, with his chief seat at Din Eidyn (modern Edinburgh). Around the year 600 Mynyddog gathered about 300 selected warriors, some from as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Gwynedd. He feasted them at Din Eidyn for a year, then launched an attack on Catraeth, which Williams agrees with Stephens in identifying as Catterick, which was in Anglo-Saxon hands. They were opposed by a larger army from the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia.|$|E

25|$|However, in {{the early}} evening of the 27th the wind picked up, fanning {{hotspots}} still left over and by nightfall the mountain was ablaze, and, despite extra firefighters brought in from as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Clanwilliam and Mpumalanga, a long night's work was predicted for emergency personnel.|$|E
25|$|Minoan horn-topped altars, which Arthur Evans called Horns of Consecration, are {{represented}} in seal impressions and have been found as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Cyprus. Minoan sacred symbols include the bull (and its horns of consecration), the labrys (double-headed axe), the pillar, the serpent, the sun-disc and the tree.|$|E
25|$|The area {{of severe}} damage covered most of southeastern Sicily, {{an area of}} about , {{including}} all the present provinces of Catania, Ragusa and Syracuse. At least 70 cities, towns and villages were devastated, with some examples of at least partial building collapse as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Messina, Agrigento, Palermo, Reggio Calabria and Malta.|$|E
25|$|After more adventures, {{which took}} him as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Japan and Polynesia, Cătărău faded to {{relative}} obscurity. He only returned to {{history in the}} 1940s, a conjectural ally of the Soviet Union and the Romanian communist regime. In old age, he retreated from political affairs and became a Romanian Orthodox monk.|$|E
25|$|This {{sheep and}} lamb fair {{was the first}} of the year in Sussex, and there was much interest. It is said that farmers from as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Hastings to the east and Findon to the west visited, and at its peak, more than 9000 lambs were sold at the fair, {{together}} with numerous horses, cattle and sheep.|$|E
25|$|As a result, the Crown {{issued a}} church brief that {{authorised}} {{the collection of}} £11,000 for {{the aid of the}} town. Churches from as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Yorkshire contributed, and the collections enabled the further development of the port. This was the last invasion of England, and French Street with its museum is named in memory of the occasion.|$|E
25|$|Patti's {{career was}} one of success after success. She sang not only in England and the United States, but also as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> in {{mainland}} Europe as Russia, and in South America as well, inspiring audience frenzy and critical superlatives wherever she went. Her girlish good looks gave her an appealing stage presence, which added to her celebrity status.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, the Morgan Works was one of America's leading {{manufacturers}} of marine steam engines, specializing in medium-sized machinery for coastal and river service. From 1850 through 1860, the Works built engines for a total of 49 vessels, and its engines were in use with American steamship companies from the United States to as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as China.|$|E
25|$|Communities {{of foreigners}} (peregrini) and former slaves (libertini) {{continued}} their own religious practices within the city. In this way Mithras came to Rome and his popularity within the Roman army spread his cult as <b>far</b> <b>afield</b> as Roman Britain. The important Roman deities were eventually {{identified with the}} more anthropomorphic Greek gods and goddesses, and assumed many of their attributes and myths.|$|E
