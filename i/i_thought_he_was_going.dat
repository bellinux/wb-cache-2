500|$|... "The lion didn't do {{anything}} {{he was supposed to}} do, and I ended up leaning against this pillar with his head in my crotch... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to take a bite out of me so I lifted the veil I was wearing and had a stare-down with him and he opened his mouth and let out this huge roar. I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E
500|$|Just as the {{aircraft}} hit takeoff speed, the No.1 Engine and its pylon assembly {{separated from the}} left wing, ripping away a [...] section of the leading edge with it. The combined unit flipped {{over the top of}} the wing and landed on the runway. Robert Graham, supervisor of maintenance for American Airlines, stated: [...] "As {{the aircraft}} got closer, I noticed what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from the leading edge of the wing and the No. 1 engine pylon. I noticed that the No. 1 engine was bouncing up and down quite a bit and just about the time the aircraft got opposite my position and started rotation, the engine came off, went up {{over the top of the}} wing, and rolled back down onto the runway... Before going over the wing, the engine went forward and up just as if it had lift and was actually climbing. It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail. The aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to the left. And at that point, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to come back to the airport." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornwell {{has spoken}} {{negatively}} {{of the presidency}} of George W. Bush, saying, [...] "I was supportive of young George W. Bush because I liked his family. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be another Big George. Boy, was I ever wrong. It's not a democracy {{so much as a}} theocracy, and those are not the principles this country was founded on." ...|$|E
60|$|GREGORY [surprised]. Your poor father! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> alive.|$|R
60|$|SYLVIA. Why? She {{introduced}} me to him. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a very nice fellow.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> joking, for {{the view}} was sordid enough, but he soon {{explained}} himself.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to jump up, {{he started}} so violently, and I pressed him back.|$|E
60|$|Savello {{closed his}} fist, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to strike Checco. A yell {{burst from the}} people.|$|E
60|$|Stroeve stopped, gasping, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to faint. This {{was not at}} all {{the story}} I had {{expected}} him to tell me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gone. His Ed was so heavy, and {{he knocked}} it so hard, {{and he fell}} so stoney, and the sassagerial {{disturbance}} in him must have been so immense, that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gone. But, <b>he</b> soon come round with care, and he sat up on the floor, {{and he said to}} me, with wisdom comin out of his eyes, if ever it come: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked so}} hostile that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{in for another}} homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle.|$|R
60|$|EMMY [looking back] Drat him, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{following}} me. <b>He's</b> stayed {{down to talk}} to that lady.|$|R
6000|$|He got up. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> No. More talk, {{more time}} for the {{development}} of infectious influences--in my room, too--remember that, in my room! ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{stopped and}} {{stood looking at}} me with his modest, perplexed young face. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to exclaim--"The analogy be hanged!"--but he said after a moment-- ...|$|E
60|$|The handsome, elderly gentleman grew very {{red in the}} face, so red that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to have a fit. For a {{few moments}} he breathed heavily.|$|E
60|$|HOPE. I made my {{objections}} {{against my}} believing, for that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{not willing to}} save me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cynical?" [...] {{repeated}} Colville thoughtfully. [...] "I {{was looking}} into The Newcomes the other day, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> rather sentimental" ...|$|R
60|$|FIRST CITIZEN. Like a carrot's, as thou say'st, and English carrot's {{better than}} Spanish licorice; but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a beast.|$|R
6000|$|He {{laid his}} hand on my knee; his wan kind eyes {{considered}} me, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to say “You’re very young!” But he only brought out: “You’ve got used to Europe anyway!” ...|$|E
60|$|At this instant, Corny went overboard! Rectus made a grab at her, {{but it was}} too late. He {{sprang to}} his feet, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> over after her, but I seized him.|$|E
60|$|For {{a second}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to run away. Then he jerked up his head, and rushed on towards the house. At {{the foot of}} the {{staircase}} he gripped me by the shoulder.|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, I {{have had}} a second disappointment. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> not nearly so {{beautiful}} as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> when <b>I</b> was blind.|$|R
60|$|I {{seemed to}} feel his great rough thumb upon my chin as I {{answered}} that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a very dangerous man indeed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{this is very}} {{surprising}} news to me, and I {{am sorry}} and disappointed to hear it. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a very manly fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to {{turn over}} a new leaf," [...] {{declared}} Jack. [...] "I wonder {{if some of the}} other fellows haven't been teasing him and that has made him go back to his old tricks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{spoke in}} such a spiteful tone that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to round off with the words: `You fool' ... and perhaps he meant to. But what he {{finished}} sharply with was: `Shut the door quietly after you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How did I {{begin with}} him? Let me see. Oh! I {{just told him}} who I was; {{and then he turned}} away and looked down under the fire like, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to make a faint of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] he stammered. [...] "Worthy {{said that}} you were up here, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> crazy the way he talked--I didn't think--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I got {{separated}} from him long ago. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on ahead with you,” said Eleanor. “We shall never {{find him in}} this crush.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But where <b>is</b> Chatterton? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> here--he had {{a sister}} married here last week," [...] inquired Lord William Stapleton, {{addressing}} {{no one in}} particular.|$|R
6000|$|Monsieur Gratiot {{slapped his}} linen breeches. [...] "That I have," [...] {{and this time}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to laugh. But he did not, though his eyes sparkled. [...] "And {{do you think that}} the good Congress will ever repay me, Davy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|My friend {{laid his}} hand on my knee; he looked at me for some moments, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to say, [...] "You are very young!" [...] But he said presently, [...] "YOU have got used to Europe any way!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know what's {{coming over}} the lad, Kate," [...] he remarked after one of his visits. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to turn to a fop, by the Lord Harry I'd disown him! Don't you notice a change in him yourself?" ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not feel}} so much like congratulating Pepton as I had on the {{previous}} evening. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> making too much of his badge-winning.|$|R
60|$|I was {{at breakfast}} when my chief {{engineer}} entered and saluted. His face <b>was</b> grave, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> even a trifle paler than usual.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm awfully glad to meet you, Miss. Wetherell," [...] said Somers, fervently; [...] "to {{tell you}} the truth, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just making up yarns." ...|$|R
