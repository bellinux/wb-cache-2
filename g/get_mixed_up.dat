500|$|In 2007, Lundgren {{directed}} {{and starred in}} the Mongolia-based action adventure, Diamond Dogs. Lundgren portrays the character of Xander Ronson, a mercenary hired {{by a group of}} American fortune hunters to act as their guide and bodyguard, while they search for a priceless Buddhist artifact deep within the Chinese wilderness. They get more than they bargained for, however, as they {{come face to face with}} Russian mercenaries also after the artifact. The film, a Canadian-Chinese production, was shot on location in Inner Mongolia. Later in 2007, Lundgren wrote, {{directed and}} starred in Missionary Man alongside Charles Solomon Jr.. Described as a [...] "modern western" [...] by Lundgren, He plays a lone, Bible-preaching stranger named Ryder who comes into a small Texas town on his 1970's Harley-Davidson motorcycle to attend the funeral of his good friend J.J., a local Native American carpenter, only to later <b>get</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>up</b> in a series of brawls with a local gang. According to Lundgren, it had long been a desire of his to direct a western, having long been a fan of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne, yet he did not want to spend the time and money building an old western town and hiring horses, so decided to set it in modern times with a motorbike instead of entering the town on a horse in the manner than Clint Eastwood would. Lundgren's co-writer, Frank Valdez's wife's brother happened to be a notable actor working in Texas and invited Lundgren's team to shoot there. The film was shot on location in Waxahachie, a southern suburb of Dallas and was produced by Andrew Stevens and it was specially screened at the 2008 AFI Dallas Film Festival.|$|E

2500|$|The opening stanzas {{evoke the}} poet {{gazing into the}} fire imagining a primeval forest older than myth, [...] "before the fauns". But his {{traumatic}} experiences on the Western Front intrude on his somewhat romantic meditation: [...] "Wrote a poem on the Colliery Disaster: but I <b>get</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>up</b> with the War at the end. It is short, but oh! sour." [...] The gently hissing coals recall the moans of the dying miners [...] "writhing for air"; and Owen intertwines their death with that of soldiers at the front, imagining heaps of white bones in the fire's ashes and [...] "muscled bodies charred". Yet in the future, the centuries will still doze by the fire, its coals themselves formed out of [...] "rich loads", of groans and toil in the dark pits of war. The coming years, preserved in their rooms like insects in amber will be oblivious {{of the millions of}} dead lads - soldiers and miners - buried under the earth.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the pregnancy, the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein {{arranged}} the wedding very quickly, {{hoping it would}} be private, with John Lennon telling her {{there should be no}} tears, or she 'wouldn't be one of the gang'. McCartney was in Tunisia at the time, and could not attend. After the wedding, George Harrison (who had arrived on a bicycle) jokingly said 'Two down, two to go', meaning that the only two Beatles who were not married were Harrison and McCartney. The Starrs had a brief honeymoon for three days at the holiday home of Epstein's lawyer, David Jacobs, in Prince's Crescent, Hove, but gave an interview in the back garden on their wedding day, as they were being besieged by numerous reporters, with 100 photographers. Starr then had to depart to the Bahamas for the filming of Help!, on 22 February. She made it clear from the start that she would not give interviews, as a Beatles spokesperson explained: 'She doesn't want to <b>get</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>up</b> in publicity, and Ringo doesn't want her to, either.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Orwell relates his {{involvement}} in the Barcelona street fighting that began on 3 May when the Government Assault Guards tried to take the Telephone Exchange from the CNT workers who controlled it. For his part, Orwell acted as part of the POUM, guarding a POUM-controlled building. Although he realises that he is fighting {{on the side of the}} working class, Orwell describes his dismay at coming back to Barcelona on leave from the front only to <b>get</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>up</b> in street fighting. Assault Guards from Valencia arrive—"All of them were armed with brand-new rifles ... vastly better than the dreadful old blunderbusses we had at the front." [...] The Communist-controlled Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia newspapers declare POUM to be a disguised Fascist organisation—"No one who was in Barcelona then ... will forget the horrible atmosphere produced by fear, suspicion, hatred, censored newspapers, crammed jails, enormous food queues, and prowling gangs ...." [...] In his second appendix to the book, Orwell discusses the political issues at stake in the May 1937 Barcelona fighting, as he saw them at the time and later on, looking back.|$|E

[...] This would be said in a moment of truth but the next day had changed his mind and he'd be up and off.... He was married to his music and I didn't mind that especially in the early years when he would play me new songs on an acoustic guitar but what didn't make me happy was {{when he was in the}} home studio, out of his brain, trying to come up with the next album because he was being pressurised into it. He would just disappear into the studio for three or four days at a time. He never slept and there would be all sorts of strange people in there with him.
