5|$|Audioslave was an American rock {{supergroup}} {{formed in}} Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave {{as a combination}} of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, {{it was noted that}} they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix.</b> As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals.|$|E
5|$|In {{selecting}} the on-disc songs, FreeStyleGames recognized that engaging guitar tracks are not strictly limited to rock music, and included other genres <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix.</b> According to designer Jim Norris, their selection process began with identifying songs {{that would be}} expected by players {{to be on a}} Guitar Hero title, and then determining which of those songs which they could license. Once they had obtained the license, FreeStyleGames would mark up the song for the note highways and determined how much fun these songs would be to play. Finally, they balanced the song selection in the game to give players a combination of songs they know and those they may not recognize but would be enjoyable.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero 2 is {{the sequel}} to DJ Hero, a spinoff of the Guitar Hero series. DJ Hero 2 was {{developed}} by FreeStyleGames, published by Activision and released worldwide in October 2010 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii consoles. Like its predecessor, DJ Hero 2 simulates turntablism, the playing of two songs in mix, using a special turntable-based controller that includes the ability to crossfade between the two songs, and scratching the recording. Players are challenged to match these actions, shown through on-screen scrolling indicators in synchronization with the mix; correct actions boost the player's score, while correctly performing several consecutive actions can increase the player's scoring multiplier. Specifically marked sections of songs allow the player to freestyle through crossfading, scratching, or inserting music samples <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix.</b> The player is not penalized for failing to perform actions. The goal is to obtain a high score for each mix, earning the player a star rating from one to five, which helps to advance the player's progress through the game.|$|E

5|$|ROT47 is a {{derivative}} of ROT13 which, {{in addition to}} scrambling the basic letters, also treats numbers and common symbols. Instead of using the sequence A–Z as the alphabet, ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common character encoding known as ASCII. Specifically, the 7-bit printable characters, excluding space, from decimal 33 '!' through 126 '~', 94 in total, taken {{in the order of}} the numerical values of their ASCII codes, are rotated by 47 positions, without special consideration of case. For example, the character A is mapped to p, while a is mapped to 2. The use of a larger alphabet produces a more thorough obfuscation than that of ROT13; for example, a telephone number such as +1-415-839-6885 is not obvious at first sight from the scrambled result Z`\c`d\gbh\eggd. On the other hand, because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> without discrimination, it is more immediately obvious that the text has been enciphered.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{expand on}} their debut's sound, the xx wanted to {{minimise}} the songs they recorded for Coexist and mute certain elements during its production. Croft {{felt that this}} would help make the music more playable live {{instead of having to}} reproduce multiple vocal or guitar elements that were tracked onto a song. Smith, who produced and mixed Coexist, wanted to keep his production simple and create an emotive, electronic sound. He used Logic Pro recording software, a Space Echo effects unit, preamplifiers, and Casiotones on occasion, as well as both synthesised steelpan sounds and live percussion instruments. To engineer the album, he put together a mixing desk from pieces of other desks and left doors open during the recording to let sounds from outside the studio bleed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix.</b> The xx finished recording Coexist in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Team Nash (Diamond Dallas Page, Sean Waltman, and {{an unknown}} member) fought Team Jarrett (Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown, and The Outlaw) in the first-ever three-on-three Lethal Lockdown match, which ran 15 minutes and 35 seconds. Waltman and Jarrett started the match by {{fighting}} {{through the crowd}} before entering the cage. After five minutes, The Outlaw joined the match and helped Jarrett attack Waltman. Diamond Dallas Page entered the match two minutes later and attacked Jarrett and The Outlaw with a cane. Following another two minutes, Brown joined the fray, finished out Team Jarrett, and threw Waltman into the cage wall. The final member of Team Nash was revealed after the final two minutes, as B.G. James was thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> that allowed a pinfall or submission to occur. Brown gained a near-fall for Team Jarrett on James after forcing him into a trash can with his signature maneuver, the Pounce. Eventually, Waltman performed a move called a hurricanrana on Brown, leading to the pinfall and victory.|$|E

5000|$|In all cases, {{the signal}} from the {{instruments}} and/or microphones are routed to the multicore cable (often nicknamed the [...] "snake") and then plugged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> board. Once <b>the</b> offstage musicians and singers' signals are plugged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> board, <b>the</b> audio engineer can blend their sounds in with the playing and singing of the onstage musicians (which is also captured by microphones and/or signal cables). <b>The</b> <b>mixed</b> output is then routed to the PA system or sound reinforcement system, the combination of power amplifiers and speaker enclosures which outputs the concert sounds for the audience.|$|R
5|$|The {{music of}} the Lesser Antilles {{encompasses}} the music of this chain of small islands making up the eastern and southern portion of the West Indies. Lesser Antillean music {{is part of the}} broader category of Caribbean music; much of the folk and popular music is also a part of the Afro-American musical complex, being a mixture of African, European and indigenous American elements. The Lesser Antilles' musical cultures are largely based on the music of African slaves brought by European traders and colonizers. The African musical elements are a hybrid of instruments and styles from numerous West African tribes, while the European slaveholders added their own musics <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix,</b> as did immigrants from India. In many ways, the Lesser Antilles can be musically divided based on which nation colonized them.|$|E
5|$|The character's {{change in}} Part II (Naruto Shippuden) has been praised for {{being one of}} the most {{developed}} ones in the series by Anime News Network's Casey Brienza, as she has become stronger than her Part I (Naruto) counterpart which, was considerably weaker than Naruto and Sasuke. This allows her to take a more active and appealing role in the series. Major praise has been given to her encounters with Sasori and Sasuke owing to her fighting skills and mature reactions, respectively. Sakura's love confession to Naruto in later parts of the series has been commented {{to be one of the}} deepest lines and part of the story arc, for bringing confusion <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> in regards to whether or not, her love confession claim is as serious as her intention to stop Naruto's suffering. It also came as a surprise as fans wondered what were Sakura's real intention regarding Sasuke who had become a dangerous criminal during such a time in the series. Jason Thompson believes Sakura's feelings were well-handled by Kishimoto. While disliking the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series as she felt it was initially a crush on Sakura's part, Amy McNulty believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden helps to expand the bond between these two as well as their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Sarah Nelkin from Anime Now praised Sakura's development across the series, mostly in late parts of the series due to how she turns into a stronger person as she grows up most notably when she becomes an adult.|$|E
25|$|Writing for IGN, Scott Collura also {{praised the}} Doctor's {{relationship}} with Bill, stating he's ‘totally sold {{on this new}} Doctor/Bill dynamic at this point, and this season's new direction as well.' He also took in consideration the themes and undertones of the episode ‘dropping some fairly heavy thematic material <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> as well'. He awarded the episode a score of '8.6' considered as ‘great'.|$|E

25|$|The Austin A. Bell Building is a four story {{structure}} of brick with Terra cotta ornamentation. Both brick and Terra cotta {{are of a}} distinct reddish-orange hue and the mortar joints are narrow. Its architect, Elmer H. Fisher would later design many of the buildings in the Pioneer Square district of Seattle. While Fisher's designs were predominantly Richardsonian, the Bell Building is less so, with several Gothic elements thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix.</b>|$|E
25|$|Types Ia, IIa, and IIIa {{have the}} same {{composition}} as types I, II, and III. The {{only difference is that}} in Ia, IIa, and IIIa, an air-entraining agent is ground <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix.</b> The air-entrainment must meet the minimum and maximum optional specification found in the ASTM manual. These types are only available in the eastern United States and Canada, only on a limited basis. They are a poor approach to air-entrainment which improves resistance to freezing under low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|By the 1960s Czech and Russian operas {{entered the}} repertory, while the 1970s saw an {{interest}} in the operas of Jules Massenet under director Thomson Smillie, followed by an emphasis on Italian operas from the end of that decade. However, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> there appeared more modern operas by Benjamin Britten and Carlisle Floyd while Elaine Padmore's 12-year tenure resulted in more international singers making first appearances and the beginnings of commercial recordings and radio broadcasts.|$|E

25|$|In divorce cases, when a {{court is}} {{attempting}} to distribute marital property, if the divorcing couple is local and the property is local, then the court applies its domestic law lex fori. The case becomes more complicated if foreign elements are thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix,</b> such as when the place of marriage {{is different from the}} territory where divorce was filed; when the parties' nationalities and residences do not match; when there is property in a foreign jurisdiction; or when the parties have changed residence several times during the marriage.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Gregory Maston of Bell Labs {{filed for}} a patent {{involving}} a circuit that could switch between several audio sources based on their levels. The loudest one was latched <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix.</b> This system did not ramp switched signals smoothly in and out and did not maintain a constant ambience. It was intended for speakerphone conferencing applications. In 1972, Keith A. T. Knox with the British Post Office Corporation developed an adaptive threshold gate circuit intended for speakerphone usage. The system used a second microphone somewhat near the first to sense ambient noise level.|$|E
25|$|Untreated filthy {{surface runoff}} was (as of 2008) {{the main source}} of pollution; in the 1980s it contributed one to eight times more {{petrochemical}} waste than direct industrial waste. As of 2008, nearly 80% of the surface runoff in the Central Administrative District is still flushed into the Moskva and Yauza untreated. Until 2000 the river was used in winter as a dump for snow collected from the streets, adding chlorides, soot, rubbish and more oil <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix.</b> This practice is now banned; the city now employs a network of snow-melting dumps that feed polluted water into treatment facilities.|$|E

25|$|In January 2007, Energy's {{playlist}} {{began to}} shift towards Rhythmic Contemporary by incorporating more current R/Hip-Hop product <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> and lessening on Dance and Old School tracks {{as a way}} to boost ratings and because of WWHV's flip from Urban to Sports (now WXTG). During this time, the station was still suffering from dismal numbers in the Arbitron ratings. On August 27, at Midnight (ET), Energy shifted formats to Adult Top 40, with the current Hot AC Pop/Rock fare mixed in with some of the Rhythmic crossovers that were held over from the previous format.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Čolić's arrival, Ambasadori {{employed}} a strange setup: they were essentially a military cover band as all the musicians, except for bandleader Slobodan Vujović, were army recruits. Their repertoire centred around 1960s rhythm & blues (Chicago, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, etc.) along with obligatory Yugoslav hits {{of the day and}} years past, and finally even a few original numbers written by the bandmembers thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix.</b> Over time, the group started getting more gig offers, which presented a problem since its army part was not available for many of them and those offers had to be declined.|$|E
25|$|Also {{part of the}} {{progressive}} folk movement was guitarist John Renbourn, whose 1968 album Sir John Alot of Merry Englandes Musyk Thynge and ye Grene Knyghte began to display {{his interest in the}} medieval, containing a number of versions of early music songs, which would be dominant on The Lady and the Unicorn (1970). From 1967 Renbourn {{was a member of the}} folk group Pentangle, and he took his interest in early music <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> of influences (including blues, jazz, bluegrass, world music and traditional folk song) in the band. Coming from the more traditional end of the folk spectrum were Shirley and Dolly Collins. They were the first artists to produce a complete album, Anthems in Eden (1969), that combined traditional folk songs with early music instruments, utilizing David Munrow’s Early Music Consort, and early music remained a major preoccupation of their careers. Also from 1969 Third Ear Band made use of medieval instruments alongside classical and eastern influences.|$|E
