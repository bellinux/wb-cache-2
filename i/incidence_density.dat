50|$|A {{rate ratio}} (sometimes called an <b>incidence</b> <b>density</b> ratio) in epidemiology, is a {{relative}} difference measure {{used to compare the}} incidence rates of events occurring at any given point in time. A common application for this measure in analytic epidemiologic studies is in the search for a causal association between a certain risk factor and an outcome.|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} rate {{is the number}} of new cases per population at risk in a given time period. When the denominator is the sum of the person-time of the at risk population, it is also known as the <b>incidence</b> <b>density</b> rate or person-time {{incidence rate}}. In the same example as above, the incidence rate is 14 cases per 1000 person-years, because the incidence proportion (28 per 1,000) is divided by the number of years (two). Using person-time rather than just time handles situations where the amount of observation time differs between people, or when the population at risk varies with time. Use of this measure implies the assumption that the incidence rate is constant over different periods of time, such that for an incidence rate of 14 per 1000 persons-years, 14 cases would be expected for 1000 persons observed for 1 year or 50 persons observed for 20 years.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the incidence and consultation rate of lower extremity complaints in general practice. METHODS: Data {{were obtained from}} the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice, in which 195 general practitioners (GPs) in 104 practices recorded all contacts with patients during 12 consecutive months in computerised patient records. GPs classified the symptoms and diagnosis for each patient at each consultation according to the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC). <b>Incidence</b> <b>densities</b> and consultation rates for different complaints were calculated. RESULTS: During the registration period 63. 2 GP consultations per 1000 person-years were attributable to a new complaint of the lower extremities. Highest <b>incidence</b> <b>densities</b> were seen for knee complaints: 21. 4 per 1000 person-years for women and 22. 8 per 1000 person-years for men. The incidence of most lower extremity complaints was higher for women than for men and higher in older age. CONCLUSIONS: Both incidences of and consultation rates for lower extremity complaints are substantial in general practice. This implies a considerable impact on the workload of the GP.

40|$|Abstract Time-to-event {{analyses}} are often {{concerned with the}} effects of explanatory factors on the underlying <b>incidence</b> <b>density,</b> but since there is no intrinsic interest {{in the form of the}} <b>incidence</b> <b>density</b> itself, a proportional hazards model is used. When part of the purpose of the analysis is to use actual cumulative incidence for simulation, or for providing informative visual displays of the results, an estimate of the baseline <b>incidence</b> <b>density</b> is required. The usual method for estimating the baseline hazards in Cox’s proportional hazards analysis yields values that are of little use, and furthermore no standard deviations of the estimates (SDEs) are available. In this article we present an alternative approach to recovering an estimate of the baseline <b>incidence</b> <b>density</b> that yields smooth estimates as well as smooth estimates of SDEs. We illustrate the method on a large dataset of inter-visit times for individuals in a diabetes registry, and indicate how it can be used to incorporate different baseline incidence densities in the analysis of different subgroups.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Selective {{digestive}} tract decontamination aims to eradicate gram-negative bacteria {{in both the}} intestinal tract and respiratory tract and is combined with a 4 -day course of intravenous cefotaxime. Selective oropharyngeal decontamination only aims to eradicate respiratory tract colonization. In a recent study, selective {{digestive tract}} decontamination and selective oropharyngeal decontamination were associated with lower day- 28 mortality, when compared to standard care. Furthermore, selective digestive tract decontamination {{was associated with a}} lower incidence of intensive care unit-acquired bacteremia caused by gram-negative bacteria. We quantified the role of intestinal tract carriage with gram-negative bacteria and intensive care unit-acquired gram-negative bacteremia. DESIGN: Data from a cluster-randomized and a single-center observational study. SETTING: Intensive care unit in The Netherlands. PATIENTS: Patients with intensive care unit stay of > 48 hrs that received selective digestive tract decontamination (n = 2, 667), selective oropharyngeal decontamination (n = 2, 166) or standard care (n = 1, 945). INTERVENTIONS: Selective digestive tract decontamination or selective oropharyngeal decontamination. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: <b>Incidence</b> <b>densities</b> (episodes/ 1000 days) of intensive care unit-acquired gram-negative bacteremia were 4. 5, 3. 0, and 1. 4 during standard care, selective oropharyngeal decontamination, and selective digestive tract decontamination, respectively, and the daily risk for developing intensive care unit-acquired gram-negative bacteria bacteremia increased until days 36, 33, and 31 for selective digestive tract decontamination, standard care, and selective oropharyngeal decontamination and was always lowest during selective digestive tract decontamination. Rectal colonization with gram-negative bacteria was present in 26 % and 71 % of patient days during selective digestive tract decontamination and selective oropharyngeal decontamination, respectively (p <. 01).

For this purpose, the national reference database for the surveillance of nosocomial infections in intensive care patients (ICU-KISS) and operated patients (OP-KISS) of the German hospital infection surveillance system (KISS) was analyzed for the period from January 2000 to December 2009. The definition of the seasons was based on freely available climate data from the German weather service "Deutscher Wetterdienst". For ICU-KISS, incidence densities (infections/ 1000 patient-days) and <b>incidence</b> <b>density</b> ratios, for OP-KISS incidences (infections/ 100 operated patients) and relative risks, were calculated respectively with the 95 % confidence intervals. The analysis was based on 8, 680, 283 patient-days and 42, 603 infections from 597 intensive care units and 767, 970 operated patients and 13, 586 surgical site infections in 595 surgical departments. The results showed both a significant increase in primary sepsis in the summer period (<b>incidence</b> <b>density</b> ratio 1. 10 [1. 05 to 1. 16]) and a significant decrease in winter period (<b>incidence</b> <b>density</b> ratio 0. 89 [0. 84 - 0. 94]) and also a significant increase in lower respiratory tract infections in the summer period (<b>incidence</b> <b>density</b> ratio 1. 08 [1. 05 to 1. 12]) and a significant decrease in winter (<b>incidence</b> <b>density</b> ratio 0. 96 [0. 93 - 0. 999]) period. The surgical site infections also showed a significant increase in summer (relative risk 1. 11 [1. 06 to 1. 15]) and a significant decrease in winter (relative risk 0. 95 [0. 91 to 0. 99]). Among the most important pathogens of nosocomial infections nonfermenting bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacteria such as enterobacter spp. and klebsiella spp. and some other pathogens were identified as seasonal infectious agents. The finding that seasonal effects exist in nosocomial infections makes it necessary to consider these effects in the planning, implementation and evaluation of studies. Since the extent of seasonal effects is relatively low, further studies will be necessary to evaluate the effect of the introduction of seasonally adjusted hygiene measures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The German {{national}} {{nosocomial infection}} surveillance system, KISS, has a component for very {{low birth weight}} (VLBW) infants (called NEO-KISS) which changed from a system with voluntary participation and confidential data feedback to a system with mandatory participation and confidential feedback. Methods In order to compare voluntary and mandatory surveillance data, two groups were defined by the surveillance start date. Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) parameters and infection rates of the NICUs in both groups were compared. In order to analyze the surveillance effect on primary bloodstream infection rates (BSI), all VLBW infants within {{the first three years}} of participation in both groups were considered. The adjusted effect measures for the year of participation were calculated. Results An increase from 49 NICUs participating in 2005 to 152 in 2006 was observed after the introduction of mandatory participation. A total of 4280 VLBW infants was included in this analysis. Healthcare-associated <b>incidence</b> <b>densities</b> rates were similar in both groups. Using multivariate analysis with the endpoint primary BSI rate and comparing the first and third year of participation lead to an adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0. 78 (CI 95 0. 66 - 0. 93) for old (voluntary) and 0. 81 (CI 95 0. 68 - 0. 97) for new (mandatory) participants. Conclusions The step from a voluntary to a mandatory HCAI surveillance system alone may lead to substantial improvements on a countrywide scale. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{demonstrate}} how a web-based intensive monitoring system using the patient {{as a source}} of information can be used to gather longitudinal safety data of a drug. Information about the time course of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is often lacking. If this information would be available, it could help increase patient's adherence to drugs when experiencing an ADR. In this study, pregabalin was used as an example. DESIGN AND METHODS: First-time users of pregabalin were approached in Dutch pharmacies between 1 August 2006 and 31 January 2008. After online registration, patients received questionnaires by email 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after the start of the drug use. Data on patient characteristics, drug use and ADRs were collected and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 1373 patients registered for the pregabalin study. Of these patients, 1051 (76. 5 %) filled in at least one questionnaire. On an aggregated level, the ADR profile remained relatively stable over time. <b>Incidence</b> <b>densities</b> showed that the five most frequently reported reactions occurred early in the treatment. Initially, the majority of the patients did not undertake any action when experiencing an ADR. Recovery {{did not seem to be}} completely dependent of drug cessation. CONCLUSION: With web-based intensive monitoring, it is possible to study the time course of ADRs. This method can be a valuable addition to pharmacovigilance because it can generate other types of information as compared with spontaneous reporting and other intensive monitoring methodologies...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the epidemiology of the three most common nosocomial infections (NI), namely, sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection (UTI), in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a developing country and to define the risk factors associated with NI. METHODS: We performed a prospective study on the incidence of NI in a single PICU, between August 2009 and August 2010. Active surveillance by National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) was conducted in the unit and children with NI (cases) were compared with a group (matched controls) in a case-control fashion. RESULTS: We analyzed 172 patients; 22. 1 % had NI, 71. 1 % of whom acquired it in the unit. The <b>incidence</b> <b>densities</b> of sepsis, pneumonia, and UTI per 1, 000 patients/day were 17. 9, 11. 4, and 4. 3, respectively. The most common agents in sepsis were Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (18 % each); Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 13 % of cases. In pneumonias Staphylococcus aureus {{was the most common}} cause (3. 2 %), and in UTI the most frequent agents were yeasts (33. 3 %). The presence of NI was associated with a long period of hospitalization, use of invasive devices (central venous catheter, nasogastric tube), and use of antibiotics. The last two were independent factors for NI. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of NI acquired in this unit was high and was associated with extrinsic factors...|$|R
