The biasing-field dependency in fine-grained particles was opposite to that in coarse-grained particles.

A single domain-like biasing-field dependency was observed in equidimensional particles up to 0. 2 Âµ mean grain size and up to 0. 4 Âµ elongated grains. Either the single domain/pseudo-single domain boundary lies above at least 0. 2 Âµ grain size or this field dependency test does not distinguish between single domain and pseudo-single domain states.

Due to the non-linear characteristic of <b>demagnetization</b> <b>curve,</b> AlNiCo can be regulated to operate at different magnetization levels via a magnetizing winding. With this distinct merit, AlNiCo can provide the assistance for online tuning the air-gap flux density. Firstly, the configuration of proposed machine is presented.

These three levels of shock effects are shown to be delimited by discrete levels of microhardness, microstructure, and stability of remanence to demagnetization.

We show that a sparse preconditioner for a nonlinear conjugate gradient energy minimizer can lead to a speed up by a factor of 3 and 7 for computing hysteresis in soft magnetic and hard magnetic materials, respectively. As a preconditioner an approximation of the Hessian of the Lagrangian is used, which only takes local field terms into account.
