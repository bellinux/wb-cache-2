25|$|Dizygotic twins, {{like any}} other siblings, have an {{extremely}} small chance of having the same chromosome profile. Even if they <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the same chromosome profile, they will always have different genetic material on each chromosome, due to chromosomal crossover during meiosis. Like any other siblings, dizygotic twins may look similar, particularly given {{that they are the}} same age. However, dizygotic twins may also look very different from each other.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Sarikamish, the Ottoman army {{runs out}} of {{ammunition}} and appeals for help {{to the people of}} Van, who <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> supplies. However, the First World War is on and all the men are fighting at the four corners of the empire and therefore can not respond to the appeal. The young children of Van want to do something and when the principal of a school, who has lost a son in the war, suggests that they transport ammunition, 120 young boys aged 12 to 17 volunteer and take to the road. The movie tells the true story of the 120 boys and their sisters and mothers left behind, who wait for their return.|$|E
25|$|One {{means of}} {{studying}} reionization uses the spectra of distant quasars. Quasars release an {{extraordinary amount of}} energy, meaning they are among the brightest objects in the universe. As a result, some quasars are detectable from {{as far back as the}} epoch of reionization. Quasars also <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> relatively uniform spectral features, regardless of their position in the sky or distance from the Earth. Thus it can be inferred that any major differences between quasar spectra will be caused by the interaction of their emission with atoms along the line of sight. For wavelengths of light at the energies of one of the Lyman transitions of hydrogen, the scattering cross-section is large, meaning that even for low levels of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM), absorption at those wavelengths is highly likely.|$|E

25|$|An unusual feeding {{strategy}} {{is that of}} the oxpeckers of Africa. They perch on living animals and glean parasites from the animals' hides. On furry animals, such as buffalo, giraffe, and donkey, these birds run their bills through the fur of the animal, using a scissors-like motion to extract ticks and lice from near the skin. When they pull the insect out {{to the end of the}} fur, they catch it and eat it. (On animals with bare hides, such as rhinoceros and hippopotamus, oxpeckers pick at any open wounds the animals <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> consuming blood and pus, and possibly keeping the wounds free of maggots.) Historically, rhinoceros and other large wild mammals have been among the favored hosts, but as the populations of large mammals in the African savanna have declined in modern times, the population and range of both red-billed and yellow-billed oxpecker have also changed, and now the birds will use donkeys and domestic cattle as hosts.|$|E
25|$|For many {{classical}} philosophers, {{nature was}} understood teleologically, meaning that {{every type of}} thing had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus, the cosmos is even said to have reason. Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal {{part of the human}} mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human mind or soul (psyche), reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (thumos) and the passions. Aristotle, Plato's student, defined human beings as rational animals, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature. He defined the highest human happiness or well being (eudaimonia) as a life which is lived consistently, excellently and completely in accordance with reason.|$|E
25|$|Girls {{are most}} likely to enjoy high {{self-esteem}} when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, {{they are more likely to}} derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).|$|E

The UK-based NGO welcomed their release saying it was overdue. Human Rights Watch (HRW) expressed its concern on the two former MPs. [...] "These latest arrests of the two Al Wefaq parliamentarians fit a pattern of masked men abducting Bahraini citizens who <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> opinions critical of the government," [...] said Joe Stork of HRW. Alkarama expressed concern over the arrest and possible mistreatment of the two, and welcomed Matar's acquittal later.

He also recounted several other instances of aberrant behavior, including arriving to a team meeting during his playing career in handcuffs after spending a night with some call girls.

McCain barred using the Jeremiah Wright controversy in ads against Obama, but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding his purported relationship with Bill Ayers. [...] McCain's rallies became increasingly vitriolic, with attendees denigrating Obama and displaying a growing anti-Muslim and anti-African-American sentiment. After one female McCain supporter said she did not trust Obama because [...] "he's an Arab", McCain pointedly replied to the woman, [...] "No ma'am. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> disagreements with on fundamental issues." [...] McCain's response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in American politics. [...] Down the stretch, McCain was outspent by Obama by a four-to-one margin.|$|E

[...] VanDerWerff also wrote in his review, [...] ""Blood of My Blood" [...] is another exciting hour of television, even if it's a bit more piece move-y than, say, [...] "The Door".

500|$|In {{the opening}} match of the tour, a draw against North Zone, Hassett made 73.

The team {{was scheduled to}} play East Zone in Calcutta, but the city was gripped in deadly riots as independence activists agitated against British rule. Australia batted first and made only 107, before East Zone replied with 131. Led by Hassett's 125, Australia posted 304 to leave the hosts a target of 281. On the final day, pro-independence rioters broke through the security presence and invaded the pitch {{for the second time}} during the match, while East Zone were batting. East Zone batsman Denis Compton told the rioters to talk to Hassett, saying that the Australian skipper controlled proceedings. Hassett smiled at the leader of the irate demonstrators and asked [...] "You wouldn't <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a cigarette, would you, old boy?" [...] The rioters calmed down and play resumed.|$|E

There, she died on either 15 or 22 January 1555, and was buried on 1 February at Chelsea Old Church. In her will she tried to provide for her sons financially and thanked the Queen, {{as well as the}} many Spanish nobles she had lobbied. The Duchess of Alba was to receive her green parrot; to Don Diego de Acevedo she gave [...] "the new bed of green velvet with all the furniture to it; beseeching him even as he hath in my lifetime showed himself like a father and a brother to my sons, so shall [...] require him no less to do now their mother is gone". She also remembered [...] "my lord, my dear husband", and stipulated: [...] "in no wise let me be opened after I am dead. ... I have not lived to be very bold before women, much more I should be loth to come into the hands of any living man, be he Physician or Surgeon."

500|$|The {{team was}} {{scheduled}} to play East Zone, but the city was gripped in deadly riots as independence activists agitated against British rule. The match went ahead, but on the first day, thousands of protestors invaded the pitch, interrupting play for an hour. Elsewhere in the city, 23 people were killed. Miller scored only 17 and one, both times dismissed by Chandu Sarwate, and did not bowl. On the final day, Miller's friend Compton, who was playing for East Zone while on deployment with the British Army in India, was nearing a century as his team closed in on victory. The rioters broke through the security presence and invaded the pitch again. The leader of the demonstrators ran up to Compton and said: [...] "Mr Compton, you very good player, but you must stop". In later years, Miller would quote this remark whenever Compton came to the crease in matches featuring both of them. Compton told the rioters to ask Hassett, saying that the Australian skipper controlled proceedings. Hassett smiled at {{the leader of the}} irate demonstrators and asked [...] "You wouldn't <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a cigarette, would you, old boy?" [...] The rioters calmed down and play resumed. Compton brought up his century with the winning runs. In 2005, the ECB and Cricket Australia decided that the player adjudged the Player of the Series in the Ashes would be awarded the Compton-Miller Medal, recognising their friendship and rivalry.|$|E
