The PCB dipole was not being actively considered, as there were several other antenna candidates that perform just as well at 2 dBi.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we present two novel {{multiband}} antenna designs for multiple frequency applications. The first of these, {{which is based}} on fractal concepts, is a Sierpinski gasket type of fractal configuration, printed on a dielectric substrate backed by a ground plane. We propose a novel approach to enhancing its multiband performance, in terms of impedance matching characteristics as well as radiation patterns, at three operating frequencies. The second design combines a rectangular microstrip patch with a cylindrical dielectric resonator, and operates at multiple frequencies. Specifically, we describe a stacked configuration of a dielectric resonator antenna on a microstrip patch for three frequency bands. Circular polarization is obtained by utilizing four coax feeds in phase quadrature. This configuration is found to exhibit good cross-pol rejection characteristics.

40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) {{would add}} {{computational}} {{power to a}} plethora of ordinary objects. Potential applications are vast and vary in terms of maturity from sensors tracking energy usage to smart wearables and many more futuristic applications. A challenge shared by many of such small devices, {{in the order of}} a few centimeters in length and width, is battery and power. Cost, size, weight, and lifetime of the battery motivate alternative methods for providing energy to such devices. A practical Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) system which can power battery-less and charge coil-free smart everyday-objects has a tremendous potential to address this demand. In this work we offer a reliable solution. The 60 -GHz WPT system that is built in this project can be employed by any smart device which can be placed at a reasonably close distance to its power transmitter, without the alignment and proximity challenges which are associated with the magnetic charging solutions. The leading applications to benefit enormously from this new 60 -GHz WPT technology are miniature IoT devices, smart charge cards, business cards and IDs, smart posters, sensor fusion, and wireless flash memories. In this work, the first reported full-system 60 -GHz WPT solution which can power battery-less and charge coil-free compact smart devices is presented. The system is fabricated in a 40 -nm digital CMOS process and an inexpensive 500 -µm CCL-HL 832 MG antenna packaging material. The rectenna (RX) of this 60 -GHz WPT system consists of a <b>grid</b> <b>antenna</b> with a measured gain of 10. 7 dBi, integrated with a tuned complementary cross-coupled oscillator-like rectifier. It harvests DC power at a rate of 1 mW with a 28. 2 % RF-to-DC Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE). This PCE rate is significantly higher than the prior art and reaches 32. 8 % for 1. 4 mA output current. A novel theoretical analysis of the unique rectifier circuitry is presented which helps formulating all key specifications and identifying the design trade-offs. We present a cascode version of the energy harvester that produces higher DC output voltage and higher PCE in low current regime. The theoretical analysis and the results of the measurement for that harvester is also presented. The transmitter (TX) is equipped with a quad-core power amplifier which produces a total saturated output power (Psat) of 24. 6 dBm, which is the highest reported power delivery in digital CMOS technology at mm-wave bands. The TX peak PAE is 9. 4 %. The quad-core PA performs a 4 × 8 -way differential power combining and implements a binary-tree architecture by using power-splitting transformers which perform intra-stage matching too. The designed 2 × 2 grid array antenna helps the TX produce a peak EIRP level of 35. 3 dBm. The coupling between the TX and RX antennas within 4 cm spacing is between - 18. 9 and - 17. 4 dB. The results of full-system characterizations of the WPT solution and the measurements data of the individually-fabricated grid antennas, harvester, transmitter, and all building blocks are reported. Programmability in the input polarities of the quad-core PA offers output power control and beam-steering capabilities to this 60 -GHz WPT system. A four-input <b>grid</b> <b>antenna</b> is designed for the TX which in simulation shows an effective 70 ° beam-steering range in the broadside direction. In order to demonstrate how the design and implementation of all the 60 -GHz circuitry has been as successful as they are, the design of the VCOs, quadrature VCOs, PAs, unit-cell devices, pads and calibration circuitry, passive components like inductors, transformers, capacitors, the patch antennas, and the grid array antennas that have been done before the final implementation of the full wireless power transfer system are presented as well and the key design points are specified and explained. The architecture study for the transmitter and the energy harvester are also included in this dissertation since they have been most vital parts of accomplishing the design of the highest transmit power delivery and highest rectenna power conversion efficiency in digital CMOS technology. The 60 -GHz WPT system designed for this work can serve miniature sized smart everyday-objects which require milliwatt-level power delivery and work in contact-less and close-proximity distances. The full-system measurement results of the proposed 60 -GHz wireless power transfer solution demonstrate the suitability of this mm-wave WPT system for addressing the demand for wireless power of batteryless and coil-free devices with stringent size constraints of new applications, like the IoT...|$|E

40|$|A {{new trend}} {{to develop the}} new assets of the modern High Voltage (HV) grid has been {{deployed}} {{on one of the}} major current investment projects of the Belgian Transmission System Operator (TSO) Elia. The new approach is a technique which is mapping the known, foreseeable and even unknown risks of a project. Starting from the impact of these risks on the installation, commissioning, operation, maintenance, emergency interventions, even decommissioning, the protection systems, lightning protection, electrical phenomena, each different topic will be treated to mitigate the corresponding risks within acceptable levels. One of the very first projects where this new approach is applied, is the STEVIN link. This link, named after Renaissance mathematician Simon Stevin from Bruges, is a necessary step to connect electrical power from almost all wind power plants in the Belgian Territorial waters and from the NEMO HVDC link (connection the Belgian and the English grid with a rating of 1000 MW) to the main 400 kV grid, which is situated some 50 km inland. Close to the coastal area, only a radial 150 kV grid actually exists, which is unable to absorb all the new announced offshore electrical power. The success of the wind integration program and the interconnector with the UK depends on the availability of this new <b>grid</b> <b>antenna.</b> The rating chosen for this new link is 3000 MVA, valid for any single contingency situation within this connection. This value corresponds to the highest transferred power stated by forecasting studies for wind energy production projected over 20 years in the future. The permitting procedure, with the visual impact and the generation of electro-magnetical fields of the link in particular, made the option to have the link using only overhead line technology impossible. Several options to have the link partly underground were researched, and the choice finally fell on the use of four parallel three-phase systems of 400 kV underground cable on the section closest to the historical of Bruges. As a consequence, reactive power compensation, by means of shunt reactors had to be integrated into the project. The paper presents for each part of the final structure of the mixed-structured Stevin Link the technical choices, related identified risks and their mitigation methods: for the overhead line parts, the underground cable sections, the technical choices and motivations for the link end and intermediate substations, ratings, functions and technical characteristics of the reactive power compensation devices. status: publishe...|$|E
