On returning to the dressing room he spoke about it to Stein, who then went out onto the pitch and <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fans to return all the balls.

25|$|At {{the start}} of the Grand Prix, Senna {{retained}} the lead from Schumacher, but proceedings soon became interrupted by a startline accident. JJ Lehto's Benetton-Ford had stalled and was hit by the Lotus-Mugen Honda of Pedro Lamy. A wheel and debris landed in the main grandstand, injuring eight fans and a police officer. The safety car, a sporty version of the Opel Vectra medium family saloon, was deployed for several laps. The Vectra's slow pace was later questioned because of the consequential drop in tyre pressures on the Formula One cars. Senna had pulled alongside the Vectra and <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> driver, Max Angelelli, to increase his speed. On lap 6, the race resumed and Senna immediately set a quick pace with the third-quickest lap of the race, followed by Schumacher.|$|E

25|$|Then, on lap 8, Pierluigi Martini {{spun off}} into the wall and his front wing, which {{separated}} from his car, was hit by Patrese and got stuck in Patrese's undertray. At the front, Mansell was no longer attacking Senna but Senna was unable to pull away. The conditions became better but after another seven laps, the weather started to become worse and more drivers began to spin off, including Mansell who smashed into a wall- which allowed McLaren to win the Constructors' Championship. Berger also spun off twice on the next lap as Senna <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marshals {{to try to get}} the race stopped. Patrese followed suit and finally it was stopped after Senna had finished lap 16. However, the officials had decided to count the results back 2 laps to lap 14 which meant that Senna won from Mansell, Berger, Piquet, Patrese and Morbidelli. Only half points were awarded because the race was stopped before 75% of the distance was over. This particular Grand Prix set a record (that still stands as of today) as the shortest Grand Prix ever run.|$|E

While fielding on the boundary during {{the second day of the}} second match, he <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee. He top-scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth, with 44 and 75, even as India surrendered to their second consecutive innings defeat. In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings; it was the only century scored by an Indian in the series. India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series, was described as [...] "the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists".|$|E
30|$|In sum, {{there is}} a range of {{possible}} reasons that might explain why <b>the</b> teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equation were detrimental for students’ learning in this study.

30|$|But, was the {{information}} in <b>the</b> teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equations actually more redundant than {{the information}} in <b>the</b> teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> graphs? Perhaps so. As noted above, the teacher's speech referred quite unambiguously <b>to</b> <b>the</b> digits in the equations (e.g., pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> “ 2 ” in the equation while saying “ 2 ”), and in this sense, her gestures were redundant with her speech. The information expressed in <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> graph was also redundant with speech (e.g., the teacher said, “we go over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2 on the x-axis” while tracing along the x-axis from <b>the</b> origin <b>to</b> (0, 2)). However, there are inherent differences in how verbal and visuospatial representations present information; Schnotz (2002) characterized this {{difference in terms of}} the distinction between descriptive representations (such as text or equations), which represent content via convention, and depictive representations (visual displays, such as diagrams or graphs), which represent content via common structural features that are either concrete or abstract. One potential consequence of these differences is that <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> visuospatial representations may be inherently less redundant with speech about those representations than are <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> symbolic representations that occur with speech about those representations. If this is <b>the</b> case, then <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> equations, by virtue of being more redundant with speech, should be more likely than <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> graphs to evoke extraneous processing that can be detrimental to performance.|$|R

30|$|The {{arguments}} {{discussed above}} offer {{a possible explanation}} for why <b>the</b> teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equations were not beneficial for student learning, but they cannot explain why <b>the</b> teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equations were actually detrimental for learning. What might account for the negative effect of the teacher's <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equations that we observed? One possibility is that the redundancy of information in the teacher’s gestures and speech actually interfered with learning, in accord with Mayer’s “redundancy principle” for multi-media learning (see, e.g., Mayer, Heiser & Lonn, 2001). According to this principle, redundant information can evoke extraneous processing and thereby tax learners’ working memory capacity. Indeed, we insured {{that all of the}} teacher’s gestures in this study were redundant with the accompanying speech because we {{wanted to be able to}} examine whether that speech (in the no-gesture condition) would effectively communicate about links on its own. However, this feature of our design, while allowing us strong experimental control, also created a situation in which gesture was always redundant. From the perspective of Mayer’s cognitive theory of multi-media learning (e.g., Mayer, 2014), the redundant gestures may have evoked extraneous processing without contributing relevant, new information.|$|R
