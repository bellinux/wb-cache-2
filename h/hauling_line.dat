50|$|The {{directional}} figure eight (a.k.a. inline figure-eight loop) is a loop knot. It is a knot {{that can}} be made on the bight. The loop must only be loaded in the correct direction or the knot may fail. It is useful on a <b>hauling</b> <b>line</b> to create loops {{that can be}} used as handholds.

50|$|Ideal {{mechanical}} advantage correlates directly with velocity ratio. The velocity ratio of a tackle is the ratio between {{the velocity of}} the <b>hauling</b> <b>line</b> {{to that of the}} hauled load. A line with a {{mechanical advantage}} of 4 has a velocity ratio of 4:1. In other words, to raise a load at 1 metre per second, the hauling part of the rope must be pulled at 4 metres per second. Therefore, the mechanical advantage of a double tackle is 4.|$|E

50|$|The knot {{is usually}} tied around a small weight, {{such as a}} stone, marble, tight fold of paper, grapeshot, {{or a piece of}} wood. A thicker line will require a larger object in the centre to hold the shape of the knot. Another {{variation}} of the monkey's fist knot omits the use of an internal object as a weight and rather uses the spare end which gets tucked back into the knot. This results in a nicer looking knot of a lesser weight, minimizing the potential danger of hurting someone with the knot when <b>hauling</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1902, a {{group of}} London, Ontario {{residents}} led by Thomas Purdom and Alfred E. Welch chartered an electric railway based in London. Unlike the municipally-owned London and Port Stanley Railway, the South Western Traction Company was chartered primarily as a passenger <b>hauling</b> <b>line.</b> Lines were planned to several other municipalities in the area, but ultimately, the line was a 28-mile meandering route between London and Port Stanley. The line began construction in 1903 southward from London to Lambeth. Construction stopped in 1904 when the company ran out of funds but resumed after additional capital was secured from the Canadian Electric Traction Company, {{a joint venture between}} Canadian and British investors. The generating equipment and rolling stock were supplied by Bruce Peebles & Co. Ltd. of Edinburgh, Scotland. The equipment on the South Western Traction Company used a Three phase AC electric overhead traction system designed by Ganz of Budapest, Hungary. The new traction line and was the only railroad in North America to use this system.|$|E
50|$|Earliest form {{of public}} transit serving the Baden area {{was a line}} of horse-drawn omnibuses, which ran down Broadway to East Grand Avenue. Fred Kraft and Jacob Bittner started it during the first St. Louis Fair in 1856. A similar line ran on Broadway from Third and Market Street to Breman, {{beginning}} in 1845, operated by Erastus Wells and Calvin Case. This line was later extended to Bissell's Point. In 1870, Case purchased the Baden line and converted it into a horse car line by laying a single track from the market house in Baden to Gano Avenue. The horse walked on a plank walk {{in the center of}} the track and passengers sometimes had to help put the car back upon the rails. Three open sided cars were used, which had canvas curtains for use in bad weather. Baden and St. Louis Railroad Company later became a division of the St. Louis Railroad Company with offices at 3700 North Broadway. This company operated a cable line on Broadway from East Grand south to Keokuk Street. All divisions of this company were electrified during the 1890s and were absorbed by the United Railways Company in the transit consolidation of 1899. Since August 1956, buses have replaced streetcars on the Broadway line. The water division operated an electric trolley line from Baden to Chain of Rocks for many years. It is now a freight <b>hauling</b> <b>line</b> with a connection to the Burlington Railroad.|$|E

40|$|Heavy <b>haul</b> railway <b>lines</b> are {{important}} and expensive items of infrastructure operating in an environment which is increasingly focussed on risk-based management and constrained profit margins. It is vital that costs are minimised but also that infrastructure satisfies failure criteria and standards of reliability which account for the random nature of wheel-rail forces and of {{the properties of the}} materials in the track. In Australia and the USA, concrete railway sleepers/ties are still designed using methods which the rest of the civil engineering world discarded decades ago in favour of the more rational, more economical and probabilistically based, limit states design (LSD) concept. This paper describes a LSD method for concrete sleepers which is based on (a) billions of measurements over many years of the real, random wheel-rail forces on heavy <b>haul</b> <b>lines,</b> and (b) the true capacity of sleepers. The essential principles on which the new method is based are similar to current, widely used LSD-based standards for concrete structures. The paper proposes and describes four limit states which a sleeper must satisfy, namely: strength; operations; serviceability; and fatigue. The method has been applied commercially to two new major heavy <b>haul</b> <b>lines</b> in Australia, where it has saved clients millions of dollars in capital expenditure...|$|R
40|$|Rail curve Lubrication {{is widely}} used to enhance below rail and above rail assets life, reduce rail/wheel {{maintenance}} and replacement costs. There are various types of applicators and greases used by rail industries. This includes mechanical, hydraulic, electrical actuators/ pumps, short and long bars and various types of grease. There is wide variation of performance of the wear levels for rails and wheels across the industry for similar operational, track and rolling stock characteristics. There {{is a need for}} best practice in rail curve lubrication. To establish lubrication best practice extensive field and lab tests of lubricators and greases are essential. Evaluation of latest technology equipment, their placement, optimal settings of grease application rate, reduced wastage, and quality are essential to achieve this. The research on Australian heavy <b>haul</b> <b>lines</b> in this area has been limited. This paper considers the effectiveness of the lubrication equipments, the length of lubricator bars, the bar location of lubricators in tangent track and the spirals of curved track and the different types of grease along with effectiveness of remote performance monitoring in heavy <b>haul</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Rail and wheel wear is {{a complex}} problem. Lubrication plays an {{important}} role in reducing wear and enhancing asset life. Curves and switches are the areas of major challenges. Tight curves when running dry shows wear rates higher to rapid wear, increased maintenance costs and non-availability of track due to maintenance or replacement. The economic analysis based on cut-off radius, lubricants and applicators takes a very long time using field data. Rail operators often face difficulties when selecting lubricants. Lubricant manufactures use different test standards when specifying lubricant properties. Four-ball test fails to give a meaningful indication of lubricant performance. The result is often a complex decision problem in ranking different lubricants under a particular axel load. An appropriate selection of lubricant for a particular rail application can give financial returns and extension of asset life. An experimental set up has been proposed in this paper. The experimental results are expected to be used for development of models on effective lubrication. This paper proposes experimental setups and methodology for analysis of lubrication effectiveness in heavy <b>haul</b> <b>lines.</b> Theories along with existing research to date relating to ranking of lubricants for rail applications and a criterion for the ranking is discussed. An analysis is carried out to compare lubricants used in Australian Heavy <b>Haul</b> <b>lines</b> based on manufacturer supplied specifications and experimental results...|$|R
