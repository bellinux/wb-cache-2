40|$|Abstract: Objective. To {{assess the}} {{theoretical}} and practical knowledge of health care providers (HCPs) {{in relation to the}} use of metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) and spacer devices. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, among 52 HCPs using a stratified random sampling technique. A questionnaire was used to assess theoretical knowledge; practical knowledge was assessed by direct <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> the use of an MDI and a spacer device. Results. Among the participants, 57 % were female. The majority provided education to their patients (92 %). Of the HCPs, 36. 5 % completed the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> holding the spacer with a mask and MDI together and then shaking well 4 to 5 times, 78. 8 % completed the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> cap removal, 15. 4 % completed the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> checking for any foreign body in the spacer, 78. 8 % completed the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> holding the device properly, 69. 2 % completed the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> inhaling slowly and deeply, 55. 8 % completed the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> maintaining the seal for 5 to 6 breaths after the MDI is pressed, 26. 9 % completed the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> “if more puffs of medication are prescribed, complete these puffs, ” and 25 % completed the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> washing the spacer with warm soapy water. The overall scores were good (16. 6 %), fair (44. 4 %), and poor (39 %). Conclusion. Most of the HCPs in this study lacked basic knowledge and skills regarding the proper way to instruct their patients to use MDIs and spacer devices. There is a need to establish continuing education programs for HCPs about asthma inhaler knowledge and technique...|$|R

5|$|Renaissance art marks a {{cultural}} rebirth {{at the close}} of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.|$|E
5|$|The Rice Museum {{offers a}} variety of public programs, {{including}} hands-on classes for children where participants make necklaces out of rocks.

The museum offers tours for school groups and other youth programs, often handling multiple groups each day. Children in the school tours get to select a stone to take home from a pile outside.

5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. <b>Demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Byte {{magazine}} {{published an}} assembly language version of Spacewar in 1977 that {{ran on the}} Altair 8800 and other Intel 8080-based microcomputers using an oscilloscope as the graphical display and a lookup table for orbits, {{as well as a}} three-dimensional variant in 1979 written in Tiny BASIC. More modern recreations of the game for computers have been made as well. An emulated version of the original game, based on the original source code made publicly available by Martin Graetz and running in a JavaScript PDP-1 emulator, was made available to play on the internet in 2012. The only working PDP-1s that are known to exist are kept in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, where <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> the machine are held, which include playing Spacewar.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was known}} for his public <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> piety, and appears to have been {{genuinely}} devout. He promoted rich, luxurious Church services, and, unusually for the period, attended mass at least once a day. He gave generously to religious causes, paid for the feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans. He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have washed the feet of lepers. Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, particularly to the abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{video game}} website GameSpot {{reported}} that Duke Nukem Forever had {{switched to the}} Doom 3 engine. Many gaming news sites mailed Broussard, asking him to confirm or deny the rumor.

Soon after 3D Realms replaced the game's Karma physics system with one designed by Meqon, a relatively unknown Swedish firm. Closed-doors <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> the technology suggested that the physics of Duke Nukem Forever would be a step up from the critically acclaimed Half-Life 2. Rumors suggested that the game would appear at 2005 E3. While 3D Realms' previously canceled Prey made an appearance, the rumors of Duke Nukem Forevers appearance proved false.|$|E
5|$|Monster {{was founded}} in 1979 by Noel Lee as Monster Cable Products. Lee, an audiophile and engineer, was experimenting with {{different}} copper qualities, wire constructs and winding methods of audio cables in his family's garage and comparing them while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. He became convinced that audio cables could be engineered to improve audio quality by conducting electricity more efficiently. Using a borrowed portion of somebody's booth at the 1978 Consumer Electronics Show, he did <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> his cables in comparison to standard wires. After a positive reception at CES, he quit his job at Lawrence Berkeley Lab and started Monster Cable Products with $250,000 in bank financing. Monster's first cables were manufactured by Lee by hand and sold door-to-door.|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{synthesized}} many three-dimensional DNA complexes {{that each}} have the connectivity of a polyhedron, {{such as a}} cube or octahedron, meaning that the DNA duplexes trace the edges of a polyhedron with a DNA junction at each vertex. The earliest <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> DNA polyhedra were very work-intensive, requiring multiple ligations and solid-phase synthesis steps to create catenated polyhedra. Subsequent work yielded polyhedra whose synthesis was much easier. These include a DNA octahedron made from a long single strand designed to fold into the correct conformation, and a tetrahedron that can be produced from four DNA strands in one step, pictured {{at the top of}} this article.|$|E
