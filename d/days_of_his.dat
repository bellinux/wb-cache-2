George is losing his sight to cytomegalovirus and {{is taking a}} drug that is manufactured by a company that, {{as a member of}} ACT UP, George is protesting. George struggles through the film to resolve his conflicted feelings over this, his guilt over abandoning Zero during the final <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> illness and his fear that the same thing will happen to him.|$|E

50|$|Leudwinus' {{original}} feast day was September 29, the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death. As this is {{also the}} feast <b>day</b> <b>of</b> Saint Michael the Archangel, after the Second Vatican Council the Feast of Saint Leudwinus was moved to September 23. It is also the feast <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> uncle, Saint Basinus.|$|R
5|$|Clement IX had {{primarily}} named Italian cardinals to the college, only appointing one French and one Spanish cardinal when {{he needed}} their assistance to fight back an invasion by the Ottoman Empire in Crete. He created his friends cardinals, with seven of the twelve that he created coming from his native Tuscany. Clement did not feel obligated to appoint a German cardinal because the Holy Roman Emperor had requested his assistance in Hungary. Within <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death Clement IX had created seven additional cardinals, which brought the number of potential electors to its maximum number of seventy.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1921, Howe was vacationing {{with the}} Roosevelts at Campobello Island when Franklin {{began to run}} a high fever and {{reported}} paralysis in his legs. A doctor was sent for, and Roosevelt was diagnosed with poliomyelitis. Howe remained by Roosevelt's bedside throughout the early <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> illness, cheering him up, tending to his needs, and even changing his bedpans. By September of that year, Howe had been formally {{invited to join the}} Roosevelt household, and began visiting his own family only on weekends.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> administration, Leggett {{took the lead}} {{on a number of}} {{controversial}} issues. To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, he proposed a statewide gas tax increase, a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, which happened {{in the midst of a}} state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> presidency, De la Rúa sent {{a bill to}} the Congress to request a federal {{intervention}} in Corrientes Province.

The intervenor selected for the work was Ramón Mestre.|$|E
5|$|Kala Capital owned 45 {{percent of}} the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company company SakHidroEnergoMsheni, a joint stock company {{incorporated}} in Georgia in 1998. His candidacy as Minister of Energy and Natural Resources in October 2012 was therefore overshadowed by concerns about a serious risk that a conflict of interests might arise. Reports {{on the same day}} indicated that Kaladze might refuse the energy portfolio or sell off his shares in Georgia Hydropower Construction Company within 10 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> appointment.|$|E
5|$|Unusually for an English {{painting}} of the period in its representation of a queen of an African country the group of Cleopatra's attendants includes both dark- and light-skinned figures shown on equal terms and with equal prominence. From the earliest <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career Etty had been interested in depicting variations in skin colour, and The Missionary Boy, believed to be his oldest significant surviving painting, shows a dark-skinned child.|$|E

5|$|Abu Bakar assumed {{office as}} the Temenggong of Johor within three <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's demise. At {{the time of}} his succession, Johor was facing a {{political}} threat from the deposed Sultan, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah. The Sultan was pursuing his sovereignty claims over Johor and Pahang and aimed to overthrow the Sultan of Terengganu with the backing of Siam. Mahmud Muzaffar Shah established an alliance with Tun Ahmad, half-brother and rival of the Bendahara Tun Koris. The alliance caused Abu Bakar concern that the fall of Tun Koris in Pahang would threaten his own political position in Johor. Abu Bakar signed a treaty of friendship with Tun Koris in June 1862, and sent a small expeditionary force to Pahang to support Tun Koris when war broke out in August 1862.|$|E
5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{became a}} Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, with his {{appointment}} as Chaplain in 1946, and in 1950 {{advanced to the}} position of Dean. His rising academic reputation was confirmed in 1953 with the publication of a project which had occupied him since the <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> curacy—his new translation of Origen's Contra Celsum, with introduction and notes. He had by now made himself an expert in Patristic Greek; only an inexactness in philology marking his earlier abandonment of Greek for music. Also in 1953 he was appointed co-editor (with Hedley Sparks) of the Journal of Theological Studies and continued editing it until 1985. He held the university appointment of Hulsean Lecturer from 1954–6.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> administration, Harrison {{dealt with the}} issue of Hawaiian annexation. Following a coup d'état against Queen Liliuokalani, the new {{government}} of Hawaii led by Sanford Dole petitioned for annexation by the United States. Harrison was interested in expanding American influence in Hawaii and in establishing a naval base at Pearl Harbor but had not previously expressed an opinion on annexing the islands. The United States consul in Hawaii John L. Stevens recognized the new government on February 1, 1893 and forwarded their proposals to Washington. With just one month left before leaving office, the administration signed a treaty on February 14 and submitted it to the Senate the next day with Harrison's recommendation. The Senate failed to act, and President Cleveland withdrew the treaty shortly after taking office.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January 2008 {{during the}} 4th and final Test of the 2007–08 series against India, Gilchrist {{announced}} that he would retire from international cricket {{at the end of the}} season. A back injury kept Ricky Ponting off the field for sections of the Indian's second innings, resulting in Gilchrist captaining the team for the part of final two <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Test cricket career. India batted out the match for a draw, so Gilchrist's 14 in the first innings was his final Test innings; he took his 379th and final catch when Virender Sehwag was caught behind. Gilchrist had scored only 150 runs at 21.42 in his final Test series.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August, Smith joined Queens Park Rangers on {{an initial}} three-month loan deal. His move was made {{permanent}} in January 2011, with Smith having agreed a three-year deal {{for a fee}} of around £1.5 million. Smith provided the assist for Heiðar Helguson in a 2–1 win against Crystal Palace on 2 October and has since made many positive contributions to the QPR team but found starts {{hard to come by}} in the early <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Rangers career. He scored his first goal for the club against Reading on 6 November, and also netted a late equaliser in a 1–1 draw with former club Portsmouth three days later, scoring a last-minute penalty to earn QPR a point and keep their unbeaten start to the season intact. On 20 August 2011, he scored his and QPR's first goal of the 2011–12 Premier League season, in a 1–0 away win against Everton.|$|E

5|$|Stanley {{acted upon}} a remark made {{by his father}} in 1854 about the high cost and poor quality of English drawing {{instruments}} compared to those imported from France and Switzerland, and started a business making mathematical and drawing instruments. At first he rented a shop and parlour at 3 Great Turnstile, Holborn, and began the business with £100 capital. He invented a new T-square which improved the standard one and became universally used. A cousin, Henry Robinson, joined him with a capital of £150, but died in 1859. Stanley stopped using the name Robinson and changed his signature {{as a consequence of}} being robbed of his cheque book during the early <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> business.|$|E
5|$|The detainee {{is also to}} be {{informed}} within 14 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> or her right to make representations against the order to an advisory board, which is required to hear and consider the detainee's representations. Each advisory board is chaired by a Supreme Court judge appointed by the President, and has two other members appointed by the President {{in consultation with the}} Chief Justice. The board has the powers of a court to summon and examine witnesses, and to order that documents be produced. It evaluates the evidence and must make recommendations to the President concerning the matter within three months of the date of detention. When the advisory board recommends the release of the detainee against the Minister's decision, the President exercises personal discretion whether the detainee should be released. Before exercising his discretion, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of middle-class and educated Khmers had grown {{weary of the}} prince and welcomed the change of government. They were joined by the military, for whom {{the prospect of the}} return of American military and financial aid was a cause for celebration. Within <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> deposition, Sihanouk, now in Beijing, broadcast an appeal to the people to resist the usurpers. Demonstrations and riots occurred (mainly in areas contiguous to PAVN/Viet Cong controlled areas), but no nationwide groundswell threatened the government. In one incident at Kampong Cham on 29 March, however, an enraged crowd killed Lon Nol's brother, Lon Nil, tore out his liver, and cooked and ate it. An estimated 40,000 peasants then began to march on the capital to demand Sihanouk's reinstatement. They were dispersed, with many casualties, by contingents of the armed forces.|$|E
