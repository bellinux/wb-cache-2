50|$|Every {{state in}} the United States is {{responsible}} <b>for</b> providing <b>disposal</b> <b>for</b> any of the LLW that is generated within its borders.

Requirements <b>for</b> LLW <b>disposal</b> sites have been established by the NRC and use a series of natural and engineered barriers to prevent any radioactive waste from escaping into the environment. Currently, the United States has four low-level waste disposal facilities that accept various levels of LLW, all are located in agreement states.|$|R

This procedure, nuclear transmutation, while well documented for other elements, is still being developed for curium.|$|E
