A temperature-sensitive thin-film Fabry-Perot interferometer can be deposited directly onto the end of a multimode optical fiber. This batch-fabricatable sensor can be manufactured at a much lower cost than can a presently available sensor, which requires the mechanical attachment of a Fabry-Perot interferometer to a fiber.

Pepsin digestion of formaldehyde-fixed tissues removed the membranes and matrices of mitochondria, but a pepsin-resistant fibrous material remained which was heavily stained by uranyl and lead ions. Experiments on a DNA "model system" showed that DNA treated with osmium tetroxide can be depolymerized by deoxyribonuclease. Zinc ions strongly inhibited the depolymerization of DNA. Digestion of osmium tetroxide-fixed tissues (fixed only briefly) with deoxyribonuclease for 1 hour greatly reduced the Feulgen staining of the nuclei, and after 4 hours the Feulgen reaction was completely abolished.

40|$|Nonlinearly {{generated}} broadband ultrafast laser {{have been}} increasingly utilized in many applications. However, traditional techniques of characterizing these sources lack {{the ability to}} observe the instantaneous features and transitory behaviours of both amplitude and phase. With {{the advent of the}} optical time stretch techniques, the instantaneous shotto- shot spectral intensity can be directly measured continuously at an unprecedentedly high speed. Meanwhile, the information of the real-time phase variation, which is carried by the frequency-time mapped spectral signal has yet been fully explored. We present a technique of experimentally measuring the spectral coherence dynamics of broadband pulsed sources. Our method relies on a delayed Young's type interferometer combined with optical time-stretch. We perform the proof-of-principle demonstrations of spectral coherence dynamics measurement on two sources: a supercontinuum source and a <b>fiber</b> ring <b>buffered</b> cavity source, both with a repetition rate of MHz. By employing the optical time stretch with a dispersive fiber, we directly map the spectral interference fringes of the delayed neighbouring pulses and obtain a sufficiently large ensemble of spectral interferograms with a real-time oscilloscope (80 Gb/s sampling rate). This enables us to directly quantify the spectral coherence dynamics of the ultrafast sources with a temporal resolution down to microseconds. Having the ensemble of single-shot interferograms, we also further calculate the cross spectral coherence correlation matrices of these ultrafast sources. We anticipate that our technique provides a general approach for experimentally evaluating the spectral coherence dynamics of ultrafast laser generated by the nonlinear processes e. g. modulation instability, supercontinuum generation, and Kerr resonator. © 2016 SPIE...|$|R

Wide angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD) experiments on the crimped fibers exhibit little difference in the crystal structure of IPS and Tencel lyocell fibers: both fibers reveal a cellulose II structure. However, the IPS lyocell fibers have a lower tensile modulus than Tencel by about 12. 5 %, although they have a similar tensile strength. Wetting and subsequent drying shift the loss tangent values higher, which is more remarkable for the IPS lyocell fibers dried under tension. Further, the IPS lyocell fibers dried under tension have a sharper α-transition peak than the fibers dried without tension. The IPS lyocell fibers exhibit excellent wet tensile strength: 90 % of tensile strength is retained after wetting twice in distilled water. In addition, the IPS lyocell fibers show good chemical stability to acids and alkalis, except for an extremely strong alkali-pH 14.

Examples described are: demultiplexer, decision gate for data regeneration, and noise suppression in a <b>fiber</b> ring optical <b>buffer.</b> The properties of the SLALOM depend not on the fiber nonlinearity but on the nonlinearity of the SLA together with the interferometer operation of the fiber loop.

Because the nonlinear effect in the SLALOM is confined to a length of some 100 mu m, the SLALOM can be very compact and an integration of the SLALOM (SLA, coupler and waveguide) on a chip seems to be possible. In most of the applications the operation speed of the SLALOM appears to be limited by the gain recovery time of the SLA to a few GHz.

Enhanced porosity was found only for fibers with lower PbO content in the spinning sol or for fibers sintered with PbZrO 3 /ZrO 2 or PbZrO 3 buffer, respectively. The densification of PbO-deficient fiber batches is dominated by solid state sintering, while liquid phase sintering is promoted by excess PbO in the system.

40|$|Abstract—Motivated by the {{difficulty}} of implementing optical packet switches having large optical buffers, we propose a new, simple, and effective way of applying electronic traffic smoothing {{at the edge of}} an optical packet switched network to reduce core optical buffering requirements. A single class of service is assumed. Incoming traffic that is destined for a particular egress edge router is smoothed at each ingress edge router by a buffer scheduling algorithm and decomposed into several constant bit rate subflows, each with a uniform packet interarrival time. Each such subflow emerging from a core switch also retains these traffic characteristics. The rates of these subflows obey a simple mathematical relationship, and it is shown that, with the appropriate queuing strategy, this substantially reduces the core buffering requirements. Indeed, it is shown through analysis and simulation that scalability is improved over existing approaches, and computation is simplified. The proposal in this paper requires much less core buffering than one without smoothing, while compared with other smoothing proposals, it is more scalable both to large networks and a large number of smoothed flows. A condition on the <b>fiber</b> delay line <b>buffer</b> depth requirements is also derived for no packet loss to take place in any of the scenarios modeled in this paper. Furthermore, it is confirmed through simulation that packet jitter is not generated in the network core.

40|$|Cerato-platanin (CP) is {{a protein}} {{elicitor}} produced by Ceratocystis platani, the causal agent of canker stain of plane tree. The eliciting activity of CP {{has been extensively}} studied, and {{in accordance with the}} “zig-zag model” described by Jones and Dangl (2006), CP may be considered a PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular pattern). However, the primary role of CP and of all the other proteins of the “cerato-platanin family” in fungi is unknown. CP is both a structural component of the cell wall of C. platani and a protein secreted in the medium where the fungus grows. No lytic activity has ever been reported. Recently, by studying the three-dimensional structure of the protein and the pattern of gene expression, a clue on its role has been found: CP could act in the remodelling and enlargement of the cell wall during hyphal growth and in the formation of chlamydospores, with a role like that of expansins. In the present work, the expansinlike activity of CP was investigated. Like expansins, CP was able to disrupt filter paper in a concentration-dependent manner and to cause fragmentation of the crystalline cellulose Avicel.

The tensile moduli, ultimate strengths, and elongations of the fibers did not exhibit significant changes in 35 weeks of degradation but PLLA fibers with a smaller diameter of 113 μm showed significant decreases in their ultimate strengths with respect to the initial value after 35 - 45 weeks of degradation. Microcracks appeared on part of the fiber surfaces, which might ultimately lead to the decrease of the mechanical strength of the PLLA fibers.

40|$|Distributed sensing {{refers to}} the {{solution}} which enables the real-time, continuous measurement at multiple sensing locations (typically, more than 100 sensing nodes). Due to many of its unique advantages, such as small size, light weight, low cost, electromagnetic immunity, high-temperature survivability, and chemical stability, optical fibers have been well accepted {{as one of the}} most promising candidates as the platform for distributed sensing applications. ^ Among different fiber distributed sensing methods, optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) represents a particular promising candidate. Based on the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) method, OFDR method is capable of measuring the spatial-continuous weak Rayleigh scattering patterns along the entire length of the fiber under test, with high spatial resolution (~μm) level and moderate interrogation distance (~ km). To extract the structural information from the unmodified communication grade single mode fiber, large interrogation bandwidth is needed. However, this resource of optical bandwidth is very expensive. The external cavity laser is the state-of-the-art frequency sweep laser source for OFDR system, which costs at least $ 20, 000. The cost has rendered the OFDR interrogation technique expensive and limits its applications. ^ This dissertation focused on the improvement of OFDR interrogation system by reducing the total system cost. First, a series of sub-terahertz range fiber sensors, including Fabry-Perot cavity sensors and terahertz fiber grating sensors were symmetrically investigated. Fabricated using femtosecond laser micromachining techniques, these sensors allow the OFDR system for low bandwidth interrogation while maintaining the high accuracy measurement. In addition, a sensor fabrication method without stripping the <b>fiber</b> polymer <b>buffer</b> was developed. This is the first time that an in-line grating structure has been fabricated within the core of an optical fiber with an intact buffer coating, allowing the fiber to retain optimal mechanical properties. ^ Second, a series of low cost sweep laser sources were developed as high-linear coherent sweep laser source, suitable for the sub-terahertz range fiber sensor interrogation. Based on current injection modulation methods, the semiconductor lasers were used as the sweep laser sources and the output wavelength was feedback controlled using optical phase locked loop techniques. The method of using VCSEL laser was also investigated to increase the sweep bandwidth. In addition, an all-digital optical phase locked loop system was implemented using the field programmable logic array, which increases the system design flexibility. ...|$|R
40|$|New {{methods for}} {{creating}} theranostic systems with simultaneous encapsulation of therapeutic, diagnostic, and targeting agents are much sought after. This work reports {{for the first}} time the use of coaxial electrospinning to prepare such systems in the form of core–shell fibers. Eudragit S 100 was used to form the shell of the fibers, while the core comprised poly(ethylene oxide) loaded with the magnetic resonance contrast agent Gd(DTPA) (Gd(III) diethylenetriaminepentaacetate hydrate) and indomethacin as a model therapeutic agent. The fibers had linear cylindrical morphologies with clear core–shell structures, as demonstrated by electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry proved that both indomethacin and Gd(DTPA) were present in the fibers in the amorphous physical form. This is thought to be a result of intermolecular interactions between the different components, the presence of which was suggested by infrared spectroscopy. In vitro dissolution tests indicated that the fibers could provide targeted release of the active ingredients through a combined mechanism of erosion and diffusion. The proton relaxivities for Gd(DTPA) released from the <b>fibers</b> into tris <b>buffer</b> increased (r 1 = 4. 79 – 9. 75 s– 1 mM– 1; r 2 = 7. 98 – 14. 22 s– 1 mM– 1) compared with fresh Gd(DTPA) (r 1 = 4. 13 s– 1 mM– 1 and r 2 = 4. 40 s– 1 mM– 1), which proved that electrospinning has not diminished the contrast properties of the complex.

The convolutional coding is proposed to be implemented in the multi-hop optical networks in order to improve the BER/PER performances. Results with convolutional coding show that there is a considerable improvement in network performance due to {{an increase in the number}} of traversable hops from a given transmitter power at a given BER/PER.

Defined aliquots of dissolution medium are withdrawn at predefined time points, and the dissolved drug is quantified. However, {{this procedure is}} associated with several drawbacks. The method is not automated, and as such requires manual sampling, which potentially leads to inaccuracies particularly in frequent sampling intervals as required for characterization of rapid drug release. Further, the sheet-like fiber mats tend to partially fold upon contact with the dissolution medium, which may potentially affect the release kinetics and reproducibility of the acquired release data. In this study, we investigated {{the application of a}} fully automated fiber-optics based dissolution testing system for in situ monitoring of drug release from electrospun fiber mats. Electrospun poly (vinyl alcohol) fibers loaded with lysozyme were used as a model system. To prevent folding of the fiber mats and ensure a fixed position in the dissolution vessel throughout the experiment, a flexible adapter was developed to allow for the attachment of the fiber mats to the vessel walls. Lysozyme release from the fiber mats was compared with the release from cast films with the same composition. Even though the release processes were rather fast and differences in release kinetics of the two systems were marginal, the fiber-optics based dissolution setup allowed for the successful detection of released protein in both cases. The present study, therefore, highlights the potential for the utilization of fully automated fiber-optics based dissolution testing systems for advanced in situ monitoring of drug release from electrospun fibers...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the design, manufacture, {{and performance of}} bare-fiber integral field units (IFUs) for the SDSS-IV survey MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO) on the the Sloan 2. 5 m telescope at Apache Point Observatory (APO). MaNGA is a luminosity-selected integral-field spectroscopic survey of 10, 000 local galaxies covering 360 - 1030 nm at R ~ 2200. The IFUs have hexagonal dense packing of fibers with packing regularity of 3 um (RMS), and throughput of 96 +/- 0. 5 % from 350 nm to 1 um in the lab. Their sizes range from 19 to 127 fibers (3 - 7 hexagonal layers) using Polymicro FBP 120 : 132 : 150 um core:clad:buffer fibers to reach a fill fraction of 56 %. High throughput (and low focal-ratio degradation) is achieved by maintaining the <b>fiber</b> cladding and <b>buffer</b> intact, ensuring excellent surface polish, and applying a multi-layer AR coating of the input and output surfaces. In operations on-sky, the IFUs show only an additional 2. 3 % FRD-related variability in throughput despite repeated mechanical stressing during plate plugging (however other losses are present). The IFUs achieve on-sky throughput 5 % above the single-fiber feeds used in SDSS-III/BOSS, attributable to equivalent performance compared to single fibers and additional gains from the AR coating. The manufacturing process is geared toward mass-production of high-multiplex systems. The low-stress process involves a precision ferrule with hexagonal inner shape designed to lead inserted fibers to settle in a dense hexagonal pattern. The ferrule inner diameter is tapered at progressively shallower angles toward its tip and the final 2 mm are straight {{and only a few}} um larger than necessary to hold the desired number of fibers. This process scales to accommodate other fiber sizes and to IFUs with substantially larger fiber count. (Abridged) Comment: 23 pages, 30 figures, AJ accepte...|$|R
40|$|Isometric tension {{responses}} to rapid temperature jumps (T-jumps) of 3 - 7 degrees C {{were examined in}} single skinned fibers isolated from rabbit psoas (fast) and soleus (slow) muscles. T-jumps were induced by an infrared laser pulse (wavelength 1. 32 microns, pulse duration 0. 2 ms) obtained from a Nd-YAG laser, which heated the <b>fiber</b> and bathing <b>buffer</b> solution in a 50 -microliter trough. After a T-jump, the temperature near the fiber remained constant for approximately 0. 5 s, and the temperature could be clamped for longer periods by means of Peltier units assembled on the back trough wall. A T-jump produced a step decrease in tension in both fast and slow muscle fibers in rigor, indicating thermal expansion. In maximally Ca-activated (pCa approximately 4) fibers, the increase of steady tension with heating (3 - 35 degrees C) was approximately sigmoidal, and a T-jump at any temperature induced a more complex tension transient than in rigor fibers. An initial (small amplitude) step decrease in tension followed by a rapid recovery (tau(1); see Davis and Harrington, 1993) was seen in some records from both fiber types, which presumably was an indirect consequence of thermal expansion. The net rise in tension after a T-jump was biexponential, and its time course was characteristically different in the two fibers. At approximately 12 degrees C the reciprocal time constants for the two exponential components (tau(2) and tau(3), respectively, were approximately 70. s(- 1) and approximately 15. s(- 1) in fast fibers and approximately 20. s(- 1) and approximately 3. s(- 1) in slow fibers. In both fibers, tau(2) ("endothermic force regeneration") became faster {{with an increase in}} temperature. Furthermore, tau(3) was temperature sensitive in slow fibers but not in fast fibers. The results are compared and contrasted with previous findings from T-jump experiments on fast fibers. It is observed that the fast/slow fiber difference in the rate of endothermic force generation (three- to fourfold) is considerably smaller than the reported differences in the "phosphate release steps" (> 30 -fold) ...|$|R
