5|$|Courses on {{this subject}} have grown {{significantly}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> decades. Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, {{as well as other}} mediums. Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way. In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, Israel Gelfer (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) {{said that the}} issue of anti-cheating became important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years, with the development of telecommunication technologies (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against cheaters {{and at the same time}} not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world. The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30–40 checks during the round; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.|$|E

25|$|The disease {{model has}} been mainly used in regards to therapy, however the {{incorporation}} of forgiveness into therapy has been lacking, and has been slowly gaining popularity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> decades. More recent research has shown how the growth of forgiveness in psychology {{has given rise to}} the study of forgiveness interventions.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> decades, {{there has}} been a growing {{movement}} to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of cultural, gender, spiritual, and sexual-orientation issues. Clinical psychologists are beginning to look at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as neuroscience, behavioral genetics, evolutionary biology, and psychopharmacology. The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem.|$|E
25|$|Spinal cord {{stimulation}} {{has been}} studied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years. In a long case study, 8 patients were given spinal cord stimulation via insertion of a percutaneous lead at the appropriate level of the cervical or thoracic spine. Between 36 and 149 months after the stimulations, the patients were interviewed. 6 of the 8 had received initial pain relief, and three experienced long-term pain relief. Spinal cord stimulation is cheaper than brain stimulation and less invasive, and is thus a more promising option for pain treatment.|$|E

In 2013, the governments of Kenya and Somalia also signed a tripartite agreement facilitating the repatriation of refugees from Somalia. The UNHCR and the IOM offer assistance to refugees who want to return voluntarily to their home countries. Many developed countries also have Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) programmes for asylum seekers who want to go back or were refused asylum.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Business Directory {{states that}} the Bihar Sugar Industry has flourished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years due to the efforts taken by the state {{government}} to revive the industry. The Sugar Industry has been helped by the climate of the state, which is very suitable {{for the growth of}} high-grade sugarcane. The main benefit of the industry is that it provides employment to many people, especially in the rural areas. Further, it provides facilities of transport and communication, and also helps {{in the development of the}} rural areas by mobilizing the rural resources. The total number of sugar mills in Bihar Sugar Industry is 28 out which only 9 are operational. The total area under sugarcane production is 2.30 lakh hectares and the total production of sugarcane is around 129.95 lakh M.T. The location of the sugar mills of Bihar Sugar Industry are Samastipur, Gopalganj, Sitamarhi, West Champaran, Chorma, Dulipati, and Supaul.|$|E
25|$|After 14 {{golden years}} at Werder Bremen, Rehhagel left to manage former hated rivals, Bayern Munich, {{before the start}} of the 1995–96 season. Prior to Rehhagel's arrival, Bayern had a disappointing, but financially lucrative season in 1994–95 (a very poor sixth place in the Bundesliga, but semi-finals in the Champions League). In the summer of 1995, Bayern spent a lot of money, buying Jürgen Klinsmann, Andreas Herzog, and others, and Rehhagel was brought in as manager to replace Giovanni Trapattoni. It was widely {{expected}} that Munich would steamroll the opposition in 1995–96, but from Day 1, Rehhagel clashed with the team and the team environment. His single-minded and occasionally eccentric ways did not mesh at all with Bayern, who quickly felt that Rehhagel was too rural at heart and had no clue about how to interact in the fancy environment of Munich. Moreover, Rehhagel's old-school tactics and patronising of the Bayern players caused major antipathy in the Bayern team, especially from Klinsmann, who never missed an opportunity to take shots at Rehhagel. Despite Rehhagel getting Bayern to the UEFA Cup final, Bayern's results in the Bundesliga dropped alarmingly in the second half of the season, and Rehhagel was famously sacked just 4 days before they were due to play in the first leg of the 1996 UEFA Cup final. Rehhagel's job was taken over by Franz Beckenbauer, who led the team to victory in the 1996 UEFA Cup final, and oversaw an upturn in form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks in the Bundesliga, but Bayern finished second, as Borussia Dortmund won their second German championship in a row.|$|E

[...] That same year, {{she made her}} film debut in She-Devil, playing Ruth. Film critic Roger Ebert gave her a positive review saying, [...] "Barr could have made an easy, predictable and dumb comedy at any point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years. Instead, she took her chances with an ambitious project – a real movie. It pays off, in that Barr demonstrates {{that there is a}} core of reality inside her TV persona, a core of identifiable human feelings like jealousy and pride, and they provide a sound foundation for her comic acting".|$|E
500|$|... "Fall Down" [...] {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} music critics, who were disappointed with its overall production. Writing for AllMusic, Fred Thomas was displeased that featuring [...] "big gun" [...] Cyrus still {{resulted in a}} [...] "manufactured disposable pop moment", and further elaborated that the song felt like one of #willpowers [...] "interminable 15 tracks [...] were written in the studio moments before they were recorded." [...] Sam Lansky from Idolator shared a similar sentiment, opining that Cyrus felt [...] "mostly phoned-in" [...] by comparison with the [...] "emotional punch" [...] Cyrus delivered on her collaboration with American rapper Snoop Lion, [...] "Ashtrays and Heartbreaks". Andy Peterson of Contactmusic.com criticized {{the production of the}} track, stating that listeners are [...] "treated to the sort of identikit trance-plus-autotune sound that's been annexing American teen culture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years".|$|E
500|$|Glazunov {{adds that}} his {{relationship}} with Tchaikovsky changed from the elder composer being [...] "not ... one of our own" [...] to a close friendship that would last until Tchaikovsky's death. [...] "I met Tchaikovsky quite often both at Balakirev's and at my own home", Glazunov remembered. [...] "We usually met over music. He always appeared in our social circle {{as one of the}} most welcome guests; besides myself and Lyadov, Rimsky-Korsakov and Balakirev were also constant members of our circle." [...] This circle, with which Tchaikovsky would spend an increasing amount of time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years of his life, would come to be known as the Belyayev circle, named after its patron, Belyayev. According to musicologist Richard Taruskin, Belyayev, through his financial influence, would shape Russian music more greatly and lastingly than either Balakirev or Stasov were able to do.|$|E

On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message on World News Tonight {{that he had been}} diagnosed with lung cancer, and was starting chemotherapy treatment the following week. [...] "As some of you now know, I have learned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days that I have lung cancer," [...] he said. [...] "Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and I smoked over 9/11. But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit."

500|$|U2's {{partnership}} with Apple Inc. for the album release ultimately imposed a much-needed deadline {{by which to}} complete the record. Burton returned to help the group during the final sessions. The band spent the final month working with Gaffney in Malibu, California. The Edge said, [...] "the bulk of it was done pretty quickly at the end. So much was achieved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks." [...] He described the last four days in particular as [...] "full-on". The album was completed on 2 September 2014, one week prior to its release. At that point, the band delivered a 10-track version of the album to Apple and opted to exclude the song [...] "Volcano", as it was unfinished. However, the group had a [...] "little crisis", believing the record sounded [...] "lopsided".

500|$|By contrast, the {{remaining}} work, the Cello Concerto in E minor, had a disastrous premiere, {{at the opening}} concert of the London Symphony Orchestra's 1919–20 season in October 1919. Apart from the Elgar work, which the composer conducted, {{the rest of the}} programme was conducted by Albert Coates, who overran his rehearsal time at the expense of Elgar's. Lady Elgar wrote, [...] "that brutal selfish ill-mannered bounder ... that brute Coates went on rehearsing." [...] The critic of The Observer, Ernest Newman, wrote, [...] "There have been rumours about during the week of inadequate rehearsal. Whatever the explanation, the sad fact remains that never, in all probability, has so great an orchestra made so lamentable an exhibition of itself. ... The work itself is lovely stuff, very simple – that pregnant simplicity that has come upon Elgar's music <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years – but with a profound wisdom and beauty underlying its simplicity." [...] Elgar attached no blame to his soloist, Felix Salmond, who played for him again later. In contrast with the First Symphony and its hundred performances in just over a year, the Cello Concerto did not have a second performance in London for more than a year.|$|E

500|$|On her {{review of}} [...] "Stewie Kills Lois", Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B+.

She did praise the cliffhanger, stating that she was intrigued about how the storyline would turn out. She also praised the storyline and liked how it was able to create drama. In her review of [...] "Lois Kills Stewie", Koski rated the episode a B, calling the end of the story a bit predictable as she thought that the deaths of Lois, Cleveland and Stewie were a one time joke. She praised and disliked some jokes and gags in the episode, including Stewie demanding praise for his macaroni picture of an owl and Lois' salvation via merman, respectively. She commented that the fight sequence was extended and highly choreographed.|$|E

There was much speculation regarding any [...] "recurrence of his stress-related illness that originally occurred in 2006", as {{this was to be}} his first overseas outing since an aborted attempt in 2008. Trescothick himself responded to the media by making a statement to the BBC World Service which read [...] "I know the risk and I know what happens when it goes wrong. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> times I have tried to go on tour it's failed, so of course ...

[...] Meanwhile, Langer assured the media that Trescothick could pull out whenever he wished to. Somerset, who began the tour without Trescothick as he was arriving later than most of the squad, commenced their warm up with a victory over the Otago Volts. The opener arrived three days later, confident in his ability to complete the tour. Somerset began with a close victory against the Deccan Chargers on 10 October, winning from the last ball.
