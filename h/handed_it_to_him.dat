25|$|On 3 March 1942, Hitler awarded Pavelić the Grand Cross of the Order of the German Eagle. Siegfried Kasche, the German envoy, <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in Zagreb. Eugen Dido Kvaternik, son of Slavko Kvaternik, {{and one of}} {{the main}} protagonists in the Ustaše {{genocide}} of the Serbs stated that Pavelić directed Croat nationalism against the Serbs in order to distract the Croat population from a potential backlash against the Italians over his territorial concessions to them in Dalmatia. The worst policies directed against minorities were Ustaše-run concentration and forced labor camps. The most notorious camp was the Jasenovac concentration camp, where 80,000–100,000 people died, including around 18,000 Croatian Jews, or around 90% of the pre-World War II Jewish community.|$|E
500|$|Reich {{published}} Die Funktion des Orgasmus ("The Function of the Orgasm") in 1927, dedicating it to Freud. He {{had presented}} {{a copy of}} the manuscript to Freud on the latter's 70th birthday on 6 May 1926. Freud had not appeared impressed. He replied [...] "that thick?" [...] when Reich <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and took two months to write a brief but positive letter in response, which Reich interpreted as a rejection. Freud's view was that the matter was more complicated than Reich suggested, {{and that there was no}} single cause of neurosis. He wrote in 1928 to another psychoanalyst, Dr. Lou Andreas-Salomé: ...|$|E
500|$|One {{morning in}} 1914, Hogg {{was awakened by}} a burglar in her bedroom. She confronted the man, who was {{attempting}} to steal her jewelry, and not only convinced him to return the jewelry, but [...] "wrote down a name and address, <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{and told him to}} go there that very day to get a job". When asked why she did that, Hogg responded, [...] "He didn't look like a bad man." [...] Later that year, she sailed to Germany, alone. While she was en route, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated, and the day before she arrived, Britain declared war on Germany. The United States was still neutral, however, so Hogg continued her tour of Europe, not leaving until several months later.|$|E

500|$|Folk {{tradition}} {{has it that}} Bajo first left Piva for Drobnjaci, and eventually Drobnjaci for Morača. Bajo was originally engaged to Milica, daughter of a local knez Bogdan Papović from Kazanci. Bogdan was, however, pressured by the recently appointed Pasha of Gacko to hand his daughter to him. Pasha, originally Tepavčević, was taken through devshirme, islamized, educated and served in Constantinople and Travnik. They arranged for a meeting on which Milica was supposed to break the engagement, and choose Pasha instead of Bajo. Bajo, who prepared himself for a wedding, came to the meeting, and after questioning the girl about her choice, asked for his ring back. Milica <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> at which moment Bajo killed her as well as Pasha {{and two of his}} bodyguards. Knez Bogdan took shelter in his house, which Bajo burned, together with a mosque Pasha erected not long ago, killing with his kinsmen and grooms all the Ottomans who served the Pasha in the process. This action caused him to abandon his tribe, losing all his wealth, and relocate to Drobnjaci, where he planned to lay low for a certain amount of time. There, he presented himself as Spasoje Sokolović, and found a job as an employee of Knez Tomić. [...] Since it was the mowing part of the year, Hasan-Aga Kopčić ordered all of the local knez's to send him their workforces to Bukovica. Bajo was among these people, and he broke his mowing blade [...] one day while working. Taking a break to fix it, he enraged the Agha, who started hiting him with a whip. Bajo then decapitated him with his fixed blade, took his horse and weapons and ran to Morača, which at the time was hajduk's nest and the most defiant of all the Montenegrin Highland tribes towards Ottomans. Bajo lived in Morača for several years, his exploits from this period (like the killing of Hafiz-bey, saving his sister Jela from Muslim maruders and protecting his cousin Sekula from wealthy and vain Pejović family) are preserved in collective memory of the population of North Montenegro. Morača was razed by the Ottomans sometime in the late 1640's, after which Bajo took shelter in Venetian controlled territories.|$|E
