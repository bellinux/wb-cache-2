5|$|Among {{the many}} homologies in mammal {{reproductive}} systems, ovaries and testicles are <b>homologous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Frogs and {{all other}} living {{tetrapods}} have a rod-like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum —or <b>homologous</b> tympanum— to the inner ear. Temnospondyls also have a stapes, which projects into the otic cavity. The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe-finned fishes. The positioning of the stapes and {{the shape of the}} otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are <b>homologous,</b> but the tympani of these amphibians are no longer considered <b>homologous</b> with the hearing systems of reptiles, birds, and mammals. Therefore, ear structures in temnospondyls were not ancestral to those of all other tetrapods.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that some behaviours might be <b>homologous,</b> based either on sharing across related taxa or on common origins of the behaviour in an individual's development, though this remains controversial. For example, D. W. Rajecki and Randall C. Flanery, using data on humans and on nonhuman primates, argue that patterns of behaviour in dominance hierarchies are <b>homologous</b> across the primates.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales of}} birds {{are thought to}} be <b>homologous</b> to those of {{reptiles}} and mammals.|$|E
5|$|Tumours with a <b>homologous</b> {{recombination}} deficiency (including BRCA defects) {{are described}} as HRD-positive.|$|E
5|$|Among insects, the stinger of {{the female}} honey bee is a {{modified}} ovipositor, <b>homologous</b> with ovipositors in other insects such as the Orthoptera, Hemiptera, and those Hymenoptera without stingers.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{compound}} {{leaves of}} flowering plants are partially <b>homologous</b> both to leaves and shoots, because their development {{has evolved from}} a genetic mosaic of leaf and shoot development.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homologous</b> {{recombination}} {{is a type}} {{of genetic}} recombination in which nucleotide sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical molecules of DNA. It is most widely used by cells to accurately repair harmful breaks that occur on both strands of DNA, known as double-strand breaks. <b>Homologous</b> recombination also produces new combinations of DNA sequences during meiosis, the process by which eukaryotes make gamete cells, like sperm and egg cells in animals. These new combinations of DNA represent genetic variation in offspring, which in turn enables populations to adapt during the course of evolution. <b>Homologous</b> recombination is also used in horizontal gene transfer to exchange genetic material between different strains and species of bacteria and viruses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homologous</b> {{recombination}} is {{the proposed}} mechanism whereby the DNA virus human herpesvirus-6 integrates into human telomeres.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homologous</b> {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a <b>homologous</b> chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E
5|$|Homology remains {{controversial}} in animal behaviour, {{but there is}} suggestive evidence that, for example, dominance hierarchies are <b>homologous</b> across the primates.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, Charles Darwin {{explained}} <b>homologous</b> structures as {{meaning that}} the organisms concerned shared a body plan from a common ancestor, and that taxa were branches of a single tree of life.|$|E
5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially <b>homologous.</b> Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are <b>homologous</b> if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{it appears}} that <b>homologous</b> {{recombination}} during meiosis functions to repair DNA damages, and that BRCA2 {{plays a key role}} in performing this function.|$|E
5|$|Related single {{stranded}} binding {{proteins that}} are important for <b>homologous</b> recombination, and many other processes, are also found in all domains of life.|$|E
5|$|The extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans has a {{remarkable}} {{ability to survive}} DNA damage from ionizing radiation and other sources. At least two copies of the genome, with random DNA breaks, can form DNA fragments through annealing. Partially overlapping fragments are then used for synthesis of <b>homologous</b> regions through a moving D-loop that can continue extension until they find complementary partner strands. In the final step there is crossover by means of RecA-dependent <b>homologous</b> recombination.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} for recombination in some RNA viruses, specifically positive-sense ssRNA viruses like retroviruses, picornaviruses, and coronaviruses. There is controversy over whether <b>homologous</b> recombination occurs in negative-sense ssRNA viruses like influenza.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are <b>homologous</b> {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings {{has evolved into a}} pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
5|$|Double-strand DNA {{breaks in}} {{bacteria}} are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of <b>homologous</b> recombination. Breaks that occur {{on only one}} of the two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway. Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways include a series of reactions known as branch migration, in which single DNA strands are exchanged between two intercrossed molecules of duplex DNA, and resolution, in which those two intercrossed molecules of DNA are cut apart and restored to their normal double-stranded state. <b>Homologous</b> recombination occurs in several groups of viruses. In DNA viruses such as herpesvirus, recombination occurs through a break-and-rejoin mechanism like in bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, branch migration is facilitated by the RuvABC complex or RecG protein, molecular motors that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move the junction. The junction must then be resolved into two separate duplexes, restoring either the parental configuration or a crossed-over configuration. Resolution can occur in either a horizontal or vertical fashion during <b>homologous</b> recombination, giving patch products (if in same orientation during double strand break repair) or splice products (if in different orientations during double strand break repair). RuvA and RuvB are branch migration proteins, while RuvC is a junction-resolving enzyme.|$|E
5|$|HIV-2’s closest {{relative}} is SIVsm, {{a strain}} of SIV found in sooty mangabees. Since HIV-1 is derived from SIVcpz, and HIV-2 from SIVsm, the genetic sequence of HIV-2 is only partially <b>homologous</b> to HIV-1 and more closely resembles that of SIVsm.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology {{accepted}} female prostate as {{an accurate}} {{term for the}} Skene's gland, which {{is believed to be}} found in the G-spot area along the walls of the urethra. The male prostate is biologically <b>homologous</b> to the Skene's gland; it has been unofficially called the male G-spot because it can also be used as an erogenous zone.|$|E
5|$|In biology, {{homology}} is {{the existence}} of shared ancestry between a pair of structures, or genes, in different taxa. A common example of <b>homologous</b> structures is the forelimbs of vertebrates, where the wings of bats, the arms of primates, the front flippers of whales and the forelegs of dogs and horses are all derived from the same ancestral tetrapod structure. Evolutionary biology explains <b>homologous</b> structures adapted to different purposes {{as the result of}} descent with modification from a common ancestor. Homology was explained by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in 1859, but had been observed before this, from Aristotle onwards, and it was explicitly analysed by Pierre Belon in 1555. The term was applied to biology by the anatomist Richard Owen in 1843.|$|E
5|$|In many plants, {{defensive}} or {{storage structures}} {{are made by}} modifications {{of the development of}} primary leaves, stems, and roots. Leaves are variously modified from photosynthetic structures to form the insect-trapping pitchers of pitcher plants, the insect-trapping jaws of Venus flytrap, and the spines of cactuses, all <b>homologous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Possible <b>homologous</b> {{structures}} in other {{species have been}} identified as the dorsoepitrochlearis muscle, the pectoralis quartus muscle or the panniculus carnosus. The dorsoepitrochlearis is an important climbing muscle in monkeys and apes where it has its origin in the tendinous region of the latissimus dorsi and extends down the arm as a superficial muscle.|$|E
5|$|Rudimentary organs such as {{the human}} tailbone, now much reduced from their {{functional}} state, are readily understood as signs of evolution, the explanation being that they were cut down by natural selection from functioning organs when their functions were no longer needed, but make {{no sense at all}} if species are considered to be fixed. The tailbone is <b>homologous</b> to the tails of other primates.|$|E
5|$|The {{embryonic}} body segments (somites) {{of different}} arthropods taxa have diverged {{from a simple}} body plan with many similar appendages which are serially <b>homologous,</b> {{into a variety of}} body plans with fewer segments equipped with specialised appendages. The homologies between these have been discovered by comparing genes in evolutionary developmental biology.|$|E
5|$|The toothcomb, {{a special}} {{morphological}} arrangement of {{teeth in the}} anterior lower jaw, is best known in extant strepsirrhine primates, which include lemurs and lorisoid primates (collectively known as lemuriforms). This <b>homologous</b> structure is a diagnostic character that helps define this clade (related group) of primates. An analogous trait {{is found in the}} bald uakari (Cacajao calvus), a type of New World monkey.|$|E
5|$|To date, no high {{resolution}} structure of ssTnI has been solved. As <b>homologous</b> proteins, ssTnI, fast skeletal muscle TnI and cardiac TnI have highly conserved structures and crystallographic {{high resolution}} structure of partial cardiac and fast skeletal troponin complex are both available. Therefore, the structure-function relationship of ssTnI would {{rely on the}} information from studies performed on fast skeletal muscle and cardiac TnI.|$|E
5|$|When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius {{are exposed}} to the DNA {{damaging}} agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in S.solfataricus could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S.acidocaldarius. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of <b>homologous</b> recombination. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to <b>homologous</b> recombinational repair of DNA damage.|$|E
5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} <b>homologous</b> structures that {{arose from the}} same tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had hind legs complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|E
5|$|Gimsa et al. (2015) {{suggest that}} the dorsal sail of Spinosaurus was <b>homologous</b> to the dorsal fins of {{sailfish}} and served a hydrodynamic purpose. Gimsa and others point out that more basal, long-legged spinosaurids have otherwise round or crescent-shaped dorsal sails, whereas in Spinosaurus, the dorsal neural spines form a shape that is roughly rectangular and similar in shape to the dorsal fins of sailfish. They therefore argue that Spinosaurus used its dorsal neural sail {{in the same manner}} as sailfish, and that it also employed its long narrow tail to stun prey like a modern thresher shark.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Glenn T. Seaborg, who {{devised the}} {{actinide}} concept that elements 89 to 103 formed an actinide series <b>homologous</b> to the lanthanide series from elements 57 to 71, predicted that element 103 (lawrencium) should be its final member {{and that the}} Lr3+ ion should be about as stable as Lu3+ in aqueous solution. It was not until decades later that element 103 was finally conclusively synthesized and this prediction was experimentally confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, it was {{hypothesized}} that an isomer of 271Hs might have a half-life of around (2.5±0.5)×108y, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4.4MeV in some samples of molybdenite and osmiridium. This isomer of 271Hs could be produced from the beta decay of 271Bh and 271Sg, which, being <b>homologous</b> to rhenium and molybdenum respectively, should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature. Since hassium is <b>homologous</b> to osmium, it should also occur along with osmium in osmiridium if it occurred in nature. The decay chains of 271Bh and 271Sg are very hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth. It is possible that more 271Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, which would also explain excesses of plutonium-239 found on the floors of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland, but minerals enriched with 271Hs are predicted to also have excesses of uranium-235 and lead-207, and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission, such as krypton, zirconium, and xenon. Thus, the occurrence of hassium in nature in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible, but highly unlikely.|$|E
5|$|In asexual organisms, {{genes are}} {{inherited}} together, or linked, as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, {{the offspring of}} sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment. In a related process called <b>homologous</b> recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. Recombination and reassortment do not alter allele frequencies, but instead change which alleles are associated with each other, producing offspring with new combinations of alleles. Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Initially, geneticists {{assumed that}} the {{junction}} would adopt a parallel rather than antiparallel conformation, because that would place the <b>homologous</b> duplexes in closer alignment to each other. Chemical analysis in the 1980s showed that the junction actually preferred the antiparallel conformation, a finding that was considered controversial, and Robin Holliday himself initially doubted the findings. The antiparallel structure later became widely accepted due to X-ray crystallography data on in vitro molecules, although as of 2004 the implications for the in vivo structure remained unclear, especially {{the structure of the}} junctions is often altered by proteins bound to it.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{mouthparts}} show {{many examples}} of convergent evolution. The mouthparts of different insect groups consist {{of a set of}} <b>homologous</b> organs, specialised for the dietary intake of that insect group. Convergent evolution of many groups of insects led from original biting-chewing mouthparts to different, more specialised, derived function types. These include, for example, the proboscis of flower-visiting insects such as bees and flower beetles, or the biting-sucking mouthparts of blood-sucking insects such as fleas and mosquitos.|$|E
