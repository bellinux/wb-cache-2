40|$|Gradience can be {{identified}} as an important factor of linguistic change. We show how this alleged performance factor, which is in principle external to what {{is often referred to}} as ‘core grammar’, appears to influence speaker’s internal linguistic competence, giving then rise to the relevant historical change. In particular, one of our main concerns is to provide an explanation of Sorace’s (2000, 2004) <b>gradient</b> <b>factors</b> involved in the selection of perfective auxiliary with intransitive verbs in Old Catalan and Old Spanish. We also put forward the reasons why the relevant change evolved the way it did, i. e., why the gradual replacement of BE by HAVE started with some lexical semantic classes (e. g., appearance and existence verbs) rather than with others (e. g., telic change of state/location verbs). Like Bentley & Eythórsson (2003), we show that Sorace’s (2000) <b>gradient</b> <b>factors</b> involved in auxiliary selection can not only be worked out from synchronic data but from diachronic ones as well. However, unlike them, we show that auxiliary selection is not only determined by semantics: we argue that auxiliary selection is not just a matter of lexical semantics but of syntactic argument structure as well. 1...|$|R

However, current studies mostly {{focus on the}} influence of Pleistocene isolation of sea basins in population structure of species in the region, leaving the contribution of other factors (such as freshwater outflow and environmental gradients) largely unexploited. Here we shed light on the question by investigating phylogeography of the surf clam Mactra chinensis in the East China Sea (ECS). Genetic information was acquired from 501 specimens collected from its main distribution in the region, represented by mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and nine polymorphic microsatellite loci. A shallow and star-like phylogeny was revealed for all COI haplotypes, indicating the origin of populations from a single refugium. Although no divergent lineages existed, population subdivision was detected in both data sets. The most striking pattern was the significant differentiation between populations north and south of a biogeographic boundary—the Changjiang Estuary, suggesting a barrier effect of the freshwater outflow to gene flow. For the northern group, substructure was revealed by COI result as one southernmost population was significant different from other ones. Clear latitude gradations in allele frequencies were revealed by microsatellite analyses, likely influenced by environmental <b>gradient</b> <b>factors</b> such as temperature. Our results demonstrate that genetic subdivision can arise for populations within the ECS despite they have a single origin, and multiple mechanisms including Changjiang River outflow, environmental <b>gradient</b> <b>factors</b> and life-history traits may act in combination in the process...|$|R

50|$|Gradient {{factors are}} a way to induce deeper stops in a {{dissolved}} state (Haldanian) decompression model. The M-values are modified to reduce the maximum allowed supersaturation in the tissue compartments by a linearly varying factor proportional to depth. They are expressed as two percentages, one being the percentage of nominal M-value at the surface, and the other being percentage of the nominal M-value at depth. Selecting a low <b>gradient</b> <b>factor</b> at depth causes the algorithm to require the first stop at a deeper depth than the unmodified algorithm. All tissue compartments are affected in the same way. Provided both gradient factors are less than 100%, the decompression schedule generated by gradient factors will be more conservative than the unmodified algorithm.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{products}} derived from the gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer (GOCE) observations are the gravity gradients. These gravity gradients are provided in the gradiometer reference frame (GRF) and are calibrated in-flight using satellite shaking and star sensor data. To use these gravity gradients for application in Earth scienes and gravity field analysis, additional preprocessing needs to be done, including corrections for temporal gravity field signals to isolate the static gravity field part, screening for outliers, calibration by comparison with existing external gravity field information and error assessment. The temporal gravity gradient corrections consist of tidal and nontidal corrections. These are all generally below the gravity gradient error level, which is predicted to show a 1 /f behaviour for low frequencies. In the outlier detection, the 1 /f error is compensated for by subtracting a local median from the data, while the data error is assessed using the median absolute deviation. The local median acts as a high-pass filter and it is robust as is the median absolute deviation. Three different methods have been implemented for the calibration of the gravity gradients. All three methods use a high-pass filter {{to compensate for the}} 1 /f gravity gradient error. The baseline method uses state-of-the-art global gravity field models and the most accurate results are obtained if star sensor misalignments are estimated along with the calibration parameters. A second calibration method uses GOCE GPS data to estimate a low-degree gravity field model as well as gravity <b>gradient</b> scale <b>factors.</b> Both methods allow to estimate gravity <b>gradient</b> scale <b>factors</b> down to the 10 ? 3 level. The third calibration method uses high accurate terrestrial gravity data in selected regions to validate the gravity <b>gradient</b> scale <b>factors,</b> focussing on the measurement band.

40|$|In frame structures, {{consisting}} of columns and beams, gravity loading on beams (floors) leads to moments {{as well as}} axial forces in the columns. In cases with slender columns, maximum moments may develop between columns ends due to second order effects. Approximate methods for calculating maximum moments between column ends are given in Norwegian and international standards. These ``conventional'' methods are formulated in terms of approximate effective lengths and a moment <b>gradient</b> <b>factor</b> (often labelled Cm), and are mainly developed for structures of regular geometry, and in which the beams and neighbouring column(s), that frame into an end of the considered column, provide a positive rotational restraint at that column end. In some circumstances, the provided rotational end restraint may actually become negative. The main object of the present work is to study the applicability of conventional methods to such cases, and other more commonly encountered cases. For this purpose, approximate maximum moment predictions are compared to results of exact, linearized second order calculations {{for a wide range}} of parameters. Similar comparisons are also made for some other approximate methods having alternative moment <b>gradient</b> <b>factor</b> definitions and differently computed effective lengths...|$|E
