[...] "Darling, you must know <b>how</b> <b>awful</b> it all is", Olga {{wrote in a letter}} to a friend from Tobolsk. During the early months of 1917, the {{children}} caught measles. Olga contracted pleurisy, as well.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Toast Can Never Be Bread Again", as Doggett and Big Boo are {{assigned}} to cover the cafeteria {{following the death of}} Poussey Washington (played by Samira Wiley), Coates is also there to watch over the body. Coates then tells Doggett that he needs to quit because he hates <b>how</b> <b>awful</b> the prison is becoming. She tells him she does not want him to go, since they are on good terms, and she likes talking to him, despite what happened. She kisses him and Coates makes it clear that he wants to go further than this but chooses not to, reasoning [...] "I don’t want to ruin where we are now".|$|E
500|$|Sarumpaet {{described}} {{the film as}} being [...] "about <b>how</b> <b>awful</b> the effect of poverty on human’s morality and lives is"; {{in an interview with}} Tempo magazine, she stated that she did not have a political message, but intended to just show the facts. Nauval Yazid, in a review for The Jakarta Post, wrote that the film was of the [...] "women-who-suffer-continuously" [...] genre, common in Indonesian cinema; he compared the theme to Ponirah Terpidana (Ponirah is Convicted; 1984), starring Hakim and Slamet Rahardjo. Anissa S. Febrina, also writing for The Jakarta Post, {{described the}} film as depicting [...] "the grim reality of those whose existence [...] are rarely aware of: victims of child and women trafficking." ...|$|E

6000|$|How {{often he}} had written a {{different}} answer to just {{the same type of}} tragic little letter--an answer of the commonplace conventional morality, a small set sermon on the duties of wives and the rights of husbands--as though there was nothing more in that fearful disclosure than the merest fancy; and now, when at last it touched himself, <b>how</b> profoundly <b>awful</b> in their mockery of the truth those baldly respectable answers seemed to him! ...|$|R
500|$|Johnny's part is {{not heard}} on the next track, [...] "I'm Affected", as {{reported}} by Johnny himself. Joey admitted {{that he did not}} favor the song, recalling: [...] "I couldn't believe <b>how</b> <b>awful</b> it sounded. It was horrible." [...] "Danny Says", the third track, was a lyrical depiction of what the band constantly went through while touring--soundchecks, autograph sessions, interviews, etc. The title [...] "Danny Says" [...] refers to the band's tour manager Danny Fields giving the members instructions, schedules, and demands. According to Joey, the ballad was inspired by Lou Reed, who had released the songs [...] "Candy Says" [...] and [...] "Caroline Says". Joey's brother Mickey Leigh called the song a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said it [...] "remains one of the most captivatingly beautiful songs I've ever heard." ...|$|E
500|$|Like {{the whole}} town, the school Christmas pageant is {{stripped}} of all symbols of Christmas, {{and the children}} instead present a minimalist song and dance created by composer Philip Glass. The parents, astounded by <b>how</b> <b>awful</b> the pageant has turned out, begin blaming one another for destroying Christmas and a fight breaks out. When Chef finds out where Kyle is, he reveals to the children that Mr. Hankey does actually exist. When all the children start believing, Mr. Hankey finally reveals himself to everyone and scolds them for losing sight {{of the good things}} of Christmas and focusing on the bad. The townspeople release Kyle from the asylum and apologize, then they all sing Christmas songs and watch Mr. Hankey fly away with Santa Claus. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle feel that something is still missing. [...] "THE END" [...] then appears, and Kenny is excited and relieved that he has survived the entire episode without getting killed in spite of being involved in dangerous and life-threatening situations throughout.|$|E
500|$|Poptimal Tanya Lane wrote, [...] "Wow…just wow. Grey's Anatomy {{has once}} again managed to shock with its season finale." [...] While she {{appreciated}} the [...] "realism and authenticity that Grey's is known for", she found the episode was [...] "almost too much" [...] as it was [...] "extremely gory and difficult to watch, initially because of the grisly wounds" [...] but later because of the [...] "heavy and emotional things that transpired". She thought Pompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her sister was dead. Digital Spy Ben Lee found Leigh's and Dane's performances [...] "phenomenal" [...] and added that he had probably never seen a better performance from Dane. He described the moment the two actors shared as [...] "truly poignant". To him, Lexie's death felt like a finale, which was thus too early. As for {{what was happening in}} Seattle Grace, he thought it was [...] "a bit pointless" [...] and [...] "uninteresting" [...] except Altman's departure, which he deemed [...] "the most significant moment at the hospital". Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky commented of Lexie's death: [...] "It was an intense death. I mean, <b>how</b> <b>awful</b> was it to watch one of Grey’s longest-running characters pass away so quickly -- and rather unceremoniously? I get that Ms. Rhimes had to do what she had to do -- and every show needs to be shaken up once in a while -- but I don't love that Lexie was the one to die. Could it have been someone less important somehow? I guess it would have been too obvious to do Kepner. And you probably just don't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan, right?" [...] Stransky also complained about Robbins' screams {{at the beginning of the}} episode, but enjoyed Bailey's story.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, we'll {{change the}} subject; I guess {{you were about}} to give me another dig, anyway, so I'm willing to change. <b>How's</b> the <b>Awful</b> Mystery flourishing these days? Wilson's got a scheme for driving plain window glass panes out of the market by decorating it with greasy finger marks, and getting rich by selling it at famine prices to the crowned heads over in Europe to outfit their palaces with. Fetch it out, Dave." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now that's too bad entirely," [...] {{said the}} matron of the school. [...] "Oh, {{who would want}} to harm a dear young lady like Miss Stevenson? It's <b>awful</b> <b>how</b> wicked some young men are," [...] and she shook her head dolefully.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the ninth}} season finale, [...] "Till Death Do Us Part", a bomb is planted by {{domestic}} terrorist Harper Dearing. Tony and Ziva, feeling bad about missing Jimmy and Breena's wedding, try to cheer {{each other up}} by joking about <b>how</b> <b>awful</b> weddings are—an exchange that begins to take on meaning when they become wistful about [...] "the vow, the ring, the kiss, the ketubah..." [...] and eloping instead of dealing with all the fuss. Later, when the Navy Yard is seconds from exploding, Ziva refuses to leave the building without Tony. The bomb goes off while they {{are still in the}} elevator; Ziva and Tony fall to the ground, with Tony's arm around her waist, and their free hands clasped tightly as the elevator appears to crash.|$|E
2500|$|Iris Murdoch won a {{scholarship}} to study at Vassar College in 1946, but was refused a visa to enter the United States because she had joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1938, while a student at Oxford. She left the party in 1942, {{when she went to}} work at the Treasury, but remained sympathetic to communism for several years. In later years she was allowed to visit the United States, but always had to obtain a waiver from the provisions of the McCarran Act, which barred Communist Party members and former members from entering the country. [...] In a 1990 Paris Review interview she said that her membership of the Communist Party had made her see [...] "how strong and <b>how</b> <b>awful</b> it [...] is, certainly in its organized form".|$|E
2500|$|The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern commented, [...] "'Knight and Day' {{woke me up}} to just <b>how</b> <b>awful</b> some summer {{entertainments}} have become. It isn't {{that the}} film is harmful, except to moviegoers' wallets and movie lovers' morale, {{but that it is}} truly phenomenal for the purity of its incoherence." [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert rated the movie 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, [...] "'Knight and Day' aspires to the light charm of a romantic action comedy like 'Charade' or 'Romancing the Stone,' but would come closer if it dialed down the relentless action. The romance part goes without saying after a Meet Cute contrived in an airport, and the comedy seems to generate naturally between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. But why do so many summer movies find it obligatory to inflict us with CGI overkill? I'd sorta rather see Diaz and Cruise in action scenes on a human scale, rather than have it rubbed in that for long stretches, they're essentially replaced by animation." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe stated, [...] "The movie’s a piece of high-octane summer piffle: stylish, funny, brainless without being too obnoxious about it, and Cruise is its manic animating principle." [...] Writing for the Associated Press, Christy Lemire commented, [...] "Cruise's presence also helps keep things light, breezy and watchable when the action – and the story itself – spin ridiculously out of control." [...] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic observed, [...] "Mangold, working from a script by Patrick O'Neill, accelerates events {{in a way that is}} either a perfect representation of how current action films are made or a demonstration of everything that's wrong with movies today. Maybe it's both." [...] Joshua Starnes of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 6.5 out of 10, and concluded his review, [...] "Instead of watching it, you're better off putting [...] "Knight and Day" [...] in a time capsule and singing some Don McLean, 'cause this is the day the movie star died." [...] In a subsequent [...] "mini review", Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 8 out of 10, and concluded, [...] "The entertainment comes from how much fun it is watching [...] on screen together and that's what separates Knight and Day from previous attempts at mixing romance, comedy, and action." [...] In a review for CNN, Tom Charity commented, [...] "there's a creeping anxiety about this project, a tendency to over-compensate that speaks to underlying inadequacies." ...|$|E
