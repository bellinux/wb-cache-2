5|$|Grizzly Rage {{breaks the}} {{standard}} mold for many Syfy natural horror films {{in that the}} bear featured is a normal grizzly bear rather than a mutant or genetically altered animal. However, the bear and actors never appear {{together in the same}} frame, rather a man <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> suit takes over the role when the actors must interact with the bear. Critics heavily panned the film, feeling its plot, script, characters, and special effects were substandard.|$|E

Kane chokeslamed Henry {{towards the end of}} the contest and {{attempted}} to pin Henry. Chavo Guerrero and Kenny Dykstra interfered, however, and attacked Kane. Kane fought back and chokeslammed Dykstra, but Henry locked Kane <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> hug. The referee stopped the contest after Kane kayfabe passed out.|$|E

25|$|Chin taunted Ebens to keep {{fighting}} after they were all thrown out. Ebens and Nitz searched the neighborhood for 20 to 30 minutes and even paid another man $20 to help look for Chin, before finding him at a McDonald's restaurant. Chin tried to escape, but was held by Nitz <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> hug while Ebens repeatedly bludgeoned Chin {{with a baseball bat}} until Chin's head cracked open. A policeman who witnessed the beating said Ebens was swinging the bat like he was swinging “for a home run”. When rushed to Henry Ford Hospital, he was unconscious and died after four days in a coma on June 23, 1982.|$|E
25|$|In Elliott's model, {{market prices}} {{alternate}} between an impulsive, or motive phase, and a corrective phase on all time scales of trend, as the illustration shows. Impulses are always subdivided into {{a set of}} 5 lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive and corrective character, so that waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulses, and waves 2 and 4 are smaller retraces of waves 1 and 3. Corrective waves subdivide into 3 smaller-degree waves starting with a five-wave counter-trend impulse, a retrace, and another impulse. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> market the dominant trend is downward, so the pattern is reversed—five waves down and three up. Motive waves always move with the trend, while corrective waves move against it.|$|E
25|$|Back at the Sawyer home, Verna {{stitches}} {{the remnants}} of the mentally-scarred Jedidiah Sawyer's face and applies a muzzle to hold them together. She then leads him into a room where his siblings are holding Elizabeth and Hartman captive. She gifts Jedidiah with his original chainsaw and Elizabeth watches on in horror as he bisects Hartman to death. As the family celebrates, Elizabeth flees into the woods while the Sawyers give chase. She nearly escapes, only to be caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> trap. Elizabeth attempts to appeal to Jedidiah's sympathy, while Verna encourages him to kill her to protect their family. Jedidiah begins to listen to Elizabeth's pleas that he is not a killer, unable to recall events prior to his injury, until she insults Verna. This causes him to decapitate her in retaliation.|$|E

500|$|In {{the next}} match, [...] "Hacksaw" [...] Jim Duggan faced Bam Bam Bigelow. Neither wrestler {{was able to}} gain an {{advantage}} until Duggan was thrown {{into the corner of}} the ring. He suffered a storyline injury, which allowed Bigelow to place Duggan <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> hug. Duggan bit Bigelow to escape from the hold. He executed a powerslam and attempted to perform his signature move, a charging clothesline. Bigelow moved out of the way, however, and performed a diving headbutt on Duggan to get the pinfall victory.|$|E
500|$|New Brighton Tower {{regularly}} advertised {{itself as}} [...] "the highest structure and finest place of amusement in the Kingdom". A single entrance fee of one shilling (or {{a ticket for}} the summer season, costing 10s6d) was charged for entrance into the grounds, which included the gardens, the athletic grounds, the ballroom and the theatre. An additional charge of sixpence was levied on those who wished {{to go to the}} top of the tower. There was a menagerie within the building, containing Nubian lions, Russian wolves (which had eight cubs in 1914), bears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> pit, monkeys, elephants, stags, leopards and other animals. There was also an aviary above the ballroom. The Tower Building also contained a shooting gallery and a billiard saloon with five tables.|$|E
500|$|Grizzly Rage {{was filmed}} in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It breaks from the {{standard}} mold many natural horror films follow in that the bear attacking the main characters is not a mutant or genetically altered, rather it is a normal, but furious mother bear. The mother bear is played by Koda, a [...] male grizzly bear, working {{at the direction of}} a trainer. To induce the bear to appear to be roaring, the trainer gave it marshmallows to make it smile. The roaring sounds were dubbed in later. Both Tyler Hoechlin and Graham Kosakoski noted that they were a little afraid of the bear and director David DeCoteau felt that working with such a powerful live animal added element of danger for the cast and crew during filming. As such, the bear is never actually filmed together with any of the actors. For scenes where the bear is supposed to interact with the characters, a man <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> suit takes over the role.|$|E

On the other hand, Steve McMichael holds {{the record for}} most {{consecutive}} games played by <b>a</b> <b>Bear</b> with 191; he accomplished the feat from 1981 to 1993. In second place is Payton, who played 186 games from 1975 to 1987 at running back, a position considered to be conducive to injury, only missing one game <b>in</b> <b>a</b> span of 13 seasons.|$|R
500|$|A {{police officer}} interrogates Parker (Julie Gonzalo) about her rape, {{but she does}} not {{remember}} any of it. Veronica tells Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) that she ran into the room and heard Parker having sex, and Parker berates her for not checking to see what was happening. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) hikes through the desert after fleeing from Cormac Fitzpatrick (Jason Beghe); Cormac later realizes that Keith has disappeared and starts following him. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Logan's (Jason Dohring) sociology professor recruits volunteers for a Stanford prison experiment-like study. Veronica interviews for a photography position at the college newspaper, but the editor tasks her with writing an exposé of the Theta Beta sorority, where Parker was during the night of her rape. Parker’s parents appear at Hearst and announce {{that they are going to}} remove her from the college in light of her assault. During her investigation, Veronica poses as a potential recruit, {{but she does not}} note any suspicious activity. In the sociology experiment, Logan is assigned to the role of a prisoner, while Wallace acts as a [...] "guard". While tracking Keith, Cormac gets stuck <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> trap; his brother Liam (Rod Rowland) appears and shoots him. Veronica is invited to attend a [...] "private party", which she believes will be the key to her exposé. At the party, Veronica encounters Dick (Ryan Hansen) and learns that Parker's room was easily accessible. Veronica pretends to be drunk in order to ascertain whether or not the sorority members collaborate with the rapist, but they just drive her home.|$|E

2500|$|On October 25, {{the group}} (minus Chyna) {{reformed}} as villains when Triple H and X-Pac helped the New Age Outlaws – who had reunited a month previously – defeat Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock. On that week's Smackdown, [...] X-Pac suggested that DX would get [...] "bigger", hinting that Kane would finally become an official member. However, later that night, {{he turned on}} Kane following a match with The Dudley Boyz, stating {{there would be no}} additional members. That same night, DX were [...] "hunted" [...] by Austin, with Stone Cold catching Road Dogg <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> trap, Billy Gunn in a noose, having a portion of the backstage ceiling fall on X-Pac and finally catching the whole group in a net.|$|E
2500|$|South Park episodes [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201", {{broadcast}} in April 2010, featured a character <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> costume, who various other characters stated was Muhammad. The South Park episode sparked {{statements from the}} extremist website Revolution Muslim, which posted {{a picture of the}} partially decapitated body of the Dutch filmmaker, Theo van Gogh, with a statement declaring that Parker and Stone could meet a similar fate. The group running the website said it was not threatening Parker and Stone, however, it also posted the addresses of Comedy Central's New York office and the California production studio where South Park is made. Comedy Central self-censored the episode when it was broadcast by removing the word [...] "Muhammad" [...] and a speech about intimidation and fear from the South Park episode.|$|E
2500|$|In September, 1949, made man Jimmy Fratianno {{was ordered}} by Jack Dragna {{to set up}} and kill Mickey Cohen loyalist Frank Niccoli. When first meeting Niccoli inside Fratianno's home, Dippolito shook his hand, and then quickly wrapped him in a reverse bear hug. Fratianno and Sam Bruno then placed a rope around Niccoli's neck and choked him to death. Afterwards, Dippolito took the body and buried it with a sack of lime in his large vineyard, which was a popular place to bury dead bodies for the Los Angeles Mafia. This method of killing was termed by the Mafia the [...] "Italian rope trick," [...] and a few years later this move was {{repeated}} on Louis Strauss ("Russian Louie") in April 1953, with Dippolito holding Strauss <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> hug, while Fratianno and Frank Bompensiero strangled Strauss with a rope.|$|E

2500|$|Unusual for a {{late night}} talk show, Late Night made {{frequent}} use of various costumed characters such as The Masturbating Bear, Robot on a Toilet, and Pimpbot5000. The humor in these sketches often derived from the crude construction of the characters' costumes {{as well as the}} absurdist nature of their conceptions. For example, Pimpbot5000 was a 1950s-style robot who dressed and acted in the manner of an exaggerated blaxploitation pimp, while The Masturbating Bear was a man <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> costume wearing an oversized diaper who would inevitably begin to fondle himself to the tune of Aram Khachaturian's [...] "Sabre Dance" [...] when brought on stage. Many of these characters did little more in their appearances than walk across the stage or be wheeled out from behind the curtain, but some had extensive sketches on the show.|$|E
2500|$|When Jewitt got {{on board}} the Lydia he looked very wild, painted red and black, wrapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> skin and with green leaves through his topknot. [...] Nonetheless, the captain welcomed him as a Christian and asked his advice {{about what to do}} with Maquinna. When he heard what exactly had {{happened}} to the Boston, he was inclined to execute him, but Jewitt persuaded him of the impolicy of this, because it would lead to further attacks on other ships visiting. Jewitt negotiated for the return of what property remained of the Boston: its cannons, anchors, and remnants of its cargo, and especially the ship's papers, which he had secured in a chest all those years ago. Once these were {{on board the}} Lydia, Maquinna was released, and the brig immediately weighed anchor and left Nootka Sound.|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrative}} {{begins by}} introducing two rulers, an unnamed {{king and his}} brother, the Green Emperor, whose domains are located in on separate [...] "margins" [...] of the Earth, being separated by desolate lands. Sensing himself at death's door and not having any male children, the emperor addresses {{a letter to the}} king, asking him to send either of his three sons, and promising to grant the one who would reach him his entire country. The eldest son agrees to follow up on his uncle's request, and embarks on the journey. Deciding to use the occasion as a test of his progeny's courage, the king heads off on the same path and, having disguised himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> skin, blocks the prince's path {{at the end of a}} bridge. The latter makes a terrified return home, and the monarch subsequently plays the same trick on his second son, with much the same result. Without revealing his ruse, the parent makes known his disappointment, which prompts the junior to burst out into tears and run out into the palace's garden. He is visited there by an old woman beggar, who suggests that she has the powers of a fortune teller and receives his alms. The woman then predicts that the youngest prince will become a glorious emperor, urges him to attempt his uncle's quest, but warns him that he should use only items his father had used as a groom: ragged clothes, rusty weapons and an old stallion. She subsequently disappears from the prince's sight, rising to the skies.|$|E
