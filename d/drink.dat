5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to <b>drink</b> more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports <b>drink</b> onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports <b>drink,</b> the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to <b>drink.</b> Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} intake and patterns in consumption of potentially erosive beverages in school children in the Netherlands. METHODS: A cross-sectional, single centre study was performed among 502 school children in Rotterdam, in age varying between 12 and 19 years. Data on consumption of soft <b>drinks,</b> energy <b>drinks,</b> sports <b>drinks</b> and alcopops were obtained through a self-reported questionnaire. Gender- and age-related differences in consumption were analysed with Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Associations between variables were investigated with Chi-square tests and Spearman's rank order correlation analysis. RESULTS: Boys consumed soft <b>drinks,</b> energy <b>drinks</b> and sports <b>drinks</b> more frequently than girls, and on average also consumed higher amounts of these <b>drinks.</b> No gender-related differences were observed in alcopop consumption. Consumption of all <b>drinks</b> was most frequent at 14 - or 15 -year of age, {{with the exception of}} alcopops which was most frequent by 16 -year-old school children. Significant positive associations were observed between the consumption of soft <b>drinks,</b> energy <b>drinks</b> and/or sports <b>drinks.</b> Alcopop consumption was only associated with consumption of energy <b>drinks.</b> CONCLUSION: onsumption of soft <b>drinks,</b> energy <b>drinks,</b> sports <b>drinks</b> and alcopops by school children is related to age and gender. The significant positive associations between the consumption of these <b>drinks</b> suggest that a subgroup of school children exists with a high cumulative intake of these potentially erosive <b>drinks...</b>|$|R

Results: For most athletes and individuals engaged in physical activity, the use of sports <b>drinks</b> does not provide a benefit over water. Furthermore, although there is much in vitro evidence that acidic <b>drinks</b> such as wine, fruit juices and carbonated soft <b>drinks</b> have erosive potential and there are relationships between consumption of these <b>drinks</b> and erosion, only one study has reported an association between sports <b>drinks</b> and dental erosion.

40|$|Objectives: We {{evaluated}} {{the accuracy of}} a newly developed self-completed <b>Drinks</b> Diary in care home residents and compared it with direct observation and fluid intake charts. Design: Observational study. Setting: Residential care homes in Norfolk, UK. Participants: 22 elderly people (18 women, mean age 86. 6 years SD 8. 6, 12 with MMSE scores < 27). Measurements: Participants recorded their own <b>drinks</b> intake over 24 hours using the <b>Drinks</b> Diary while care staff used the homes’ usual fluid intake chart to record <b>drinks</b> intake. These records were compared with <b>drinks</b> intake assessed by researcher direct observation (reference method), during waking hours (6 am to 10 pm), while <b>drinks</b> taken from 10 pm to 6 am were self-reported and checked with staff. Results: <b>Drinks</b> intake assessed by the <b>Drinks</b> Diary was highly correlated with researcher direct observation (Pearson correlation coefficient r= 0. 93, p< 0. 001, mean difference - 163 ml/day) while few staff-completed fluid charts were returned and correlation was low (r= 0. 122, p= 0. 818, mean difference 702 ml/day). The <b>Drinks</b> Diary classified 19 of 22 participants correctly as drinking enough or not using both the European Food Safety Authority and US recommendations. Conclusion: The <b>Drinks</b> Diary estimate of <b>drinks</b> intake was comparable with direct observation and more accurate (and reliably completed) than staff records. The <b>Drinks</b> Diary can provide a reliable estimate of <b>drinks</b> intake in elderly care home residents physically and cognitively able to complete it. It may be useful for researchers, care staff and practitioners needing to monitor <b>drinks</b> intake of elderly people, to help them avoid dehydration...|$|R
