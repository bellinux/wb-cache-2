40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} and failure modes of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) confined concrete wrapped with different FRP schemes, including fully wrapped, partially wrapped, and nonuniformly-wrapped concrete cylinders. By using {{the same amount of}} FRP, this study proposes a new wrapping scheme that provides a higher compressive strength and strain for FRP-confined concrete, in comparison with conventional fully wrapping schemes. A total of 33 specimens were cast and tested, with three of these specimens acting as reference specimens and the remaining specimens wrapped with different types of FRP (CFRP and GFRP) by different wrapping schemes. For specimens that belong to the descending branch type, the partially-wrapped specimens had a lower compressive strength but a higher axial strain as compared to the corresponding <b>fully-wrapped</b> specimens. In addition, the nonuniformly-wrapped specimens achieved both a higher compressive strength and axial strain in comparison with the <b>fully-wrapped</b> specimens. Furthermore, the partially-wrapping scheme changes the failure modes of the specimens and the angle of the failure surface. A new equation {{that can be used to}} predict the axial strain of concrete cylinders wrapped partially with FRP is proposed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} shear behavior of RC members fully wrapped with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites, which are {{a new type of}} FRP material characterized by a much larger rupture strain (LRS) compared with conventional FRPs (i. e., made of carbon, glass, and aramid fibers). A total of 10 PET <b>fully-wrapped</b> RC beams, which were designed to fail in shear and with different shear-span to effective-depth ratios, transverse reinforcement ratios and shear strengthening ratios, were tested under 4 -point bending loads. The overall load-deflection responses and the shear deformation of the beams as well as the strain development of the transverse steel reinforcement and the FRP jackets were carefully observed. Based upon the extensive strain measurements, the shear contributions by concrete, FRPs, and transverse reinforcement are differentiated. It was found that the use of PET FRP composites as the jacket material of RC members could shift the mode of shear failure from a brittle one to an ideal ductile one whereas the ultimate state of the members is no longer caused by FRP fracture. In order to efficiently predict the shear strength of RC members wrapped by LRS FRPs, the effective strain in LRS FRPs and the degradation of concrete at the peak member shear strength should be appropriately considered.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project was to develop an innovative manufacturing method that allows reinforcing fibres to be on-line impregnated with thermoplastics during wrapping and laid on a liner. The new process {{is based on the}} principle of in-situ extrusion of molten polymer on to a conventional fibre strand, which was not impregnated with the polymer, just before the fibres are laid on the liner. The project is divided into three units consisting of eight work steps in total to produce a demonstration component {{in the form of a}} <b>fully-wrapped</b> plastic cylinder for service pressures up to 300 bar (burst pressure greater than 900 bar). The concept of on-line impregnation with thermoplastics has been successfully realised using a partially reinforced steel liner. Based on a number of full-scale tests carried out, the good bursting behaviour, fatigue strength and ageing resistance of the component have been demonstrated. A plastic liner has been developed, which is produced by the rotational moulding process and into which the metallic end pieces (openings) are introduced during the moulding process. The plastic liner has been shown to be compatible with and to have a low permeability for the gases such as air and natural gas to be contained in it at high pressure. The plastic liner reinforced with fibres by the wet winding method has attained a burst pressure of 1050 bar on average. Compared to a conventional steel cylinder, its weight is reduced by about 70 %. The new winding technique could not be satisfactorily adopted with the plastic liner. It is therefore necessary to try out other thermoplastics or to develop new process steps in order to achieve sufficient temperature stability during winding. (orig.)
