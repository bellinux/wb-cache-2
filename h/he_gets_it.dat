500|$|After {{news of his}} mother's death reaches Luke, the Captain, anticipating that Luke might {{attempt to}} escape in order to attend his mother's funeral, has him locked in the prison {{punishment}} box. After being released from the box, receiving word that his mother's burial is completed and being told to forget about her, Luke is determined to escape. Under {{the cover of a}} Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is later recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but not before one of the bloodhounds sent after him dies from strain caused by struggling through barbed-wire fences. After his capture and return, the Captain has Luke fitted with leg-irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, explaining, [...] "What we've got here is failure to communicate.

500|$|Dean Martin's song [...] "Naughty Lady of Shady Lane" [...] was {{the first}} to have a number-one in the Record Mirror chart but not to be awarded the top spot in NME 's chart. There are five more songs that, like Martin's, reached number-one on the Record Mirror chart but are not {{classified}} as number-one by the UK Singles Chart. Additionally, the Record Mirror and other charts differed about what they classified as the top song of the year. Record Mirror classified The Everly Brothers' [...] "All I Have to Do Is Dream"/"Claudette" [...] as the top single of 1958 while the UK Singles Chart best-selling single of that year was Elvis Presley's [...] "Jailhouse Rock". Furthermore, despite never reaching number-one, Pat Boone's [...] "Love Letters in the Sand" [...] was classified by Record Mirror as the best-selling song of 1957; the song entered the chart at number eleven on 13 July and, later, charted in the top three positions for 9 consecutive weeks. This is because the top lists for the whole year, were based on a points system. It has to be noted that Tony Jasper's Top 20 book (which takes info from Record Mirror) does actually fall into mistakes between August & December 1958, as Tony says there was no chart for the first week of August, but there was. The charts he prints for 9th Aug onwards are all dated wrongly. The 9th Aug is the 2nd Aug, the 16th is the 9th & so on until 27th Dec 1958, when the dated chart for 27th is actually 20th Dec. He then fails to print the 27th Dec chart. From 1959, <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>it</b> correct again. Though through this mistake, he misses a top 20 entry by Martinas & His Orchestra [...] "Cha Cha Momma Brown", which sneaked into the chart at #18 at the end of December 1958, & then quickly fell out again.|$|E

They throw to second; the runner tags and he's safe.

500|$|Meanwhile, {{the joke}} becomes a {{national}} sensation. Comedian Carlos Mencia goes on Conan O'Brien's show claiming {{credit for the}} joke. The joke is played on rapper Kanye West, who does not understand it. West grows angry when others say he does not get it, and will not allow anyone {{to explain it to}} him, because he claims to be a genius and [...] "the voice of a generation". Kanye abducts Carlos Mencia, who admits he stole the joke to compensate for not being funny and claiming that his [...] "dick don't work" [...] in a parody of Viggo Mortensen's character Lalin in Carlito's Way, but Kanye doesn't believe him and beats him to death {{with the help of his}} hired thugs. Cartman and Jimmy go on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and claim they invented the joke, prompting Kanye to go after them. Jimmy confronts Cartman, asking how he can live with himself for taking credit for a joke he did not write. They are interrupted by Kanye, who threatens to kill them. By now, Cartman has not only convinced himself he wrote the whole joke without Jimmy's help, but believes he also saved his life from a black widow, slew a dragon, defeated an army of Jew robots, and has powers similar to the Human Torch. Cartman thinks he realizes what Kyle was trying to tell him, but <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>it</b> completely backwards: Cartman believes that Jimmy's ego is the one that is twisted and Jimmy's ego trying to convince itself that he wrote the joke, while not accepting that Cartman wrote the whole thing, and Jimmy believes him. Kanye has an epiphany about his own massive ego and believes he finally understands the joke. However, he incorrectly thinks it means he is, in fact, a gay fish. The episode ends with Kanye donning a wetsuit and diving off the Santa Monica Pier into the ocean to embrace his new identity as a gay fish in the form of a music video, in which he happily swims around the sea, kissing and humping random fish.|$|E

2500|$|A Frenchman, a German, and a Russian go on a safari and are {{captured}} by cannibals. They {{are brought to}} the chief, who says, [...] "We are going to eat you right now. But I am a civilized man, I studied human rights at the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, so I'll grant each of you a last request." [...] The German asks for a mug of beer and a bratwurst. <b>He</b> <b>gets</b> <b>it,</b> and then the cannibals eat him. The Frenchman asks for three girls. He has crazy sex with them, and then suffers {{the fate of the}} German. The Russian demands: [...] "Hit me hard, right on my nose!" [...] The chief is surprised, but hits him. The Russian pulls out a Kalashnikov and shoots all the cannibals. The mortally-wounded chief asks him: [...] "Why didn't you do this before we ate the German?" [...] The Russian proudly replies: [...] "Russians are not aggressors!" [...] (This joke has also been used as a Jewish joke; more specifically, as an Israeli joke, alluding to Israel's being constantly afraid of being seen as the [...] "aggressor".) ...|$|E
