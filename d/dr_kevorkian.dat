Slaughterhouse-Five sees Billy Pilgrim, lacking religion himself, nevertheless become a chaplain's assistant in the military and display a large crucifix on his bedroom wall.

5000|$|My aim {{in helping}} the patient was not to cause death. My aim was to end suffering. It's got to be decriminalized. Jack Kevorkian According {{to a report by}} the Detroit Free Press, 60% of the {{patients}} who committed suicide with Kevorkian's help were not terminally ill, and at least 13 had not complained of pain. The report further asserted that Kevorkian's counseling was too brief (with at least 19 patients dying less than 24 hours after first meeting Kevorkian) and lacked a psychiatric exam in at least 19 cases, 5 of which involved people with histories of depression, though Kevorkian was sometimes alerted that the patient was unhappy for reasons other than their medical condition. (In 1992, Kevorkian himself wrote that it is always necessary to consult a psychiatrist when performing assisted suicides because a person's [...] "mental state is ... of paramount importance.") The report also stated that Kevorkian failed to refer at least 17 patients to a pain specialist after they complained of chronic pain, and sometimes failed to obtain a complete medical record for his patients, with at least three autopsies of suicides Kevorkian had assisted with showing the person who committed suicide to have no physical sign of disease. Rebecca Badger, a patient of Kevorkian's and a mentally troubled drug abuser, had been mistakenly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The report also stated that Janet Adkins, Kevorkian's first euthanasia patient, had been chosen without Kevorkian's ever speaking to her, only with her husband, and that when Kevorkian first met Adkins two days before her assisted suicide he [...] "made no real effort to discover whether Ms. Adkins wished to end her life," [...] as the Michigan Court of Appeals put it in a 1995 ruling upholding an order against Kevorkian's activity. According to The Economist: [...] "Studies of those who sought out <b>Dr.</b> <b>Kevorkian,</b> however, suggest that though many had a worsening illness ... it was not usually terminal. Autopsies showed five people had no disease at all. ... Little over a third were in pain. Some presumably suffered from no more than hypochondria or depression." ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{tries to}} argue that physician-assisted suicide (PAS), which is opposed by the AMA and all US states except Oregon, is a moral and ethical dilemma that faces physicians, ethicists, legal experts, and others. To {{demonstrate}} this, the various dimensions of the debate are explored. This is accomplished by discussing the legal, ethical, medical and political ordeals of its most infamous practitioner, Dr. Jack Kevorkian of Michigan (1928 - 2011). As the paper argues, Dr. Kevorkian’s belief {{in the practice of}} PAS led him to assist in the suicide of James Adkins in 1998. This began his legal problems, which lasted for about ten years (while continuing this practice, causing the state of Michigan to pass stricter laws against PAS). However, it was his more active administration of the suicide of Thomas York (who had Lou Gehrig’s disease), and its demonstration on CBS ’ 60 -Minutes program, that led to his most severe legal ordeal in 1998 that landed him a prison sentence of 10 to 25 years (of which he served 8). In the paper, various ethical, moral, and legal arguments, evoked by ethicists, philosophers and legal experts are presented. However, the paper begins with the ordeal of <b>Dr.</b> <b>Kevorkian</b> and the reaction to the 60 -Minutes piece by the media, religious authors, and others are presented...|$|E
