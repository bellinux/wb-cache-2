Soon afterwards, in 1860, a steamer service to Wales was inaugurated, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> {{commercial}} success, and ended in 1888. Burnham-on-Sea railway station was the terminus of the Burnham branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It opened in 1858, closed to scheduled passenger traffic in 1951, and stopped being used for excursions in 1962. The former Great Western Railway station {{is now known as}} Highbridge and Burnham. A second pier, built of concrete between 1911 and 1914, is claimed to be the shortest pier in Britain.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that ASL is a creole with LSF as the superstrate language and with the native village sign languages as substrate languages. However, more recent {{research has shown that}} modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages. ASL may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but {{it is also possible that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> creole-type language. There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination, for example the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. This might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology. Additionally, Clerc and Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.|$|E

For example, the gull-wing design makes creating a convertible version of the car harder, as the hinges would be removed with the roof, and standard doors would be needed for the convertible.

The party was outlawed by the Dutch East Indies government in 1927.

I didn't consider myself co-producer. Van would ask me questions and I would give him answers, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> defined role." [...] Morrison felt unsatisfied with some of the final recordings, and notably reworked the song [...] "Street Choir" [...] shortly before studio work concluded.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Austrian SS" [...] {{is often}} used to {{describe}} that portion of the SS membership from Austria, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> recognized branch of the SS. In contrast to SS members from other countries, who were grouped into either the Germanic-SS or the Foreign Legions of the Waffen-SS, Austrian SS members were regular SS personnel. It was technically under the command of the SS in Germany, but often acted independently concerning Austrian affairs. The Austrian SS was founded in 1930 and by 1934 was acting as a covert force to bring about the Anschluss with Germany, which occurred in March 1938. Early Austrian SS leaders were Kaltenbrunner and Arthur Seyss-Inquart. Austrian SS members served in every branch of the SS. Political scientist David Art of Tufts University notes that Austrians constituted 8 percent of the Third Reich's population and 13 percent of the SS; he states that 40 percent of the staff and 75 percent of commanders at death camps were Austrian.|$|E

The former track contained the lyrics [...] "What you trying be? My new wife? / What, you Mariah? Fly through twice," [...] while the latter suggested that he begged to be taken back by Carey. Later that year, Eminem confirmed that they had been in a relationship in an interview for Rolling Stone, but claimed to have not been fully committed to it and that he disliked her as a person, while Carey told Maxim that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> [...] "sexual relationship" [...] and interviewer Larry King [...] "I hung out with him, I spoke to him on the phone.
