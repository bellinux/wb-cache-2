5|$|In 1947, he {{adapted the}} <b>isothermal</b> Murnaghan {{equation}} of state, {{which had been}} developed for infinitesimal strain, for Eulerian finite strain, developing what {{is now known as}} the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state.|$|E
5|$|Although thin, these {{outer layers}} {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} white dwarf. The degenerate electrons in the bulk of a white dwarf conduct heat well. Most of a white dwarf's mass is therefore at almost the same temperature (<b>isothermal),</b> {{and it is also}} hot: a white dwarf with surface temperature between 8,000K and 16,000K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000K and 20,000,000K. The white dwarf is kept from cooling very quickly only by its outer layers' opacity to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} {{are used}} to identify infectious diseases such as chlamydia, influenza virus and tuberculosis; or specific strains such as H1N1 virus. Genetic identification can be swift; for example a loop-mediated <b>isothermal</b> amplification test diagnoses the malaria parasite and is rugged enough for developing countries. But despite these advances in genome analysis, in 2013 infections are still more often identified by other meanstheir proteome, bacteriophage, or chromatographic profile. Molecular diagnostics are also used to understand the specific strain of the pathogenfor example by detecting which drug resistance genes it possessesand hence which therapies to avoid.|$|E
25|$|The <b>isothermal</b> {{efficiency}} (Z) is {{a measure}} of where the process lies between an adiabatic and <b>isothermal</b> process. If the efficiency is 0%, then it is totally adiabatic; with an efficiency of 100%, it is totally <b>isothermal.</b> Typically with a near <b>isothermal</b> process an efficiency of 90-95% can be expected.|$|E
25|$|These near <b>isothermal</b> {{compressors}} {{can also}} be used as near <b>isothermal</b> expanders and are being developed to improve the round trip efficiency of CASE.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isothermal</b> - This model {{assumes that}} the {{compressed}} gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy {{is removed from the}} system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. <b>Isothermal</b> compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect <b>isothermal</b> compression. However, with practical devices perfect <b>isothermal</b> compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect <b>isothermal</b> compression.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isothermal</b> Systems and Tessera Technologies partnered on {{a defense}} project that {{received}} $4.5 million in earmarks over 2003 and 2004. <b>Isothermal</b> had Letitia White as a lobbyist; Tessera had her husband, Richard. Tessera paid Richard White $300,000 in fees between 2003 and 2005.|$|E
25|$|The third {{depicted}} {{the locus of}} the <b>isothermal</b> chromaticities on the CIE 1931 x,y chromaticity diagram. Since the <b>isothermal</b> points formed normals on his UCS diagram, transformation back into the xy plane revealed them still to be lines, but no longer perpendicular to the locus.|$|E
25|$|PAN-AC: uses <b>isothermal</b> {{conditions}} for amplification, {{and may be}} used in living cells.|$|E
25|$|When evaluated, the <b>isothermal</b> work {{is found}} to be lower than the {{adiabatic}} work.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isothermal</b> {{compression}} and expansion approaches attempt to maintain operating temperature by constant heat exchange to the environment. They are only practical for low power levels, without very effective heat exchangers. The theoretical efficiency of <b>isothermal</b> energy storage approaches 100% for perfect heat {{transfer to the}} environment. In practice neither of these perfect thermodynamic cycles is obtainable, as some heat losses are unavoidable.|$|E
25|$|The {{compressibility}} equation {{relates the}} <b>isothermal</b> compressibility (and indirectly the pressure) {{to the structure}} of the liquid.|$|E
25|$|A useful {{formula for}} the Gaussian {{curvature}} is Liouville's equation {{in terms of}} the Laplacian in <b>isothermal</b> coordinates.|$|E
25|$|The ideal Otto and Diesel cycles are {{not totally}} {{reversible}} because they involve heat transfer through a finite temperature difference during the irreversible <b>isothermal</b> heat-addition and heat-rejection processes. The irreversibility renders the thermal efficiency of these cycles {{less than that}} of a Carnot engine operating within the same limits of temperature. Another cycle that features <b>isothermal</b> heat-addition and heat-rejection processes is the Stirling cycle, which is an altered version of the Carnot cycle in which the two isentropic processes featured in the Carnot cycle are replaced by two constant-volume regeneration processes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isothermal</b> expansion. The expansion-space and {{associated}} heat exchanger are maintained {{at a constant}} high temperature, and the gas undergoes near-isothermal expansion absorbing heat from the hot source.|$|E
25|$|In an <b>isothermal</b> {{compression}} process, the gas in {{the system}} is kept at a constant temperature throughout. This necessarily requires exchange of heat with the gas, otherwise the temperature would rise during charging and drop during discharge. This heat exchange {{can be achieved by}} heat exchangers (intercooling) between subsequent stages in the compressor, regulator and tank. To avoid wasted energy, the intercoolers must be optimised for high heat transfer and low pressure drop. Smaller compressors can approximate <b>isothermal</b> compression even without intercooling, due to the relatively high ratio of surface area to volume of the compression chamber and the resulting improvement in heat dissipation from the compressor body itself.|$|E
25|$|Newton famously {{considered}} {{the speed of}} sound before most of the development of thermodynamics and so incorrectly used <b>isothermal</b> calculations instead of adiabatic. His result was missing the factor of γ but was otherwise correct.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{experiments}} studied metal melting and crystallisation under microgravity conditions. This experiment, jointly designed by the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, was performed in an <b>isothermal</b> heating furnace.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isothermal</b> {{coordinates}} {{are known}} to exist in a neighbourhood of any point on the surface, although all proofs to date rely on non-trivial results on partial differential equations. There is an elementary proof for minimal surfaces.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} achieve a near {{thermodynamic}} reversible process so {{that most of the}} energy is saved in the system and can be retrieved, and losses are kept negligible, a near reversible <b>isothermal</b> process or an isentropic process is desired.|$|E
25|$|In {{thermodynamics}} {{and fluid}} mechanics, compressibility (also {{known as the}} coefficient of compressibility or <b>isothermal</b> compressibility) {{is a measure of}} the relative volume change of a fluid or solid as a response to a pressure (or mean stress) change.|$|E
25|$|This {{equation}} {{can be used}} {{to obtain}} Joule–Thomson coefficients from the more easily measured <b>isothermal</b> Joule–Thomson coefficient. It is used in the following to obtain a mathematical expression for the Joule–Thomson coefficient in terms of the volumetric properties of a fluid.|$|E
25|$|When the Carnot {{cycle is}} plotted on a {{pressure}} volume diagram, the <b>isothermal</b> stages follow the isotherm lines {{for the working}} fluid, adiabatic stages move between isotherms and the area bounded by the complete cycle path represents the total work {{that can be done}} during one cycle.|$|E
25|$|Conversely given a metric on U a {{coordinate}} {{change on}} U making the metric conformally {{equivalent to the}} metric is a diffeomorphism h of U such that the original metric is a positive smooth function times the induced Euclidean metric; the new coordinates are called <b>isothermal</b> coordinates.|$|E
25|$|Similar inequalities {{are valid}} for other {{classical}} {{conditions for the}} closed systems and the corresponding characteristic functions: for <b>isothermal</b> isobaric conditions the Gibbs free energy decreases, for the isochoric systems with the constant internal energy (isolated systems) the entropy increases {{as well as for}} isobaric systems with the constant enthalpy.|$|E
25|$|If the {{temperature}} in a system remains constant (an <b>isothermal</b> system), vapor at saturation pressure and temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as the system pressure is increased. Similarly, a liquid at saturation pressure and temperature will tend to flash into its vapor phase as system pressure is decreased.|$|E
25|$|Sir Isaac Newton {{computed}} {{the speed}} of sound in air as , which is too low by about 15%,. Newton's analysis was good save for neglecting the (then unknown) effect of rapidly-fluctuating temperature in a sound wave (in modern terms, sound wave compression and expansion of air is an adiabatic process, not an <b>isothermal</b> process). This error was later rectified by Laplace.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{centrifugal}} compressors, commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio {{of more than a}} 3.5 to 1 in any one stage (for a typical gas). Since compression raises the temperature, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more <b>isothermal.</b> The inter-stage coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in vapor-liquid separators.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{experimental}} {{data that are}} used for the determination of solution equilibrium constants. Potentiometric data obtained with a glass electrode are {{the most widely used}} with aqueous solutions. The others are Spectrophotometric, Fluorescence (luminescence) measurements and NMR chemical shift measurements; simultaneous measurement of K and ΔH for 1:1 adducts in biological systems is routinely carried out using <b>Isothermal</b> Titration Calorimetry.|$|E
25|$|Compression of air creates heat; {{the air is}} warmer after compression. Expansion removes heat. If {{no extra}} heat is added, the air will be much colder after expansion. If the heat {{generated}} during compression can be stored and used during expansion, {{the efficiency of the}} storage improves considerably. There are three ways in which a CAES system can deal with the heat. Air storage can be adiabatic, diabatic, or <b>isothermal.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to powder snow avalanches, wet snow avalanches are a low velocity suspension {{of snow and}} water, with the flow confined to the track surface (McClung, first edition 1999, page 108). The low speed of travel {{is due to the}} friction between the sliding surface of the track and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~10–40km/h), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density. The body of the flow of a wet snow avalanche can plough through soft snow, and can scour boulders, earth, trees, and other vegetation; leaving exposed, and often scored, ground in the avalanche track. Wet snow avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snow packs that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water. The <b>isothermal</b> characteristic of wet snow avalanches has led to the secondary term of <b>isothermal</b> slides found in the literature (for example in Daffern, 1999, page 93). At temperate latitudes wet snow avalanches are frequently associated with climatic avalanche cycles {{at the end of the}} winter season, when there is significant daytime warming.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{is neither}} created nor {{destroyed}} during a process. Energy changes from one form to another (see First Law of Thermodynamics). In contrast, exergy is always destroyed when a process is irreversible, for example loss of heat {{to the environment}} (see Second Law of Thermodynamics). This destruction {{is proportional to the}} entropy increase of the system together with its surroundings. The destroyed exergy has been called anergy. For an <b>isothermal</b> process, exergy and energy are interchangeable terms, and there is no anergy.|$|E
25|$|Energy storage systems {{often use}} large {{underground}} caverns. This {{is the preferred}} system design, due to the very large volume, and thus the large quantity of energy that can be stored with only a small pressure change. The cavern space can be easily insulated, compressed adiabatically with little temperature change (approaching a reversible <b>isothermal</b> system) and heat loss (approaching an isentropic system). This advantage is {{in addition to the}} low cost of constructing the gas storage system, using the underground walls to assist in containing the pressure.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} sign {{means that}} work is done on the gas by the surroundings. Process irreversibilities (such as in heat transfer) will result in less energy being recovered from the expansion process than {{is required for the}} compression process. If the environment is at a constant temperature, for example, the thermal resistance in the intercoolers will mean that the compression occurs at a temperature somewhat higher than the ambient temperature, and the expansion will occur at a temperature somewhat lower than ambient temperature. So a perfect <b>isothermal</b> storage system is impossible to achieve.|$|E
25|$|Like most medieval buildings, {{the windows}} at Chartres {{suffered}} badly from the corrosive effects of atmospheric acids during the Industrial Revolution and subsequently. The majority of windows were cleaned and restored by the famous local workshop Atelier Lorin {{at the end}} of the 19th century but they continued to deteriorate. During World War II most of the stained glass was removed from the cathedral and stored in the surrounding countryside to protect it from damage. At the close of the war the windows were taken out of storage and reinstalled. Since then an ongoing programme of conservation has been underway and <b>isothermal</b> secondary glazing was gradually installed on the exterior to protect the windows from further damage.|$|E
25|$|Given a {{centroid}} for the cluster, {{which can}} be determined by using a reconstructed mass distribution or optical or X-ray data, a model can be fit to the shear profile {{as a function of}} clustrocentric radius. For example, the singular <b>isothermal</b> sphere (SIS) profile and the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile are two commonly used parametric models. Knowledge of the lensing cluster redshift and the redshift distribution of the background galaxies is also necessary for estimation of the mass and size from a model fit; these redshifts can be measured precisely using spectroscopy or estimated using photometry. Individual mass estimates from weak lensing can only be derived for the most massive clusters, and the accuracy of these mass estimates are limited by projections along the line of sight.|$|E
