25|$|The crew of HMS Haslemere spotted Johnson's {{parachute}} coming <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> {{her alive}} in the water, calling for help. Conditions were poor – there was a heavy sea and a strong tide, snow was falling and it was intensely cold. Lt Cmdr Walter Fletcher, the commander of Haslemere, dived into the water {{in an attempt to}} rescue Johnson. Fletcher failed in the attempt. As a result of the intense cold he died in hospital days later. In 2016, Alec Gill, a historian, claimed that the son of a crew member stated that Johnson had died because she was sucked into the blades of the ship's propellers; the crewman did not observe this to occur, but only supposed that it might have done. This claim has not been verified, as Johnson's body was never recovered.|$|E
25|$|Having {{lost the}} Test {{series on the}} {{previous}} Saturday, the mid-week Lions came to Eden Park with something to prove. Refereed by New Zealander Steve Walsh, the match was marked by the Lions' inability to find touch and Auckland's willingness to attack and run the angles. Auckland gave up some guaranteed points from early penalties to take the Lions on in set piece play. Auckland tighthead prop John Afoa was denied a try after a tap and run saw him held up in goal. A series of handling errors throughout the first half let Auckland <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the Lions to a 14–3 lead at the half. The second half saw the Lions give away points to a stoic Auckland pack and the scoreline was narrowed to 14–13 Lions lead. A late Ronan O'Gara penalty saw the Lions extend to a 4-point winning margin of 17–13. This victory completed an impressive clean sweep of matches for the mid week Lions against host Unions throughout New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|For Richthofen, {{this was}} the first of the 80 {{confirmed}} aerial combat victories with which he was credited before his death in April 1918. The circumstances foreshadowed his death later in the war. His account of the event noted that the pilot was probably experienced, as he appeared conscious of the danger he was in and did his best to escape, as von Richthofen manoeuvred his new Albatros D.II serial number 491/16, into position to attack. Rees, in the observer's position, fired constantly from the forward-facing Lewis machine-gun (which could also be turned to fire backwards over the pilot). Von Richthofen recounted that at the time he was not sure whether the F.E.2b would fall, until he was able to close up behind it during a moment of non-evasive flying, taking advantage of the F.E.2b's vulnerability underneath. After he fired, the propeller stopped turning, indicating that he must have hit the engine. Rees was not visible and the plane was flying unsteadily, indicating to von Richthofen that both British men had been injured. Morris managed to land the aeroplane at a nearby German airfield at Flesquières. Von Richthofen followed the F. E. 2b <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the dead observer and badly wounded pilot (who died later the same day), then flew back to his squadron's base at Bertincourt.|$|E

2500|$|More {{than once}} he had a severe {{reaction}} to a drug. In Kessler, he tried a drug named Sygen which was theorized to help reduce damage to the spinal cord. The drug caused him to go into anaphylactic shock, and his heart stopped. He claimed to have had an out-of-body experience and remembered saying, [...] "I'm sorry, but I have to go now", during the event. In his autobiography, he wrote, [...] "and then I left my body. I was up on the ceiling...I looked <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> my body {{stretched out on the}} bed, not moving, while everybody—there were 15 or 20 people, the doctors, the EMTs, the nurses—was working on me. The noise and commotion grew quieter as though someone were gradually turning down the volume." [...] After receiving a large dose of epinephrine, he woke up and stabilized later that night.|$|E
2500|$|... …I was {{standing}} upstairs when I heard {{some sort of}} growing noise, then I saw the corrugated turbine cover rise and stand on end. Then I saw the rotor rising from underneath it. It was spinning. I could not believe my eyes. It rose about three meters. Rocks and pieces of metal went flying, we started to dodge them… At that point the corrugated cover was nearly at roof level, and the roof itself had been destroyed… I made a mental calculation: the water is rising, 380 cubic meters per second, so I took to my heels {{and ran for the}} № 10 turbine. I thought that I wouldn't make it, I climbed higher, stopped, looked <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> everything getting destroyed, water coming in, people trying to swim… I thought: someone must urgently shut the gates to stop the water, manually… Manually, because there was no power, none of the protection systems had worked… ...|$|E
2500|$|Reserve sophomore {{running back}} Mikell Simpson racked up 119 yards rushing and two TDs {{to go along}} with 152 {{receiving}} yards, for 271 all-purpose yards, as 19th-ranked Virginia came from behind to defeat Maryland. The game ended when, with 16 seconds left, Simpson dived into the endzone as the ball was knocked out of his hands. It was ruled a touchdown and Virginia defeated Maryland. Terps coach Ralph Friedgen said [...] "I saw the ball come out on the goal line. I saw it and I don't think he had possession." [...] Simpson himself stated, [...] "It crossed the line. I knew I scored because I looked <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the yellow line and I saw the ball cross [...] they hit it out." [...] With the victory, the Cavaliers reached seven wins in a row {{for the first time since}} 1990 and for only the fourth time in school history. They also accomplished the feat in 1914 and 1949. That season, Virginia won an NCAA record of five games by two points or less, with the other edged teams being North Carolina, Middle Tennessee State, Connecticut, and Wake Forest.|$|E

60|$|I had {{observed}} it, and had often wondered {{whether she had}} too. I must have shown as much, now, in my face; for her eyes were in a moment cast <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>saw</b> tears in them.|$|R

60|$|The {{man looked}} up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the roadway <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> {{that nobody else}} was in sight, {{that part of the}} highway being but little traveled. Then he came closer to the {{unconscious}} boy and bent over him.|$|R
60|$|At last John woke up also. He {{stretched}} his arms yawning, {{and for the}} first time became aware of the weight upon his breast. He glanced <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> dimly at first--then more clearly.|$|E

60|$|Turnbull looked <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> {{that the}} {{polished}} car was literally lit up from underneath by the far-flung fires from below. Underneath whole squares and solid districts were in flames, like prairies or forests on fire.|$|E

60|$|He heard Willems {{shouting}} something, {{waited for}} awhile, then glanced vaguely <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the woman still stretched out perfectly mute and unstirring, {{with her head}} at his feet. He felt a nervous impatience that, somehow, resembled fear.|$|E
6000|$|Kipps looked <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> a swift line of scarlet rush {{down his}} hand. He {{perceived}} {{the other man}} student regarding this with magnified eyes.

60|$|Like {{lightning}} he stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> I <b>saw</b> {{something in}} his hand flash before my eyes. There was a strange burning pain and then everything faded away before my sight.

Then all sound became concentrated in a confused roar, which throbbed for a moment in my ears and then died away. Unconsciousness crept in upon me.|$|R
60|$|He {{tightened}} his hold {{in time to}} prevent her sinking on the floor, but she cried out in a terrible voice, 'I shall die if you hold me! Let me fall upon the ground!'
