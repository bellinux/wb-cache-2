5|$|Deep <b>frying</b> (also {{referred}} to as deep fat <b>frying)</b> is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional <b>frying,</b> done in a <b>frying</b> pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep <b>frying</b> may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep <b>frying</b> is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep <b>frying</b> foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E
5|$|Deep <b>frying</b> {{is popular}} worldwide, with deep-fried foods {{accounting}} {{for a large}} portion of global caloric consumption. Many foods are deep-fried and cultures surrounding deep <b>frying</b> have developed, most notably in the Southern United States, where many events dedicated to deep <b>frying</b> food and non-edible items are held.|$|E
5|$|Deep <b>frying</b> {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep <b>frying</b> is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for <b>frying</b> over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E

5|$|<b>Frying</b> food {{in olive}} oil is attested in Classical Greece from about the 5th century BCE. The late Roman {{cookbook}} of Apicius (c. 400), appears to list the ancient Romans' first use of deep <b>frying</b> to prepare Pullum Frontonianum, a chicken dish. The practice of deep <b>frying</b> spread {{to other parts of}} Europe and Arabia in the following centuries. Deep-fried foods such as funnel cakes arrived in northern Europe by the 13th century, and deep-fried fish recipes have been found in cookbooks in Spain and Portugal at around the same time. Falafel arrived in the Middle East from population migrations from Egypt as soon as the 14th century. The deep <b>frying</b> of food in Japan was likely introduced by Portuguese the 16th century. Evidence of potato <b>frying</b> can be found as early as the late 17th century in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Stir frying: Stir <b>frying</b> is a Chinese cooking {{technique}} used for preparing {{food in a}} wok. It originates from the Han Dynasty, but did not fully develop until the Song Dynasty. Although there are no surviving records of Han Dynasty stir <b>frying,</b> archaeological evidence of woks and the tendency to slice food thinly indicate that the technique was likely used for cooking. It {{was not until the}} Ming Dynasty that stir <b>frying</b> was popularized as primary cooking method of Chinese cuisine. Stir <b>frying</b> was brought to America by early Chinese immigrants, and has been used for non-Asian cuisines.|$|E

5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} <b>frying,</b> simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and <b>frying.</b> The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E
5|$|Pan <b>frying</b> (or shallow <b>frying)</b> {{requires}} a <b>frying</b> pan of sturdy construction {{and a source}} of fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
5|$|Sanders {{was unhappy}} with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron <b>frying</b> pan, {{but he refused to}} deep fry the chicken, which he {{believed}} lowered the quality of the product. If he pre-cooked the chicken in advance of orders, there was sometimes wastage at day's end. In 1939, the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market, mostly designed for steaming vegetables. Sanders bought one, and modified it into a pressure fryer, which he then used to fry chicken. The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep <b>frying,</b> while, in the opinion of Sanders, retaining the quality of pan-fried chicken.|$|E
