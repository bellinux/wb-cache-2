He personally wanted to help the Palauans become self-sufficient, but the TTPI wanted to focus on improving Micronesia–United States relations. Nevertheless, he established community schools that replaced the Japanese three Rs <b>educational</b> <b>model</b> with Deweyism. In 1962, the TTPI assigned Vitarelli as an architect and project coordinator in the Accelerated Elementary School Program (AESP), a project costing over one million dollars. He wanted to have local Palauans to build schools and houses under this program. The TTPI rejected these plans, insisting that the locals could not meet the project's physical specifications. As a result of this conflict, the TTPI transferred Vitarelli to its headquarters in Saipan. While on Saipan, Vitarelli used local bayogo seeds to create the Bo Jo Bo Wishing Doll for an upcoming arts festival. These traditional-style dolls are still sold on Saipan today.|$|E

After the end of Great Sioux War in 1877, the Lakota people were impoverished, harassed and confined to a reservation. At the time, many people believed Native Americans were a vanishing race whose only hope for survival was rapid cultural transformation. The U.S. government urgently sought a progressive <b>educational</b> <b>model</b> to rapidly assimilate Indians into white culture. Whether this could be achieved and how rapidly it could be done was unknown. Pratt believed he could make use of the Carlisle facility.

These languages are both technically and organisationally quite demanding. Their implementation therefore constitutes a major innovation. Two different implementation cases of the <b>educational</b> <b>modelling</b> language EML provide the data for the investigation. The one case is situated in an institution for higher professional education that caters for on-campus students, the other in an institution for higher, open distance education that serves off-campus, home-based students. Together, the cases represent two important dimensions of the space of possible <b>educational</b> <b>modelling</b> language implementations. Rogers' diffusion-innovation theory is used as the backdrop for the analysis of the cases. It not only provides a common yard stick, but more importantly helps understand why the implementations failed in particular respects. Thus, it helps formulate guidelines for future implementations. In this respect, a current candidate, IMS Learning Design, is discussed at some length...|$|R

25|$|The {{physical}} {{structure of the}} building itself has {{been the target of}} many complaints, notably due to its poor internal ventilation, and its noticeable lack of exterior windows (there are windows inside the school). This architectural peculiarity is accounted for by the fact that Thornlea was originally intended to be a prototype for an <b>educational</b> <b>model</b> where extrinsic stimuli (such as vegetation, the sky, wildlife) are minimized, while intrinsic stimuli (such as bookshelves, other students in class, computer terminals) are maximized. The idea was that students would then be less distracted and more psychologically conditioned to focus on their studies during the day. However, some classrooms and staff rooms are located {{in the middle of the}} school surrounded by walls. This leads to overheating and poor ventilation in summer. At some point the experiment was abandoned, and a new southern wing was built during the 2000–01 school year, complete with windows for every classroom that has an externally facing wall.|$|E
25|$|By the 1960s, {{psychotherapy}} {{had become}} imbedded within clinical psychology, {{but for many}} the Ph.D. <b>educational</b> <b>model</b> did not offer the necessary training {{for those interested in}} practice rather than research. There was a growing argument that said the field of psychology in the U.S. had developed to a degree warranting explicit training in clinical practice. The concept of a practice-oriented degree was debated in 1965 and narrowly gained approval for a pilot program at the University of Illinois starting in 1968. Several other similar programs were instituted soon after, and in 1973, at the Vail Conference on Professional Training in Psychology, the practitioner–scholar model of clinical psychology—or Vail Model—resulting in the Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) degree was recognized. Although training would continue to include research skills and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. The first program explicitly based on the Psy.D. model was instituted at Rutgers University. Today, about half of all American graduate students in clinical psychology are enrolled in Psy.D. programs.|$|E

Furthermore, supporting human-oriented knowledge management instruments are needed to facilitate the exchange and reuse process. The DIN Didactical Object Model, developed by the German Standards Body (Deutsches Institut für Normung, DIN e. V.), provides specifications for this. Additionally, an integrative concept for knowledge sharing and reuse is presented: the solution integrates business, learning, and knowledge processes into a common architecture using the Didactical Object Model to exchange scenarios.
