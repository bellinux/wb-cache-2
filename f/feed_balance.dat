40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the role of livestock in smallholder mixed farming systems, and to determine variations in livestock inventory in relation to changes in socio-economic status and rural population density in the Harar Highlands of Ethiopia. Livestock <b>feed</b> <b>balance,</b> household food adequacy level, and soil humus balance of annually cropped plots were identified as proxy indicators of sustainability. The long-term dynamics of the crop-livestock sub-system within the evolving livelihood system was also examined. The study showed that farmers and experts differed in their views regarding livestock production objectives, constraints and development measures. Farmers in different well-being categories varied in their livestock inventories, showing differences in their production strategies and needs. Only poor farmers had enough feed to meet maintenance requirement of their livestock while others were largely deficit. <b>Feed</b> <b>balance</b> results failed to portray field reality, as knowledge about tropical feeds and the adaptive potentials of indigenous breeds is limited, undermining the potential use of <b>feed</b> <b>balance</b> as an indicator of sustainability of smallholder mixed farms. Both household energy adequacy levels and the per cent contribution of livestock to total household energy supply varied significantly with well-being categories. Households in medium and well-to-do categories were high in household energy adequacy levels whereas poor households could not meet their energy demands. Also, the estimated soil humus balances of annually cropped plots of poor households were negative whereas those of other farmers were positive, and values increased with higher livestock holding. The variations across districts and across well-being categories were highly significant. Livestock inventory declined with rural population density and increased with socio-economic status, and variations were significant. But the number of livestock per unit area of cultivated land increased significantly with rural population density. The number and overall transport performance of dondeys increased significantly with socio-economic status, indicating the growing importance of non-agricultural activities and signalling a change in livelihood systems and the functions of livestock. The trend and dynamics of the crop-livestock sub-system was also studied, using system dynamics modelling. Complementary and competitive relations among sub-system components were depicted, the critical role of livestock in the livelihood system illustrated, and a conceptual model framework containing key elements and flows developed. As the role of livestock in the livelihood systems remains central, the focus of technology choice and promotion has to shift from crop or livestock to crop and livestock production system. The thesis that as land resources dwindle mixed farming systems will have to specialize or would face involution, does not seem to hold for the Harar Highlands of Ethiopia, at least in the foreseeable future. Agricultural development initiatives must therefore consider the crucial role of livestock in smallholder mixed farming systems even when farm sizes decline...|$|E
40|$|A {{central concern}} of the Grain & Graze research, {{development}} and extension program has been improving {{the management of the}} feedbase on mixed farms through addressing ‘feed gaps’ – times of year during which the supply of forage is insufficient to meet livestock demand. In this review,weuse the available data on pasture growth and quality, supplemented by modelling results, to describe the characteristic timing of feed gaps across the Australian cereal-livestock zone. Feedbase interventions studied during the Grain & Graze program have mainly addressed the supply side of the <b>feed</b> <b>balance</b> equation. We review these studies, paying particular attention to the time scale of the variability in the <b>feed</b> <b>balance</b> that each intervention is intended to address. We conclude that grazing of cereals (either dual-purpose or forage crops) is the most promising means of alleviating winter feed gaps in regions where they are important. Reducing feed gaps in summer by relying on unpredictable summer rainfall events will increase year-to-year variability in forage production and will therefore require moreflexible livestock management systems to exploit it. The use of forage shrubs offers a practical tool for increasing the predictability of summer and autumn feed supply, but given their moderate capacity for providing additional metabolisable energy it remains important to carefully manage livestock over autumn and to manage the herbaceous inter-row pasture. Feed gaps mainly arise from an interaction between biology and economics. Wefind, however, that the options studied in the Grain&Graze program for addressing feed gaps require either greater complexity in pasture and grazing management or more opportunistic livestock trading; they therefore comeat a cost to the manager’s limited decision-making time. Times with feed gaps are also times when particular natural resource management risks (especially erosion) need to be managed. Supplyside interventions to relieve feed gaps will generally use more soil water, which will often have positive effects on natural resource management outcomes. Andrew D. Moore, Lindsay W.

40|$|THE EFFECT OF SUBSTITUTION FERMENTED AMTABIS WITH Aspergillus niger ON BROILER PERFORMANCEByMUHAMMAD ASRILABSTRACTStudy on {{the effect}} of {{substitution}} fermented Amtabis with Aspergillus niger on broiler performance was conducted at Experimental Farm Laboratory, Animal Husbandry Department, Syiah Kuala University Darussalam Banda Aceh from 4 December 2015 to 9 January 2016. The purposes {{of this study was to}} evaluate substitution of fermented Amtabis with commercial broiler on broiler performance including body weight, feed consumption and feed conversion ratio. Totally 100 DOC were used in this study for 35 day. The experiment was designed by using completely randomized design (CRD) consisting 4 treatments (P 0 = 0 %, P 1 = 2 %, P 2 = 4 %, and P 3 = 6 % of Amtabis in the commercial feed) and 5 replications. Parameters which were observed in this study were body weight, feed consumption and feed conversion ratio. The results on the study indicate that substitution of Amtabis in commercial feed significantly effected (P 0, 05) on feed consumption, feed conversion ratio and feed efficiency. Decreasing of performance broiler by substitution Amtabis in the commercial feed was probably caused by imbalance of nutritive feed formulation after Amtabis substitution.

The plant was designed around 40 mol% hydrogen <b>feed</b> (<b>balance</b> CO 2) at 3 MPa, operating at up to 500 °C. Flow was split into 10 parallel membrane trains with membranes staged in each train in series or parallel arrangements. Each stage was a fixed module of 100 m 2. Membrane system modelling revealed that at least 4 stages is needed to ensure plant feed flow is {{kept to a minimum}} (large feed flows put demand on gasifier size). The series train achieved lower feed flows and better total recovery of H 2 as compared to the parallel train. The parallel train did however achieve better outlet concentration of H 2 (i. e. 77 mol% vs. 64 mol% for 4 stage systems), but this improvement appeared outweighed by the lower feed flow required (27 % lower) and better permeate H 2 recovery. The capital cost of constructing a 4 -stage train (40 stages total) system was estimated at over AUD$ 20 M, being mostly made up of membrane cost (38 %) and the membrane vessel (36 %).

30|$|Remote sensing {{along with}} {{household}} surveys is an innovative approach to assess farm system dynamics. LULC change, grain production pressure, and pressure on feed resources {{are the three}} major indicators that measure land conversion and food and <b>feed</b> <b>balance.</b> Conservation structures, woodlands, water resources, irrigation activities, afro-alpine reserves, access to road and local market, and recently introduced practices—such as highland fruits, malt barley seeds, tree lucerne seedlings, and improved animal breeds—are important interventions to improve land productivity, economic gains, and food security. Increased numbers of endangered tree species, high grazing pressure, and intensive land conversions are, however, potential threats to enhance the management of improved land resources. Settlement and plantation have increased tremendously, {{in line with the}} increasing human population. The rising population is also causing a concomitant shrinkage in natural vegetation. If the underlying crop-livestock dynamics affecting the system remain unchanged, competition for land resources and environmental damage is certain to accelerate. This situation warrants further investment in sustainable land resource management and efficient institutional arrangements that can preserve the natural landscape and minimize the extent of crop-livestock competition. Promoting multipurpose forage and crop varieties could provide enough biomass {{to meet the needs of}} humans and livestock as well as enhance soil fertility. Increasing crop production alone will not be sufficient to meet the farmers’ animal feed. We conclude that the adoption of improved forages and fodder species and better integrating crop-livestock production can sustainably alleviate human food and animal feed demands in the highlands of Ethiopia.|$|E

Mean basal and supplement (P< 0. 001) and total (P< 0. 01) DM intake, mean CP intake (P< 0. 001) from basal, supplement and total diet, and mean energy intake from basal (P< 0. 001) and supplement (P< 0. 01) varied among the production subsystems. Basal and supplemental dry matter, crude protein and energy intakes varied (P< 0. 001) among herd size groups (i. e. small, medium and large), where medium sized farms had higher (P< 0. 001) supplemental dry matter, crude protein and energy intakes, while small farms had higher (P< 0. 001) basal dry matter, crude protein and energy intakes. Basal and total (P< 0. 001) crude protein intakes were greatest in the long rainy season. Annual dry matter and crude protein intakes close to calculated requirements for intra-urban and secondary town, but 1. 5 % lower than requirement for large peri-urban farms.

System productivity is sub-optimal due to lack of management skills, <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> (30 % protein-content tilapia feed) shortages and deficient technical assistance. To overcome resource limitations, producers complement <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> with the leaves of tree spinach (Cnidoscolus chayamansa), a plant found in Yucatan, other parts of Mexico, Central and South America, Africa, Asia and Oceania. Based on experimental data, a bioeconomic analysis was made to determine (1) the combination of <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> and tree spinach leaves which minimizes production costs and (2) the combination which maximizes economic returns. In a limited-resource scenario, a combination of 50 % <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> at manufacturer-recommended ration plus tree spinach ad libitum reduced feeding costs and increased producer economic returns by 37. 9 % vs. a complete <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> diet, 48. 4 % vs. a half-complete diet, and 98. 3 % vs. satiety rations.

40|$|The study aims to {{estimate}} the livestock water productivity (LWP) and to {{examine the effect of}} grazing area closure and feeding strategies on LWP at farm household level under wealth and intervention categories at Lencha Dima watershed. Results are based on survey of 120 sample households and focus group discussion. Beneficial outputs of livestock and depleted water for producing them were estimated then livestock water productivity as the ratio of the beneficial out puts and depleted water was estimated. LWP shows difference between participant with in the interventions and non participant with the intervention farm households. The value of LWP in ETB was 1. 7 ± 0. 3 in non participant farm household and 0. 79 ± 0. 03 in participant farm household and it ranges from 1. 7 at better off non participant farm household to 0. 7 in very poor participant farm households. The highest livestock feed financial water productivity was estimated at very poor non participant farm households (5. 5 ± 2. 3 ETB m- 3 per year). Crop residue accounted much in depleted water for livestock feed production and it is also the major contributor for livestock feed resource base, which were found at negative <b>feed</b> <b>balance</b> to the existing livestock holding at household and watershed level. To mitigate this shortage framers use different feeding strategies according to livestock importance and age. Much of the beneficial output valued at the present LWP accounted by traction and transport services and ranked as the primary purpose of cattle.

Secondary data sources and field observations, key informants discussions and semi-structured questionnaire interview were employed to generate data. The district was stratified into upper, mid and lower altitudes and a total of 90 respondents (upper= 30, mid= 30 and lower= 30) were randomly selected and interviewed individually. Samples of feed and soil were collected from three altitudes during the dry and wet seasons and their mineral concentrations were determined. The results of the study indicated that the major feed resources were grazing of natural pasture (58. 9 %), wheat straw (42. 4 %), barley straw (30 %) and hay (21. 1 %). During the dry season, 90 % of the respondents feed their animal crop residues, hay (58. 8 %) and stubble grazing (56. 1 %). Natural pasture was the major feed source during the wet season. Most respondents (46. 7 %) had their own natural pasture lands, 86. 7 % produced crop residues from their crop land whereas only 25. 6 % were producing improved forages. The major constraints related to livestock feed were shortage of grazing land, absence of feed processors and retailers, shortage of technologies in feed production and lack of awareness of the respondents. The total maintenance DM of feed requirement of the animals per year in the district was 388, 859. 8 tons while the actual DM of feed production was 212, 047. 15 tons. The total DM of feed produced per year fulfilled the maintenance requirement of the animals only for 6. 54 months of the year. Concentrations of most minerals in the soil were above the critical level of plant growth and most macro minerals in the feed were below the requirement of dairy animals while micro minerals were above the requirement of dairy animals except Mn. Alternative feed production technologies such as development of improved forages, efficient feed utilization technologies (eg. provision of chopper) and natural pasture land improvement measures should be taken.

General linear model (GLM) was fitted for dry matter yield of private grazing lands of the household in tonnes over covariates household grazing land size and number of households’ livestock in TLU for each type of livestock’s. Models were fitted for crop residues dry matter yield and aftermaths of the households including utilization efficiency and all were significant. Average family size of the households was 8. 52 with literacy of the households’ leaders’ value of 52. 5 % for the Woreda overall. Mean holdings of total lands did not vary between the two farming systems significantly (P > 0. 05) but land use systems varied between the two study sites significantly (P 0. 05) with Pepper / Wheat /Livestock farming system having higher values than Teff / Haricot bean /Livestock system. Similarly, livestock holding in tropical livestock unit (TLU) and total dry matter (DM) productions of feed resources were significantly different between the two study sites (P 0. 05) and the major sources of feeds for livestock near to 78 % are obtained from crop residues followed by grazing lands. In this regard rate of cultivation of lands is far great for Teff / Haricot Bean /Livestock system and significant differences of crop residues yield was observed between the two study sites (P< 0. 05). Results are based on 114 sample households’ surveyed in the two great strata of the Woreda called farming systems at two seasons which varied mainly on the types of commodities they produce and species of animals’ dominance. The results of the models showed that the following variables with the corresponding P-value in the bracket were found to have a significant effect over the dependent variable dry matter yield of grazing land, household grazing land size in hectar (< 0. 0001), numbers of household livestock in TLU for horse (0. 03), mature female donkey (0. 04), and for dairy cows (0. 07). Livestock <b>feed</b> <b>balance</b> in terms of dry matter yield showed that a total of 1, 224. 6 tonnes of dry matter are produced for a total TLU values of 1, 128. 2 making their ratio to 1. 09 but in actuality 3, 178 tonnes of dry matter is required for the surveyed existing stocks regardless of the nutritional content of the dry matter. Quantification estimate clearly showed that the time of abundant feeds availability in the Woreda is only five months. Seasonal variation of feed is high and efficient utilizations of what is produced is still quite less than 65 % because of non-storage of crop residues during crop harvest, wastage by trampling and lack of improvement {{of the quality of the}} feed. Plots of, private grazing lands in front of homestead are usually the main sources of feeds for livestock, during cultivation and hence is over grazed.

High production of crop residues dry matter that make the two systems complement to one another, locally available sodic soil of the area called bole in addition to better livestock market out let is an existing opportunity. Forage development is a key to skip feed shortages if practiced but it is at an infant stage in terms of usage in the study areas and the main reasons of which are highly attributed to shortage of land, seed and knowledge gap. Interventions to utilize locally available potential feeds, better access to forage and fodder development, water development and quality improvement of straws are optioned as a way out to profit from the livestock sector in the study areas.

Breeding efficiency appears to be correlated with concentrations of trace elements (Kumar and Vadhve, 1984). In recent years, the interest in nutritional significance of trace minerals in animal reproduction has markedly increased. The imbalance or deficiency of trace elements leads to inactive ovaries and repeat breeding in dairy animals. (Hidiroglou, 1979). Therefore, {{the present study was}} aimed to relate the blood profile of these compounds (Cu, Co, Zn, and Iron) with fertility status in Surti buffaloes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Perinephric pseudocyst is a {{rare disease}} that affects animals and humans. It is {{characterized}} by an accumu-lation of serous fl uid around of one or both kidneys, and in cats the manifestation as sub-capsular, containing liquid with transudate characteristics are most frequently observed. The etiology is not well understood yet, but {{it is known that}} it is associated with chronic renal injury. While it has no direct relation to race and gender, it shows a higher occurrence in elderly patients above 10 years. According to the scientifi c literature, surgery is the treatment of choice for this condition. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} report the fi rst case of bilateral perinephric pseudocyst in a young cat in Brazil, treated with palliative maneuver associated with a therapeutic <b>feeding</b> <b>balanced.</b> Case: A 1 -year-old Siamese cat, 3 kg, female non-castrated was referred for clinical investigation in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It presented a 30 days history of progressive increase of abdominal volume, followed also by weight loss, hyporexia, and apathy. The patient underwent to an abdominal ultrasound, showing a large cyst in both kidneys, sugges-tive of perinephric pseudocyst. It was found that the surgical therapy would the choice for such alterations; however, th...|$|R

The effects of load admittance and excitation capacitance on magnetizing reactance, frequency, terminal voltage, currents {{have been shown}} in this paper. The equivalent circuit of SEIG has been analyzed by loop impedance method to develop circuit equation which is non-linear in nature. This can be easily solved by genetic algorithm (GA) optimization technique. The simulated results obtained using genetic algorithm help in understanding the steady state performance of SEIG. Keywords—equivalent circuit, GA, magnetizing reactance, SEIG and steady state performance.

40|$|A split coaxial balun with a step {{transition}} {{of the inner}} conductor diameter is introduced to satisfy impedance matching between unbalanced feeder and balanced antennas. The location of the step transition along the axis of the balun and the diameter change are two dimensional parameters that are not present in the conventional split coaxial balun. These additional parameters, together with the double slot width, provide more flexibility to design the balun for better impedance matching. The effects of the three dimensional parameters on the input impedance seen at the (unbalanced) coaxial line side of the balun are investigated when it is terminated with specific lumped impedance at its (balanced) split side. An optimization procedure is introduced {{to arrive at the}} balun dimensional parameters to give the best matching with specific load impedance. The proposed balun is designed to <b>feed</b> (<b>balanced)</b> two-arm antennas such as the dipole and the bowtie antenna from 50 [*]Ω-coaxial line. The electromagnetic simulation shows that the proposed balun results in a perfect impedance matching. A comparison with the performance of the conventional split balun used to feed a dipole antenna shows that the balun proposed in the present paper gives a much lower value of the return loss at the design frequency and a wider bandwidth for VSWR ≤ 1. 5. The simulation results obtained using the MoM are compared with experimental measurements showing good agreement...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the effect of breed, feed type and sex, on the final body weight in New Zealand white and Blanc de Termonde rabbits. The experiment was conducted on a farm in the Małopolska Province in the south of Poland. Rabbits of both breeds were kept in identical conditions up to the age of 90 days. However, they were fed using two different methods – with commercial <b>balanced</b> (granulated) <b>feed</b> (9. 75 MJ, 155 g protein) and farm-made feed (9. 54 MJ, 157 g protein). Among New Zealand White rabbits, commercial <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> was given to 38 males and 42 females, whereas farm-made feed to 37 males and 38 females. Among Blanc de Termonde rabbits, commercial <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> was given to 65 males and 68 females, and farm-made feed to 54 males and 60 females. Daily gains were determined for both examined breeds divided into sexes. Then, we calculated interactions between breed and feed type, between breed and sex, as well as between feed type and sex. The mean body weights on the 90 th day of fattening differed for both sexes and feed types. For both rabbit breeds, the higher mean final body weight was observed in case of feeding with the commercial <b>balanced</b> <b>feed,</b> whereas the highest body weight (2515. 13 g) was registered for the females of Blanc de Termonde rabbits...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the technical efficiency (TE) of the milk production on totally 83 cattle herds (database of APRC Nitra) in the period 2006 - 2010 and to synthesise impact of the main inputs (costs) on the TE value. A nonparametric approach Data Envelopment Analysis with the input-oriented variable return to scale model was used to evaluate the TE value. Average value of TE in the analysed period was 0. 96, i. e. evaluated herds reached 96 % of technical efficiency in milk production on average. For these, reduction of inputs by 4 % is recommended to reach the efficiency at the given level of milk yield. Value of individual inputs: total feed costs, material costs, labour costs, repair and service, depreciation, other direct costs and overhead costs, should be reduced by 3. 7, 10. 0, 3. 3, 15. 8, 2. 1, 2. 9 and 8. 5 % respectively, while maintaining the same level of output. It is possible to state that the analysed farms are inefficient in utilization of inputs for the given level of output. The TE value was statistically significantly influenced by the feed costs only. The negative influence of this factor indicates inefficient utilization of <b>feeds</b> (<b>balance</b> of <b>feeding</b> ration, losses of storage, reciprocal substitution of feeds) or inefficient utilization of its production potential in relation to the given output level...|$|R
