5|$|The 1926 World Series {{was also}} known for Ruth's promise to Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy. Ruth promised the child that he would <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run on his behalf. Sylvester had been injured in a fall from a horse, {{and a friend of}} Sylvester's father gave the boy two autographed baseballs signed by Yankees and Cardinals. The friend relayed a promise from Ruth (who did not know the boy) that he would <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run for him. After the Series, Ruth visited the boy in the hospital. When the matter became public, the press greatly {{inflated}} it, and by some accounts, Ruth allegedly saved the boy's life by visiting him, emotionally promising to <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run, and doing so.|$|E

5|$|Musial {{made his}} 12th NL All-Star {{appearance}} in 1955 as a reserve player, when Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski outpolled him by 150,000 votes {{to get on}} the starting lineup at first base.

5|$|On July 9, 2011, Jeter {{recorded}} his 3,000th career <b>hit,</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run off of David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays. Jeter finished {{the day with}} five hits in five at-bats, the second player to have five hits {{on the day he}} achieved his 3,000th hit (the first was Craig Biggio). He also became the second player to <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run for his 3,000th hit, Wade Boggs having done so in 1999. The last of Jeter's five hits proved to be the game-winning hit. He is {{the only member of the}} 3,000 hit club to record all of his hits with the New York Yankees, and the only player to join the club as a Yankee. Jeter became the second player to reach 3,000 career hits while still a regular shortstop (the first was Honus Wagner). Only Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, and Robin Yount were younger than Jeter on the day of their 3,000th hit. MLB and HBO produced Derek Jeter 3K, a documentary that profiled his path to 3,000 hits and originally aired on July 28, 2011.|$|E
