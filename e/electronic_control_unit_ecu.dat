25|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>ECU),</b> {{provided}} by MoTeC, {{is used to}} monitor and optimise {{various aspects of the}} engine's performance. Numerous sensors in the car collect information which is then transmitted to the team, allowing them to monitor things such as tyre wear and fuel consumption and find potential problems with the car. The ECU is also used by officials during the scrutineering process.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} {{new technology is}} the electronically controlled 'active differential'. An <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>ECU)</b> uses inputs from multiple sensors, including yaw rate, steering input angle, and lateral acceleration—and adjusts the distribution of torque to compensate for undesirable handling behaviours like understeer. Active differentials used to play {{a large role in}} the World Rally Championship, but in the 2006 season the FIA has limited the use of active differentials to only those drivers who have not competed in the World Rally Championship in the last five years.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain of}} the ESC {{system is the}} <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>ECU).</b> The various control {{techniques}} are embedded in it. Often, the same ECU is used for diverse systems {{at the same time}} (ABS, Traction control system, climate control, etc.). The input signals are sent through the input-circuit to the digital controller. The desired vehicle state is determined based upon the steering wheel angle, its gradient and the wheel speed. Simultaneously, the yaw sensor measures the actual state. The controller computes the needed brake or acceleration force for each wheel and directs via the driver circuits the valves of the hydraulic modulator. Via a Controller Area Network interface the ECU is connected with other systems (ABS, etc.) in order to avoid giving contradictory commands.|$|E

25|$|Typically ABS {{includes}} a central <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>ECU),</b> four wheel speed sensors, {{and at least}} two hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the rotational speed of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending wheel lock, it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{kinetic energy}} {{recovery}} system—known from [...] to 2013 as KERS, and renamed from 2014 as ERS-K—was incorporated into {{the design of the}} engine and its usage increased; its function as a supplementary power source was taken by the introduction of the heat-based energy recovery system (ERS). The ERS unit captured waste heat as it was dispelled from the exhaust turbocharger, using an electrical device known as a heat motor generator unit. This waste heat was stored as an electrical charge until it was used by a complementary system called the kinetic motor generator unit. This device was connected directly to the drive train to deliver the additional power in the most direct and efficient way. In combination with the ERS-K it gave drivers an additional [...] for thirty-three seconds per lap, compared to the KERS units used prior to 2014, which gave drivers [...] for six seconds per lap. This energy was released into the powertrain by the <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>ECU)</b> to promote the most efficient and effective application of the power, but the driver had the ability to manually override the ECU and use the remaining available power instantly.|$|E
