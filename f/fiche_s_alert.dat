The aimed {{of this study was to}} learn the influences of social family support toward anticipatory behavior of pregnancies sign 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>alert</b> in primigravida. Method: A quasy experimental purposive sampling design was used in this study. There were 20 respondents who met the inclusion criteria. They were divided into 2 groups, intervention and control groups, each comprising 10 respondents. The independent variable in this study was social family support and the dependent variable was the anticipatory behavior of pregnancies sign 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>alert</b> in primigravida. Data were collected by using questionnaire, observation and structured interview and then analyzed by using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and Mann Whitney U Test with significance level α≤ 0. 05. Result: The result showed that the social family support influencing the knowledge of pregnant woman with significant level p= 0. 011, social family support also influencing the attitude of pregnant woman with significant level p= 0. 008 and the action of pregnant woman p= 0. 017. There were difference knowledge, attitude and action between intervention and control groups after treatment with significant level p= 0. 000 for knowledge, p= 0. 015 for attitude and p= 0. 002 for action.

40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} driver {{acceptance of}} alerts to left-turn encroachment incidents {{that do not}} produce a crash. If an event that produces a crash is the criterion for a “true ” alert, all the alerts we studied are technically false alarms. Our aim was to inform the design of intersection-assist active safety systems. Background: The premise {{of this study is}} that it may be possible to overcome driver resistance to alerts that are false alarms by designing systems to issue alerts when and only when drivers would expect and accept them. Method: Participants were passengers in a driving simulator that presented left-turn encroachment inci-dents. Participant point of view, the direction of encroachment, and postencroachment time (PET) were manipulated to produce 36 near-crash incidents. After viewing each incident, the participant rated the relative acceptability of a hypothetical alert to it. Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA and logistic regression indicate that acceptability varies inversely with PET. At PET intervals less than 2. 2 s, driver point of view and encroachment direction interact. At PET intervals more than 2. 2 <b>s,</b> <b>alerts</b> to lateral encroach-ments are more acceptable than alerts to oncoming encroachments. Conclusion: Driver acceptance of alerts by active safety systems will be sensitive to context. Application: This study demonstrates the utility of eliciting subjective criteria to inform system design to match driver (user) expectations.

Results from detection of casual fungi are following: Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides (Fron.), Fusarium culmorum (W. G. Sm.) Sacc. and Fusarium graminearum Schwabe.

40|$|Attentional {{behavior}} in complex visual workspaces {{is driven by}} the physical and temporal characteristics of the display, the goals and knowledge of the operator, and task demands. Accordingly, to develop effective displays, designers must understand how these factors interact to influence attentional allocation within the display and the detectability of critical alerts. The purpose of the current project was two-fold. First, an integrative model of attention was developed to serve as a theory-motivated design tool, allowing a designer to investigate the interactions between the many factors that influence attentional allocation and noticing behavior. Second, to fill in gaps in the existing theoretic literature and to support model development, the current project provided a pair of empirical studies examining the interactions between bottom-up and top-down sources of attentional guidance on alert detection and attentional behavior to inform the design of information displays. Built on the framework of SEEV (Wickens et al., 2003; Wickens & McCarley, 2008; Wickens et al., 2008), the model integrates elements from several basic attentional processes to create a model of attentional {{behavior in}} dynamic environments. The model was validated against PDTs from a high-fidelity flight simulator study, against miss rates and RTs from Nikolic et al. ???<b>s</b> (2004) <b>alert</b> detection experiment, and data from the current studies. Combined, the results indicated that the model can accurately predict attentional behavior within complex environments and tasks, using heuristic parameter values selected by either the experimenter or an SME. The two current experiments examined how alert expectancy interacts with salience, eccentricity, and workload to influence attentional behavior in an alert detection task alert. Participants performed a central highway-in-the-sky (HITS) manual tracking task and a peripheral alert detection task concurrently while alert eccentricity, salience, expectancy, and central task workload were manipulated. The results of the studies suggested two primary design recommendations: 1) Critical, but low expectancy, alerts should be placed close to the central display, but away from other dynamic display items. 2) The location of high expectancy alerts should be determined by the importance of the alert. Alerts that require more prompt responses by the operator should be located closer to the central display and/or presented away from other dynamic display elements...|$|R

40|$|Some predators sidestep {{environments that}} render them {{conspicuous}} to the sensory systems of prey. However, these challenging environments are unavoidable for certain predators. Stenolemus giraffa is an assassin bug that feeds on web-building spiders; the web is {{the environment in}} which this predator finds its prey, but it also forms part of its preys’ sophisticated sensory apparatus, blurring the distinction between environment and sensory systems. Stenolemus giraffa needs to break threads in the web that obstruct its path to the spiders, and such vibrations can alert the spiders. Using laser vibrometry, this study demonstrates how <b>S.</b> giraffa avoids <b>alerting</b> the spiders during its approach. When breaking threads, S. giraffa attenuates the vibrations produced by holding on to the loose ends of the broken thread and causing them to sag prior to release. In addition, S. giraffa releases the loose ends of a broken thread one at a time (after several seconds or minutes) and in this way spaces out the production of vibrations in time. Furthermore, S. giraffa was found to maximally reduce the amplitude of vibrations when breaking threads that are prone to produce louder vibrations. Finally, S. giraffa preferred to break threads in the presence of wind, suggesting that this araneophagic insect exploits environmental noise that temporarily impairs the spiders’ ability to detect vibrations. The predatory behaviour of S. giraffa seems to be adaptated in intricate manner for bypassing the sophisticated sensory systems of web-building spiders. These findings illustrate how the physical characteristics of the environment, along with the sensory systems of prey can shape the predatory strategies of animals. 14 page(s...|$|R

Consequently, on the decade 1998 - 2009 the number of doctorates handed out in all OECD countries grew by 31 %. Doctoral holders are not only the most qualified in terms of educational attainment, but also those who are specifically trained to conduct research. Although the unemployment rate for doctoral holders is stabilized around 3 % since 2006, nowadays it {{is becoming more and}} more difficult for them to find a job corresponding to their qualification. The recruitment of PhD graduates in the private sector (business, industry) should be considered a key avenue in converting research into commercialized innovations, technological progress and productivity growth of the countries.

Both whole and ground caraway seeds were extracted.

Further, the amount of essential oil was studied in caraway gathered at the beginning of maturation (sample A) and at full ripeness (sample B) of caraway seeds.

Having evolved from hospital billing and laboratory {{systems in the}} 802 ̆ 7 s, EHR systems have grown considerably as we learn to represent more and more aspects of patient encounter, diagnosis and treatment digitally. EHR user interfaces, however, lag considerably behind their consumer-electronics counterparts in usability, most notably with respect to customizability. This limitation is especially evident {{in the implementation of}} audible alerts that are coupled to sensors or timing devices in intensive-care settings. The most current standard, (ISO/IEC 60601 - 1 - 8) has been designed for alerts that are intended to signal situations of varying priorities: however, it is not universally implemented, and has been criticized for the difficulty that healthcare providers have in discriminating between individual alarms, and for the failure to incorporate prior research with respect to 2 ̆ 2 sense of urgency 2 ̆ 2 as it applies to alarm efficacy. In the present work, however, we consider that there are more effective means to allow a user to identify an alarm correctly than 2 ̆ 2 sense of urgency 2 ̆ 2 response.

We built a tool, PASA (Personalized Alert Study Application), that would allow us to capture and edit sounds and orchestrate studies that would contrast any two types of sounds. PASA facilitated a study where study participant 2 ̆ 7 s responses to 2 ̆ 2 personalized 2 ̆ 2 sounds were contrasted with sounds that meet the ISO/IEC 60601 - 1 - 8 : 2012 standard. We performed two sub-studies that contrasted responses to two banks of 6 -alerts and 10 -alerts. The 6 -alert study was repeated with the same subjects after two weeks without training to measure recall. We observed that accuracy, reaction time, and retention were significantly improved with the personalized sounds. For example, the median errors for the 6 -alert baseline study were 4 for personalized vs. 27 for standard alerts. For the 6 -alert repeat study it was 7 vs. 43. The median for the 10 -alert study was 1 for personalized vs. 55 for standard alerts. Accuracy for recognition, while remaining constant for personalized alerts, degraded considerably for standardized alerts as the number of alerts increased from 6 to 10. We conclude that personalization of alerts may improve information delivery and reduce cognitive overload on the health care provider. This potential positive effect at the point of patient care merits further studies in a clinical or simulated clinical setting...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Powdery mildew (Microsphaera alphitoides Griff. et Maubl.) was studied {{from the}} aspect of its {{influence}} on regeneration of the pedunculate oak stands in the Ravni Srem area. Possibility to control the funguswith chemical protection measures was also investigated. During the three-year research period (2006 – 2008), efficiency of eight fungicides (Microthiol special, Stroby DF, ZATO 50 -WG, Cabrio Top, Quadris, <b>Alert</b> <b>S,</b> Duett Ultra, Sabithane) and their influence on the plant growth increase were tested. Material and Methods: The research was conducted on seedlings and juvenile oak plants in a newly regenerated pedunculate oak stand in the southwestern Srem area, in the Vini~na forest section (dept. 15 a). Level of plants infection and evaluation of fungicide efficiency were determined by visual evaluation {{of the presence of}} powdery mildew on leaves of 25 randomly picked plants within each experimental field. Plant growth elements were determined {{on the basis of the}} length of multistage formed shoots and root neck diameter. Results and Conclusion: Suppression of powdery mildew on pedunculate oak seedlings and juvenile oak plants is an important protective measure which is essential for regeneration areas in the period of regeneration cutting. The observed fungicides showed high efficiency in control of the fungus. A biological feature of pedunculate oak to form multistaged shoots by activating terminal buds during the growing season came to the fore. Majority of plants formed 3 or 4 stage growths during the first year. Chemical protection of seedlings from powdery mildew should be conducted in the period of plant growth in height. In such proceedings, the application of fungicides is reduced to minimum and thereby provides a rational seedling protection. In the second and third year of oak development, applied fungicides had little effect. Under a canopy of herbaceous weed species, plants hadmore or less intense growth in height, depending on climatic conditions and the amount of moisture in the soil...|$|R
40|$|The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have {{identified}} exposure to silica {{as a health}} hazard to workers involved in manufacturing, finishing and installing natural and manufactured stone countertop products, both in fabrication shops and during in-home finishing/installation. This hazard can be mitigated with simple and effective dust controls in most countertop operations. Workers involved in manufacturing, finishing, and installing natural and manufactured stone countertops {{are at risk for}} significant crystalline silica exposure. Crystalline silica commonly occurs in nature as the mineral quartz, and is found in granite, sandstone, quartzite, various other rocks, and sand. Workers who inhale very small crystalline silica particles are at risk for silicosis - an incurable, progressively disabling and sometimes fatal lung disease. Silicosis results in permanent lung damage. Silica dust particles become trapped in lung tissue, causing inflammation and scarring and reducing the lungs' ability to take in oxygen. Symptoms of silicosis can include shortness of breath, cough and fatigue, and {{may or may not be}} obviously attributable to silica. Workers exposed to airborne crystalline silica also are at increased risk for lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and kidney disease. OSHA and NIOSH investigated U. S. worker exposure to respirable crystalline silica in the stone countertop industry following reports from other countries of stone countertop workers developing silicosis. In at least some cases from Spain and Israel, workers were exposed in shops operating without dust suppression, and without respiratory protection. While the stone industry in the United States has worked to implement dust controls to protect workers against the dangers of silica exposure, studies and OSHA inspections indicate that exposure levels may not be adequately controlled in some stone countertop fabrication worksites in the U. <b>S.</b> This Hazard <b>Alert</b> focuses on countertop industry worker exposures to airborne silica dust, including from quartz in stone. It covers the health effects of breathing silica dust, recommends ways to protect workers, and describes how OSHA and NIOSH can help employers effectively reduce silica dust exposures. Employers must ensure that workers are properly protected from exposure to silica. DTSEM 02 / 2015 NIOSHTIC No. 2004576...|$|R
40|$|Objetivou-se determinar a resistência antimicrobiana e identificar os ribotipos de 96 cepas de Salmonella isoladas em plantéis avícolas com ciclo completo de produção para estabelecer seu perfil de disseminação. Os maiores percentuais de resistência foram para sulfonamida (56, 25 %), tetraciclina (53, 12 %) e amoxacilina (31, 25 %), enquanto 28, 13 % dos isolados foram sensíveis a todos antibióticos. Perfis de multiresistência foram observados para 28 cepas (29, 17 %) do sorovar Minnesota. Na CIM encontraram-se cepas com concentração acima da máxima (tetraciclina > 256 &# 956;g/mL - 7; sulfametoxazol > 1024 &# 956;g/mL - 45; amoxacilina > 256 &# 956;g/mL - 16). A ribotipagem identificou 63 / 96 cepas. Das amostras testadas, 21 foram identificadas como Minnesota e agrupadas em seis ribotipos, sendo o 208 -S- 8 o mais prevalente com 11 identificações (52, 38 %). Quatorze amostras de S. Infantis foram agrupadas em sete ribogrupos, sendo o 337 -S- 2 o mais prevalente, 8 / 14 (57, 14 %). Duas amostras de S. Schwarzengrund e duas de S. Newport foram agrupadas nos ribogrupos 208 -S- 4 e 204 -S- 7, respectivamente. A multirresistência de S. Minnesota alerta para a necessidade de uma monitoria sistemática da resistência antimicrobiana em bactérias zoonóticas. A CIM acima da concentração máxima sugere que essas bactérias podem ter sofrido alterações com o surgimento de resistência adquirida. Os resultados reforçam a necessidade do uso responsável de antibióticos na produção animal, principalmente daqueles usados na {{medicina}} humana. A alta prevalência do ribogrupo 208 -S- 8 (S. Minnesota) e 337 -S- 2 (S. Infantis) caracteriza a disseminação clonal destes sorovares, isolados desde o ambiente de criação até o abate. Estes resultados indicam que aves positivas na granja contribuem para a contaminação das carcaças no abatedouro. A identificação de cepas clonais permite estabelecer o elo epidemiológico existente entre isolados de Salmonella, determinando assim a etapa da cadeia de produção industrial do frango de corte que contribui para a contaminação do produto final. The {{objective was}} to determine the antimicrobial resistance and to identify the ribotypes of 96 Salmonella strains isolated from poultry plants with complete production cycle to establish their profile dissemination. The highest percentages of resistance were to sulfonamide (56. 25 %), tetracycline (53. 12 %) and amoxicillin (31. 25 %), while 28. 13 % of the isolates were sensitive to all antibiotics tested. The profiles of multidrug resistance were observed in 28 strains (29. 17 %) of serovar Minnesota. In MIC were found strains at concentrations above the maximum (tetracycline > 256 &# 956;g/mL - 7; sulfamethoxazole > 1024 &# 956;g/mL - 45; amoxicillin > 256 &# 956;g/mL - 16). The ribotyping identified 63 / 96 strains. Of the samples tested, 21 were identified as Minnesota and grouped into six ribotypes, and the 208 -S- 8 was the most prevalent with 11 identifications (52. 38 %). Fourteen samples of S. Infantis were grouped into seven ribogroups, and the 337 -S- 2 was the most prevalent, 8 / 14 (57. 14 %). Two samples of S. Schwarzengrund and two S. Newport were grouped in the ribogroups 208 -S- 4 and 204 -S- 7, respectively. The multidrug resistance of <b>S.</b> Minnesota <b>alert</b> to the needing of implements systematic monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria. The MIC above the maximum concentration suggests that these bacteria may have changed with the emergence of acquired resistance. The results emphasize the needing for responsible use of antibiotics in animal production, especially those used in human medicine. The high prevalence of ribogroup 208 -S- 8 (S. Minnesota) and 337 -S- 2 (S. Infantis) characterizes the clonal spread of these serovars, isolated from the farm until slaughter. These results indicate that positive birds at the farm contribute to contamination of carcasses at the slaughterhouse. The identification of clonal strains may establish the epidemiological link between isolates of Salmonella, thereby determining the stage of the chain of industrial production of broiler chickens that contributes to the contamination of the final product...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{is complex}} domain and {{distributed}} in nature. Some of its major characteristics are shared and distributed {{decision making and}} management of care. Such characteristics require the communication of complex and diverse forms of information between clinical and other settings. The healthcare services centre around the wellness, maintenance, and illness management of patients. The delivery of such services heavily depends on up-to-date medical knowledge and experience. However, miscommunication, misinterpretation of diverse forms of information exchanged between clinical settings, inability to be up-to-date with clinical best practices, and accessing rapidly changing and exponentially growing medical knowledge cause errors in health care that are leading cause of injuries and deaths. In this thesis, we addressed the research problems related to the interpretation and understanding of medical referral and response letters, exchanged between Specialists and General Practitioners (GPs) for patients care decision making. These research problems are implicitly associated with GPs information needs at point of care, including management of and access to evidence-based medical information and knowledge relevant to medical referral and response letters. The interpretation and understanding of referral and response letters and sending <b>alert</b> <b>s</b> for critical situations at point of care require methods for medical information processing, and methodologies for modelling and management of clinical knowledge. It also requires mechanisms to access concise, relevant, evidence-based clinical knowledge and techniques for efficient and context-sensitive retrieval. The goal of the thesis has been divided into five objectives, therefore, five-phased multi-steps research methodology was devised. We have taken interdisciplinary solution approach {{along the lines of}} healthcare knowledge management, contextual information retrieval, and knowledge-based search strategies. We have formulated a knowledge modelling methodology and a computerization technique for clinical practice guidelines, which transform them into computer interpretable segments that are enriched with content-specific meta-information. To link segments of computerized clinical practice guidelines with online evidence-based medical knowledge, we have developed a technique for automatically generating clinical queries from these segments. These queries are used by our Context Specific Query Generation framework to retrieve relevant medical literature from online evidence-based knowledge sources and to link them with corresponding computerized CPGs segments. We have developed a method for computerized processing of referral and response letters. This method analyses medical information and provides a comprehensive information-view of the letter 10 help healthcare practitioners formulate customized and focused information specifications to access required knowledge. We also have developed a technique for contextual and statistical analysis of medical concepts and indexing strategy, which are used to retrieve CPGs segments and related medical literature relevant to information needs of healthcare practitioners. Finally, we have designed a healthcare-knowledge mediated architecture and implemented a computer system for Clinical Knowledge Assistance (CKA) to provide better interpretation and understanding of referral and response letters...|$|R
