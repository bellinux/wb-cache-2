500|$|Nicolas Cage {{was cast}} as Al Columbato. He reflected, [...] "I {{was terrified of}} the role of Al, because it was like nothing I'd ever done before, and I didn't know how to get to the places the role was asking me to go emotionally." [...] For scenes in which Al's face is {{disfigured}} and swathed in bandages, Cage lost 15 pounds and had two of his front teeth pulled out. [...] "I wanted to look like I was hit by a bomb," [...] he said. [...] "It gave me a feeling of something I had lost. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> was a once-in-a-lifetime part, and it deserved that much." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Sisto said he {{was drawn}} to the script, and was excited to take on a {{different}} project than his regular role of Detective Cyrus Lupo on the NBC crime drama series Law & Order. Sisto said of working on the show, [...] "For nine months we basically do the same episode over and over. This [...] came out of nowhere." [...] Sisto said of working on Into Temptation: [...] "Having just come off a job where there is little room to find true moments and to create a full character, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> respite from the task of trying to force a space where I could express something more personal through my job was no less than a creative life saver." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Ehrich {{received}} a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series for {{his portrayal of}} Fenmore. [...] On the day the actor was informed of his nomination, Ehrich stated: [...] "I’ve been in daydream all day. I feel like I was hit by an electric current." [...] He admitted {{that it was a}} [...] "pretty easy choice" [...] choosing which scene to submit for consideration; Ehrich chose a scene where Fenmore tells Jamie that Summer is the one cyberbullying him. He stated that he chose that episode [...] "because that day, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> outer body experience. I was not in control at all". Of his nomination, Ehrich stated: [...] "It’s an honor, and it’s something I hope will hit me really soon, because it doesn’t feel real at all!" [...] However, Ehrich lost the award to Days of Our Lives star Chandler Massey for his portrayal of Will Horton.|$|E

500|$|Hutchings {{introduced}} Drake to the 25-year-old American producer Joe Boyd, {{owner of}} the production and management company Witchseason Productions. The company was, at the time, licensed to Island Records, and Boyd, {{the man who had}} discovered Fairport Convention and been responsible for introducing John Martyn and The Incredible String Band to a mainstream audience, was a significant and respected figure on the UK folk scene. He and Drake formed an immediate bond, and the producer acted as a mentor to Drake throughout his career. A four-track demo, recorded in Drake's college room in the spring of 1968, led Boyd to offer a management, publishing, and production contract to the 20-year-old, and to initiate work on a debut album. According to Boyd:In those days you didn't have cassettes—he brought a reel-to-reel tape [...] that he'd done at home. Half way through the first song, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> was pretty special. And I called him up, and he came back in, and we talked, and I just said, [...] "I'd like to make a record." [...] He stammered, [...] "Oh, well, yeah. Okay." [...] Nick was a man of few words.In a 2004 interview, Drake's friend Paul Wheeler remembered the excitement caused by his seeming big break, and recalled that the singer had already decided not to complete his third year at Cambridge.|$|E
2500|$|In 1953-54, when I {{undertook}} a year's teaching assignment at Columbia University, {{the need for}} a book in English, dealing with all aspects of Indo-Muslim history, was forcefully brought home to me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> need particularly with regard to American students who, in the absence of anything better, had to fall back upon Vincent Smith's [...] or similar compilations.|$|E
2500|$|A third, {{politically}} charged clip was later posted, with the titles [...] "Guess Who Batman" [...] and later [...] "Get with the Brogram", finally appearing as [...] "GWB". Despite both working titles sharing initials with George W. Bush, Allen wrote that [...] "this song {{is not a}} direct attack at anyone, it was originally written about the BNP in the UK but then <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> issue has become relevant pretty much everywhere, we are the youth, we can make coolness for our future, its up to us. Go green and hate hate." [...] The song was retitled [...] "Fuck You" [...] for the album version. Allen posted a fourth song on her Myspace page, called [...] "Who'd of Known", noting that the song had been recorded for the album but would not be included due to legal issues since the chorus is musically similar to the Take That song [...] "Shine". However, Take That later did allow Allen to include the song on the album (now titled grammatically correctly as [...] "Who'd Have Known").|$|E

2500|$|In November 1997, {{the press}} {{revealed}} that after 13 years playing Kathy, Gillian Taylforth had {{opted not to}} renew her contract when it expired in March 1998. Taylforth commented, [...] "I love EastEnders, it's in my blood. But after 12 years I want {{a bit of a}} change. I want {{to spend more time with}} my family and consider other offers. It was an extremely difficult decision to make but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> was the best time to go. I've had alternative job offers in the past, but I've always stuck with EastEnders. It's been brilliant for me and I will miss it hugely." [...] At the time, a BBC spokesperson would not confirm the departure saying, [...] "Gilly is in discussions about taking a possible break. It is the policy that long-serving, valued, senior cast members are eligible for such breaks." [...] However, her departure was later confirmed, with Taylforth saying that she made the decision to quit after she missed her daughter's sports day due to filming commitments on set. Barbara Windsor, who plays Kathy's mother-in-law Peggy Mitchell, said: [...] "This is really sad. Gill is a wonderful actress and a very good friend." [...] Steve McFadden, who plays Kathy's estranged husband Phil Mitchell, said: [...] "I can't believe it. I've been with her all day and she never said a thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|While in England, Kitty Hart-Moxon became {{interested}} in educating people about the Holocaust by telling her life story to the public. [...] This began with her first book I Am Alive (1961) (see References); this is an account of her life from the day in 1939 when, while away on holiday with her mother, they received a telegram from her father insisting they return at once, through the {{events that led to}} her incarceration in Auschwitz in 1942, to her liberation from Auschwitz on 13 April 1945. [...] Then, in 1978, Yorkshire Television (YTV) producer Peter Morley's team learned about Hart-Moxon while doing background research on a project about women who risked their lives to save others during the Nazi era, and convinced him to meet her. She didn't fit the parameters they'd set for Women of Courage, but after two visits, Morley was so impressed with Hart-Moxon, he submitted a proposal to YTV to accompany her to Auschwitz for her first visit in 33 years and film it, provided she brought along her eldest son, then a young doctor, for emotional support. In his memoirs, Morley wrote, [...] "This, no doubt, {{was going to be a}} very raw film... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> to be a unique opportunity to add fresh insight to the infamy of Auschwitz as had been portrayed in both fictional and non-fictional films and television programmes." ...|$|E
