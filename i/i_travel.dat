500|$|LeMond {{is an avid}} outdoor enthusiast and fly angler, and in 1991– {{while still}} racing full-time– he made the world-record fly fishing catch of a four-pound smallmouth bass on a reel with a four-pound tippet.

500|$|Second, Schulz is {{credited}} with being the first center to {{step back from the}} line while playing defense. [...] Prior to Schulz's innovation, centers played in the line on defense. [...] In 1905, Schulz began dropping back from the line, enabling him to use his speed to move laterally and giving him greater coverage across the field of play. [...] At the time, the innovation was referred to as a [...] "roving center", but it was effectively the birth of the linebacker position in American football. [...] Asked how he developed the [...] "roving center" [...] idea, Schulz noted that the backs started from five yards behind the line and concluded, [...] "No back living could move five yards while I was moving four". [...] He described his thinking to Coach Yost this way: [...] "It's all very simple, Yost. The ball carrier travels five yards while <b>I</b> <b>travel</b> only four yard to meet him. [...] I know of no back who can beat me in a five-yard race after giving me a one-yard handicap".|$|E

And I don't really believe those polls. <b>I</b> <b>travel</b> around the country, I see people, I see their response to my husband, I see their response to me. There {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges right now in the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a brown {{person in}} Greeley, Colorado {{in the late}} 1940's {{studying}} English he came across much prejudice. He was appalled by what he perceived as loose sexual openness of American men and women (a far cry from his home of Musha, Asyut). This American experience was for him a fine-tuning of his Islamic identity. He himself tells us on his boat trip over [...] "Should <b>I</b> <b>travel</b> to America, and become flimsy, and ordinary, like those who are satisfied with idle talk and sleep.
