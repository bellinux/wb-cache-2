They include both free content licences like Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike and free software licences like the GNU <b>General</b> <b>Public</b> License.

The term reciprocal license has also been used to describe copyleft, but has also been used for non-libre licenses (see, for example, the Microsoft Limited Reciprocal License).|$|R

50|$|Some laws {{used for}} {{copyleft}} licenses vary {{from one country}} to another, and may also be granted in terms that vary from country to country. For example, in some countries it is acceptable to sell a software product without warranty, in standard GNU GPL style (see articles 11 and 12 of the GNU GPL version 2), while in most European countries it is not permitted for a software distributor to waive all warranties regarding a sold product. For this reason the extent of such warranties are specified in most European copyleft licenses. Regarding that, see the European Union <b>Public</b> <b>Licence</b> EUPL, or the CeCILL license, a license that allows one to use GNU GPL (see article 5 of the EUPL and article 5.3.4 of CeCILL) in combination with a limited warranty (see article 7 and 8 of the EUPL and 9 of CeCILL).For projects which will be run over a network, a variation of the GPL is provided in the Affero <b>General</b> <b>Public</b> License, which ensures that the source code is available to users of network software.|$|R
