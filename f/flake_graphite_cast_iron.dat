The main factors affecting shape of graphite cast iron are the metallurgical structures and the section thicknesses. Cast iron of different shapes of graphite particles directly affect its thermo-mechanical properties. The nodular shape of these graphite particles such as in ductile cast iron improve its mechanical properties, on the other hand, when the shape of these graphite particles become elongated such as in <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> results in improving its thermal conductivity. In between, the worm-like shape of these graphite particles such as in compacted graphite cast iron, make this type of cast iron to have thermo-mechanical properties in between those of ductile and <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> The different types of ductile, compacted and <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> were produced by means of plunger method at different section thicknesses and the effect of Mg/S ratio on these types of graphite particles was investigated and its range was established...|$|E
40|$|A new surface {{hardening}} technology for cast irons {{was developed by}} applying the Friction Stir Processing (FSP) in which the matrix can be controlled in the solid state. <b>Flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> (FC 300) and {{spheroidal graphite cast iron}} (FCD 700) were used to investigate the validity of this new method. As a result, it has been clarified that a Vickers hardness of about 700 HV is obtained for both the <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and the spheroidal graphite cast iron, and that the hardness depends on the size and the density of the martensite phase. Moreover, the hardness can be controlled down to about 500 HV by changing the stirring degree. For previous hardening methods, post surface-processing was required because a large distortion was generated. However, with this new method, many advantages, such as a higher surface hardness and unnecessary post surface-processing, could be obtained. [doi: 10. 2320 /matertrans. F-MRA 2008835...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Flake and {{spheroidal}} graphite cast irons with similar composition {{were subjected to}} high temperature oxidation to investigate graphite morphology and distribution effects on the oxidation behavior. High temperature oxidation tests were conducted between 400 and 750 C in air. For comparison low carbon steel was also tested. Graphite morphology obviously affected high-temperature oxidation resis-tance. The <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> exhibited the worst high-temperature oxidation resistance compared with {{spheroidal graphite}} cast iron. Since graphite flakes provide suitable sites for the iron oxide growth and are almost interconnected, the iron oxide grows faster and penetrates along the graphite flakes boundaries resulting in the subsurface oxidation. Due to the severe subsurface oxidation <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> parabolic rate constants are five times {{higher than that of}} the spheroidal graphite cast iron. However, spheroidal graphite cast iron parabolic rate constants and oxide layer thickness {{are similar to those of}} the low carbon steel. Therefore, graphite flakes have negative effect on the cast iron high temperature oxidation resistance...|$|E

This work focuses on the material of automotive brake disks, namely, <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> The specificity of this material is its asymmetric behavior under tensile and compressive loadings, {{which is due to}} the shape of graphite that acts as small cracks. Multi-scale models inspired from the literature are first presented. They lead to a good description of the material behavior under cyclic loadings.

40|$|The {{shrinkage}} and chilling {{tendency of}} spheroidal graphite (abbreviated SG) cast iron {{is much greater}} than that of the <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> in spite of its higher amount of C and Si contents. Why? The main reason should be the difference in their graphitization during the eutectic solidification. In this paper, we discuss the difference in the solidification mechanism of both cast irons for solving these problems using unidirectional solidification and the cooling curves of the spheroidal graphite cast iron. The eutectic solidification rate of the SG cast iron is controlled by the diffusion of carbon through the austenite shell, and the final thickness is 1. 4 times the radius of the SG, therefore, the reduction of the SG size, namely, the increase in the number, is the main solution of these problems...|$|E

40|$|The {{amount and}} {{morphology}} of the graphite phase largely controls the resulting properties of <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> For instance, in <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> the mechanical properties are low while the thermal conductivity is high. This {{is in contrast}} with spheroidal <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> where the mechanical properties are high and the thermal conductivity is low. These differences are due to the different graphite morphologies and must be accounted for in the design work and material selection of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> components. In this work {{the influence of the}} graphite phase on the elastic and plastic deformation behaviour of <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> has been studied. The material grades studied originate from castings for marine diesel engine piston rings with different chemical analyses. Two groups of pearlitic <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> materials were studied; one with differences in graphite morphology and one with grey irons that differed in graphite content. For these different material grades the mechanical properties were correlated to microstructural parameters. In addition to standard uniaxial tensile tests, acoustic emission measurements were used for the study of deformation. When studying the modulus of elasticity of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> {{it was found that the}} modulus of elasticity of the inherent graphite phase depends on the roundness of the graphite particles and is due to the strong anisotropy of the graphite phase. A linear correlation between nodularity and the modulus of elasticity of the graphite phase was derived. This correlation made it possible to account for the anisotropy of the graphite phase in the model used. By applying the linear function when modelling the effective modulus of elasticity, a high accuracy between experimental and theoretical values was achieved. Another factor affecting the elastic response when subjecting a <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> component to tensile load was found to be the plastic deformation that actually occurs at very low strains for all of the studied <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> grades. It was observed that the plastic deformation in the low strain elastic region, quantified by using acoustic emission measurements, increased linearly with decreasing modulus of elasticity. These measurements showed that the amount of plastic deformation in the elastic region was largely controlled by the graphite morphology. It was concluded that as the roundness of the graphite particles increases, the plastic deformation activity in the elastic region decreases. The plastic deformation activity continued linearly into the pronounced plastic region of the tensile tests. A decrease in roundness or increase in graphite fraction resulted in an increase of the amount of plastic deformation and the strain hardening exponent. A dependence between strength coefficient and graphite fraction was observed. Models for the flow curves for pearlitic <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> were developed and shown to accurately reproduce the observed experimental curves. The surveys performed and conclusions from this thesis will be helpful in the design of new <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> materials...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} phase of the project it was proven that by {{changing}} the ratio between the thermal gradient and the growth rate for commercial <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> samples solidifying in a Bridgman type furnace, it is possible to produce all types of <b>graphite</b> structures, from <b>flake</b> to spheroidal, and all types of matrices, from ferritic to white at a certain given level of cerium. KC- 135 flight experiments have shown that in a low-gravity environment, no flotation occurs even in spheroidal <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> with carbon equivalent as high as 5 %, while extensive graphite flotation occurred in both <b>flake</b> and spheroidal <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons,</b> in high carbon samples solidified in a high gravity environment. This opens the way for production of iron-carbon composite materials, with high carbon content (e. g., 10 %) in a low gravity environment. By using KC- 135 flights, the influence of some basic elements on the solidification of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> will be studied.

40|$|International audienceThe present paper details an elasto-viscoplastic {{constitutive}} model for automotive brake discs made of <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> In a companion paper, the authors proposed a one-dimensional setting appropriate for representing the complex {{behavior of the}} material (i. e. asymmetry between tensile and compres-sive loadings) under anisothermal conditions. The generalization of this 1 D model to 3 D cases on a volume element and the associated challenges are addressed. A direct transposition is not possible and an alternative solution without unilateral conditions is first proposed. Induced anisotropic damage and associated consti-tutive laws are then introduced. The transition from the volume element to the real structure and the numerical implementation requires a specific basis change.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{strength}} of grey cast iron components subjected to combined bending and tension, this case of loading being met in C-frames and clamps, crane hooks and various eccentrically—loaded protruding machine parts.

With due consideration of non-linearities and inequalities in stress-strain relations in tension and compression, stress distribution for these sections was obtained from strain measurements. The ratio of bending to tensile stress components is herein shown to {{play a significant role}} in locating the neutral plane and in identifying the dominating failure stress. The value 2, for this ratio, is shown to draw some demarkation border between the two modes of fracture encountered in the tests.

40|$|<b>Flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> was hot-dip {{coated with}} pure {{aluminium}} or aluminium alloys (AlSi 11 and AlTi 5). The study aimed at determining {{the influence of}} bath composition on the thickness, microstructure and phase composition of the coatings. The analysis was conducted {{by means of an}} optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope with an EDS spectrometer. It was found that the overall thickness of a coating was greatly dependent on the chemical composition of a bath. The coatings consisted of an outer layer and an inner intermetallic layer, the latter with two zones and dispersed graphite. In all the cases considered, the zone in the inner intermetallic layer adjacent to the cast iron substrate contained the Al 5 Fe 2 phase with small amount of silicon; the interface between this phase and the cast iron substrate differed substantially, depending on the bath composition. In the coatings produced by hot-dipping in pure aluminium the zone adjacent to the outer layer had a composition similar to that produced from an AlTi 5 bath, the Al 3 Fe phase was identified in this zone. The Al 3 Fe also contained silicon but its amount was lower than that in the Al 5 Fe 2. In the coatings produced by hot-dipping in AlSi 11, the zone adjacent to the outer layer contained the Al 3 FeSi phase. The analysis results showed that when AlSi 11 alloy was applied, the growth mode of the inner layer changed from inwards to outwards.

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} the optimization of wet cylinder liner designs for high thermal loads, with special refer-ence to medium speed diesel engine {{applications in the}} bore range 180 - 500 nun (- 7 - 20 in). It is shown that a <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> nickel-copper-molybdenum alloyed <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with a well developed vanadium matrix combines the best properties for liner manufacture. For quality control reasons, centrifugal castings are often pre-ferred, although the resultant graphite form is unfavourable for thermal stress resistance. Consequently, recourse to plain steels is sometimes required, leading naturally {{to the adoption of}} chromed finishes for wear and corrosion resistance. For a given thermal rating, the thermal stresses can be reduced by a judicious choice of air-fuel ratio, but a limiting value exists beyond which the thermal stresses remain unaffected. Reductions in stress level are also possible by optimizing the wall thickness and coolant flow. This leads inevitably to thin sections susceptible to distortion under firing and impact loads, thus impairing both the strength of the component and its wear properties. A planned degree of restraint can be adopted to control both distortion and stress level; such measures are not always conducive to economic design and serviceability, and may actually degrade the reliability when applied to steel liners. The surrounding structure can have a first order effect on the stress levels in the liner; these manifest them-selves as applied loads to the liner supports or flange. The design details are thus important, and the influence of parameters such as bolting load, location of sealing spigot and block deflection are discussed in relation to the evolution of successful designs. Any structurally sound design must be capable of operating for periods of 20000 h or more without excessive wear. It is shown that the wear process is essentially exponential; the factors affecting its absolute value are discussed, and attempts made to quantify their contribution...|$|R

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to understand the nucleation mechanism of graphite flakes and nodules {{and the effect of}} various elements on the growth morphology of graphite. Investigations were started on <b>flake</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> The effect of S on the graphite morphology and MnS was experimentally analysed. The influence of various type of oxides on the growth morphology of MnS and their relation with the graphite growth morphology was studied carefully through series of experiments, and results were related to the thermodynamic calculations, performed to predict the nucleation of oxides and sulfides at any temperature. The calculations were supported by EDX analysis on particles in the samples, showing sequential nucleation of flake graphite. The austenite volume fraction and the dendrite growth orientations were affected by the addition of Al to the melt. The effect of aluminium oxide and sulfur was studied on the austenite growth morphology with the help of colour etching technique. Thermal analyses were performed to study the effect of sulfur content on austenite volume fraction and growth morphology using DSC. The latent heat of solidification and the rate of austenite formation was studied and related to the sulfur content in the alloy. To study the effect of O and S on the graphite morphology, pure Fe-C alloy was prepared and strong de-oxidizers and de-sulfurizer (Mg, Ca and Sr) were tested. With the help of ion etching and polishing, we were able to reveal the graphite growth morphology. The morphological changes in the graphite were explained by relating it to the composition of the melt in regard of dissolved S and O in the melt. The effect of other trace elements such as S, F, O, N, P, B and Se, was also investigated by testing them on an ultra-pure Fe-C alloy. The possibility of substituting a foreign atom in the basal plane of graphite was analysed based on the bonding energy between C and the foreign atoms. The resulting change {{in the structure of the}} basal plane was studied using Avogadro software and the resulting model were compared with the experimental results. The basal plane of nodular, flake and undercooled graphite was studied with the help of HRTEM, which showed differences in the lattice spacing between different graphite morphologies. The latent heat measurement showed that flake graphite have higher energy than the undercooled or vermicular graphite. This research made us enabled to tell about the growth along c-plane in graphite and the reason behind the transition of graphite morphology. The effect of inoculation temperature and inoculation sequence on the nodularity was studied. EDX analysis were performed and the results were compared to the thermodynamic calculations.   It was found that, the melt composition is controlling the graphite growth morphologies. Strong de-oxidizers and de-sulfurizer are necessary to reduce O and S to a level where it does not influence the graphite growth morphology. The effect of various elements on the activity of oxygen in the melt is calculated. High Al cast iron was also studied. The major problem associated with this type of alloy was that, the Mg was not effective in producing nodular graphite. Experiments showed that de-oxidizers stronger than Mg are required to increase the nodularity. Thermodynamic calculations showed that the activity of oxygen in the melt was changing strongly by increasing the Al content in the alloy. This was increasing the required oxygen level to nucleate MgO. QC 20141107 </p...|$|E

In the case of locally hard faced cast steel, the inserted layer was also formed with similar process {{to that of the}} spheroidal <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> while intermediate phases with very hard complex carbide were formed at the bonding region between the inserted layer and the base metal. The hardness of mother cast steel was about HV 300, while the hardness of the inserted layer ranged from HV 800 to HV 1400. Especially, the intermediate layer with complex carbide showed the highest hardness of HV 1800. Therefore, the inserted methods with hard alloy particles are considered to be a very effective one for locally hard facing of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and <b>cast</b> steel...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{spheroidal}} <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> {{is widely}} used for automobile parts and the object {{to be focused on}} sphering agent containing rare earth (RE) used for its quality. And produced spheroidal <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> content RE was adjusted, it is possible to clarify the effect on the fatigue strength, it is considered to reduce possible RE content. In 1 st chapter, I describe the relationship between the mechanical properties and the RE of spheroidal <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> In 2 nd chapter, RE 2 % and RE 0 % of the nodularizer is produced spheroidal <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> of the smooth specimens, and subjected to plane bending fatigue test. As a result, compared to the fatigue strength and RE 2 % of the specimens in RE 0 % of the specimen smooth material is reduced 13 %. The results of evaluation of the casting defects, the fatigue strength is decreased by casting defects inside of the ⊿K>⊿Kth a smooth material. In 3 rd chapter is to use the RE 0 % and RE 2 % of nodularizer, FDI the base structure of ferrite land, pearlite area ratio of 30 % of the PDI (30), and the fatigue strength in spheroidal <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> which was perlite land of PDI was investigated. As a result, the RE 0 % of the test piece, 10 % FDI, 13 % in the PDI (30), 23 % fatigue strength at PDI decreased. The results of the observation of the fracture surface in each organization, but casting defect that becomes the ⊿K>⊿Kth has been confirmed． In 4 th chapter, the RE content in the nodularizer 0 %, 0. 3 %, and produced a spheroidal <b>graphite</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> was adjusted 0. 5 %, 2. 0 % and by making the plane bending fatigue test, can reduce RE content I was examined. RE 0. 3 %, about 8 % fatigue strength is lowered by RE 0 % of the specimen by comparing 0. 5 %, and 2. 0 %. As a result of quantitatively evaluating the casting defects were observed in the fracture surface, the value of ⊿K/⊿Kth 0. 3 % is assumed to be possible to reduce the RE content of 0. 5 %, since it was reduced to 2. 0 % to 0. 3 % that. Since the graphite grains number in RE 0 % of the specimens is equal less than 300 number/mm 2 is chill critical particle count, the inflation pressure by crystallization of graphite is reduced, is suggested that the increased casting defects. In 5 th chapter is summary, I have summarized the results of this study. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|R
