25|$|Fields met {{the comedian}} and {{impresario}} Archie Pitt {{and they began}} working together. Pitt gave Fields champagne on her 18th birthday, and wrote in an autograph book {{to her that he}} would make her a star. Pitt began to manage her career and they began a relationship; they married in 1923 at Clapham Register Office. Their first revue was called Yes <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> <b>So</b> in 1915 and the two continued to tour Britain together until 1924. That year they appeared in the revue Mr Tower of London, with other shows By Request, It's A Bargain and The Show's The Thing, during the following years.|$|E
500|$|Paramount's {{vice-president}} of music Joel Sill took a liking to a 28-year-old composer named James Horner, feeling that his demo tapes {{stood out from}} generic film music. Horner was introduced to Bennett, Meyer and Salin. [...] Horner said that [...] " [...] {{did not want the}} kind of score they had gotten before. They did not want a John Williams score, per se. They wanted something different, more modern." [...] When asked about how he landed the assignment, the composer replied that [...] "the producers loved my work for Wolfen, and had heard my music for several other projects, and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>so</b> far as I've been told, they liked my versatility very much. I wanted the assignment, and I met with them, we all got along well, they were impressed with my music, and that's how it happened." [...] Horner agreed with the producers' expectations and agreed to begin work in mid-January 1982.|$|E
500|$|In 1882, {{seeking more}} {{professional}} orchestral experience, Elgar {{was employed to}} play violin in Birmingham with William Stockley's Orchestra, for whom he would play every concert {{for the next seven}} years and where he later claimed he [...] "learned all the music I know". On 13 December 1883 he took part with Stockley in a performance at Birmingham Town Hall of one of his first works for full orchestra, the Sérénade mauresque – the first time one of his compositions had been performed by a professional orchestra. Stockley had invited him to conduct the piece but later recalled [...] "he declined, and, further, insisted upon playing in his place in the orchestra. The consequence was that he had to appear, fiddle in hand, to acknowledge the genuine and hearty applause of the audience." [...] Elgar often went to London in an attempt to get his works published, but this period in his life found him frequently despondent and low on money. He wrote to a friend in April 1884, [...] "My prospects are about as hopeless as ever ... I am not wanting in energy <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>so</b> sometimes I conclude that 'tis want of ability. ... I have no money– not a cent." ...|$|E

500|$|Brown was {{nominated}} in the Best Actress category at the 2009 British Academy Television Awards {{based on her}} performance in the episode, becoming the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted {{for her role as}} Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. She commented that she was proud to be nominated, but was not overly excited as: [...] "I don't believe anything is going to happen until it does, until you see your name on a paper or it actually happens and you have something in your hand." [...] Brown lost out to Anna Maxwell Martin, but the show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described the nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: [...] "I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's beyond me why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA [...] to connect with a big audience." [...] McLean agreed that Brown deserved to win, but commented on the awards: [...] "never underestimate snobbery towards soap." [...] Brown spoke of the nomination in 2013, saying: [...] "You never [...] if you're in a soap. [...] I would've liked it, yes. I would've felt it had crowned my acting in a way, made it sound worthwhile, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>So</b> I didn't care that I didn't get nominated for any other awards that time!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{writing for}} Batman, Hill {{considered}} that a fundamental {{aspect of the}} character was how he interacts with his villains, allies, and the city around him. Hill said: [...] "You know, {{what does it mean}} to be Batman? ...How does it affect Batman when things happen to him? What is his psychological make up? Those are the influences behind the game... you actually delve into the psyche of what makes him what he is, which is where <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> much of the interest in Batman is." [...] Batman's armor was redesigned to match that of the Batmobile to make them appear visually similar—featuring the same shapes and material textures—and appear functionally compatible with the high-speed methods in which the character enters and exits the vehicle. The design also added armor over Batman's shoulders, covering the previously exposed cape, to make it appear more feasible that it could hold Batman's weight without failing during gliding. For other returning characters, art director David Hego said that the designs were conceived to keep them interesting after players had seen them several times before in previous games, while the game's autumnal setting also necessitated a change in character clothing over the winter setting of Arkham City. The Penguin lost his long coat, and was made to look dirtier, his clothing showing signs of sweat and food stains, and his head was shaved. For Two-Face, the designers felt the character did not require changing significantly, and instead emphasized existing character traits, particularly his disfigured flesh, using references of burnt flesh as inspiration. Similarly, they wanted to retain the typical Riddler characterizations like green shirts emblazoned with question marks, but instead had the character design evolve throughout the game, modifying his own costume in response to the events of the plot.|$|E
2500|$|On May 5, 2015, Hollywood Life {{reported}} that Tim Allen and Richard Karn had admitted {{talking about getting}} back together as a cast for a Home Improvement reboot or reunion show.

2500|$|Heterosexual Swedish {{international}} and former Arsenal and West Ham United midfielder Freddie Ljungberg endured questions over his sexuality [...] "due to his bachelor lifestyle {{and love of}} musicals and fashion". Despite denying the speculation, he told the New York Times that [...] "I don’t mind at all. I am proud of that. I love fashion, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> many gay people have amazing style. So that is a compliment to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lyne cast Lane in {{the role}} of Constance after seeing her in the film, A Walk on the Moon. He felt that the actress [...] "breathes a certain sexuality. But she's sympathetic, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> many sexy women tend to be tough and hard at the same time." [...] Lyne also wanted Gere and Lane to gain weight in order to portray the comfort of a middle-age couple. In particular, he wanted Gere to gain 30 pounds and left donuts in the actor's trailer every morning.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, in a {{discussion}} forum, Lee Kuan Yew was asked whether the emotional bonds of various ethnic groups in Singapore could be a hurdle to nation building, Lee replied: [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> {{over a long period}} of time, and selectively. We must not make an error. If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who's very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine-gun unit, that's a very tricky business. We've got to know his background. I'm saying these things because they are real, and if I don't think that, and I think even if today the Prime Minister doesn't think carefully about this, we could have a tragedy.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the end of}} Voyager, Ryan {{joined the}} main cast of Boston Public, {{comparing}} her new character of Ronnie with Seven of Nine, saying [...] " [...] had all of these emotions, she just wasn't comfortable expressing them, and didn't {{really know how to}} express them; Ronnie, my character on Boston Public, is quite comfortable expressing them, and is fairly free with her expressions, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>So</b> it's {{going to be a lot}} of fun. It's going to be much more free, as far as the acting style." [...] Ryan said that she had several favourite Seven of Nine episodes, including [...] "", [...] "", [...] "", [...] "", [...] "" [...] and the two-part [...] "".|$|E
2500|$|The two monuments on {{the north}} and south sides of the chancel are {{described}} by Silas Taylor in 1665. Speaking of the one {{on the north}} side, he says, “near him, on the wall, hangs a wooden shield with the arms of Devereux. Over against it on the south side, another shield hangs up with a cross engrailed between four spear-heads. I could not discern the colours… A little lower, near the remains of the quire are the effigies of a man in close armour, and a woman”… I am disposed to think that the single figure represents Sir W. Devereux, who died in 1402, and the two figures represent John Marbury and Agnes his wife. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> partly because Silas Taylor says the Devereux shield hung on the north side and the Marbury shield on the south.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} during their appearance at Rock in Rio in September 2017, Noodles and Holland {{talked about the}} new Offspring album, with the former commenting, [...] "We've got a few songs already done. We wanna do a couple more, and we definitely want to get something out soon. Our fans have waited long enough, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>so</b> we wanna get something in their hands that they can listen to and hold, and put in their ears." [...] Holland added that the album will [...] "for sure" [...] be released in 2018. In an October 2017 interview, however, Holland said, [...] "I think I want to do like an EP. It's kind of what people are doing these days and it makes for less time in between stuff. It has been five years for us {{so we have a}} few songs together and I'm hoping to get something out by early next year." [...] In the same month, bassist Greg K. mentioned a possible 2018 release date for the new Offspring album, and revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for the album's slow progress is because they have been working on songs here and there. He also stated that the band is no hurry to finish the album.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 November 1965, Tynan {{participated in}} a live TV debate, {{broadcast}} {{as part of the}} BBC's late-night satirical show BBC-3. He was asked whether he would allow a play to be staged in which sexual intercourse was represented on the stage, and replied: “Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> certainly. I doubt if there are any rational people to whom the word 'fuck' would be particularly diabolical, revolting or totally forbidden. I think that anything which can be printed or said can also be seen." [...] No recording survives of the programme, but Private Eye always maintained that Tynan's stammer made it the first three-syllable four-letter word. At the time, this was {{believed to be the first}} time the word [...] "fuck" [...] had been spoken on British television – although it has since been pointed out that at least three others have a prior claim: Brendan Behan on Panorama in 1956 (although his drunken slurring was not understood); an anonymous man who painted the railings on Stranmillis Embankment alongside the River Lagan in Belfast, who in 1959 told Ulster TV's magazine show, Roundabout, that his job was [...] "fucking boring"; and the actress and raconteur Miriam Margolyes, who claims to have used the word in frustration whilst appearing on University Challenge in 1963. Johnson later called Tynan's use of the word [...] "his masterpiece of calculated self-publicity", adding [...] "for a time it made him the most notorious man in the country".|$|E
2500|$|Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as {{an amiable}} figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, [...] "I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, {{and the more}} so from his having no pretensions to it". Selwyn also said that [...] "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no {{consideration}} on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. You have heard me say, that I thought he had no malice or rancour; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> still and am sure of it. But I {{think that he has}} no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not". Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: [...] "The essential defect in his character and the cause of all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart". Edward Gibbon remarked that [...] "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood." [...] Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that [...] "friendship was the only real happiness in the world." [...] For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster. [...] "Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power." [...] The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were [...] "the witty and wicked" [...] satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.|$|E
