40|$|This article {{analyzed}} {{the demand for}} meats at household level {{over the past decade}} in Uruguay, a country that exhibits a very high per capita consumption of these products. In particular, the consumption of beef is one of {{the highest in the world}} and only comparable to Argentina. The analysis involved a two-step estimation of an incomplete system of censored demand equations using household data from the last available national income and expenditure survey (2005 / 06). Thirteen meat products were included in the analysis: six broad beef products (deboned hindquarter cuts, bone-in hindquarter cuts, ground beef, rib plate, bone-in <b>forequarter</b> <b>cuts,</b> and other beef cuts), four products from other meats (sheep, pork, poultry, and fish), and three generic mixed-meat products. A complete set of short-term income, own-price and cross-price elasticities were computed and reported along with their 90 % confidence intervals (CI). The results were consistent with both economic theory and empirical evidence as well as with the expected behavior, considering the relevance of these products, particularly beef, in the diet of Uruguayan consumers. All meat items were necessary goods and evidenced income-inelastic responses, which was expected given their high consumption level. All meats behaved as normal goods although exhibiting different reactions to changes in price. In general, beef cuts were more price elastic than other more broadly defined products. The more specific and disaggregated the meat product the higher its corresponding direct price elasticity. The complement/substitute relationships found in this study were highly depended on the specific product combinations...|$|E
40|$|To obtain {{slaughter}} weight and {{age and the}} carcass characteristics of young bulls, a feedlot study was conducted at Embrapa Pecuária Sudeste. A total of 215 animals from Embrapa and private farms, 3 / 8 and 1 / 2 Blonde d'Aquitaine x Nellore; 1 / 2 Canchim x Nellore; 1 / 2 Limousin x Nellore; 1 / 2 Piedmontese x Nellore; Canchim (CA) and Nellore (NE), were used in 1994, 1995 and 1997. The {{slaughter weight}}s (TRAT) of 400 (I); 440 (II) and 480 kg (III), except for NE cattle (380, 410 and 440 kg), were tested. All animals received, ad libitum, a diet based on 50 % whole plant corn silage and 50 % concentrate, on a dry matter basis. The live weight of the animals were obtained after fasting of 16 hours. The animals were slaughtered at a commercial packing plant. The data were submitted {{to the analysis of}} variance and the means were compared by SNK tests. The straightbred Canchim and all crossbred animals were slaughtered at 231, 252 and 273 kg of hot carcass weight with an average age of 15. 4; 16. 1 and 16. 8 months, for TRAT I, II and III, respectively; while straightbred Nellore were slaughtered at 211. 5; 219 and 228 kg hot carcass weight with an average age of 16. 4; 17. 2 and 17. 5 months, for TRAT I, II and III, respectively. The estimated means of days on feedlot, yield of carcass, rib eye area and backfat thickness were: 70. 9; 95. 1 and 114. 7 days; 57. 2; 57. 7 and 58. 3 %; 31. 4; 30. 9 and 30. 2 cm 2 / 100 kg carcass weight; 2. 5; 3. 1 and 3. 6 mm, for TRAT I, II and III, respectively. The percentage of saleable meat from the hindquarter gunbit cut was similar for all three slaughter weights; while a reduction of the percentage of bones was compensated for by an increase in the percentage of trimmed excess fat with an increase of slaughter weight. There were significant interactions between genetic group and TRAT for estimated slaughter weights, percentage of hindquarter, hindquarter gunbit and <b>forequarter</b> <b>cuts</b> and the rib eye area...|$|E
40|$|Com o objetivo de obter o peso e idade de abate e as características de carcaça de bovinos machos não-castrados, o confinamento foi desenvolvido na Embrapa Pecuária do Sudeste. Um total de 215 animais, da Embrapa e de produtores particulares, sendo 53 Blonde d'Aquitaine x Nelore (BN), 36 Canchim x Nelore (CN), 36 Limousin x Nelore (LN), 36 Piemontês x Nelore (PN), 18 Canchim (CA) e 36 Nelore (NE), foram utilizados. Foram avaliados os pesos de abate (TRAT) de 400 (I), 440 (II) e 480 kg (III), exceto para os bovinos NE, que foram de 380, 410 e 440 kg. Os animais receberam uma dieta, ad libitum, à base de 50 % de silagem de milho e 50 % de concentrado, na base seca. O peso vivo dos animais foi obtido, após jejum de água e alimentos de 16 horas. Os animais foram abatidos em frigorífico comercial. Os dados foram submetidos à análise de variância e as médias, comparadas pelo teste SNK. Os animais cruzados e Canchim foram abatidos com 231, 252 e 273 kg de carcaça quente aos 15, 4; 16, 1 e 16, 8 meses de idade para os TRAT I, II e III, respectivamente, enquanto as carcaças dos animais NE pesaram 211, 5; 219 e 228 kg aos 16, 4; 17, 2 e 17, 5 meses, respectivamente. As médias estimadas de período experimental, rendimento de carcaça, área de olho de lombo e espessura de gordura externa foram: 70, 9; 95, 1 e 114, 7 dias; 57, 2; 57, 7 e 58, 3 %; 31, 4; 30, 9 e 30, 2 cm²/ 100 kg de carcaça; 2, 5; 3, 1 e 3, 6 mm, para os TRAT I, II e III, respectivamente. A percentagem de carne comestível do traseiro especial não foi alterada pelos pesos de abate, ocorrendo redução na percentagem de ossos e aumento na percentagem de aparas de gordura, à medida que aumentou o peso de abate. Ocorreram interações entre TRAT e grupos genéticos para pesos estimados de abate, percentagens de cortes traseiro total, traseiro especial e dianteiro da carcaça resfriada e área de olho de lombo.

40|$|Carcass {{characteristics}} {{of small and}} medium-frame Aberdeen Angus young steers, finished in feedlot and slaughtered with similar subcutaneous fat thickness are evaluated. The average age and live weight {{at the start of}} feedlot were respectively 298 days and 202 kg. The steers were confined during 158 days, and slaughtered with average subcutaneous fat thickness of 6. 4 mm. The feed consisted of sorghum silage and concentrate at 60 : 40 ratio of dry matter during the first 63 days and 50 : 50 afterward. The frame was calculated by formula F =- 11. 548 + (0. 4878 xh) - (0. 0289 xID) + (0. 0000146 xID²) +(0. 0000759 xIDxh), where h is the height and ID the age, in days. Steers with medium frame showed superiority in important marketing aspects such as warm (p < 0. 0001) and cold carcass (p < 0. 0001) weights. Muscularity measurements such as longissimus dorsi area in relation to cold carcass (p = 0. 0477) and empty body (p = 0. 0419) weights were lower for medium-frame steers. Carcass conformation, longissimus dorsi area and cushion thickness were similar in both frame. The commercial <b>cuts,</b> <b>forequarter</b> (p < 0. 001), flank (p = 0. 009) and saw cut (p = 0. 0003) in kg were higher for medium-frame steers. Saw cut decreased 0. 18 % with an increase in frame (p = 0. 0404). Weight of the carcass tissues increased with the steers frame, whereas the percentage of muscle tissue decreased 0. 57 % (p = 0. 0410) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to assess carcass features, physicochemical and sensory parameters of meat from steers finished on three types of pastures: natural pasture; natural pasture improved, fertilized and oversown with winter species; and annual summer grassland. The experiment was conducted from December 14, 2009 to November 30, 2010, with treatments distributed in a completely randomized design with a different number of replicates. Animals were used as experimental units. Experimental animals were Aberdeen Angus steers with twenty months of initial age and 354 ± 27. 4 kg of live weight, on average. The highest average daily gains were obtained for the annual summer grassland. There was no effect of treatments on carcass conformation. The highest carcass yield was obtained on the improved natural pasture. <b>Forequarter</b> yield, side <b>cut</b> yield and longissimus muscle area were similar between the pastures. Moisture and total lipids were not affected by the pasture. Thawing and cooking losses were higher in improved natural pasture and lower in sorghum pasture. Regardless of the treatment, the meat had luminosity ranging from intermediate to dark, high in red, high in yellow, and considered within the normal range for beef. Meat of higher shear force was found in natural pasture, and lower shear force was observed in meat from annual summer grassland. Average live weight daily gain explained 18 % of the shear force. Sensory evaluation by duo-trio test showed differences between samples from distinct pastures in flavor. All the studied systems allow for desirable characteristics in carcass and meat...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar o desempenho em confinamento, as características de carcaça e a qualidade da carne de animais puros das raças Tabapuã (T), Bonsmara (B), cruzados ½ Bonsmara ½ Nelore (B 1) e cruzados ½ Bonsmara ¼ Red Angus ¼ Nelore (B 2). Foram utilizados cinco bovinos castrados de cada grupo genético, com idade média e peso vivo de 22 meses e 394 kg, respectivamente, ao início do experimento. A dieta de todos os animais foi composta por silagem de cana-de-açúcar e ração comercial, na proporção respectivamente de 55 e 45 % (base seca), tendo 16, 83 % de PB e 58, 64 % de NDT. Os animais foram abatidos quando atingiram o escore {{corporal}} 3, onde 1 = magros e 5 = obesos. Houve efeito significativo (P 0. 05) {{among the}} genetic groups for cold carcass weight and percentages of commercial <b>cuts</b> (<b>forequarter,</b> hindquarter and sidequarter) at the slaughter. Bonsmara steers presented the greatest ribeye area {{and percentage of}} muscle, and the smallest percentage of fat in the carcass. B 1 animals presented greater back fat thickness (BFT) than Bonsmara and Tabapuã animals, however all genetic groups presented BFT greater than the minimum (3 mm) required by the meat industry. There {{was no difference in}} the meat centesimal composition among the genetic groups. Meat from Bonsmara, B 1 and B 2 presented greater tenderness than from Tabapuã steers. The Longissimus fat acid profile did not differ among the genetic groups. It can be concluded that the meat from Bonsmara, B 1 and B 2 animals presented greater quality than Tabapuã steers...|$|R
