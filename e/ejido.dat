The Ministry of Education of Guerrero canceled classes at all schools in the evening and close the port navigation. Faced with the prospect of Henriette strengthening, The Head of the Harbor Bay in Acapulco stopped all travel for small craft and coastal fisheries. Also blue and yellow flags were raised as a preventive measure for swimmers. On September 4, the port of Mazatlán, Sinaloa had to be shut down to all navigation due to the inclement weather produced by the hurricane. The port authority reported that Henriette produced waves surpassing 4meters (13ft) in height. The Carnival Pride cruise scheduled to arrive at the port had to be diverted out to sea {{as a result of the}} port's closure. In the city itself, school was suspended for two days, and officials stated that approximately 600families might have to be evacuated. Further north, the port of Topolobampo, Sinaloa was also closed due to Henriette's threat, and 20families were evacuated from their homes in an <b>ejido.</b>|$|E

Much of {{the reason for this is}} the lack of support by the <b>ejidos,</b> or communal farm organizations. This issue for the <b>ejidos</b> is that the candidate must be from Tlacolula, and not candidates chosen by or associated with the state’s dominant PRI party. The current president is from the PAN party, but is an ex-PRI member who is accused of blackmail.

The establishment of the terminal Tláhuac caused a struggle between bus operators in the Federal District and neighboring State of Mexico for rights to transport passengers between the station and points in the State of Mexico, especially the suburb of Chalco. Residents complained that construction of the line left Avenida Tláhuac in poor condition for local traffic and pedestrians.|$|E

25|$|There are forty nine {{important}} mostly secular festivals {{through the}} year, {{with the most}} important being the Feria de la Nieve, Feria de la Alegría y el Olivo, and the Flor más Bellas del <b>Ejido.</b> The “Flor más Bella del Ejido” (Most Beautiful Flower of the <b>Ejido</b> or Field) pageant is a borough-wide event dedicated to fjthe beauty of Mexican indigenous women. The origins of this event are traced back over 220 years with symbolism {{that is based on}} the pre-Hispanic notion of a “flower-woman” representative of Mother Earth and fertility. This flower-woman is based on the goddess Xochiquetzal, the goddess of flowers and love, robbed from her husband Tlaloc by Tezcatlipoca. After the Conquest, this “flower-woman” symbol survived and would appear at certain Catholic festivals such as the Viernes de Dolores, or the Friday before Palm Sunday. An official pageant dedicated to this was established in 1786. Originally, its purpose was religious but it eventually became secularized. For this reason, the event was moved to a week before the Viernes de Dolores and then called the Viernes de las Amapolas. The event existed in this form for 170 years, with dancing, food, pulque, charros and pageants featuring china poblanas. In 1902, the tradition diminished as the last of the canals connecting the area with the Jamaica market closed. In 1921, the El Universal newspaper held a beauty pageant for the 100th anniversary {{of the end of the}} Mexican War of Independence, calling it “La India Bonita” dedicated to indigenous women. The first winner was María Bibiana Uribe. In 1936, another pageant was created for mestizo women called “la Flor Más Bella del Ejido” or the Most Beautiful Flower of the <b>Ejido,</b> which occurred each year on the Viernes de Dolores in the Santa Anita area. This event was moved to San Andres Mixquic in the 1950s, but the lack of crowds had it move again in 1955 to Xochimilco, where it remains.|$|E
25|$|The canals {{would remain}} {{a part of}} the borough until the mid-20th century. Efforts to {{preserve}} the system began in 1920, when <b>ejido</b> owners turned over land to construct new ones. In the 1930s, many of the barrios of Iztapalapa were still marked by canals and still grew vegetables, fruits and flowers. Major traffic was confined mostly to the Canal Nacional on the borough’s border. However, groundwater pumping started in the 1950s lowered water tables and began the process of destroying the rest of the canals, and most of the chinampas along with them.|$|E

25|$|The 1934 Código Agrario, promulgated {{during the}} Cárdenas {{administration}} (1934–1940), granted {{the federal government}} powers to define the “public interest” to which water could be harnessed. By virtue of such legislation, between the 1930s and 1970s, the rural community and <b>ejido</b> sector were subject to direct federal control over water. Private landowners, on the other hand, enjoyed the benefits of federally subsidized irrigation infrastructure and guaranteed market prices. Over time, large landowners became highly capitalized, while small land owners, by the 1970s, were suffering {{from the effects of}} water monopolies.|$|E
25|$|Most of the state’s land {{is devoted}} to {{agriculture}} (38.1%) or to forest (34.9%). Much of these crop forest lands are <b>ejido</b> or communal lands. The main crop is corn, with peas, barley, beans, potatoes, alfalfa, wheat, avocados and guava also grown. Livestock is raised on about 17% of the state’s farmland with cattle being the most important animal. Almost all of the forest lands in the state are used for producing forestry products such as wood and paper. However, this sector only employs 1.3% of the state’s population.|$|E
25|$|During this war, {{the area}} was mostly {{sympathetic}} the Liberation Army of the South as was the rest of Guerrero; however, fighting was mostly done in the state’s central valleys. The major effect {{of the war was}} the redistribution of land and the institution of the <b>ejido</b> system afterwards, with the aim of giving “campesinos” (peasant farmers) lands that could not be taken away from them. However, their formation did not do away with the old caciques, which still exerted considerable influence. One example of this was Silvestre Mariscal, who controlled the municipality of Atoyac starting in 1914.|$|E
40|$|Abstract only. This paper {{reports on}} the first {{comprehensive}} study of economic and livelihood considerations relating to inland fisheries in common property lands (<b>ejidos)</b> of the Mayan Zone in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Given the data-sparse nature of these fisheries, a fishery assessment approach was used which linked methods from both the natural and social sciences, and which combined the local knowledge of community residents with scientific knowledge. The results, from 48 fishing sites in 9 <b>ejidos,</b> showed that the fisheries involve both indigenous (Mayan) and non-indigenous fishers, and is mainly male oriented, although with some women involved {{in the majority of}} <b>ejidos</b> studied. A comparison with other sources of livelihood showed that for most involved in fishing, the major occupation was slash-and-burn agriculture. The fisheries are highly artisanal (small-scale) with very basic technology (notably hand-lines) utilized primarily through barefoot fishing along the shores, or with the aid of rafts and canoes, and taking place seasonally, primarily during the dry season. While the key motivation of those in the fishery was subsistence, the study found, {{for the first time in}} this form of fishery, that recreation was also a significant goal of many participants...|$|R

40|$|In {{this book}} Lawrence A. Cardoso focuses {{attention}} on the flow of unskilled, low-paid Mexican workers who migrated north across the border between Mexico and the United States from 1897 to 1931. He traces {{the origins of the}} northward movement, beginning with the rapid changes in the land and labor systems of rural Mexico in the closing decade of the nineteenth century. During Porfrrio Draz 2 ̆ 7 s long tenure in the presidency, Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s national policies favored foreign capital investment, the impact of which transformed the pastoral countryside. Prior to the inauguration of public-sponsored programs for economic development, rural inhabitants lived on communally held <b>ejidos</b> or privately owned haciendas, if not altogether securely or comfortably, at least with a sense of belonging. In general, the principal economic function of the ejiodos and haciendas in Profirian Mexico was to supply nearby urban centers with basic commodities. With the introduction of the machine culture, hacienda owners, in need of new arable lands to expand crop production, readily encroached upon the <b>ejidos.</b> The process of encroachment forced millions of ejected dwellers to relocate. For the displaced ejidatarios the choice was either to find employment and accommodations at the haciendas or to join the migratory labor force that furnished additional temporary workers at planting and harvesting seasons. According to Cardoso: a significant intrusion of the machine culture that accelerated the destruction of the <b>ejidos</b> was the highly visible railway system. As the railroads exported voluminous quantities of luxury food items to distant markets, the value of prime land for agricultural production increased correspondingly, fomenting the rapid enclosure of <b>ejidos.</b> Unstable working and living conditions in the countryside, compounded by an erratic economy, prompted thousands of families to seek an alternative in the northern borderlands, where they found passageway into the United States...|$|R
