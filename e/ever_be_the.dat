500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+". He {{argued that the}} episode was [...] "the best season finale cliffhanger the show ever did", and compared it to the second season finale [...] "Anasazi"; he noted that while the latter episode was [...] "pretty amazing", [...] "Requiem" [...] has [...] "a finality" [...] to it and a [...] "sense that nothing will <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same" [...] that made its cliffhanger ending work. VanDerWerff also wrote that the nods to the pilot episode helped to show how far the series had evolved in seven years. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. Despite lamenting the loss of Fox Mulder, he noted that [...] "the truth is The X-Files has been a show like no other and 'Requiem' proved once again there truly {{is a place for}} magic and beauty and love on the small screen and I am delighted to have witnessed it for seven seasons now." [...] Kessenich later named the episode one of the [...] "Top 25 Episode of All Time" [...] of The X-Files, ranking it at number 20.|$|E
