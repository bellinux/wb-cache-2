In Abe's Oddysee, Abe's Exoddus, and Munch's Oddysee, the Mudokons are peaceful, spiritual inhabitants of a mock-Paleolithic society. Oddworld creator Lorne Lanning has explained that the Mudokons were not always sympathetic protagonists, <b>insofar</b> <b>as,</b> though <b>they</b> represent a class of slaves exploited by the upper class, their ability to telepathically control other species contradicts that status. Their principal enemies are the Glukkons: a cephalopod-like anthropoid with only vestigial lower limbs (usually concealed by clothing), representing an industrial master class. Subordinate to the Glukkons are the Sligs, who appear as soldiers or body-servants. The Mudokons have two sacred or totemic species, both of which resemble arthropods, but are actually vertebrates: the towering Scrabs and the arachnid-like Paramites, whereof both are hunted by the Sligs on the Glukkons' behalf to make food or similar products. Mudokons, Scrabs, Paramites, and Glukkons were designed by Steven Olds.|$|R

Jim finds himself in a small town facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the others will be released in honour of Jim's status as a guest, but if he does not, they will all be killed.

5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> protect the rights of others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E
40|$|Previous works {{exploring}} {{the challenges of}} ensuring information security for neuroprosthetic devices and their users have typically built on the traditional InfoSec concept of the “CIA Triad” of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, we argue that the CIA Triad provides an increasingly inadequate foundation for envisioning information security for neuroprostheses, <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it presumes that (1) any computational systems to be secured are merely instruments for expressing their human users' agency, and (2) computing devices are conceptually and practically separable from their users. Drawing on contemporary philosophy of technology and philosophical and critical posthumanist analysis, we contend that futuristic neuroprostheses could conceivably violate these basic InfoSec presumptions, <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> (1) <b>they</b> may alter or supplant their users' biological agency rather than simply supporting it, and (2) they may structurally and functionally fuse with their users to create qualitatively novel “posthumanized” human-machine systems that cannot be secured <b>as</b> though <b>they</b> were conventional computing devices. Simultaneously, {{it is noted that}} many of the goals that have been proposed for future neuroprostheses by InfoSec researchers (e. g., relating to aesthetics, human dignity, authenticity, free will, and cultural sensitivity) fall outside the scope of InfoSec as it has historically been understood and touch {{on a wide range of}} ethical, aesthetic, physical, metaphysical, psychological, economic, and social values. We suggest that the field of axiology can provide useful frameworks for more effectively identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing such diverse types of values and goods that can (and should) be pursued through InfoSec practices for futuristic neuroprostheses...|$|R
40|$|Auditory alarms in {{a medical}} setting are a useful tool to {{communicate}} important information {{about the status of}} patients as healthcare professional complete concurrent tasks. To assist device manufacturers and medical staff, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standardized a set of melodic alarms for eight common medical commands (i. e. the IEC 60601 alarms). Unfortunately, empirical studies of these alarms show they are difficult to learn, hard to remember and are frequently confused [1 - 3]. Several studies have suggested that these problems {{may be due to the}} similarity of IEC alarms <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> that <b>they</b> have the same length, same rhythm and fall within a narrow pitch range [2, 4]. Additionally, studies suggest that by increasing the heterogeneity of alarms within a set, learning, memory and discriminability could be improved [4, 5]. Here we describe an exploratory study in which we looked at multiple factors that could increase heterogeneity. Our initial interest was in amplitude envelope (i. e. the shape of a sound over time), as we have found an improvement in memory associations for sounds with “percussive ” (i. e. naturally decaying) envelopes vs. those with “flat ” (i. e. artificial-sounding) envelopes in a previous study [6]. This manipulation did not seem to play a role in this context. However, our exploration offers new, detailed information on alarm confusions, insights that can inform future research on alarm design...|$|R

This would make Halfdan a brother or son of this Harald. The Frankish Annals vaguely mention this elder Harald as king. In Frisian history it is mentioned, that their king Redbad II (the last king of the Frisians) in 754 had to flee to [...] "the land of the Danes" [...] where king Harald reigned ("Daniae Regi Heraldi"). Also, a King Sigifrid (Siegfried) is mentioned in 777, granting refuge to the Saxon duke Widukind. In 782, an emissary {{by the name of}} Halfdan was sent by Sigifrid to Charlemagne. The last mention of Sigifrid in the Annals is in 798, when Charlemagne sent an envoy to him. In 804, Gudfred is mentioned as King of the Danes, exchanging envoys with Charlemagne. [...] Harald could be related to Sigifrid and Gudfred. His reign occurring between 798 and 804 are placed prior to that of Sigifrid.

40|$|There {{are several}} ways of conceiving {{objectivity}} [...] scientific objectivity in particular [...] and, accordingly, several ways of defending or attacking particular construals of it. According to one conception sometimes labelled "realism", objectivity in science is a semantic, modal and metaphysical notion: a scientific theory is objective <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it tells {{the truth about the}} way the world is independently of its epistemic accessibility to us. So, for instance, the Newtonian theory of gravition is objective <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it tells the truth about the motion of particles submitted to gravitational forces. What it tells us, the realist contends, holds or is the case whether or not the physical world is accessible to us. The conception is semantic <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> the notion of truth is involved, modal <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> the conception of the possibility of a mind-independent natural world is involved and metaphysical <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> a conception of a certain way the world is is involved.
