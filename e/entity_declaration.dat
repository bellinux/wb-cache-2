In XML, a subset of SGML, an <b>entity</b> <b>declaration</b> {{may not have a}} [...] identifier without a [...] identifier.|$|E

50|$|A common {{misconception}} {{holds that}} a non-validating XML parser {{does not have}} to read document type declarations, when in fact, the document type declarations must still be scanned for correct syntax as well as validity of declarations, and the parser must still parse all <b>entity</b> <b>declarations</b> in the internal subset, and substitute the replacement texts of internal entities occurring anywhere in the document type declaration or in the document body.|$|R
50|$|An SGML or XML DTD {{may also}} include <b>entity</b> <b>declarations</b> {{in which the}} token CDATA is used to {{indicate}} that entity consists of character data. The character data may appear within the declaration itself or may be available externally, referenced by a URI. In either case, character reference and parameter entity reference markup is allowed in the entity, and will be processed as such when it is read.|$|R
50|$|An entity {{is similar}} to a macro. The <b>entity</b> <b>declaration</b> assigns it a value that is {{retained}} throughout the document. A common use is to have a name more recognizable than a numeric character reference for an unfamiliar character. Entities help to improve legibility of an XML text. In general, there are two types: internal and external.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Document Type Definition (DTD) is a {{fundamental}} tool that enables users to constrain the structure of XML documents. This tool does not support semantic query. Therefore, it has recently become an active research topic in Web intelligence to endow XML with semantics for query quality. In this paper, we develop {{an extension of the}} DTD using for the provision of formal semantics [...] It is implemented using an <b>entity</b> <b>declaration</b> in the DTD to describe the ontology and recurring this description to the form of Frame Logic. After validated by our extended DTD, a semantic valid XML document will be produced, so as to be queried using existing query languages (such as XQL). Our extended DTD is based on two main principles (1) maximizing the sharing of meta-data on the Web and (2) possibly using the DTD’s provisions for reducing development expenses...|$|E
50|$|AdaControl {{is a free}} (GMGPL) {{tool that}} detects the use of various kinds of {{constructs}} in Ada programs. Its first goal is to control proper usage of style or programming rules, {{but it can also}} be used as a powerful tool to search for use (or non-use) of various forms of programming styles or design patterns. Searched elements range from very simple, like the occurrence of certain <b>entities,</b> <b>declarations,</b> or statements, to very sophisticated, like verifying that certain programming patterns are being obeyed.|$|R

40|$|The SUAVE project aims to {{introduce}} object-oriented and genericity extensions into VHDL {{in a way}} that does not disturb the existing language or its use. Designers regularly define abstract data types by using aspects of VHDL's type system, subprograms, and packages. They also use VHDL's genericity mechanism to parameterize component and <b>entity</b> <b>declarations</b> with formal generic constants. The SUAVE approach builds on these basicmechanisms by strengthening the facilities for encapsulation and adding an inheritance mechanism. It also extends the genericity mechanism byallowing formalgenerics types and by allowing generics to be specified in the interfaces of subprograms and packages. The SUAVE extensions are based on the features of Ada- 95. They allow units to be re-used in a muchwider variety of contexts without modifying the original code. By choosing an incremental and evolutionary approach to extensions, SUAVE avoids major additions to the language that would complicate choice of mecha [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a flexible {{way in which}} a deisgn model extracted from Java programs can remain unified with the source code. Each <b>entity</b> <b>declaration</b> and reference in the Java program is assigned a globally unique identifier (UID) based on its declaration scope and file which serves as a key by which its original declaration and other references can be found, and more importantly, by which information about the entity can be stored or retrieved from the design database. The resulting uniquely renamed source code makes it convenient and efficient to do further business logic and technical analysis that crosses the boundary between source code and the design database. The UIDs are attached to the entity references in the source code using XML markup, so that both the UID and the original source text of the declaration or reference are available in the renamed source program. While is possible to generate the unique names in an ad hoc manner, we show how to generate these using a combination of source transformations and design database inferences. This ensures that the notion of UID is consistent and well defined...|$|E
40|$|VHDL {{currently}} has a limited form of genericity in which component and <b>entity</b> <b>declarations</b> can be parameterized with formal generic constants. SUAVE extends the genericity mechanism by allowing formal generics types and by allowing generics {{to be specified}} in the interfaces of subprograms and packages. The approach {{is based on the}} features of Ada- 95. It allows units to be re-used in a much wider variety of contexts without modifying the original code. In this paper, we show that the genericity added by SUAVE enhances reuse across the spectrum of modeling, from high-level to gate level. In particular, the genericity extensions interact with the SUAVE extensions for objectoriented data modeling to significantly improve support for high-level behavioral modeling and for developing testbenches. We show that the genericity extensions integrate seamlessly with the existing language. Furthermore, the implementation burden is not large, and, since generic instantiation is performed at elaboration time, there is no performance penalty in simulation or synthesis. 1...|$|R

50|$|An {{internal}} entity has a {{value that}} {{is either a}} literal string, or a parsed string comprising markup and entities defined in the same document (such as a Document Type Declaration or subdocument). In contrast, an external <b>entity</b> has a <b>declaration</b> that invokes an external document, thereby necessitating the intervention of an entity manager to resolve the external document reference.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{characteristic}} functions of modern {{government is to}} administer declarations of attachment. Many of these declarations are compulsory, and they span a wide range. In order to receive some social benefit-a license, citizenship, education, employment, a right to cohabit-one must declare one 2 ̆ 7 s allegiance to a person or <b>entity.</b> <b>Declarations</b> of attachment are often backed {{by the force of}} law. Membership in private organizations, including fraternities, religious groups, and clubs, may also be conditioned on compliance with requirements of this sort. Compulsory oaths have been a prominent source of controversy {{in the latter half of}} the twentieth century. Consider, for example, recent debates over the pledge of allegiance, loyalty oaths, the marriage vow, and oaths of citizenship for new Americans. Civil libertarians have criticized compulsory declarations in some or all of these settings on the ground that they impose requirements of uniformity and obedience that are inconsistent with important principles of pluralism and individual freedom. Defenders of compulsory declarations respond that oaths serve important unifying, educative, and even celebratory functions, inculcating in participants a sense of the solemnity and importance of such central institutions as citizenship and marriage. In this view, otherwise plausible principles of freedom and pluralism should not be permitted to override the legitimate functions performed by compulsory oaths. Indeed, freedom and pluralism may ultimately depend on the social cohesion brought about by institutions that perform precisely those functions. My goal in this essay is to explore the diverse social functions of compulsory declarations of attachment. The treatment will be tentative and speculative; it will also be largely descriptive rather than normative. I want to provide some preliminary answers to the following questions: What social tasks do compulsory declarations carry out? To what problems and needs, and to whose problems and needs, are they an attempted response...|$|R
500|$|Through the mid-1980s, Wałęsa {{continued}} underground Solidarity-related activities. Every {{issue of}} the leading underground weekly publication Tygodnik Mazowsze bore his motto, [...] "Solidarity will not be divided or destroyed". Following a 1986 amnesty for Solidarity activists, Wałęsa co-founded the Provisional Council of NSZZ Solidarity (Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarność), the first overt legal Solidarity <b>entity</b> since the <b>declaration</b> of martial law. From 1987 to 1990, he organized and led the semi-illegal Provisional Executive Committee of the Solidarity Trade Union. In mid-1988 he instigated work-stoppage strikes at the Gdańsk Shipyard. [...] He was frequently hauled in for interrogations by the Polish secret police, the Security Service (SB), during the 1980s. On many of these occasions, Danuta--who was even more anti-Communist than her husband--was known to openly taunt SB agents when they picked Lech up.|$|R
5|$|On September 11, 1986, 225 Polish {{political}} prisoners were released—the last of those connected with Solidarity, and arrested {{during the previous}} years. Following amnesty on September 30, Wałęsa created the first public, legal Solidarity <b>entity</b> since the <b>declaration</b> of martial law—the Temporary Council of NSZZ Solidarność (Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarność)—with Bogdan Borusewicz, Zbigniew Bujak, Władysław Frasyniuk, Tadeusz Janusz Jedynak, Bogdan Lis, Janusz Pałubicki and Józef Pinior. Soon afterwards, the new Council {{was admitted to the}} International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many local Solidarity chapters now broke their cover throughout Poland, and on October 25, 1987, the National Executive Committee of NSZZ Solidarność (Krajowa Komisja Wykonawcza NSZZ Solidarność) was created. Nonetheless, Solidarity members and activists continued to be persecuted and discriminated, if less so than during the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, a rift between Wałęsa's faction and a more radical Fighting Solidarity grew as the former wanted to negotiate with the government, while the latter planned for an anti-communist revolution.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Association of South East Asian Nations was {{established}} as a political and economic <b>entity</b> through Bangkok <b>Declaration</b> in 1967. Among its seven objectives are: to accelerate growth, social progress and cultural development, to promote regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice {{and the rule of}} law in the relationship between countries in the region and adherence to the principle to the United Nations Charter. Although the term ‘human rights’ is not explicitly used in the Declaration, by affirming adherence to the principle of the United Nations Charter, the founding members of ASEAN accepted its purposes and principles. The Association of South East Asian Human rights issues and the establishment of Association South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) human rights mechanism are still very challenging matters for ASEAN. Generally speaking, ASEAN has been making a slow progress in the field of human rights. ASEAN has long empashized that the promotion and the protection of human rights by the international community must recognize national sovereignty, national border and non-interference in another state’s affairs. ASEAN views human rights as an internal affairs. The establishment of human rights mechanism was provided for by the Charter but what kind of human rights body ASEAN would be comfortable with was a crucial question for ASEAN and its people. Through the setting up of ASEAN Human Rights Body, this paper aims to examine the effectiveness of the ASEAN Human Rights Body in dealing with human rights issues in ASEAN region.   The Effectiveness of Asean Human Rights Body in Dealing With Human Rights Issues in Asean Regio...|$|R
5000|$|On 15 June 2006, a {{demonstration}} {{was held in}} Banja Luka {{in which it was}} demanded that in case Kosovo becomes independent, RS must hold an independence referendum. In 2007, the [...] "Plebiscit of Republika Srpska" [...] demanding an independence referendum was handed over to the National Assembly. In 2007, Bosniak and Bosnian Croat members of the Presidency called for the abolishment of the <b>entities.</b> Since Kosovo's <b>declaration</b> of independence Bosnian Serb nationalists have called for Milorad Dodik to fulfill his promises and call a referendum. Dodik has since said he will only call a referendum if Srpska's autonomy is threatened. Despite this, Bosnian Serb lawmakers passed a resolution on 21 February 2008 calling for an independence referendum if a majority of the UN members, especially members of the European Union (EU), recognise Kosovo's declaration of independence. After the resolution was passed the U.S. cut aid to the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) and the resolution was condemned by the EU. The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) overseeing Bosnia and Herzegovina said the country's entities have no right to secede. The High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Miroslav Lajčák, said RS has [...] "absolutely no right" [...] to secede and that he would use his Bonn Powers [...] "if there are threats to peace and stability" [...] or the Dayton peace agreement, [...] "Republika Srpska does {{not have the right to}} secede from BiH, at the same time no one can unilaterally abolish Republika Srpska." [...] Serbian President Boris Tadić said that Serbia does not support a breakup of Bosnia and that, as a guarantor of the Dayton Accords that brought peace to Bosnia, supports Bosnia’s territorial integrity. In an interview for a Novi Sad daily, Dodik said if most countries recognise Kosovo's self-proclaimed independence, this would legitimise the right to secession and added [...] "we do not see a single reason why we should not be granted the right to self-determination, the right envisaged in international conventions." ...|$|R
