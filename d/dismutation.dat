25|$|In biology {{this type}} of {{reaction}} is called a <b>dismutation</b> reaction. It involves both oxidation and reduction of superoxide ions. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) group of enzymes increase the rate of reaction to near the diffusion-limited rate. The key to the action of these enzymes is a metal ion with variable oxidation state that can act either as an oxidizing agent or as a reducing agent.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} of superoxide with non-radicals is spin-forbidden. In biological systems, {{this means that}} its main reactions are with itself (<b>dismutation)</b> or with another biological radical such as nitric oxide (NO) or with a transition-series metal. The superoxide anion radical (O2−) spontaneously dismutes to O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) quite rapidly (~105 M−1s−1 at pH 7). SOD is necessary because superoxide reacts with sensitive and critical cellular targets. For example, it reacts with the NO radical, and makes toxic peroxynitrite.|$|E
25|$|Superoxide dismutases (SOD) are a {{class of}} enzymes that {{catalyze}} the <b>dismutation</b> of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. As such, they are an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen. In mammals and most chordates, three forms of superoxide dismutase are present. SOD1 is located primarily in the cytoplasm, SOD2 in the mitochondria and SOD3 is extracellular. The first is a dimer (consists of two units), while the others are tetramers (four subunits). SOD1 and SOD3 contain copper and zinc ions, while SOD2 has a manganese ion in its reactive centre. The genes are located on chromosomes 21, 6, and 4, respectively (21q22.1, 6q25.3 and 4p15.3-p15.1).|$|E

2500|$|Because the uncatalysed <b>dismutation</b> {{reaction}} for superoxide requires two superoxide molecules {{to react}} with each other, the <b>dismutation</b> rate is second-order {{with respect to}} initial superoxide concentration. Thus, the half-life of superoxide, although very short at high concentrations (e.g., 0.05 seconds at 0.1mM) is actually quite long at low concentrations (e.g., 14 hours at 0.1 nM). In contrast, the reaction of superoxide with SOD is first order with respect to superoxide concentration. Moreover, superoxide dismutase has the largest kcat/KM (an approximation of catalytic efficiency) of any known enzyme (~7 x 109 M−1s−1), this reaction being limited only by the frequency of collision between itself and superoxide.

2500|$|Superoxide dismutase (SOD, [...] ) is {{an enzyme}} that {{alternately}} catalyzes the <b>dismutation</b> (or partitioning) of the superoxide (O2) radical into either ordinary molecular oxygen (O2) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Superoxide is produced as {{a by-product of}} oxygen metabolism and, if not regulated, causes many types of cell damage. Hydrogen peroxide is also damaging and is degraded by other enzymes such as catalase. Thus, SOD is an important antioxidant defense in nearly all living cells exposed to oxygen.

2500|$|According to Blough & Zepp, {{superoxide}} {{is one of}} {{the hardest}} reactive oxygen species to quantify because it is present in low concentrations: 2×10−12 M in the open ocean and up to 2×10−10M in coastal areas. [...] The main sources of biological superoxide in the ocean come from the reduction of oxygen at the cell surface and metabolites released into the water. In marine systems, superoxide most often acts as a one-electron reductant, but it can also serve as an oxidant and may increase the normally slow oxidation rates of environmental compounds. [...] Superoxide is very unstable, with between 50 and 80% of its concentration of anions spontaneously disproportionating to hydrogen peroxide. [...] At its peak, this reaction occurs with a rate constant on the order of 2.2×104 – 4.5×105 L mol−1sec−1 in seawater. [...] The <b>dismutation</b> of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide can also be catalyzed by the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase with a rate constant on the order of 2×109 L mol−1sec−1. As a result of these fast acting processes, the steady state concentration of superoxide is very small. Since superoxide is also moderately reactive towards trace metals and dissolved organic matter, any remaining superoxide is thought to be removed from the water column through reactions with these species. As a result, the presence of superoxide in surface waters has been known to result in an increase of reduced iron. This, in turn, serves to enhance the availability of iron to phytoplankton whose growth is often limited by this key nutrient. [...] As a charged radical species, superoxide is unlikely to significantly affect an organism's cellular function since it is not able to easily diffuse through the cell membrane. [...] Instead, its potential toxicity lies in its ability to react with extracellular surface proteins or carbohydrates to inactivate their functions. [...] Although its lifetime is fairly short (about 50 microseconds), superoxide has the potential to reach cell surfaces since it has a diffusion distance of about 320nm.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "Wurster's blue" [...] {{is often}} {{reserved}} for the radical cation, the colorless diamine being called tetramethylphenylenediamine (TMPD). The midpoint potential for titration of the first electron is given as 0.276 V vs NHE, and this transition is useful in potentiometric titrations as both a redox mediator and indicator. The two electron-oxidized form (di-iminium) is unstable in aqueous solutions, therefore highly oxidizing conditions should be avoided in titrations relying on TMPD, or reached only during {{the final stage of}} the titration. The second oxidation step is not well separated from the first on the redox scale, so some instability will be encountered on the oxidizing side of 0.276, and it is impossible to prepare pure aqueous solutions of Wurster's Blue due to its <b>dismutation</b> to the unstable diaminium and TMPD.|$|E

5000|$|The assay of {{superoxide}} {{generated in}} biological systems {{is a difficult}} task because of its high reactivity and short half-life. One approach {{that has been used}} in quantitative assays converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, which is relatively stable. Hydrogen peroxide is then assayed by a fluorimetric method. As a free radical, superoxide has a strong EPR signal, and it is possible to detect superoxide directly using this method when its abundance is high enough. For practical purposes, this can be achieved only in vitro under non-physiological conditions, such as high pH (which slows the spontaneous <b>dismutation)</b> with the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Researchers have developed a series of tool compounds termed [...] "spin traps"(see spin trapping) that can react with superoxide, forming a meta-stable radical (half-life 1-15 minutes), which can be more readily detected by EPR. Superoxide spin trapping was initially carried out with DMPO, but, more recently, phosphorus derivatives with improved half-lives, such as DEPPMPO and DIPPMPO, have become more widely used.|$|E
50|$|The {{generally}} accepted reaction mechanism initially utilizes two successive stages of transmetallation of the committed Grignard reagent, {{leading to an}} intermediate dialkyldiisopropyloxytitanium complex. This complex undergoes a <b>dismutation</b> to give an alkane molecule and a titanacyclopropane 1. The insertion of the carbonyl group of the ester in the weakest carbon-titanium bond leads to an oxatitanacyclopentane 2 being rearranged to ketone 3. Lastly, the insertion of the carbonyl group of 3 in the residual carbon-titanium connection forms a cyclopropane ring. In the transition state of this elementary stage, which is the limiting stage of the reaction, an agostic interaction stabilizing between the beta hydrogen and the R2 group and the titanium atom was called upon to explain the diastereoselectivity observed. Complex 4 obtained is a tetraalkyloxytitanium compound able to play a part {{similar to that of}} the starting tetraisopropyloxytitanate, which closes the catalytic cycle. At the end of the reaction, the product is mainly in the shape of the magnesium alcoholate 5, giving the cyclopropanol after hydrolysis by the reaction medium.|$|E
