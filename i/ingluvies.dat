While in most cases, adults, larvae or pupae are eaten as staples by indigenous people, beondegi or silkworm pupae are eaten as a snack in Korean cuisine while Maguey worm is considered a delicacy in Mexico. In the Carnia region of Italy, children catch and eat <b>ingluvies</b> of the toxic Zygaena moths in early summer. The <b>ingluvies,</b> despite having a very low cyanogenic content, serve as a convenient, supplementary source of sugar to the children who can include this resource as a seasonal delicacy at minimum risk.|$|E
50|$|A crop (sometimes {{also called}} a croup or a craw, or <b>ingluvies)</b> is a {{thin-walled}} expanded {{portion of the}} alimentary tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion. This anatomical structure is found {{in a wide variety}} of animals. It has been found in birds, some non-avian dinosaurs, and in invertebrate animals including gastropods (snails and slugs), earthworms, leeches, and insects.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. —A {{field survey}} of local {{traditional}} food habits in northern Italy revealed that children in Carnia have traditionally eaten sweet <b>ingluvies</b> (the crop) from day flying moths {{of the genus}} Zygaena and its mimic, Syntomis. These moths are brightly colored, and all species of Zygaena contain cyanogenic glucosides, which release toxic hydrogen cyanide upon degradation. The presence of cyanogenic glucosides in larvae and imagos (adults) {{as well as in}} <b>ingluvies</b> of Zygaena and Syntomis moths was investigated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The sugar content of the <b>ingluvies</b> was determined using gas chromatography and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. The <b>ingluvies</b> contained very low quantities of cyanogenic glucosides but high quantities of various sugars. We conclude that over time children have become acquainted with the use of Zygaena as a convenient, supplementary source of sugar in early summer when Zygaena is very common and easy to catch by hand. Because the <b>ingluvies</b> have a very low cyanogenic content, children can include this resource as a seasonal delicacy at minimum risk...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The crop (<b>ingluvies),</b> {{an organ}} for food storage in most avian species when the {{proventriculus}} is full, {{is located at}} the base of the esophagus. Little is known about any immunological capacity in the crop, and the current study was conducted to determine whether any antibodies to SE could be found in crop flushes taken from White Leghorn hens following infection with this organism. Surprisingly, an exceptionally strong IgA anti-SE response could be detected in the crops of hens 17...|$|E
40|$|Fight against mycotoxicosis {{could be}} carried on through {{prophylaxis}} measures, such as well drying the cereals presenting high humidity values, prior to storage. If they are already contaminated with mycotoxins, they could be annihilated through absorption inhibition or by usage of some bacteria which consume mycotoxins. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to assess the effect of ochratoxine A (OTA) and deoxynivalenol (DON) on the haematological, immunological an histological response of the chicken broilers, protected or not protected against mycotoxins through feeding or not a detoxifying-mycotoxin inhibitor additive, meaning Mycofix MTV product, from Biomin, at dietary inclusion rates of 1 ‰ and 3 ‰. The biological material was represented by 111678 ROSS- 308 chicken broilers, reared industrially, in deep litter system, till slaughter at 40 days old. Prior to slaughtering, blood samples were taken; digesta samples and internal organ tissues were sampled from slaughtered broilers, in order to assess the influence of the used feed additive on the following parameters: concentration of DON in digesta, concentration of OTA in gall, white blood cells formula (%), properdine (µg/ml), serum lysosime (µg/ml), histopatological alterations in <b>ingluvies,</b> ileum, caecum, liver, kidneys and spleen. Mycotoxicological exam revealed rapid inactivation of DON, since the <b>ingluvies,</b> with: 55. 52...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRA CT Contrib. Nat. Hist. 12 : 461 – 488. Folk {{traditional}} diets in Western Friuli include {{wild plants}} and few invertebrates (i. e. insects) that are peculiar in the Southern Alps. 156 plants are listed here, ranging from 200 m to 2200 m a. s. l [...] This selection {{is the result}} of the research of 64 informants who contributed with their personal experiences. Recovery of scattered knowledge is valuable for maintaining and sustaining its use and enhancing a wild biodiversity base for agroecology, conservation and ecotourism. Pistiç, frita and lidùm are some of the names used for about 50 – 60 herbs collected in field margins, hay meadows, woodlands and the wild, most commonly in spring. In order to be consumed, most herbs are boiled together and are later sautéed with butter or lard and garlic. The higher range pre-alpine Carnic slopes have supported seasonal sheep and cow grazing and summer pastoral communities have traditionally used plants as well for salads, soups and spices in addition to the boiled-sautéed dish. Furthermore, herbs have been used as medicinal elixirs and for milk processing. For instance, Lycopodium annotinum L. was employed to filter milk; Asplenium ruta-muraria L. was cooked with maize flour to prepare "fregole" a dish eaten with milk or coffee made from barley. Specifically, collections of these useful alpine plants include: Chenopodium bonus-henricus L., Aruncus dioicus (Walter) Fernald, Cicerbita alpina (L.) Wallr., Rumex alpinus L., Carlina acaulis L., Myrrhis odorata (L.) Scop., Ranunculus hybridus Biria (dry leaves used as pepper), and raw bulbils of Polygonum viviparum L. Some parts or products of insects were also eaten in these summer meadow areas ("magredi") and hay meadows such as the <b>ingluvies</b> of adult Lepidoptera (Zygaenidae Zygaena spp. and Ctenuchidae Syntomis spp.). Bees such as Bombus sp. were exploited for honey content in their <b>ingluvies</b> and their nests were exploited for honey. The pollen and nectar deposits of Osmia sp. inside snail shells were eaten as a snack. Of the grasshopper Decticus verrucivorus (L.) at least the prominent femurs were eaten raw. These local traditional habits need further ethnobiological attention and nutritional study since the loss of practical experience in collecting these 462 Angelo L. Dreon & Maurizio G. Paoletti fragments of biodiversity make their memory prone to be lost. The highest number of plant species found in Friuli is associated to the highest amount of wild plants offered in this region by specialized restaurants (Osterie) in the Northern regions of Italy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. 10 ISA Brown hybrid hens, 53 weeks old, {{placed in}} {{individual}} cages, {{were killed by}} administering iv a T 61 solution at 10 different times after being deprived of food. After that the digestive tracts were ligatured and segmented into 9 parts: <b>ingluvies</b> (ING), stomach (proventriculus and gizzard) (ST), upper duodenum (DP), lower duodenum (DD), jejunum (JEJ), upper ileum (PI), lower ileum (ID), ceca (CEC) and rectum (R). In {{order to determine the}} MRT of the dry matter in the segments of the digestive tract by the technique of continuous administration of the marker simultaneously with the total collecting of the digesta from one segment, the hens were fed with combined feed with a supplement of 0. 1 % Cr 2 O 3 used as marker. The results showed that the average value of the MRT in the small intestine was of 185 minutes; the steady state of the marker is kept for 2 hours and 45 minutes after the limitation to the access to food, i. e. for the T 1 – T 7 killing time, but it is not valid for the hens killed during T 8 (3 hours and 45 min.), T 9 (5 hours and 45 min.) and T 10 (7 hours and 45 min.) ...|$|E
