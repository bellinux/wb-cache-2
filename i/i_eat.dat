After that, the ala brought lunch and said to the woman, “Eat, kuma.” “How can <b>I</b> <b>eat</b> after I saw a poker and a broom fighting in the first room?” “Eat, kuma, eat.

Hofmann observes that the aria depicts a [...] "pastoral idyll with a rustic musical scene – {{a tribute to the}} Enlightenment utopia of simple, happy country life." [...] The violin's figuration suggests the drone of bagpipes or hurdy-gurdy. The voice leaps in upward sixths, in [...] "folk-like character" [...] and conveying [...] "contented tranquillity".
