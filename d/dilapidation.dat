5|$|As {{the castle}} was disused from the mid-15th century it fell into <b>dilapidation,</b> and {{antiquarian}} depictions from the 18th century show Gleaston {{in a state}} of ruin. Though it is not open to the public, it {{has been the subject of}} historical and archaeological investigation in the 20th and 21st centuries.|$|E
5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow {{fell into a}} state of ruined <b>dilapidation,</b> with a small road being built through the centre of the {{monument}} by the 19th century at the latest. Local folklore grew up around the site, associating it with the countless stones motif. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the early 18th century, and was studied by local archaeologists in the 20th. Both it and the nearby Chestnuts Long Barrow are open for public viewing by appointment with the landowner.|$|E
5|$|The square {{has always}} had a park in its centre, which was {{originally}} Lammas land. The park's fortunes have varied over the centuries, reaching near <b>dilapidation</b> in the mid-19th century after changing ownership several times. It was restored under the direction of Albert Grant, which included the construction of four new statues and a fountain of William Shakespeare. The square was extensively refurbished and remodelled for the 2012 London Olympics, costing more than £15m and taking over 17 months to complete.|$|E
50|$|Formal {{guidance}} on <b>dilapidations</b> exists {{such as the}} PLA protocol which was currently adopted under the Civil Procedure Rules in 2012. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors produces a guidance note on dealing with <b>dilapidations</b> claims and this is currently in its sixth edition. The Financial Reporting Council's accounting standard FRS12 requires occupiers to budget for <b>dilapidations</b> in their accounts leading to more tenants seeking advice on <b>dilapidations</b> {{before the end of}} their leases.|$|R
50|$|Tenants enter {{commercial}} leases {{agreeing to}} keep premises in repair; {{if they do}} not, the law of <b>dilapidations</b> applies. Landlords {{have the ability to}} serve a schedule of <b>dilapidations</b> on a tenant either during or more commonly {{at the end of the}} lease, itemising the breaches of covenant. Remedies for the landlord will be for the tenant to undertake the specified works or for them to seek to recover from the tenant the cost of making good the disrepair. <b>Dilapidations</b> occur primarily at the end of a lease, and often disputes arise between landlords and tenants as to their extent, and in order to reach a conclusion this inevitably leads to an appraisal of past case law which stems over 100 years. In an economic downturn <b>dilapidations</b> are also commonplace either during a lease term or if the tenant exercises a break clause. Most <b>dilapidations</b> are settled by negotiation, but other methods exist in demonstrating loss suffered by a landlord such as a diminution valuation. Landlords and tenants will normally be advised by a specialist surveyor or property consultant.|$|R

5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow {{fell into a}} state of ruined <b>dilapidation,</b> perhaps {{experiencing}} deliberate destruction in the Late Medieval period, either by Christian iconoclasts or treasure hunters. In local folklore, the site became associated with the burial of a prince and the countless stones motif. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the 19th century, while archaeological excavation took place in the early 20th. In 1926, ownership was transferred to heritage charity The National Trust. Open without charge to visitors all year around, the stones are the site of a rag tree, a May Day morris dance, and various modern Pagan rituals.|$|E
5|$|Open-air cages {{installed}} in the Monkey House resulted in a dramatic improvement in the life expectancy of its residents, but the potential for expansion and improvement after the First World War was limited by the post-war economy. Rising labour costs and minimal profits resulted in the gardens' increasing <b>dilapidation.</b> The zoo began to be neglected after the sale of Belle Vue in 1925, but it was rejuvenated by the appointment of Gerald Iles as zoo superintendent in 1933. A new Gibbon Cage and Monkey Mountain were created and the Reptile House was extended.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} closed in 1978 and leased {{to a private}} company; however, the venture failed, and it closed to bathers in 1984. It was {{for a short time}} used as a trout farm, but was {{threatened}} with demolition, as an alternative to repair. In 2003 Bath and North East Somerset council put the site up for sale or long lease, and it was added to the English Heritage Buildings at Risk Register. A trust was formed in 2005 to rescue the pool from <b>dilapidation.</b> In 2006 its listed building status was raised from II to II* as it is considered particularly important buildings of more than special interest.|$|E

5000|$|In 1714 Tenison {{inherited}} considerable estates {{from his}} uncle, Edward Tenison of Lambeth, who was steward to Archbishop Tenison and left £12,000; but he subsequently {{lost most of}} his wealth in 1720 by investing it in the South Sea Company. In 1715 he acted as executor to his cousin the archbishop, and was in consequence involved in litigation {{on the question of}} <b>dilapidations</b> with Archbishop William Wake. Correspondence on the subject was published by him in 1716. The surveyor involved in estimating the <b>dilapidations</b> of the episcopal palaces was John James, who defended himself in print against what he called Tenison's [...] "cavils and misrepresentations". Wake asked for <b>dilapidations</b> of £3469. The claim was referred to Peter King, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and John Bettesworth, Dean of the Arches, as arbitrators, with the Bishop of Lichfield as moderator. The arbitrators awarded Wake £2800.|$|R

5|$|In 1952, the {{two couples}} {{discovered}} that Red House {{was up for}} sale, and as architects {{with an interest in}} Morris, they recognised its historic value. By this point, the Red House had been empty for 18 months, after Thomas Hills and his family had left in 1951, and had fallen into a state of <b>dilapidation.</b> Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were able to afford a mortgage {{with the aid of a}} loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms' name, and thus the Hollambys became Toms' tenants. The two families then moved in with their six children, and a seventh was born soon after. They camped in the house's grounds while carrying out a project of renovation.|$|E
5|$|Trade in {{the region}} was {{negatively}} impacted {{by the development of}} an oceanic route from Europe around Africa to India, and in the tax registers of the late sixteenth century, Alanya failed to qualify as an urban center. In 1571 the Ottomans designated the city as part of the newly conquered province of Cyprus. The conquest further diminished the economic importance of Alanya's port. Traveler Evliya Çelebi visited the city in 1671/1672, and wrote on the preservation of Alanya Castle, but also on the <b>dilapidation</b> of Alanya's suburbs. The city was reassigned in 1864 under Konya, and in 1868 under Antalya, as it is today. During the 18th and 19th centuries numerous villas were built in the city by Ottoman nobility, and civil construction continued under the local dynastic Karamanid authorities. Bandits again became common across Antalya Province in the mid-nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Mersea Fort, {{also known}} as Cudmore Grove Blockhouse, was an {{artillery}} fort established by Henry VIII on the East Mersea coast in 1543. It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the River Colne {{that led to the}} town of Colchester. It was triangular in shape, with earthwork walls and three bastions to hold artillery. It was demobilised in 1552, but was brought back into use several times over the next century and saw service during the Second English Civil War of 1648. The fort hosted an admiralty court to oversea the local oyster trade, until the <b>dilapidation</b> of the site forced the court to move to the Moot Hall in Colchester {{in the middle of the}} 18th century. A new gun battery was built at the fort during the Napoleonic Wars, but the fortification then fell into decline and was extensively damaged by the construction of a sea wall along the coast. The remains of the earthworks were excavated by archaeologists between 2002 and 2003.|$|E
5000|$|To {{place the}} law {{relating}} to <b>dilapidations</b> {{on a more}} satisfactory footing, the Ecclesiastical <b>Dilapidations</b> Act 1871 was passed. The buildings to which the act applies are defined to be such houses of residence, chancels, walls, fences and other buildings and things as the incumbent of the benefice is by law and custom bound to maintain in repair. In each diocese a surveyor is appointed by the archdeacons and rural deans subject to {{the approval of the}} bishop; and such surveyor shall by the direction of the bishop examine the buildings on the following occasions viz.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The parson and parsoness parsonically gone {{to study}} parsonages, schools, and <b>dilapidations,</b> I suppose. What a bore it is having them here; I'd {{have taken up}} my {{quarters}} here, otherwise, but I can't stand parish politics.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{governors}} pay for {{the works}} on execution on receipt of a certificate from the surveyor; and the surveyor, when the works have been completed to his satisfaction, gives a certificate to that effect, the effect of which, so far as regards the incumbent, is {{to protect him from}} liability for <b>dilapidations</b> for the next five years. Unnecessary buildings belonging to a residence house may, by the authority of the bishop and with the consent of the patron, be removed. An amending statute of 1872 (Ecclesiastical <b>Dilapidations</b> Act (1871) Amendment) relates chiefly to advances by the governors of Queen Anne's Bounty {{for the purposes of the}} act.|$|R
25|$|In 1728 {{the convent}} school was {{demolished}} due to <b>dilapidation</b> {{and replaced by}} a new school. In the same year the convent building, then called the Amtshaus (bailiff's office), west of the abbey, was demolished and replaced by the new Amtshaus, completed in 1729, now housing the Birkenhof home for the elderly.|$|E
25|$|In 1946 the Port Elizabeth Music and Dramatic Society (PEMADS) rented and renovated the Loubser Hall into a theatre, {{which is}} known today as the Ford Little Theatre. In the early 2000s the Athenaeum {{building}} went {{into a state of}} <b>dilapidation</b> and closed down. The Mandela Bay Development Agency (MBDA) took over the building in 2010 and started renovations. The Athenaeum and Ford Little Theatre were reopened in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The castle {{suffered}} {{considerable damage}} and <b>dilapidation</b> during the Commonwealth {{due to the}} abolition of the office of bishop whose residence it was. Cromwell confiscated the castle and sold it to the Lord Mayor of London shortly after taking it from the bishop. A similar fate befell the cathedral, it being closed in 1650 and used to incarcerate 3,000 Scottish prisoners. Graffiti left by them can still be seen today etched into the interior stone.|$|E
60|$|This {{being an}} unanswerable argument, Mrs Brook smiled {{by way of}} reply, and turned a sleeve inside out, the better to get at its <b>dilapidations.</b> Changing the subject, she desired Gertie to go and prepare dinner, as it was {{approaching}} noon.|$|R
50|$|A father {{transferred}} company {{shares to}} his son (presumption of advancement) to preserve them for the family’s benefit because he could be soon liable for <b>dilapidations</b> under commercial leases. It turned out he was not liable. The son refused to re-transfer shares.|$|R
6000|$|... 'DEAR SIR,--Agreeably to {{your request}} of the 18th instant, I have {{arranged}} to survey and make drawings of the aisle and tower of your parish church, and of the <b>dilapidations</b> which have been suffered to accrue thereto, {{with a view to}} its restoration.|$|R
25|$|The S-Bahn {{platforms}} {{were located}} on the outsides of the connecting curves. Platform B was on the track connecting the Stadtbahn to the northern Ringbahn, while platform C was on the southern curve connecting towards Treptower Park. They were removed respectively in 1970 and 1978 due to their <b>dilapidation.</b> After that, trains ran from the northern or southern Ringbahn without stopping, while trains running {{in the opposite direction}} from both the northern and southern Ringbahn continued to stop at {{one side or the other}} of platform A.|$|E
25|$|During the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) {{the capital}} of China was moved to Beijing, {{eliminating}} the need for the canal arm flowing west to Kaifeng or Luoyang. A summit section was dug across the foothills of the Shandong massif during the 1280s, shortening the overall length by as much as 700km (making the total length about 1800km) and linking Hangzhou and Beijing with a direct north-south waterway for the first time. As in the Song and Jin era, the canal fell into disuse and <b>dilapidation</b> during the Yuan dynasty's decline.|$|E
25|$|Much of the Grand Canal {{south of}} the Yellow River was ruined for several years after 1128, when Du Chong decided to break the dykes and dams holding back {{the waters of the}} Yellow River in order to decimate the {{oncoming}} Jurchen invaders during the Jin–Song wars. The Jurchen Jin dynasty continually battled with the Song in the region between the Huai River and the Yellow River; this warfare led to the <b>dilapidation</b> of the canal until the Mongols invaded in the 13th century AD and began necessary repairs.|$|E
60|$|BURGE. True. If {{you take}} a house on a ninety-nine years lease, you spend {{a good deal of}} money on it. If you take it for three months you {{generally}} have a bill for <b>dilapidations</b> to pay at the end of them.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Norris, who {{had begun}} to redden, was appeased; and, for a little while, other {{subjects}} took place of the improvements of Sotherton. Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends; their acquaintance had begun in <b>dilapidations,</b> and their habits were totally dissimilar.|$|R
25|$|The {{village of}} Old Woking, though much rebuilt due to <b>dilapidations,</b> predates {{the rest of}} Woking by over 1000 years and still {{contains}} many historic buildings; an architectural group of the village's Residents' Association has recorded the oldest buildings alongside officers detailing the listed buildings from English Heritage.|$|R
25|$|The bus {{operators}} now funded {{their operations}} via a State Government subsidy, partially {{funded by the}} sale of multi-modal Met Tickets (rather than each bus company issuing their own tickets) which are {{commonly referred to as}} a 'Myki'. In another attempt to reduce costs beyond the 'go or grow' policy, the State Government refused to subsidise new capital investment into the private bus companies (for instance, spending on new depots) and put a moratorium on the subsidies on bus replacement. Any new additions to the fleets of bus companies would have to be covered out-of-pocket by the bus companies themselves. This policy led to the <b>dilapidation</b> of the bus fleet through the late 1980s and into the 1990s, though would later be lifted.|$|E
25|$|The general <b>dilapidation</b> of the {{military}} was {{a symptom of the}} confused administration of the coastal provinces. The Ming provincial administration was split into three parallel hierarchies: one for civil, one for military, and one for surveillance. This deliberately fragmented structure was meant to provide checks against regionalism and the rise of powerful officials at the provincial level; however, it also made for an ineffective response during emergencies. Beginning {{in the middle of the}} 15th century, grand coordinators (xunfu) and supreme commanders (zongdu) were sent to the provinces undergoing military emergencies to override the existing provincial hierarchies. In the wokou-stricken provinces, however, a grand coordinator had not been appointed until 1547 due to the interference of the coastal gentry who were involved with the illegal foreign trade.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Alexander Stewart, Bishop of Moray and Commendator of Scone, Patrick was given crown {{nomination}} to succeed to both positions on 1 March 1538. He {{was provided by the}} Papacy on 14 June, on the condition he should resign the commend of St Andrews Cathedral Priory. Hepburn's episcopate is remembered as notorious for the <b>dilapidation</b> with which his dominions suffered. A huge percentage of his diocese was leased out, and in 1547 Scone Abbey itself went on a 19-year lease to one John Erskine of Dun. Meanwhile, Bishop Hepburn enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle. As early as 1529, when Hepburn was Commendator-Prior of St Andrews, Alexander Alesius, a canon of this Hepburn's own priory was preaching against Hepburn's ungodly lifestyle.|$|E
