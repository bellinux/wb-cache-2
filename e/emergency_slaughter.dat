30|$|Approximately, 27.3 % of {{the farmers}} who {{consigned}} these animals for slaughter were ignorant {{of the fact that}} the cows were actually pregnant but only 21.8 % {{of the farmers}} were aware of the physiological status of these cows. At least 6 % of the culled cows were “discarded” for fertility reasons when they were actually pregnant. Otherwise known as euthanasia, few authors have indicated that <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter</b> may be an exceptional situation that might necessitate slaughtering pregnant animals (Grandin 1994; Butterworth, 2000; Biggs and Blackwell 2005). When <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter</b> remains the only alternative, it is expected that the farmer contact the slaughter operators and the Official Veterinarian must rather be present during the ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection to declare the meat either fit or unfit for human consumption (Gregory and Grandin 2007).

Dead calves showed the highest percentage of P. multocida isolation followed by the <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughtered</b> calves, diseased calves then apparently healthy ones. These isolates were confirmed as P. multocida microscopically, biochemically by traditional tests and by API 20 E commercial kit then by PCR. The percentages of positive serum samples using somatic antigen and micro-agglutination test at 1 / 1280 diluted serum were 10 %, 54. 49 % and 0 % in apparently healthy, diseased and <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughtered</b> samples, respectively whereas, the percentages using capsular antigen and indirect haemagglutination test were 40 %, 60. 89 % and 60 % in apparently healthy, diseased and <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughtered</b> samples, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{evaluated}} Swiss slaughterhouse {{data for}} integration {{in a national}} syndromic surveillance system for the early detection of emerging diseases in production animals. We analysed meat inspection data for cattle, pigs and small ruminants slaughtered between 2007 and 2012 (including <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughters</b> of sick/injured animals); investigating patterns {{in the number of}} animals slaughtered and condemned; the reasons invoked for whole carcass condemnations; reporting biases and regional effects. RESULTS: Whole carcass condemnation rates were fairly uniform (1 - 2 ‰) over time and between the different types of production animals. Condemnation rates were much higher and less uniform following <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughters.</b> The number of condemnations peaked in December for both cattle and pigs, a time when individuals of lower quality are sent to slaughter when hay and food are limited and when certain diseases are more prevalent. Each type of production animal was associated with a different profile of condemnation reasons. The most commonly reported one was "severe lesions" for cattle, "abscesses" for pigs and "pronounced weight loss" for small ruminants. These reasons could constitute valuable syndromic indicators as they are unspecific clinical manifestations of a large range of animal diseases (as well as potential indicators of animal welfare). Differences were detected in the rate of carcass condemnation between cantons and between large and small slaughterhouses. A large percentage (> 60...|$|R

40|$|Over a 3 -y period, 906 000 cattle were {{monitored}} in 23 feedlots {{in southern}} Alberta for symptoms of acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP). Plasma, urine, and lung tissue were collected at slaughter from 299 animals clinically diagnosed with AIP and from 156 healthy penmates and analyzed for 3 -methylindole (3 MI) derivatives and reduced glutathione concentration. From each animal, the left lung was subsampled for histologic examination. Concentrations of glutathione in lung tissue were reduced (P < 0. 001) in animals showing clinical symptoms of AIP {{as compared with}} their asymptomatic penmates. Animals histologically confirmed as having AIP had higher levels of 3 MI protein adducts in blood and lung tissue (P < 0. 05) than did emergency-slaughtered animals without AIP. Within feedlots, where pens of heifers were fed either a standard dosage of melengestrol acetate (MGA) or none, the rate of death attributable to AIP was similar between treatment groups, but <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter</b> after clinical diagnosis of AIP was done 3. 2 times more often (P < 0. 001) in the MGA-fed heifers than in the group not fed MGA.

This epizootiological disease has been present in our country for quite some time now, and it has been increasingly frequently diagnosed in carnivora in the recent years. The objective of the investigations was to determine and establish the pathways for the transfer and the manner of spreading of the MA virus to carnivora. Epizootiological data on the appearance of MA, collected in the field, as well as an epizootiological report by the Serbian Ministry of Agriculture and of the Federal Ministry for Agriculture were used as material. Detailed epizootiological, clinical, pathomorphological, and laboratory analyses were performed in five critical spots for MA registered in the territory of Vojvodina province.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of adrenocortical and thyroid hormones in {{the pathogenesis of}} ketosis, {{as well as the}} ovarian consequences of this metabolic disorder, were studied in _ 2 parity cows (n= 199) in 3 large scale dairy herds. To compare the plasma/serum concentrations of certain hormones Šcortisol, thyroxin (T 4), triiodothyronine (T 3), insulin, insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) ¹ and metabolites Šglucose (G), acetoacetic acid (ACAC), βOH-butyrate (BHB), non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), trigliceride (TG), total cholesterol (TCh) ¹, and the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood samples were taken 1 to 3 days after calving and again 4 times 7 days apart. The ACTH-challenged cortisol responsiveness and the TRH-induced T 4 /T 3 increase were determined between days 1 to 3 and again between days 28 to 35. The resumption of ovarian cyclicity was followed up by individual progesterone (P 4) profiles based on milk samples taken 3 times a week for about 80 to 85 days. BHB level of 1 mmol/L was estimated as a border line between hyper- (> 1 mmol/L) and normoketonaemic (< 1 mmol/L) conditions. Five different ketone patterns were distinguished: (1) non-ketotic (n= 98; normoketonaemia in all samples), (2) early type ketosis (n= 45; hyperketonemia was detected only in the first week after calving), (3) late type (lactational) ketosis (n= 11; after a normoketonaemic period increasing hyperketonaemia was detected in the 5 th, or in the 4 th and 5 th weeks), (4) temporary ketosis (n= 11; hyperketonaemia was detected for 1 - 2 weeks in the 2 nd and 3 rd or in the 3 rd and 4 th weeks); (5) long-lasting ketosis (n= 34; hyperketonaemia has been detected since calving for 4 to 5 weeks or until dying / <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughtering).</b> Simultaneously with the hyperketonaemic stage increased NEFA, ACAC, depressed TCh, glucose and decreased insulin, IGF- 1, T 4 and T 3 concentrations were detected in almost all the cases. Obvious metabolic and endocrine alterations were found, however, only in long-lasting ketosis. The TRH-stimulated T 4 and T 3 responses remained almost unaffected proving intact thyroid function in early and late type as well as in temporary ketosis. Depressed thyroid response and delayed onset of cyclic ovarian function were detected only in cases of long-lasting ketosis. The cows characterized by lower than normal (<mean-SD of non-ketotic cows) ACTH-stimulated cortisol response on days 1 - 3 after calving showed poorer chance for spontaneous recovery.

Outbreaks in sparsely and densely populated areas were compared under four different control strategies and with two alternative trade assumptions. Results indicate that the control strategy required by current EU legislation is enough to eradicate an epidemic starting in an area with sparse pig population. By contrast, additional control measures are necessary if the outbreak begins in an area with high pig population density.

Its impact on developing countries, such as Nigeria, has not been fully established as information on livestock and surveillance has eluded those {{in charge of this}} task. The BSE risk to Nigeria's cattle population currently remains undetermined, which has resulted in international trade restrictions on commodities from the cattle population. This is mainly {{because of a lack of}} updated BSE risk assessments and disease surveillance data. To evaluate the feasibility of BSE surveillance in Nigeria, we carried out a pilot study targeting cattle that were presented for <b>emergency</b> or casualty <b>slaughter.</b> In total, 1551 cattle of local breeds, aged 24 months and above were clinically examined. Ataxia, recumbency and other neurological signs were topmost on our list of criteria. A total of 96 cattle, which correspond to 6. 2 %, presented clinical signs that supported a suspect of BSE. The caudal brainstem tissues of these animals were collected post-mortem and analysed for the disease-specific form of the prion protein using a rapid test approved by the International Animal Health Organization (OIE). None of the samples were positive for BSE. Although our findings do not exclude the presence of BSE in Nigeria, they do demonstrate that targeted sampling of clinically suspected cases of BSE is feasible in developing countries.

40|$|This {{master s}} thesis investigates {{emergency}} preparedness and response in Norwegian aquaculture using discrete-event simulation. The aquaculture industry is growing in terms of production, size, and technology, with the first exposed salmon farm expected in offshore waters {{by the end of}} 2017. One should therefore prepare and plan for new challenges. This thesis considers emergency preparedness and response for current and future aquaculture. The emergencies considered involve loss of biomass. The system limitations are set to when salmon is located in cages at sea. Relevant literature considering emergency preparedness and response in aquaculture is evaluated. Emergency preparedness and response is defined as planning for emergency, and the reactive actions performed after emergency. To gain insight, relevant literature from other segments is also assessed. A discrete-event simulation model is developed in SimEvents, to serve as a tool in the analysis. The model is developed as a generic basis to handle different emergency types. The modeled system is constructed to determine response time and time until the emergency is eliminated, based on various input data. The correlation between input data and calculations with the system is illustrated. The input data is mostly based on research, thereby causing variations in accuracy. The simulation model is used to evaluate emergency escape and <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter.</b> A case study with three cases is carried out to show the application and diversity of the simulation model. All three cases contain several scenarios with changing input data. The two first cases considers response time for wellboats and light diving vessels upon first arrival at the emergency site. With varying probability and distribution input, simulations are performed for one sheltered fish farm and one exposed fish farm. Further, the case study considers different fleet compositions to empty the two fish farms, with varying stock sizes. Each simulation provides different output due to stochastic variables, such as wave height and mobilization time. The results show {{that it is possible to}} obtain the same response times for the exposed fish farm by increasing the availability of response vessels. Further, the case study shows that a significantly larger capacity is needed for <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter</b> in exposed areas. Lastly, the case study shows that poor utilization decreases performance offshore when one large vessel is used, instead of several smaller vessels. The thesis concludes that increased focus on preparedness and response in the growing aquaculture industry is needed. Both to improve procedures and planning, to prevent loss of biomass in emergency. The case study concludes that it is highly possible to achieve a satisfactory level of preparedness and response for exposed fish farming, but standby vessels may be necessary. Furthermore, increased incentives are suggested to improve current planning and communication procedures, level of standardization, as well as ensuring capacities before emergency occurs...|$|E

This article describes the macroscopic and microscopic lesions in the distal metatarsal physis of bulls from an association of farmers in northeastern Italy. The metatarsal bones of 62 bulls (12 with severe lameness and 50 without lameness), average age 16. 44 ± 1. 72 months, were examined at the abattoir. The animals {{came from the same}} geographic area and shared intensive husbandry practices and a diet based on maize starch. A total of 124 metatarsal bones were sectioned, and the distal metaphyseal growth plate was grossly examined. Twenty-three cases, including 12 lame and 9 nonlame animals with visible lesions on macroscopic examination, and 2 controls (a total of 46 physes) were examined microscopically. Eight of 12 bulls with severe lameness had a chronic purulent physitis in at least 1 limb. Segmental thickening of the hypertrophic zone, consistent with osteochondrosis (OC), was present contralaterally (n = 3 cases) and bilaterally (n = 3 cases) in 6 of these animals. In the group of nonlame bulls, 19 of 50 (38 %) had similar segmental thickening of the physis consistent with OC. In the remaining bulls, minor findings included partial closure of the physis and a variable degree of metaphyseal hyperemia. A high incidence of OC was found in both lame and nonlame fattening bulls. It is likely that lame animals were clinically more severe due to secondary hematogenous implantation of bacteria, resulting in a purulent physitis and severe lameness that required <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter</b> in some cases...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} the gross anatomical, histological and surface morphological {{features of the}} oropharynx and proximal oesophagus of the emu {{in order to address}} the scarcity of information on this region in this commercially important bird. Heads obtained from birds at slaughter (and a younger and older bird from <b>emergency</b> farm <b>slaughter)</b> were used for this study and described using basic gross anatomical and histological techniques, supplemented by scanning electron microscopy. The findings of the study were compared with the relevant literature. The oral and pharyngeal cavities could not be morphologically separated and formed a single cavity. This cavity was dorso-ventrally flattened and clearly divided, both on the floor and the roof, into rostral pigmented and caudal non-pigmented parts. The non-pigmented floor housed the tongue and laryngeal mound which had a wide glottis and no papillae. The choana was triangular-shaped, with a small caudo-lateral fold on either side, and was situated in the nonpigmented part of the roof. Caudal to the choana were two rounded pharyngeal folds with a pitted ventral surface. A small bilateral projection from the caudo-lateral edge consisted mainly of diffuse lymphoid tissue. The pharyngeal folds contained numerous large simple branched tubular mucus-secreting glands as well as large accumulations of lymphoid tissue. The pigmented regions of the roof and floor were aglandular and lined by a keratinised stratified squamous epithelium which, particularly in the roof, contained numerous Herbst corpuscles in the underlying connective tissue. SEM revealed the surface to be composed of sheets of desquamating flattened polygonal cells. The non-pigmented regions were glandular and lined by a non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium. Surface cells displayed a pattern of microplicae or microvilli while individual surface cells were seen to desquamate. The connective tissue housed small, simple tubular and large, simple branched tubular mucus-secreting glands, Herbst corpuscles (only absent from the pharyngeal folds and proximal oesophagus), lymphoid tissue, blood vessels and nerves. The glands of the upper digestive tract were polystomatic and named as follows according to their location: Caudal intermandibular, lingual, crico-arytenoid, oral angular, caudal palatine, pharyngeal and oesophageal. The openings of the glands to the surface were seen on SEM as variably sized holes on the surface, some being obscured by mucus secretions from the underlying glands. Taste receptors were sparse and present only in the caudal non-pigmented oropharyngeal floor, tongue root and proximal oesophagus. Accumulations of lymphoid tissue were identified at the junction between the two regions of the roof, and in the non-pigmented roof, the non-pigmented floor, tongue ventrum, root and frenulum, proximal oesophagus and pharyngeal folds. The consistent dense accumulation of lymphoid tissue in the pharyngeal folds constituted pharyngeal tonsils (Lymphonoduli pharyngeales). The lymphoid tissue of the non-pigmented floor was visible macroscopically as round raised nodules. Specific, unnamed larger lymphoid tissue aggregations were located at the junction of the tongue ventrum and frenulum and in the small folds lateral to the choana. Surface morphology, as seen by SEM, revealed a pattern of microridges on the surface cells of the keratinised areas, whereas the surface cells of the non-keratinised areas displayed microplicae, microvilli and cilia. Microvilli and cilia were associated with the gland openings and ducts. The proximal oesophagus was a cylindrical tube with a longitudinally folded mucosa and displayed the typical tissue layers described in birds. The mucosa was formed by a nonkeratinised stratified epithelium which on SEM showed minimal surface desquamation. The lamina propria contained numerous simple tubular mucus-secreting glands which sometimes branched and occasional diffuse lymphoid tissue aggregations. The gland openings to the surface were seen on SEM as small and large dark holes. The muscularis mucosae was very prominent and was a longitudinal smooth muscle layer separating the mucosa from the submucosa. The tunica muscularis was composed of a thicker inner circular and a thinner outer longitudinal smooth muscle layer surrounded by the outer loose connective tissue forming the tunica adventitia. The emu tongue was divided into a body and a root. The body was triangular, dorso-ventrally flattened, pigmented and displayed caudally directed lingual papillae on both the lateral and caudal margins. The root, a more conspicuous structure in comparison to other ratites, was triangular, with a raised bulbous component folding over the rostral part of the laryngeal fissure. The lingual skeleton was formed by the triangular-shaped paraglossum (hyaline cartilage), forming the core of the tongue body, and the rostral projection of the basihyale, ventral to the paraglossum. Following the general trend in ratites, the emu tongue was greatly reduced in comparison to the bill length and specifically adapted for swallowing during the cranioinertial method of feeding employed by palaeognaths. The tongue was invested by a non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium. The glands in the connective tissue formed the bulk of the parenchyma and were composed of both small simple tubular and large simple branched tubular mucus-secreting glands similar to those seen in the oropharynx. The lingual glands were grouped as follows: dorsal and rostro-ventral (large glands), caudo-ventral and radical (large and small glands) and frenular (small glands). The large glands were visible macroscopically as doughnut-shaped structures. Melanocytes were absent from the tongue ventrum and occasionally from the tongue root. Lymphoid tissue was absent from the tongue dorsum. Herbst corpuscles were present in the tongue body and root and generally closely associated with the large mucus-secreting glands. The surface morphology varied in the different regions of the tongue. The dorsal and rostro-ventral tongue body showed individual desquamating cells and large gland openings only, the caudo-lateral ventrum showed less desquamation and both large and small openings. The mid-ventral aspect had an undulating uneven appearance with round raised cells on the surface which were densely packed with microvilli. Very large, large and small openings were present in this region and ciliated cells occurred in the vicinity of gland openings. This study presented various unique findings regarding the morphology of the emu oropharynx compared to other ratites. Although the sense of taste has been confirmed in many avian species, this study presented the first evidence of taste in the emu and ratites in general and suggests the possibility of taste being previously overlooked in the other birds studied (ostrich and greater rhea). The tongue root of the emu was clearly defined and is unique in structure and possible function amongst the ratites and other birds. Previously unmentioned functions of the emu tongue revealed by this study include: touch (Herbst corpuscles), taste (taste bud), lubrication and mechanical protection (mucus-secreting glands), immunological (lymphoid tissue) and digestive (swallowing). It was also noted that the various structures and organs of the oropharynx revealed important and often interesting differences between the emu and the other ratites documented. The prominent serrations of the rostral mandibular tomia of the emu also appear to be unique amongst ratites. The presence and wide distribution of Herbst corpuscles within the emu oropharynx and tongue show these areas to be highly sensitive to touch. The caudo-lateral projections of the pharyngeal folds effectively formed pharyngeal tonsils, a feature not apparent in other ratites. Despite the differences noted between the emu and other ratites it was possible to discern a common pattern of structures and features, with their modifications, both within and forming the oropharynx in this group of birds.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{majority}} of atypical {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) cases so far identified worldwide have been detected by active surveillance. Consequently the volume and quality of material available for detailed characterisation is very limiting. Here we report on a small transmission study of both atypical forms, H- and L-type BSE, in cattle to provide tissue for test evaluation and research, and to generate clinical, molecular and pathological data in a standardised way to enable more robust comparison of the two variants with particular reference to those aspects most relevant to case ascertainment and confirmatory diagnosis within existing regulated surveillance programmes. Results Two groups of four cattle, intracerebrally inoculated with L-type or H-type BSE, all presented with a nervous disease form with some similarities to classical BSE, which progressed to a more dull form in one animal from each group. Difficulty rising was a consistent feature of both disease forms and not seen in two BSE-free, non-inoculated cattle that served as controls. The pathology and molecular characteristics were distinct from classical BSE, and broadly consistent with published data, but with some variation in the pathological characteristics. Both atypical BSE types were readily detectable as BSE by current confirmatory methods using the medulla brain region at the obex, but making a clear diagnostic distinction between the forms was not consistently straightforward in this brain region. Cerebellum proved a more reliable sample for discrimination when using immunohistochemistry. Conclusions The prominent feature of difficulty rising in atypical BSE cases may explain the detection of naturally occurring cases in <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter</b> cattle and fallen stock. Current confirmatory diagnostic methods are effective {{for the detection of}} such atypical cases, but consistently and correctly identifying the variant forms may require modifications to the sampling regimes and methods that are currently in use. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to model {{logistics}} for the downstream aquaculture supply chain interaction for increased production of salmon in the future. We employed a quantitative approach using discrete-event simulation, where we developed a model, replicating the real-world supply chain in MATLAB s add-on software Simulink. The output was basis for evaluations regarding system dynamics and flexibility, based on composition and throughput. Project limitations excluded human influence, {{as well as all}} commercial aspects, from the analyses. The motivation for the thesis was the Norwegian governments goal to increase aquaculture production by five-fold within 2050. Following this increase comes the development of farm sizes and locations, as well as an adapted supply chain. Such an expansion may include the introduction of additional transportation modes, like processing vessels and seaborne transportation of products to market. As a multimodal system, the challenge lies in coordinating the various modes, pursuing seamless integration between them. This is effectively assessed using discrete-event simulation, modelling the continuous movement of entities. The model was run several times with different system compositions and scenarios. These served to verify the model, establish a benchmarking fleet and test system robustness against external influence. Two crash scenarios, simulating <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter</b> and waiting cage ban, were imposed. The results showed that delivery to market using the current day trucking system is efficient and reliable. However, a simulated expansion required a large fleet, which the introduction of cargo vessels could relieve. Processing vessels withheld transit-time to a minimum regardless of imposed scenarios, and were a contribution to continuity in operation. In conclusion, we showed that any system upgrade must be supported by equivalent infrastructure to increase system performance. Collaboration and redundancy through parallel nodes were key factors in ensuring system up-time. Further work should include evaluations on commercial competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|Of the 31 {{cases of}} BSE {{diagnosed}} in Japan up to December 31, 2006, 24 {{were born in}} the prefecture of Hokkaido. Details for these cases were obtained from The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) (2006). They included the town and date of birth, the date of detection, and the physical sta-tus of the animal (downer, healthy at slaughter, or fallen) when it was detected. Downer stock were defined as cattle over 30 months of age that were unable to walk, recumbent, unable to rise or to walk without assistance, or cattle over 30 months of age sent for <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter</b> or condemned at antemortem inspection. Fallen stock were defined as cat-tle over 30 months of age found dead or culled on the farm, during transport or at an abattoir (OIE 2001). Japan is divided into 47 prefectures of which Hokkaido is the largest. Each prefecture is divided into primary administrative areas, called cities (Fig 1) which are further divided into local administrative areas, called settlements. In Hokkaido there are 219 mainland cities which range from 9 to 1408 km 2 in area. For the spatial analyses the unit of interest was the city, termed the ‘city unit ’ {{for the purpose of this}} paper. City units where at least one case of BSE had been diagnosed were defined as BSE-positive, and the others as BSE-negative. The objective was to identify factors that were asso-ciated with the risk of a city unit being BSE positive. Factors thought to be associated with this risk included the numbers of dairy and beef cattle and pigs kept in each city unit, and the amount of concentrate feed supplied to it by the major feed compounders operating throughout the prefecture. The possible influence of the size of the farm animal populations on the BSE risk was based on the results of epidemiologi-cal studies from other BSE-affected countries, notably Grea...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop an {{assessment}} scheme for the evaluation at farm level of beef cattle welfare in the intensive rearing system {{that is capable of}} both identifying weak points in animal welfare and grading farms to such extent. The basic principle of the method was the avoidance of animal handling and the prolonged observation of cattle using animal-based and resource provision measures grouped in four classes of parameters: 1) Housing systems and facilities; 2) Health and cleanliness; 3) Animal behaviour and reactivity; 4) Quality of management and stockmanship. Each parameter was graded giving the highest scores to the best option for animal welfare, and the threshold value for distinguishing good from poor welfare conditions was set primarily on the results of scientific reports and investigations. An overall Welfare Index was calculated summing the scores of the 4 classes of parameters to formulate a general judgement of the farm and to allow comparison among them. The protocol was applied to 102 Italian intensive beef cattle farms rearing more than 300 young bulls/year. Regarding housing and facilities, the study showed that space allowance and space at the manger were the most frequent critical points. Within the "poor welfare" farms, more than 80 % provided less than 3. 5 m(2) /head to bulls weighing more than 500 kg, and none adopted a feeding frontage of at least 60 cm/head. Negatively judged farms compared to those ranked in the good welfare area for health and cleanliness showed a higher incidence of <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter</b> (score 1. 7 : > 1 % vs score 3 : 0. 5 - 1 %, P< 0. 05) and lameness (score 1. 9 : 1. 5 - 3 % vs score 3. 3 : < 1. 5 %, P< 0. 05). Animal behaviour and reactivity parameters showed that in the "poor welfare" farms, bulls had a quicker flight reaction to the presence of both farmer and observer (P< 0. 01) likely due to a negative human-animal interaction. The quality of stockmanship was the category in which the highest number of farms failed to reach the acceptable threshold. Animal welfare was mainly impaired by the practice of tail docking and reduced feed availability. Although none of the farms included in the survey reached the maximum overall score, less then 30 % were graded in the poor welfare area, penalized mainly by low management quality. The protocol was shown to be effective in detecting specific critical points for animal welfare, even if further development should be addressed to testing repeatability at different fattening stages...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibilities}} and {{economic benefits of}} controlling mycoplasmal pneumonia of pigs caused by Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae by immunisation with Respisure and by Tiamutin treatment were studied. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a herd comprising 1000 sows which was free of PRRS, Aujeszky's disease, swine dysentery and leptospirosis, and the prevalence of mycoplasmal pneumonia was low because the farm had recently been restocked. Groups C 1 and C 2 served as untreated controls, while Groups R 1 and R 2 received a prestarter diet containing 100 ppm Tiamutin from the time of weaning. Piglets of Group R 1 were vaccinated with Respisure vaccine once on day 69, while those of Group R 2 twice, on days 65 and 80. Piglets of Groups ST 1 and ST 2 were fed 100 ppm Tiamutin in the diet for 7 days at the time of weaning and then at 4 months of age, while pigs of Group ST 2 received such treatment also in the 6 th month of life. The efficacy of treatment was analysed {{on the basis of the}} number of animals that died, were emergency slaughtered or were retarded in growth in the different groups, the body weight of animals at weaning, at 94 and 148 days of age and at the time of slaughter, their daily body weight gain, the lung lesions found in animals slaughtered from the different groups, the costs of medication and vaccination, and the cost-benefit calculations of the results. The mortality and <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter</b> rate was 2. 88 % and 4. 62 % in Groups ST 2 and ST 1, respectively, 4. 23 % and 4. 62 % in Groups R 2 and R 1, respectively, and 8. 39 % and 9. 44 % in the control groups (C 2 and C 1, respectively). The rate of growth retardation was 0. 48 % and 2. 12 % in Groups R 1 and R 2, respectively, 1. 59 % and 3. 46 % in Groups ST 1 and ST 2, respectively, as compared to 8. 03 % and 6. 55 % in the control groups (C 1 and C 2, respectively). The severity score of lung lesions was 1. 82 and 1. 46 in Groups R 1 and R 2, 2. 18 and 2. 93 in Groups ST 1 and ST 2, and 3. 83 and 4. 02 in the control groups C 1 and C 2, respectively. The mean finishing weight of pigs was 102. 4 - 107. 8 kg and 95. 2 - 106. 6 kg in the treated groups and 94. 5 - 98. 6 kg in the control groups. The classification of pigs according to the EUROP categories showed a shift to the E and U categories in the treated groups. The average feed cost per one kg of liveweight was 77. 89 - 82. 64 Forints in the treated groups and 85. 66 Forints in the control groups...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the association between beef cattle, pre-slaughter handling, animal welfare and carcass quality besides testing the applicability of an index that assess the handling quality in slaughterhouses. The study was carried out in three plants licensed to export meat located in the southeast of Brazil, assessing 42, 360 cattle. One indicator of animal welfare (falls) and two indicators of handling quality (animals hit by gates and electric prod use) were recorded. These indicators were used to calculate the Handling Quality Scores (HQS). The occurence of bruises and meat pH were also recorded as indicators of carcass and meat quality. The occurence of carcasses with multiple bruises (at least three), meat with high pH (≥ 5, 9), and the occurrence of <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter</b> and acts of abuse (trampled animals and non-ambulatory animals being drove inappropriately) were also recorded. For control purposes the following handling information were also recorded: periods of day, cattle category and different cattle categories being handled together. Data was analyzed by Generalized Linear Models and Pearson Correlation by using the GLM and CORR procedures of SAS program. It was also performed Chi-squared test and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). There was a significant effect (P< 0. 01) of animal welfare indicators and handling indicators on the HQS in the three plants. The highest and lowest HQS values were observed in plants 3 and 1, respectively. HQS values increased in all plants when acts of abuse occurred during handling (P< 0. 01). It was also observed an effect (P< 0. 01) of the periods of day with increasing values of HQS and frequency of falls, electric prod use and animals hit by gates throughout the working day in all plants. Cattle categories and different cattle categories being handled influenced (P < 0. 01) HQS. The correlation analysis showed a strong [...] . Os objetivos com esta pesquisa foram avaliar a associação entre manejo pré-abate, bem-estar animal e qualidade da carcaça de bovinos de corte e a utilidade de um índice de qualidade de manejo nos frigoríficos como indicador da qualidade do manejo. Foram avaliados 42. 360 animais em três plantas frigoríficas sob o controle do Serviço de Inspeção Federal (SIF). Foram registrados indicadores de bem-estar animal (frequências de quedas sofridas pelos bovinos), da qualidade de manejo (frequências de porteiradas sofridas pelos animais e utilização do bastão elétrico pelos manejadores), durante o manejo de condução dos bovinos nos frigoríficos, que foram usados para compor o Índice de Qualidade de Manejo (IQM). Foram registrados os indicadores de qualidade de carcaça (pH e hematomas observados nas carcaças). Registrou-se também o número de carcaças com valor de pH acima de 5, 9 e com presença de múltiplos hematomas (pelo menos três); além das ocorrências de abates de emergência realizados e atos de abuso (animais pisoteados e fraturados sendo manejados). Para efeito de controle foram registradas também as seguintes informações do manejo: horário do dia, categorias de animais manejados e se houve mistura de categorias nos lotes de manejo.

40|$|The new Animal Evaluation Model {{predicts that}} heavier live weight (LW) of the {{lactating}} cow reduces {{the profitability of}} the pasture-based dairying farm in New Zealand, because its effects on increased maintenance requirements are not fully compensated by the extra income generated from selling heavier culled cattle and surplus progeny. The work outlined in this thesis was intended to validate the expected effects of selection for differences in LW on actual LW from birth to maturity and on herbage intake and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) of growing cattle and lactating cows. It also investigated the existence of any associated effects on calving difficulty, calf mortality, onset of puberty and reproductive performance of the two lines of Holstein-Friesian (HF) cattle bred for heavy or light mature LW. These two lines have been developed at the Dairy Cattle Research Unit, Massey University, New Zealand, since 1989. The high genetic merit HF cows from the base herd have been mated to high genetic merit HF sires with either high or low breeding value (BV) for LW but with similar breeding worth (BW) in order to generate the heavy (H) and the light (L) mature LW selection lines. During the period 1994 to 1997, a series of experiments with growing heifers and lactating cows from the H and L lines, and analysis of data collected from the cows were undertaken to compare the two genetic lines. The BV's for live weight of the sires were 86 kg for the H and 31 kg for the L cows and the actual H animals were heavier at birth (41 vs. 35 kg) and at maturity (510 vs. 460 kg). In addition the BV's for milk (1037 vs. 737 l), milkfat (33. 0 vs. 27. 5 kg) and milk protein (31 kg vs. 22 kg) of H sires were also higher and the H cows produced significantly more milk (4708 vs. 4323 l/lactation), more milkfat (207 vs. 198 kg/lactation) and more milk protein (157 vs. 150 kg/lactation) than the L cows. However, the L sires had slightly higher breeding worth ($ 46 vs. $ 37) than the H sires and theoretically calculated and experimentally measured feed intakes and the resultant feed conversion efficiencies, confirmed that the L cows had slightly higher values for FCE than the H cows in three short-term grazing experiments and when FCE was calculated over multiple lactations. Therefore the basic assumptions in the Animal Evaluation Model seem to be correct. Sires of H cows had {{a higher proportion of}} USA Holstein genes in their pedigrees than the L sires. Consequently cows from the H line had a higher (≈ 27 %) proportion of USA Holstein genes compared to cows from the L line (≈ 7 %), whose sires were mainly of New Zealand ancestry. New Zealand bulls are progeny tested under grazing conditions and a very tight seasonal system of reproduction, whereas North American bulls are progeny tested under dairying systems of all year round milk production and feedlot feeding. There were significant differences in the pattern of grazing behaviour of H and L cows. The L cows displayed a more 'aggressive' pattern of grazing behaviour than H cows given by significantly longer grazing times (520 vs. 499 min/d), faster rates of biting (58 vs. 52 bites/min), higher number of total bites per day (31053 vs. 25046 bites/d), lower rumination times (471 vs. 572 min/d), and the selection of herbage of higher digestibility (72. 0 % vs. 69. 3 %). These results may reflect not only a difference in mature LW between the H and L cows, but may also reflect a strain of Holstein (i. e. NZ vs. USA Holstein) difference due to the sires' ancestry referred to above. There were no differences between H and L cows in the incidence of calving difficulty. However, offspring of bulls with high BV for rump width (i. e. wider pelvises) were more likely to face a difficult calving, and so were daughters of bulls with low BV for rump angle (i. e. less sloping pelvises). There were no differences between H and L cows for calf mortality. However, induced calves were more likely to die or undertake an <b>emergency</b> <b>slaughter,</b> and the H cows had significantly higher induction rates than the L cows (10. 5 vs. 4. 2 %). The H heifers grew faster, ate more feed (4. 3 vs. 3. 8 kg/hd/d) and were heavier (241 vs. 221 kg) and older (325 vs. 300 d) at puberty than L heifers, and there were no differences between H and L heifers in pregnancy rate, age at first calving and first lactation yield of milk and milk components. There were only small differences in the reproductive performance of H and L cows after adjusting by differences in induction, calving date and percentage of USA Holstein genes in the cows. The L cows had slightly shorter intervals from first service to conception (13 vs. 17 d) and from the start of mating to conception (24 vs. 29 d), and slightly higher first service conception rate (65 vs. 54 %), which translated in a more concentrated calving pattern and lower induction rate (4. 2 vs. 10. 5 %) for the L cows. The results of this thesis indicate that selecting for heavier mature live weight produced the expected results of heavier animals with higher yields of milk and milk components, higher feed requirements and higher herbage intakes and slightly lower feed conversion efficiency than lighter mature live weight cows. However, there were also differences in grazing behaviour in which the L cows displayed a more competitive pattern of grazing behaviour than the H cows. The results of this thesis suggest that for the New Zealand seasonal system of milk production based almost completely on grazed pasture, lighter mature LW HF cows may have an advantage over heavier mature LW cows. Under the conditions of this experiments L cows were slightly more efficient, younger at puberty, had a more concentrated calving pattern, and were less prone to be induced to calve than heavier mature live weight HF cows...|$|E
