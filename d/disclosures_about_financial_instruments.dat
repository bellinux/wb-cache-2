In this thesis IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures, that treats information about financial instruments, is investigated. IFRS 7 aims to establish a good international standard for <b>disclosures</b> <b>about</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to study {{differences in the interpretation}} of IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures between Swedish life insurance companies, problems – if any – that associate with the recommendation, the recommendation’s effect on accounting and the attitudes towards IFRS amongst the Swedish life insurance companies. The thesis is based on a qualitative method and the conclusion of the thesis is that the life insurance companies find it tricky to decide how the accounting shall be designed in compliance with IFRS 7. Almost all information needed already exists. The problem rather relates to the design of the accounting. Further more, the companies read the recommendation with different eyes and define different users of annual reports, that creates different interpretations. Balance- and income statements will be less affected of IFRS 7, while notes and disclosures will grow. Finally, the attitudes towards IFRS vary alot between life insurance companies...|$|E

40|$|Problems in Finance, {{particularly}} those involving risk assessment and management, {{have been slow}} to yield to expert systems technology for two reasons. First, expert reasoning in such problems is often based on âfirst principles" instead of âsituation-action" rules that characterize most expert systems. Secondly, the knowledge involved, such as that <b>about</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments,</b> is constantly changing. This would make it extremely difficult to keep a rule-base accurate. We have developed a representation in the domain of financial hedging that has the following characteristics. First, it allows for reasoning qualitatively based on first principles using the fundamental quantitative valuation models that characterize each instrument. Secondly, it uses object oriented concepts and inheritance to minimize the effort needed to set up the knowledge base and keep it current. Thirdly, it includes a calculus for derivation of qualitative knowledge of "one-dimensional-order", which allows it to solve problems where optimality constraints are qualitative. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the role played}} in the credit crisis of the processes by which different groups of market participants produce knowledge <b>about</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> Employing documentary sources {{and a set of}} 76 predominantly oralhistory interviews, the article presents a historical sociology of the clusters of evaluation practices surrounding ABSs (asset-backed securities) and CDOs (collateralized debt obligations). Despite the close structural similarity between ABSs and CDOs, these practices came to differ substantially, and became the province (e. g. in the rating agencies) of organizationally separate groups. In consequence, when ABS CDOs (CDOs in which the underlying assets are ABSs) emerged, they were evaluated in two separate stages. This created a fatally attractive arbitrage opportunity, large-scale exploitation of which sidelined a previously important set of gate keepers (risk-sensitive investors in the lower tranches of ABSs) and eventually magnified and concentrated the banking system’s calamitous mortgage-related losses. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} question {{of this study}} is whether or not companies can improve the relationship with their investors by voluntarily extending the scope of their risk disclosure. The novel aspect of this research is that it analyses the relationship between companies and investors in a unique crisis situation. This thesis explains and tests the relationship between listed European insurance groups that disclose risk information in their annual financial statements and the reaction of the capital market during the recent sub-prime loan crisis. It covers the disclosure periods 2007 and 2008 of thirteen insurance groups that file their financial reports according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Based on literature it is assumed that during a crisis situation investors estimate the value of the company they have invested in and decide whether or not they sell their shares or hold on to them. Research studies indicate that investors demand company-specific information about the investment risk, measurement of <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> and forecasts that are up to date and specific to the crisis situation. To analyses the relationship between listed companies and investors the thesis measures their disclosure performance and the capital market response towards it. A self administered risk disclosure performance index is used that is based on accounting disclosure requirements and specified to the crisis. It measures the discretionary <b>disclosure</b> of companies <b>about</b> mortgage portfolio-based <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> These <b>instruments</b> caused <b>financial</b> distress of banks that spread to a global economic crisis. The thesis measures the reaction of the capital market towards the disclosed risk information by applying the event study methodology {{at the peak of the}} crisis situation. The statistical analysis of the relationship indicated that voluntary risk disclosure is not well recognized by investors as reported in the literature. It found out that investors had recognized those listed European insurance groups that have been most severely affected by the financial crisis. Investors came to that conclusion even before the researched companies disclosed risk information <b>about</b> their <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> in annual group financial statements. The statistical research has been extended using structured-interviews with experts that represent significant users of financial information. This qualitative approach seeks to verify and explain the statistical results. The results of the interviews with professional users of financial information such as financial analysts, managers of rating agencies and bankers have shown that they do not depend on risk information from annual financial statements of respective companies. They seek to get risk information in the event of a crisis by directly addressing the management of insurance groups. This enables them to gain comments on the impact of upcoming problems in the financial market from these managers. These results imply that theories about the relationship between disclosing companies and the capital market are different in crisis situations when psychological factors influence the behaviour of both companies and the capital market. These factors are difficult to separate and need further research. Practical implications of this research study arise for regulators and standard setters. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Born was {{appointed}} to the CFTC on April 15, 1994 by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System, the Options Clearing Corporation, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned <b>about</b> swaps, <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any. CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC’s concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a [...] "legal uncertainty" [...] regarding such <b>financial</b> <b>instruments,</b> hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would [...] "stifle financial innovation" [...] and encourage financial capital to transfer its transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies, [...] insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies.|$|R
