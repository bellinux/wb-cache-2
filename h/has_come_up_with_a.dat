5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) {{is having a}} hard time dealing with her {{break-up}} with Paul L'Astname (Will Forte). Liz, seeing Jenna miserable, visits Paul and tells her that Jenna misses him. Paul visits Jenna, though not to resume their relationship, instead to tell her that he <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brilliant costume for the New Queer's Eve party in which guests dress up as a pop culture phenomenon from the previous year. Unbeknownst to Paul, Jenna also has the same costume idea as his and as a result the two get back together. At the party, Paul dresses like actress Natalie Portman's character in the 2010 movie Black Swan, and Jenna dresses up as former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Lynn Swann.|$|E

25|$|One {{case study}} with coral reef {{restoration}} {{was conducted on}} the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The University of Hawaii <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program to help relocate and restore coral reefs in Hawaii. A boat channel on the island of Oahu to the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology was overcrowded with coral reefs. Also, many areas of coral reef patches in the channel had been damaged from past dredging in the channel. Dredging covers the existing corals with sand, and their larvae cannot build and thrive on sand; they can only build on to existing reefs. Because of this, the University of Hawaii decided to relocate some of the coral reef to a different transplant site. They transplanted them {{with the help of the}} United States Army divers, to a relocation site relatively close to the channel. They observed very little, if any, damage occurred to any of the colonies while they were being transported, and no mortality of coral reefs has been observed on the new transplant site, but they will be continuing to monitor the new transplant site to see how potential environmental impacts (i.e. ocean acidification) will harm the overall reef mortality rate. While trying to attach the coral to the new transplant site, they found the coral placed on hard rock is growing considerably well, and coral was even growing on the wires that attached the transplant corals to the transplant site. This gives new hope to future research on coral reef transplant sites. As a result of this coral restoration project, no environmental effects were seen from the transplantation process, no recreational activities were decreased, and no scenic areas were affected by the project. This is a great example that coral transplantation and restoration can work and thrive under the right conditions, which means there may be hope for other damaged coral reefs.|$|E

McNutt argued that, while Ferrell [...] "is not really the problem with the role" [...] of Deangelo Vickers, the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like [...] "hanging out to commemorate the former’s departure from a television show" [...] rather than the two playing believable characters. He also felt that Deangelo [...] "feels disruptive to the show’s narrative" [...] because his character {{gets in the way of}} the plot. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent [...] "so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do". He further noted that [...] "nobody <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> good reason for him being here other than that he's Will Ferrell." ...|$|E

Aditya Music marketed the film's soundtrack. Compared to other songs, Sastry took more time to complete the lyrics of the song [...] "Jaago". Siva explained the situation to Sastry during the film's shoot at Karaikudi and at Ramoji Film City, and Sastry took input from him. Prasad composed it in the indie rock genre. Haasan revealed that [...] "Charuseela" [...] was based on her character in the film and that the tune had been inspired by one of Michael Jackson compositions. Regarding that song, Prasad said, [...] "It's a peppy dance number that has Mahesh sporting an uber stylish look. Lyricist Ramajogayya Sastry <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fusion of chaste Telugu words and English slang and I incorporated the Michael Jackson rhythm in the song".|$|E
500|$|Burton {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he enjoyed the plot twist, and compared it to Jason Morgan being Monica Quartermaine's (Leslie Charleson) son on General Hospital. He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E

According to Dr. Theodore Taylor, after reviewing leaked photographs of disassembled weapons components taken before 1986, Israel possessed boosted weapons and would require supercomputers of that era to advance further toward full two-stage weapons in the megaton range without nuclear test detonations. The other nuclear-armed nations, India and Pakistan, probably have single-stage weapons, possibly boosted.|$|E

In the instances where an 'S' has been used, it is only to clarify the pronunciation. For example, I felt that 'Vicl,' although the true spelling, was a little boggling; hence, 'Visl'. 'F' has a soft 'fth' sound. Vowels tend to conform to Latinate 'ah-eh-ih-oh-ooh.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{production}} {{opened to}} wide critical acclaim, {{much of the}} press commenting {{on the effectiveness of}} the open air setting.

[...] The New York Times reviewer commented: [...] "The natural environment makes for something genuinely haunting and mysterious as night falls on the audience..." [...] Stephen Sondheim attended twice, reportedly extremely pleased with the production. The production also won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival and Michael Xavier, who played Cinderella's Prince and the Wolf, was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Supporting Role in a Musical.|$|E
2500|$|HKRI <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new {{proposal}} {{which calls}} for a 27.5% increase (for 50 trip holders) and a 33.3% increase (for single trips). Furthermore, frequencies are to be reduced from 113 sailings a day to 80. After midnight services {{will be replaced by}} a coach service. Residents are still concerned that this is still a substantial increase given the current economic situation and fuel prices have fallen below US$50.00. Sources have also revealed that HKRI pays HK$9.00 per litre where other ferry operators pay around HK$5.50 per litre. [...] The eventual deal agreed with the Transport Department (TD) was for single fares of HK$31 per journey with an overnight surcharge of HK$13 per journey between 00:00 and 06:00. This represented a general price increase of 10% - far above inflation in the current economic climate; but still more reasonable than the original proposals by the operator.|$|E
2500|$|The first U.S. {{review of}} the film was {{published}} on May 23 in industry trade magazine Variety. Todd McCarthy called Pulp Fiction a [...] "spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture... a startling, massive success." [...] From Cannes forward, Tarantino {{was on the road}} continuously, promoting the film. Over the next few months it played in smaller festivals around Europe, building buzz: Nottingham, Munich, Taormina, Locarno, Norway, and San Sebastián. Tarantino later said, [...] "One thing that's cool is that by breaking up the linear structure, when I watch the film with an audience, it does break [...] alpha state. It's like, all of a sudden, 'I gotta watch this... I gotta pay attention.' You can almost feel everybody moving in their seats. It's actually fun to watch an audience in some ways chase after a movie." [...] In late September, it opened the New York Film Festival. The New York Times published its review the day of the opening. Janet Maslin called the film a [...] "triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino's ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color... <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> work of such depth, wit and blazing originality that it places him in the front ranks of American film makers." ...|$|E

2500|$|If {{there is}} any word which might serve {{as a key to}} the {{philosophical}} and practical aims of Þeyr it is [...] "symmetry". They combine their belief in an inherent structure behind the manifestation of matter with intense experimental fervour that aims at unravelling at least a few practical applications of this [...] "divine proportion" [...] that determines the extent and amplitude of our aesthetic experience [...] The second study deals with the harmonic build up of music, and this has led to a study of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915) whose work aimed at breaking up all classical rules of harmonic composition and ultimately at the founding of a new music that would escape the straitjacket of the 12-tone scale [...] He further sought to unite sensations such as smell, sight and hearing into one, and some of his later works were interpreted in colour as well as sound. This fascinating study is being pursued by Þeyr whose concerts have been known to reek of exotic incense and to be lighted by a certain blending of root colours. Ultimately these things will be married under the one heading which forms their third study, FOURIER. The Fourier as they jokingly refer to it is basically a machine that is being worked upon by one of the bands members who has a background in theoretical mathematics, physics and electrical engineering. However it has through time of construction (several proto-types of its main parts have already been constructed and some already discarded in favour of new ideas currently being worked on) come to represent an entirely new approach to the basic laws which underlie natural structures as ranging from the formation of crystals to harmonic scales that can be worked out of logarythmic spirals, these building in the scales 12. 17, 31, 55...n. making use of the basic laws and axioms supplied by the French mathematician and physicist J. B. Fourier. He <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> machine that makes use of the newest advances in computer technology but is controlled through a simple set of symbols which are ultimately part of the Fourier philosophy (as they jokingly refer to it) that is slowly but steadily being constructed by the band. The future user of the Fourier will need and extensive background in the writings of such diverse personalities as R. Buckminster Fuller, Giordano Bruno, the alchemical writings of Newton, not to mention Nyquist, Walsh and others which have worked upon the mathematics of music.
