The chemical constitution as regards distillation range, acid content, {{and types of}} washes are briefly discussed.

A {{major problem}} in the current biomass {{gasification}} systems is the formation <b>of</b> <b>tar.</b> The condensed tar at low temperatures may cause blockage and pollution of downstream equipments, as well as environmental pollution. Therefore, the removal and conversion <b>of</b> <b>tar</b> are the key issues for biomass gasification. At present, the common methods <b>of</b> <b>tar</b> removal are mainly mechanism methods, thermal cracking and catalytic cracking. In this paper, the catalytic cracking method and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed...|$|R

The pyrolysate <b>of</b> <b>tars</b> obtained from the wood and bamboo crude vinegars were almost identical and were primarily composed of phenolic compounds and aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, during {{the aging of}} model wood vinegar that was prepared for comparison with the wood and bamboo vinegars, a marked decrease was observed in the levels of phenolic compounds (phenol; o-, p-, and m-cresol; and syringol). Furthermore, the Py-GC-MS results <b>of</b> the <b>tars</b> produced during {{the aging of the}} model wood vinegar revealed that phenolic compounds were primarily responsible for the formation <b>of</b> <b>tar</b> during the aging of wood and bamboo crude vinegars.

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} the ability <b>of</b> <b>tar</b> isolated from {{environmental tobacco smoke}} (ETS) to nick DNA in mammalian cells. Solutions <b>of</b> ETS <b>tar</b> behave similarly to aqueous solutions <b>of</b> cigarette <b>tar</b> from mainstream smoke.

ETS tar solutions, like mainstream tar solutions, produce hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide appears to be an essential component of the mechanism by which both ETS tar and mainstream tar cause DNA damage in rat thymocytes, as catalase substantially protects against DNA damage. Glutathione also protects against DNA nicking by both ETS and mainstream tar solutions by scavenging radicals and/or oxidants.
