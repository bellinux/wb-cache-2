5|$|By the {{inequality}} of arithmetic and geometric means, function S'n(θ) is bounded {{from above}} by −ln(n+1), {{and thus the}} maximum has to <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> least in the supremum sense.|$|E
5|$|COBOL's syntax {{is usually}} {{described}} {{with a unique}} metalanguage using braces, brackets, bars and underlining. The metalanguage was developed for the original COBOL specifications. Although Backus–Naur form did <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> the time, the committee had not heard of it.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{observations}} proved {{that it is}} actually possible for life to <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> high temperatures and that some bacteria even prefer temperatures higher than the boiling point of water. Dozens of such bacteria are known.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the area}} is known as el-Ghazali Square and {{is used as a}} car park and {{collection}} point for refuse before it is dumped outside the city. Some small shops also <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> the site.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} their weapons, {{the regiment}} {{was ordered to}} Guyandotte in (West) Virginia's Cabell County. This small Ohio River community is located close to Virginia's border with Ohio and Kentucky, and {{is now part of}} Huntington, West Virginia (which did not <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> the time). At Guyandotte, the regiment received its horses and conducted more drills.|$|E
5000|$|The {{statement}} Y may {{be interpreted}} as [...] "There <b>exists</b> <b>at</b> least one x that is both a man and white and there <b>exists</b> <b>at</b> least one x that is both a man and non-white" ...|$|R
50|$|Dimension assumption. Given {{a line in}} a plane, there <b>exists</b> <b>at</b> {{least one}} point in the plane that is not on the line. Given a plane in space, there <b>exists</b> <b>at</b> least one point in space that is not in the plane.|$|R

5|$|Approximately 200 {{million light-years}} from Earth with a {{redshift}} of 0.016 is Abell 3627; {{also called the}} Norma Cluster, {{it is one of}} the most massive galaxy clusters known to <b>exist,</b> <b>at</b> ten times the average cluster mass. Abell 3627 is thus theorized to be the Great Attractor, a massive object that is pulling the Local Group, the Virgo Supercluster, and the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster towards its location at 600–1000 kilometres per second.|$|E
5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought {{that they could not}} <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E
5|$|Hart House resembles some {{traditional}} aspects of student representation through its financial support of student clubs, and its standing committees and board of stewards that are composed mostly of undergraduate students. However, the main students' unions on administrative and policy issues are the University of Toronto Students' Union, Association of Part-time Undergraduate Students and the Graduate Students' Union. Student representative bodies also <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> the various colleges, academic faculties and departments.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Dwayne Heard at the University of Leeds {{suggested}} that quantum mechanical tunneling could explain a reaction his group observed taking place, at {{a significantly higher}} than expected rate, between cold (around 63 kelvins) hydroxyl and methanol molecules, apparently bypassing intramolecular energy barriers which {{would have to be}} overcome by thermal energy or ionization events for the same rate to <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> warmer temperatures. The proposed tunneling mechanism may help explain the common observation of fairly complex molecules (up to tens of atoms) in interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|In DNA, fraying {{occurs when}} non-complementary regions <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of}} an {{otherwise}} complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century the fraternity system continued to expand at such a rapid pace that university newspapers questioned if the increase in the number of fraternities would ever end. Many fraternity chapters were founded during this time that no longer <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> the university, such Alpha Chi Rho, Theta Nu Epsilon, and Delta Chi. Other chapters that are still active were founded at this time as well, such as Theta Chi and Phi Sigma Kappa.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{when the story}} first emerged, but similar stories, {{possibly}} inspired by medieval Arthurian legends, <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> the nearby locations of Hexham and the Eildon Hills. Matthew Lewis wrote a poem, Sir Guy the Seeker, popularising the story in 1808, with subsequent versions produced by W. G. Thompson in 1821 and James Service in 1822. The tale continues to be told {{as part of the}} local oral tradition.|$|E
5|$|Night clouds or {{noctilucent clouds}} are {{composed}} of tiny crystals of water ice up to 100nm in diameter and <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> a height of about , higher than any other clouds in Earth's atmosphere. Clouds in the Earth's lower atmosphere form when water collects on particles, but mesospheric clouds may form directly from water vapour in addition to forming on dust particles.|$|E
5|$|Other outdoor {{recreation}} opportunities <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> {{and near the}} pass. Between the pass and Difficult Campground, 3 miles (4.8km) east of Aspen, there are many popular rock climbing areas, some with grades up to 5.12 under the Yosemite Decimal System. The Grotto Wall across from Lincoln Gulch campground is a frequent destination. Closer to the pass are Instant Karma Cliff and Putterman's Dome. A pair of rocks along either side of Highway 82 on the east approach to the pass are popular bouldering spots.|$|E

5|$|Predators {{including}} Cactoblastis cactorum (mentioned above) {{can also}} be used to destroy invasive plant species. As another example, the poison hemlock moth (Agonopterix alstroemeriana) can be used to control poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). During its larval stage, the moth strictly consumes its host plant, poison hemlock, and can <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> hundreds of larvae per individual host plant, destroying large swathes of the hemlock.|$|E
5|$|Sam's slacker boyfriend Ben (Rasmus Hardiker) {{goes through}} {{numerous}} jobs and {{interests in the}} first series, such as taking a circus skills course, and a short-lived shelf-stacking job, however these apparent jobs require a recurring amount of forty pounds (which is gained from Rick through Sam's pleas), which {{may in fact be}} used to purchase recreational drugs, meaning the jobs and interests may not <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E
5|$|The electoral {{district}} ceased to <b>exist</b> <b>at</b> {{the drop of}} the writ for the 1888 Northwest Territories general election. This was due to a population boom in the area caused by an influx of settlers. The {{electoral district}} was redistributed and split between the electoral districts of Batoche and the Prince Albert electoral district. During the nine years the district existed, it returned three members through three elections who served roughly three-year terms.|$|E

50|$|Several {{portraits of}} Alexander Luttrell are listed by Maxwell Lyte (1909), {{but there is}} some {{difficulty}} in identifying him due to his similar appearance to his brother Francis. Maxwell Lyte lists a 1729 portrait of him by John Vanderbank at Dunster Castle, and others <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> one time at Nettlecombe Court and Bathealton Court. Portraits of his wife also <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> Dunster in 1909, and two portraits of her second husband Edward Dyke <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> Pixton at that time also. One portrait of Edward Dyke hangs at Dunster Castle in 2015.|$|R
