25|$|Some of my {{critics have}} painted me {{as a kind}} of moral leper, {{comparing}} me to those who deny that the Jewish Holocaust happened, that six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust. Others say my work is a revisionist job, useful, perhaps, in stimulating debate, but otherwise too extreme to be considered reliable. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with those appraisals.|$|E
500|$|Ling Woo's {{character}} {{has been described}} as the antithesis of Ally McBeal's. [...] For example, Woo is portrayed as evil, McBeal as good; Woo growls, McBeal purrs. At the same time, Woo's verbal assaults present a fantasy of authority that appeals to even McBeal. [...] "She's my hero", says McBeal, [...] "she's vicious, <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with almost everything she says, she treats me like dirt, and somehow she's my hero." ...|$|E
500|$|Armstrong was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the vowel system of Somali. A 2014 bibliography on the Somali language called Armstrong's paper [...] "seminal" [...] and notes she provides a more detailed description of Somali vowels than other works. She was also the first to discuss vowel harmony in Somali; her vowel harmony analysis was praised by Italian Somalist [...] Australian British linguist Roy Clive Abraham wrote that he agreed with Armstrong on most parts regarding Somali phonetics: [...] "there are very few points where <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with her". Austro-Hungarian linguist Werner Vycichl wrote that Armstrong's study [...] "opens a new chapter of African studies". In 1992, Trinity College, Dublin linguist John Ibrahim Saeed said Armstrong's paper was [...] "even now the outstanding study of Somali phonetics", and in 1996, Martin Orwin wrote that it [...] "remains essential reading for anyone interested in pursuing any aspect of the sound system of Somali".|$|E
40|$|William Peone {{was born}} about 1806 or earlier, his father's name was William "Sea-al " Peone, a French-Canadian, {{and his mother}} Quichinemalese of the Spokane tribe. Some writers give his parents as Louis Pion and Okanagan Native Mary "Sukomelk, ” <b>I</b> <b>disagreed</b> with them. You’ll see why I do later in this piece...|$|R

I undertook certain responsibilities which he should have shared, and he arranged to leave the firm and the country at once. We parted--well, not exactly the best of friends. I am afraid I cannot give you any information." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>disagreed</b> {{with him}} at the outset. Madame Pratolungo and my aunt had quarreled about politics. Any {{correspondence}} between them--a confidential correspondence especially--seemed {{to be one of the}} most unlikely things that could take place. I asked Oscar if he could guess what the letter contained, and why it was not to be given to me until Grosse reported that I was quite cured.|$|R
500|$|The {{book was}} {{summarised}} in Internet Bookwatch as [...] "ragmatic, insightful, rational, iconoclastic, informed and informative". It {{was described as}} [...] "thoughtful and thought-provoking, making it a welcome and highly recommended addition to personal and academic library Contemporary Ethics reference collections and supplemental reading lists." [...] In addition to a quote from Internet Bookwatch, Columbia University Press advertised Animal Rights Without Liberation with quotes from several academics working {{in the area of}} animal ethics. Philosophers Peter Singer and Paula Casal praised work for exposing a false dichotomy of animal rights versus animal welfare, both seeing the work as an important contribution to the literature for this reason. Francione, an advocate for an animal rights approach which does mandate liberation, was quoted as saying that [...] "It would be an understatement to say that <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with Cochrane but he does a fine job presenting the argument and his book will surely provoke debate and discussion." ...|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} the About.com, Nancy Basile's review was mixed to {{positive}} {{and gave the}} episode a score of four out of five. She wrote, [...] "...though <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> {{with a few of}} the animator's choices, this Christmas special is a treat." [...] Basile criticized its characters especially the use of foam to create the characters and the way Santa Claus was depicted saying [...] "...he looks like a pig with liver spots." [...] The animators responded to this comment about their interpretation of Santa Claus, saying [...] "We definitely wanted to keep an element of strangeness, almost scary aspects in the story." [...] Caballero explained that the idea of making Santa Claus look tired and strange came when they saw a drawing of him by Marc Ceccarelli or Luke Brookshier. Caballero said, [...] "We thought that was a great idea. So we came up with our own little back story where Bikini Bottom is the last stop for Santa. He's tired, he wants to get home, take his shoes off ... We honed in on the old descriptions of Santa being a jolly old elf. We pictured him as humanoid, but not necessarily directly human." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Kevin Shirley {{was brought}} in {{on the advice of}} Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. [...] As Rich explained, [...] "We really wanted to work with someone who can come in and say, 'That's not good.'... If Kevin says {{something}} <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with, he'll {{be the first one to}} say, 'Hey, it's your song,' but it's healthy for me and Chris to have him come in and be as excited about our songs as we are and say, 'Okay, that's cool, but what if we tried this?'" [...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. [...] I stopped them then and I said to them... 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'" [...] Shirley's prompting led the band to write [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around" [...] on the spot, before he had signed on to produce. [...] Rich agreed that Shirley shifted the focus to making [...] "a rock record" [...] that was [...] "focused and concise".|$|E

40|$|The new BBC {{director}} general Tony Hall {{barely had time}} to arrange the pens on his new desk before two hot potatoes landed on it. <b>I</b> <b>disagreed</b> with his decision on the Wizard of Oz protest song and, you may not be surprised to hear, disagree with the line taken on the LSE’s complaints about the BBC Panorama North Korea film. But politically, he may well have done the right thing...|$|R
5000|$|Nicholas D. Kristof welcomed Sexants in the New York Times as [...] "sensibly {{organized}} and engagingly told" [...] but [...] "In the end, <b>I</b> <b>disagreed</b> {{with much of}} the thesis of this book, but {{that is not to say}} that I disliked it. On the contrary, I probably liked it more for disagreeing with it. Partly because of the boldness of the argument, it is stimulating and refreshing..." ...|$|R
2500|$|Shulamit Reinharz {{wrote in}} a column for the Jewish Advocate, [...] "Most would {{say that they are}} simply anti-Zionists, not anti-Semites. But <b>I</b> <b>disagree,</b> because in a world where there is only one Jewish state, to oppose it vehemently is to endanger Jews." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, 1963, Connally {{was seriously}} wounded while riding in President Kennedy's car at Dealey Plaza in Dallas when the {{president}} was assassinated. Connally suffered three broken ribs, a punctured lung and a shattered wrist and had a bullet lodged in his leg. He underwent four hours of surgery after the shooting and recovered from his wounds. The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963–64 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by 24 year old ex-Marine Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. Connally did not dispute this conclusion but did {{for the rest of}} his life question the single bullet theory. In 1966, he told the press, [...] "I am convinced beyond any doubt that I was not struck by the first bullet," [...] and added, [...] "but just because <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with the Warren Commission on this one finding does not mean <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with their overall findings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nils Nilsson writes [...] "If {{a program}} behaves as if [...] it were multiplying, {{most of us}} would say that it is, in fact, multiplying. [...] For all I know, Searle may only be {{behaving}} as if [...] he were thinking deeply about these matters. [...] But, even though <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with him, his simulation is pretty good, so I'm willing to credit him with real thought." ...|$|E
5000|$|... It {{probably}} wont be {{long before}} Ill become editor of another New York newspaper. I hope so, anyway. I {{have no intention of}} retiring at the age of 37. I resigned from the Graphic because <b>I</b> <b>disagreed</b> heartily with Mr. Macfadden on vital and essential matters of policies, not only of his newspaper but of his other publications as well. I would never work for Mr. Macfadden again under any circumstances." ...|$|R
5000|$|Contestant Jamie Lester {{was accused}} of brokering dodgy {{property}} deals in the disputed area of Northern Cyprus and sold the homes of Greek Cypriots who fled the country when Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 and occupied it illegally. Former Liverpool council leader Derek Hatton, who attended a conference at which Lester spoke, claimed {{he said it was}} OK to sell the homes. He said: [...] "I remember Jamie. <b>I</b> <b>disagreed</b> with the morals and legality of his argument." ...|$|R
5000|$|Childish has said: [...] "The Stuckist art {{group was}} formed in 1999 at the {{instigation}} of Charles Thomson, {{the title of the}} group being taken from a poem of mine written and published in 1994. <b>I</b> <b>disagreed</b> with the way Charles presented the group, particularly in the media. For these reasons I left the Stuckists in 2001. I never attended any Stuckist demonstrations and my work was not shown in the large Stuckist exhibition held in the Walker Art Gallery in 2004." ...|$|R
2500|$|Obama {{also argued}} that the high court {{had gone too far}} in restricting the powers of the states. If the court had [...] "said we want to {{constrain}} the abilities of states to do this to make sure that it’s done in a careful and appropriate way, that would have been one thing. But it basically had a blanket prohibition and <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with that decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|BBVA {{executive}} chairman, Francisco González, {{explained why}} banks must {{get with the}} technology program: [...] "Some bankers and analysts think that Google, Facebook, Amazon or the like will not fully enter a highly regulated, low-margin business such as banking. <b>I</b> <b>disagree.</b> What is more, I think banks that are not prepared for such new competitors face certain death." [...] The banking industry recognizes BBVA to be more pro-technology than many of its competitors.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, Trump {{said about}} the lawsuit: [...] "Essentially the judge just said 'Trump is too famous. He's so famous that you're allowed to say {{anything}} you want about him.' Well, <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with that." [...] In July 2015, O'Brien, who was now working for Bloomberg View, wrote a column titled [...] "Dear Mr. Trump: I'm Worth $10 Billion, Too," [...] in which he exaggerated {{the value of his}} belongings {{in the same way as}} Trump.|$|E

But he was always engaging and interesting, and you were never bored when reading or listening to him, and the country a great campaigner, a great writer, and someone who I'm sure whose words will be followed keenly for many, many years to come.|$|R
5000|$|When England manager Glenn Hoddle {{took the}} Captain's armband from Adams {{and gave it}} to Alan Shearer it was a bitter pill for Adams to swallow. Speaking at a fans' forum in 2008 Adams remarked [...] "I have some resentment over the way Glenn Hoddle gave the {{captaincy}} to Alan Shearer instead of me but I can let that go. I reacted positively. <b>I</b> <b>disagreed</b> with him Hoddle and he thought Alan could get more penalties being a centre forward. People know my reaction to that".|$|R

He primarily writes on economic subjects, generally advocating a free market approach to capitalism. Sowell opposes the Federal Reserve, arguing that it has been unsuccessful in preventing economic depressions and limiting inflation.|$|E
2500|$|Press reports {{indicated}} that Vice President Cheney [...] "repeatedly pressed Bush to pardon Libby" [...] {{to no avail}} {{in the final days}} of the Bush administration. Cheney told The Weekly Standard, [...] " [...] was the victim of a serious miscarriage of justice, and I strongly believe that he deserved a presidential pardon. Obviously, <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with President Bush's decision." [...] Cheney was reportedly [...] "furious" [...] with Bush over his decision not to pardon Libby.|$|E
2500|$|ARMITAGE: They're not {{words on}} which <b>I</b> <b>disagree.</b> I {{think it was}} {{extraordinarily}} foolish of me. There was no ill-intent on my part and I had never seen ever, in 43 years of having a security clearance, a covert operative's name in a memo. The only reason I knew a [...] "Mrs. Wilson", not [...] "Mrs. Plame", worked at the agency was because I saw it in a memo. But I don't disagree with her words to a large measure.|$|E
5000|$|Skousen's book {{is full of}} misrepresentations and factual errors.

2500|$|How, he {{was later}} asked, could the Seventh Circuit's holding that an {{employer}} could {{be held liable for}} adverse action against speech believed to be unprotected but later held otherwise be reconciled with qualified immunity? [...] "Number one, <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with that," [...] he said. [...] "Unfortunately that's the question cert was granted on", came the reply. Bisbee insisted that the record did not support that reading, that it was merely a dictum and that he himself had not so argued.|$|E

"I can see {{no basis}} for {{concluding}} that the liberty of a corporation to engage in political activity with regard to matters having no material effect on its business is necessarily incidental to the purposes for which the Commonwealth permitted these corporations to be organized or admitted within its boundaries. Nor can <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> with the Supreme Judicial Court's factual finding that no such effect has been shown by these appellants.

The Court's analysis assumes that the only interests at stake in the case are those of the Amish parents on the one hand, and those of the State on the other.
