5|$|Some of {{the energy}} thus {{captured}} produces biomass and energy that is available for growth and development of other life forms. The majority {{of the rest of}} this biomass and energy are lost as waste molecules and heat. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances <b>into</b> <b>energy</b> useful to sustain life are metabolism and cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{is about}} halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion {{reactions}} in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million tonnes of matter are converted <b>into</b> <b>energy</b> within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth <b>into</b> <b>energy,</b> about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star. The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence, because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force, according to the inverse-square law. This stronger force increases {{the pressure on the}} core, which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser. It is estimated that the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years. At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.|$|E

5|$|Cid {{is confronted}} by Vaan, Balthier and {{company at the}} Draklor Laboratory, which results in a fight that Cid loses. Cid survives the {{encounter}} and flees. Cid goes to the Pharos lighthouse to invoke the Sun-Cryst's full power, revealing himself to the main characters there once Gabranth is defeated. Enraged, Gabranth tries to attack Cid, who teleports {{out of the way}} as Venat throws the judge against a wall. Cid fights Vaan, Balthier and the rest of the party once again, and again loses. Cid dies after the battle, dissolving <b>into</b> <b>energy</b> absorbed by the Sun-Cryst before it is destroyed and fully activates his final airship, the Bahamut. A character named Cid appears or is mentioned in every main Final Fantasy. He made his debut appearance in Final Fantasy II, though this appearance is the first Final Fantasy game to feature a Cid character as a villain. Cid was voiced by John Rafter Lee in English and by Chikao Ōtsuka in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which {{is a type of}} abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose <b>into</b> <b>energy,</b> causing the dog to have extremely low energy and be unable to exercise. The gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.|$|E
5|$|Although the Xel'Naga rarely appear {{during the}} novels and the video games, various relics left behind from their legacy are {{scattered}} throughout the series. One such relic appears in Brood War, a large temple on the planet Shakuras containing the power to wipe the planet clear of other species. During the course of Brood War, the Protoss activate the temple {{and use it to}} destroy all of the Zerg on Shakuras. In addition, other structures have been shown in the series. In the novel Shadow of the Xel'Naga, the three main species fight for control of a large Xel'Naga artifact on the planet Bhekar Ro, but accidentally activate it. The artifact releases a creature incubating in the structure, which proceeds to convert the nearby Xel'Naga-empowered Protoss and Zerg forces <b>into</b> <b>energy</b> for nourishment, before disappearing into space. After this, the novel Firstborn reveals that numerous other similar artifacts are discovered by the Terran Dominion within its borders. The Dominion heir Valerian Mengsk consequently sends an archaeological team under Emil Narud to investigate these relics. Wings of Liberty also features a Xel'Naga relic that was broken into pieces. James Raynor and Valerian Mengsk reunite the pieces and, during a bloody invasion of the volcanic Zerg planet of Char, use the relic to restore Sarah Kerrigan back into her human form; the artifact also plays a significant role in Legacy of the Void.|$|E

5|$|After this, Estelle is {{kidnapped by}} Raven, {{revealed}} to be an agent of Commandant Alexei, leader of the Knights and the mastermind behind the blastia thefts: Alexei intends to use Estelle's power and the replica of a magical sword to activate an ancient weapon called the Enduring Shrine of Zaude and remake the world, erasing the harmful blastia. After Raven decides to remain with Brave Vesperia after helping Estelle to escape with them, the group travel to Zaude to stop Alexei. They fail, and as Zaude is activated, it is {{revealed to be}} a barrier generator which kept the Adephagos sealed off from the world. As the Adephagos is released, Alexei is killed as Zaude collapses and Yuri is separated from the group after one of Flynn's subordinates attempts to kill him without Flynn's knowledge. Rescued by Duke, Yuri decides to stop the Adaphagos. During his absence, Rita discovers a means of converting blastia cores into spirits, which can process aer into a less-dangerous alternate energy called mana, stabilizing the aer krene and keeping Estelle's powers in check. In turn, the mana could power a weapon capable of destroying the Adephagos. After receiving permission from the world's leaders {{to carry out their}} plan, Brave Vesperia must confront Duke aboard the city-sized weapon Tarqaron. Duke intends to convert all of human life, including himself, <b>into</b> <b>energy</b> to power the weapon and destroy the Adephagos, returning the world to a more primal state of being. While they share some goals, they are forced to fight due to their conflicting methods. After defeating Duke, Yuri attempts to use the converted blastia energy against Adaphagos, but it proves insufficient. Moved by Brave Vesperia's efforts, Duke provides the extra power and Adaphagos is destroyed. The Entelexeia that formed the Adaphagos are then converted into spirits to revitalize the planet. A post-credits scene shows Brave Vesperia continuing their adventures.|$|E

30|$|Recently, an {{approach}} for converting nanoscale mechanical <b>energy</b> <b>into</b> electrical <b>energy</b> {{has been suggested}} by using piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires and TiO 2 [20].

25|$|There is also {{an attempt}} to bring nanofluidic {{technology}} <b>into</b> <b>energy</b> conversion.

25|$|For {{many years}} after the 1986 Chernobyl {{disaster}} nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. Some anti-nuclear groups disbanded. In the 2000s (decade), however, following public relations activities by the nuclear industry, advances in nuclear reactor designs, and concerns about climate change, nuclear power issues came back <b>into</b> <b>energy</b> policy discussions in some countries.
