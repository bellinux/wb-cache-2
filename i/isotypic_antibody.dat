40|$|Fifty volunteers, {{treated with}} an inactivated {{trivalent}} influenza vaccine containing A/Bangkok/ 1 / 79 (H 3 N 2), A/Brazil/ 11 / 78 (H 1 N 1) and B/Singapore/ 222 / 79 virus, were subdivided {{according to the}} estimated first exposure to influenza in their lifetime (priming) {{and the presence of}} antibodies against the vaccine components in the pre-vaccination sera. The <b>isotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> response (IgG, IgA, IgM) was determined by means of an antibody capture haemadsorption immunosorbent technique. For all three vaccine components, previously seropositive subjects produced antibodies of the IgG- and IgA-class more frequently than previously seronegative persons. Subjects primed to one of the influenza A subtypes showed more IgG and IgA responses in comparison with those unprimed (prime-effect). In contrast, IgM antibodies occurred in only 19 and 11 % of primed, but in 59 and 54 % of unprimed subjects, for A (H 3 N 2) and A (H 1 N 1), respectively. The incidence of IgM titre rises was not influenced by the prevaccination state. However, the mean magnitude of anti-A (H 1 N 1) -IgM titre rises was greater in those previously seronegative. The concepts of primary and reinfection and of 'original antigenic sin' are discussed, and it is suggested that age and, if possible, serological state prior to antigen-exposure should be taken into account when studying <b>isotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> responses after influenza infection or vaccination...|$|E

With a modified immunodot procedure, an immune response was detected after experimental H. somnus abortion, experimental H. somnus pneumonia, or vaccination with commercial H. somnus vaccine, with the greatest titer found within the immunoglobulin G 2 isotype. With protein A peroxidase conjugate, which detects primarily bovine immunoglobulin G 2, we showed that cattle with H. Somnus disease could be distinguished from clinically normal carriers, culture-negative cattle, or cattle with disease due to Pasteurella haemolytica or P. multocida. Little cross-reactivity between the 270 -kilodalton Fc receptor antigen and antigens from other gram-negative bovine pathogens was seen. Thus, this antigen may be a useful diagnostic antigen...|$|E
40|$|This study {{demonstrated}} that antigens of the parasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei (SS) cross-react with antigens {{of the house}} dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus(DP). Crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CE) reaction of SS extract with rabbit anti-DP serum resulted in multiple immunoprecipitates. Reciprocal CIE reactions gave similar results. Immunoprecipitates from both reactions bound IgE in the sera of dust-mite – sensitive patients who had no history of scabies. Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resolved protein/peptide bands of both SS and DP also bound serum IgE from dust-mite–allergic patients following immunoblotting. Non-allergic control sera gave no IgE binding to either SS or DP antigens. These results indicate that patients with atopy to dust mites exhibit circulating antibodies built to DP but that recognize determinants on SS antigens. It is highly probable that scabietic patients build antibodies to SS antigens that also recognize DP antigens. These results raise questions concerning the reported <b>isotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> responses to SS because the sensitivity of scabietic patients to house dust mites has not been previously evaluated. This cross-reactivity may {{play an important role}} in the susceptibility to scabies and its clinical manifestations...|$|E
40|$|The {{antiestrogen}} tamoxifen {{was examined}} for {{its effect on}} the interaction of monoclonal antibodies with the multidrug resistance markers: with Pgp and MRP 1 in the cultured T-lymphoblast leukemia cell line Jurkat and with BCRP in the cultured cervical cancer cell line HeLa. The investigation used immunofluorescence and flow cytofluorimetric assays, primary monoclonal and <b>isotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> labeled with the fluorescent dyes FITS and PE. After tamoxifen use, there was an increase in specific fluorescence and the number of specifically fluorescent cells on incubation with Pgp and BCRP antibodies and a reduction in those on incubation with MRP 1 antibodies. This directly indicates that tomoxifen binds to Pgp, BCRP, and MRP 1, which inevitably results in a decrease in the intracellular concentration of the antiestrogen available for the interaction with other cellular targets, including that with estrogen receptors. The authors consider that {{there is every reason to}} consider Pgp, BCRP, and MRP 1 as markers for lowering the efficacy of tamoxifen in the treatment of breast cancer with the positive estrogen receptor status...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectives:In this study, {{the effect}} of {{maternal}} peripheral and placental Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia {{on the level of}} antibody and cytokine immune responses in the neonate was investigated. Methods:Malaria parasites were detected by light microscopy. Levels of malaria-specific <b>isotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> were measured in maternal and cord blood by indirect ELISA. The numbers of IFN-γ and IL- 4 cells produced by maternal/cord blood after in vitro stimulation were enumerated using the ELISPOT assay. Results:Malaria parasite rate of maternal, placental biopsy and cord blood was 32. 8 %, 33. 7 % and 7. 8 % respectively. Overall, ELISA seropositivity rates for P. falciparum-specific IgG, IgM, IgE and IgA in the maternal plasma samples were 71 %, 85 %, 29. 3 %, and 0 % respectively, while those for the cord samples were 69 %, 6. 0 %, 4. 4 % and 0 % respectively. Mean IgM ELISA OD 405 values of neonates born from positive placentas, or whose mothers had peripheral malaria parasitaemia were higher than those who were parasite negative. The mean number of maternal cells producing IFN-γ was higher (P= 0. 0001) than that of the paired cord samples. The mean number of IL- 4 producing cells of neonates born of mothers who were positive (P< 0. 05) or from malaria-positive placentas (P< 0. 025) was higher than from those who were malaria negative. Neonates born of malaria-positive mothers or from parasitized placentas mounted predominantly Th 2 type immune responses. Conclusion:It appears from this study that neonates born from malaria-infected mothers or placentas may relatively be more susceptible to malaria attack during the first years of life...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{experimental}} Haemophilus somnus pneumonia {{was produced}} in five 8 - to 12 -week-old calves to investigate host-parasite relationships in the respiratory tract. Calves were depressed and pyrexic and coughed intermittently for 3 days and then recovered except for sporadic coughing. Bacteria persisted in the lung for 6 to 10 weeks or more. Immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG 1), IgG 2, and IgM but no IgA antibodies specific for H. somnus were detected in serum. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples contained detectable IgG 1, IgG 2, IgM, and IgA antibodies specific for H. somnus {{throughout most of the}} experiment. The kinetics of the <b>isotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> response against H. somnus in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids differed, suggesting that both local and systemic antibody responses had occurred. Persistence of pulmonary infection for 10 weeks or more in the presence of antibody may be due to an inappropriate distribution of isotypes, toxicity of H. somnus for bovine macrophages, and perhaps other factors. Three of the calves were challenged with a 10 -fold-higher dose of H. somnus at 10 weeks after the original inoculation. Immunity against H. somnus was indicated by the rapid clearance of bacteria from the lungs and the presence of minimal pneumonia at necropsy 3 days after bacterial challenge...|$|E
40|$|Transplant {{arteriosclerosis}} {{is characterized}} by inflammation and intimal thickening caused by accumulation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) both from donor and recipient. We assessed the relationship between clinical factors {{and the presence of}} host-derived SMCs in 124 myocardial biopsies from 26 consecutive patients who received hearts from opposite-sex donors. Clinical and demographic information was obtained from the patients ’ medical records. Host-derived SMCs accounted for 3. 3562. 3 % of cells in arterioles (range, 0. 08 – 12. 51 %). As shown by linear regression analysis, an increased number of SMCs was associated with rejection grade (mean, 1. 4161. 03, p = 0. 034) and the number of leukocytes (19. 1612. 7 per 20 high-power fields, p = 0. 01). The accumulation of host-derived SMCs was associated with an increased number of leukocytes in the allografts. In vitro, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1) released from leukocytes was crucial for SMC migration. After heart allotransplantion, mice treated with MCP- 1 -specific antibodies had significantly fewer hostderived SMCs in the grafts than mice treated with <b>isotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> controls. We conclude that the number of host-derived SMCs in human cardiac allografts is associated with the rejection grade and that MCP- 1 may play pivotal role in recruitin...|$|E
40|$|Intragastric {{inoculation}} with whole-virion vaccine of inactivated {{influenza virus}} resulted in production of hemagglutinin (HA) -specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG both in lung lavage fluids and in serum samples of mice. HA-specific IgA was the predominant <b>isotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> secreted in the lung lavage fluids (average IgA/IgG ratio, 13 : 1), whereas HA-specific IgG {{was the major}} antibody class in serum (average IgA/IgG ratio, 0. 3 : 1). These responses were similar to the antibody responses stimulated by intranasal infection with live influenza virus. In vitro cultures of lymphoid cells from lungs and Peyer's patches, but not from spleens, {{in the presence of}} homologous antigen, from mice vaccinated intragastrically synthesized mostly HA-specific IgA. Mice immunized parenterally with inactivated influenza virus produced only IgG in lung lavage fluids and sera. Cultures of lymphoid cells from their spleens, but not their lungs, synthesized HA-specific IgG upon antigenic stimulation in vitro; neither synthesized IgA. These in vitro cell culture results, as well as the inverse relationship of IgA/IgG ratios in lung lavage fluids and sera, demonstrated that the IgA antibody in lung lavage fluids was actively synthesized locally in the lungs of intragastrically immunized mice. This finding was consistent with the migratory distribution of antigen-primed lymphoid cells from Peyer's patches to distant lymphoid tissue such as lung. Intragastric vaccination conferred protection against intranasal challenge with a lethal dose of virulent virus...|$|E

This <b>isotypic</b> distribution ofantiviral <b>antibodies</b> contrasts sharply with that ofantisoluble protein or anticarbohydrate antibodies, which are usually restricted to the IgG 1 and IgG 3 subclasses, respectively (1 - 3).

40|$|After {{infection}} with some viruses and intracellular parasites, antibody production {{is restricted to}} IgG 2 a. We first observed that, whereas live viruses such as lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) or mouse adenovirus induced mostly an IgG 2 a response, {{a large proportion of}} antibodies produced against killed viruses were IgG 1. This IgG 1 antiviral response was suppressed when live virions were added to inactivated viral particles. These results indicate that the IgG 2 a preponderance is related to the infectious process itself rather than to the type of antigen involved. Since IFN-gamma is known to stimulate IgG 2 a production by activated B lymphocytes and to be secreted after infection, we examined the role of this cytokine in the <b>antibody</b> <b>isotypic</b> distribution caused by LDV. Most IgG 2 a responses were relatively unaffected in mice deficient for the IFN-gamma receptor or treated with anti-IFN-gamma antibody. A similar IFN-gamma-independent IgG 2 a secretion was observed after {{infection with}} the parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi. However, the IFN-gamma-independent IgG 2 a production triggered by infection still required the presence of functional T(h) lymphocytes. Therefore, signal(s) other than IFN-gamma secretion may explain the T(h) -dependent <b>isotypic</b> bias in <b>antibody</b> secretion triggered by viruses and parasites.

40|$|Male {{and female}} BALB/c mice differ {{dramatically}} in susceptibility to myocarditis subsequent to coxsackievirus B 3 (CVB 3) infection. CVB 3 infection of male mice results in substantial inflammatory cell infiltration of the myocardium, and virus-immune lymphocytes from these animals give predominantly a Th 1 cell phenotypic response, {{as determined by}} predominant immunoglobulin G 2 a <b>isotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> production and elevated numbers of gamma interferon and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) -producing CD 4 + T lymphocytes. Females infected with the same virus give predominantly a Th 2 cell phenotypic response, as determined by preferential immunoglobulin G 1 antibody isotypic responses and increased precursor frequencies of IL- 4 - and IL- 5 -producing CD 4 + T cells. Treatment of females with testosterone or males with estradiol prior to infection alters subsequent Th subset differentiation, suggesting that the sex-associated hormones have either a direct or indirect effect on CD 4 + lymphocyte responses in this model. Treatment of females with 0. 1 mg of monoclonal antibody to IL- 4 reduces precursor frequencies of IL- 4 -producing CD 4 + T cells and increases frequencies of gamma interferon-producing cells. This treatment also enhances myocardial inflammation, indicating a correlation between Th 1 -like cell responses and pathogenicity in CVB 3 infection. The Th 2 -like cell may regulate Th 1 cell activation. Adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes from CVB 3 -infected female mice into male animals suppresses the development of myocarditis in the recipients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Peritoneal injury {{sustained}} at laparotomy may evoke local inflammatory {{responses that}} result in adhesion formation. Peritoneal mast cells are likely to initiate this process, whereas vascular permeability/endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may facilitate {{the degree to which}} subsequent adhesion formation occurs. METHODS: Mast cell deficient mice (WBB 6 F 1 -/-), along with their mast cell sufficient counterparts (WBB 6 F 1 +/+), underwent a standardized adhesion-inducing operation (AIS) with subsequent sacrifice and adhesion assessment 14 days later in a blinded fashion. Additional CD- 1 and WBB 6 F 1 +/+, and WBB 6 F 1 -/- mice were killed 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after operation for measurement of VEGF by ELISA in systemic serum and peritoneal lavage fluid. Two further groups of CD- 1 mice underwent AIS and received either a single perioperative dose of anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (10 mug/mouse) or a similar volume of IgG <b>isotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> and adhesion formation 2 weeks later was evaluated. RESULTS: WBB 6 F 1 -/- mice had less adhesions then did their WBB 6 F 1 +/+ counterparts (median [interquartile range] adhesion score 3 [3 - 3] vs 1. 5 [1 - 2] respectively; P <. 003). Local VEGF release peaked 6 hours after AIS in both WBB 6 F 1 +/+ and CD- 1 mice whereas levels remained at baseline in WBB 6 F 1 -/- mice. CD- 1 mice treated with a single dose of anti-VEGF therapy during operation had less adhesions than controls (2 [1. 25 - 2] vs 3 [2. 25 - 3], P =. 0002). CONCLUSIONS: Mast cells and VEGF are central to the formation of postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions with mast cells being responsible, either directly or indirectly, for VEGF release into the peritoneal cavity after operation. In tandem with the recent clinical success of anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies in oncologic practice, our observations suggest an intriguing avenue for research and development of anti-adhesion strategy...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Penetrating {{keratoplasty}} has a {{very poor}} outcome compared with adults if performed {{in the first years}} of life. Rejection in these young patients occurs even in the absence of known immunological risk factors. Recently, a baby rat model was introduced and an essential contribution of natural killer (NK) cells during allograft rejection was suggested. To analyze this, NK cells were depleted in baby rats before keratoplasty. Methods: Allogeneic keratoplasty was performed between Lewis and Fisher rats. The recipient's ages were 10 and 3 weeks, respectively. NK cells were depleted by an intraperitoneal injection of a monoclonal antibody. All experiments were controlled by the injection of <b>isotypic</b> control <b>antibodies</b> and syngeneically. Survival rates were calculated and cellular infiltrates were analyzed histologically. Results: NK cell depletion did delay median graft survival times in a statistically significantly way compared with the control animals (p< 0. 01). At median rejection time points, macrophages, CD 4 + T cells and CD 25 + leukocytes infiltrated to a greater extent in the depleted recipients. No significant changes in the cell numbers of infiltrating CD 8 + T cells were observed. Conclusions: We conclude that NK cells play a role during allograft rejection in baby rats, but their effect is replaceable. A greater infiltration of macrophages and CD 4 + T cells suggests that they might compensate for the missing NK cells’ response in this experimental setting. Our results represent another step toward understanding the complex mechanism...|$|R

BackgroundIgA nephropathy (IgAN) {{is characterized by}} deposition in the glomerular mesangium of IgA together with C 3, C 5 b- 9, and properdin. IgG deposition as a risk factor in IgAN was recently confirmed by a long-term follow-up of patients with IgAN. We previously reported on an acute model of IgA-mediated glomerular inflammation in Wistar rats. MethodsTo investigate {{the effect of the}} combination of IgA and IgG on glomerular injury, Wistar rats were injected with a minimum dose of rat IgG in {{the presence or absence of}} a subnephritogenic dose of polymeric rat IgA. Subsequently, glomerular complement activation, influx of inflammatory cells, proteinuria, and hematuria were assessed. ResultsAdministration of IgG to the rats resulted in maximal proteinuria of 20. 3 ± 12. 1 mg/ 24 h on day 2 and an absence of overt glomerular inflammation. Administration of polymeric rat IgA antibodies to rats resulted in hematuria with a moderate mesangial complement deposition. In the combination group, however, glomerular {{deposition of}} C 5 b- 9 was dramatically increased. This was accompanied by increased proteinuria as compared with rats receiving IgA or IgG antibody injections alone on day 7. Microhematuria occurred in rats receiving either polymeric rat IgA or IgG alone or the combination. While both rat IgG and polymeric IgA induced minor mesangial cell (MC) proliferation and MC lysis, the combination resulted in a pronounced, significant increased percentage of aneurysm formation on day 7 after injection.

40|$|Murine {{antibody}} {{responses to}} soluble proteins and to carbohydrates are generally {{restricted to the}} IgGI and IgG 3 subclasses, respectively (1 - 7), suggesting that IgG isotypes are not selected at random. Surprisingly, no family of antigens {{has been shown to}} preferentially induce the production of IgG 2 a antibodies, although this subclass represents a major component of mouse serum immunoglobulins (8). A few recent observations nevertheless suggested that IgG 2 a could predominate in antiviral antibody responses (9 - 12). This isotypic bias was particularly striking after infection with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) t and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). However, because these two viruses induce considerable alterations of the immune system, including a polyclonal B lymphocyte activation (13, 14), they may evoke antibody responses that are not representative of more common antiviral reactions.

40|$|Background. In human glomerulonephritis, {{including}} immunoglobulin-A nephropathy (IgAN), glomerular {{expression of}} macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) {{is found to}} correlate with progressive renal injury. We have shown previously that polymeric IgA is capable of inducing MIF production in cultured human mesangial cells, suggesting a role in inducing inflammatory injury in IgAN. Herein, we examined whether IgA deposition and the subsequent renal injury can be ameliorated with anti-MIF treatment in an experimental murine model of IgAN. Methods. Glomerular IgA deposition was induced in 4 -week-old BALB/c mice by intravenous injection of immune complexes consisting of dinitrophenyl-conjugated bovine serum albumin (DNP BSA) and IgA MOPC- 315 myeloma anti-DNP antibodies. To determine the therapeutic effect of anti-MIF, mice were given anti-MIF (5 mg/kg) or <b>isotypic</b> control <b>antibody</b> intravenously 2 h before the immune complexes administration. The mice were sacrificed 48 h after injection of DNP-IgA. Proteinuria and haematuria were determined and the kidneys were removed for histopathology, immunostaining and immunoblotting. The effect of exogenous MIF on production of TGF-β 1 by cultured mesangial cells was also examined. Results. IgA deposits were detected in glomeruli of all mice receiving the immune complexes while no glomerular deposit was detected in the control mice. Microscopic haematuria and mesangial hypercellularity were present in mice of the three experimental groups and were absent in the control group. Proteinuria was absent in all groups. Anti-MIF treatment also resulted in decreased renal expression of TGF-β 1. Moreover, the reduction in TGF-β 1 expression was confined mainly to glomerular mesangium. An in vitro culture experiment demonstrated that MIF increased TGF-β 1 production in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. MIF-induced TGF-β 1 synthesis was abolished by incubating cells with neutralizing antibody against MIF. Conclusions. Our finding shows that anti-MIF treatment can ameliorate kidney injury and reduce glomerular TGF-β 1 expression in an experimental model of IgAN. © ERA-EDTA 2004; all rights reserved. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Eosinophils and T {{lymphocytes}} {{are thought}} to be involved in allergic airway inflammation. Both cells express the alpha 4 beta 1 -integrin, very late antigen- 4 (VLA- 4, CD 49 d/CD 29); alpha 4 -integrins can promote cellular adhesion and activation. Therefore, we examined the in vivo effects of a blocking anti-alpha 4 monoclonal antibody, HP 1 / 2, on antigen-induced early and late bronchial responses, airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammatory cell influx, and peripheral leukocyte counts in allergic sheep. Sheep blood lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils expressed alpha 4 and bound HP 1 / 2. In control sheep, Ascaris antigen challenge produced early and late increases in specific lung resistance of 380 +/- 42 % and 175 +/- 16 % over baseline immediately and 7 h after challenge, respectively, as well as airway hyperresponsiveness continuing for 14 d after antigen challenge. Treatment with HP 1 / 2 (1 mg/kg, i. v.) 30 min before antigen challenge did not affect the early increase in specific lung resistance but inhibited the late-phase increase at 5 - 8 h by 75 % (P < 0. 05) and inhibited the post-antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness at 1, 2, 7, and 14 d (P < 0. 05, for each time). Intravenous HP 1 / 2 given 2 h after antigen challenge likewise blocked late-phase airway changes and postchallenge airway hyperresponsiveness. Airway administration of HP 1 / 2 (16 -mg dose) was also effective in blocking these antigen-induced changes. Response to HP 1 / 2 was specific since an <b>isotypic</b> monoclonal <b>antibody,</b> 1 E 6, was ineffective by intravenous and aerosol administration. Inhibition of leukocyte recruitment did not totally account for the activity of anti-alpha 4 antibody since HP 1 / 2 neither diminished the eosinopenia or lymphopenia that followed antigen challenge nor consistently altered the composition of leukocytes recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage. Because airway administration of HP 1 / 2 was also active, HP 1 / 2 may have inhibited cell activation. Reduction of platelet-activating factor-induced eosinophil peroxidase release from HP 1 / 2 -treated eosinophils supports such a mechanism. These findings indicate a role for alpha 4 -integrins in processes that lead to airway late phase responses and persisting airway hyperresponsiveness after antigen challenge...|$|R

Because {{it was not}} known whether the virus could also affect the Ab specificity, the authors addressed this point using human growth hormone (hGH) as a model antigen. Anti-hGH monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) were used as probes to study the occurrence of Ab to three native hGH epitopes (3 C 11, F 11 and 10 D 6) in sera from LDV-infected CBA/Ht and BALB/c mice immunized with hGH. Competition ELISA {{was used to determine}} the extent of Ab directed to cryptic hGH epitopes, i. e. antigenic determinants hidden in the native hormone. Results indicated that in LDV-infected CBA/Ht mice the titres of anti-hGH Ab were lower than in controls, although a consistent isotypic shift to IgG 2 a subclass was observed. Concurrently, the presence of Ab to epitopes 3 C 11, F 11 and/or 10 D 6 were markedly reduced in infected animals and most anti-hGH Ab were directed to hGH cryptic epitopes. By contrast, LDV infection increased the amount of anti-KLH Ab elicited by CBA/Ht mice and did not affect Ab specificity, whilst control and LDV-infected BALB/c mice showed similar concentrations of anti-hGH Ab. Furthermore, the proportion of Ab to cryptic hGH epitopes did not change in infected animals even though an important shift to IgG 2 a was detected. Thus, data presented herein suggest that LDV Infection modifies Ab specificity depending on the mice genetic background and on the antigenic characteristics of the immunogen...|$|R
