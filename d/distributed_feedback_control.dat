The main contribution {{is the development of}} a model that reflects the way that air traffic controllers regulate traffic flows into their facilities, and of a feedback control approach that provides them with decision support, in a distributed manner that is consistent with the existing communication structure. The focus is on developing techniques that guarantee that the aircraft queues in each airspace sector, which are an indicator of air traffic controller workload, are kept small. It is shown that the problems of scheduling and routing aircraft flows in the NAS can be posed as the fluid approximation of a network of queues, and that under appropriate conditions, a MaxWeight policy can be used to determine a <b>distributed</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> law that stabilizes the system.

In ac-cordance with the visions of e. g. autonomic computing and organic computing, self–organizing systems promote self-adaptability as one major property helping to realize software that can manage itself at runtime.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the design of}} distributed state and output <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> algorithms for linear multi-agent systems with performance guarantees {{in the presence of}} delays. The multi-agent systems considered are assumed to exchange relative information over an information network. As a first contribution, a novel <b>distributed</b> state <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> design method with a sub-optimal LQR performance is developed for a network of multiple agents. For the control design process, it is assumed that the exchange of relative information is instantaneous. A stability analysis of the proposed control law is performed by incorporating delays in relative information to ascertain the maximum possible delay that can be accommodated by the communication network. Subsequently, the assumption of the exchange of instantaneous relative information in the control design process is relaxed and the relative information is assumed to be delayed. The system is then represented as a time-delay system. <b>Distributed</b> state <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> synthesis methods are then developed for the system with a certain level of LQR performance. In the above contributions, the time delay analysis and the development of delay based control methods, it is implicitly assumed that delays are detrimental to achieving cooperative tasks for a multi-agent system. Subsequently, positive effects of delays in communication of relative information are explored. For this a network of vehicles described by double integrator dynamics, which cannot be stabilized by static output feedback without delays, is considered. A novel control design method to achieve exponential stabilization of such a multi-agent system by static output feedback using delayed relative information is developed. Conclusions are drawn from the results of the research presented in this thesis and a few directions for future work are identified...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Feedback control {{techniques}} {{have recently been}} applied {{to a variety of}} real-time systems. However, a fundamental issue that was left out is guaranteeing system controllability and the feasibility of applying <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> to such systems. No control algorithms can effectively control a system which itself is uncontrollable or infeasible. In this paper, we use the multiprocessor utilization control problem as a representative example to study the controllability and feasibility of distributed real-time systems. We prove that controllability and feasibility of a system depend crucially on end-to-end task allocations. We then present algorithms for deploying end-to-end tasks to ensure that the system is controllable and utilization control is feasible for the system. Furthermore, we develop runtime algorithms to maintain controllability and feasibility by reallocating tasks dynamically in response to workload variations, such as task terminations and migrations caused by processor failures. We implement our algorithms in a robust real-time middleware system and report empirical results on an experimental test-bed. We also evaluate the performance of our approach in large systems using numerical experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed task allocation algorithms improve the robustness of <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> in <b>distributed</b> real-time systems.

40|$|Abstract—An {{increasing}} number of distributed real-time systems face the critical challenge of providing quality of service guarantees in open and unpredictable environments. In particular, such systems often need to enforce utilization bounds on multiple processors {{in order to avoid}} overload and meet end-to-end deadlines even when task execution times are unpredictable. While recent <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> real-time scheduling algorithms have shown promise, they cannot handle the common end-to-end task model where each task is comprised of a chain of subtasks distributed on multiple processors. This paper presents the End-to-end Utilization CONtrol (EUCON) algorithm that adaptively maintains desired CPU utilization through performance feedbacks loops. EUCON is based on a model predictive control approach that models utilization control on a distributed platform as a multivariable constrained optimization problem. A multi-input-multi-output model predictive controller is designed based on a difference equation model that describes the dynamic behavior of distributed real-time systems. Both control theoretic analysis and simulations demonstrate that EUCON can provide robust utilization guarantees when task execution times deviate from estimation or vary significantly at runtime.

40|$|Abstract. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is {{the current}} inter-domain routing {{protocol}} used to exchange reachability information among Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet. BGP supports policy-based routing which allows each AS to independently define a set of local policies regarding which routes to accept and advertise from/to other networks, as well as which route the AS prefers when more than one route becomes available. However, independently chosen local policies may cause global conflicts, which result in protocol divergence. We propose a new algorithm, called Adaptive Policy Management (APM), to resolve policy conflicts in a distributed manner. Akin to <b>distributed</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> systems, each AS independently classifies {{the state of the}} network as either conflictfree or potentially conflicting by observing its local history only (namely, route flaps).
