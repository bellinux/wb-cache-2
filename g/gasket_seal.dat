40|$|A solid {{electrolyte}} cell with improved sealing characteristics was examined. A tube cell was designed, developed, fabricated, and tested. Design concepts {{incorporated in the}} tube cell to improve its sealing capability included minimizing the number of seals per cell and moving seals to lower temperature regions. The advanced tube cell design consists of one high temperature ceramic cement seal, one high temperature <b>gasket</b> <b>seal,</b> and three low temperature silicone elastomer seals. The two high temperature seals in the tube cell design represent a significant improvement over the ten high temperature precious metal seals required by the electrolyzer drum design.

40|$|A {{large number}} of samples are {{required}} to characterize a site contaminated with asbestos from previous mine or other industrial operations. Current methods, such as EPA Region 10 ’s glovebox method, or the Berman Elutriator method are time consuming and costly primarily because the equipment is difficult to decontaminate between samples. EPA desires a shorter and less costly method for characterizing soil samples for asbestos. The objective of this was to design and test a qualitative asbestos sampler that operates as a fluidized bed. The proposed sampler employs a conical spouted bed to vigorously mix the soil and separate fine particulate including asbestos fibers on filters. The filters are then analyzed using transmission electron microscopy for presence of asbestos. During initial testing of a glass prototype using ASTM 20 / 30 sand and clay fines as asbestos surrogates, fine particulate adhered {{to the sides of}} the glass vessel and the tubing to the collection filter – presumably due to static charge on the fine particulate. This limited the fines recovery to ~ 5 % of the amount added to the sand surrogate. A second prototype was constructed of stainless steel, which improved fines recovery to about 10 %. Fines recovery was increased to 15 % by either humidifying the inlet air or introducing a voltage probe in the air space above the sample. Since this was not a substantial improvement, testing using the steel prototype proceeded without using these techniques. Final testing of the second prototype using asbestos suggests that the fluidized bed is considerably more sensitive than the Berman elutriator method. Using a sand/tremolite mixture with 0. 005 % tremolite, the Berman elutriator did not segregate any asbestos structures while the fluidized bed segregated an average of 11. 7. The fluidized bed was also able to segregate structures in samples containing asbestos at a 0. 0001 % concentration, while the Berman elutriator method did not detect any fibers at this concentration. Opportunities for improvement with the fluidized bed include improving reproducibility among replicates, increasing mass recovery, improving the lid <b>gasket</b> <b>seal...</b>|$|E
40|$|Low-temperature {{measurements}} of the Hall effect {{have been used to}} de-termine donor and acceptor concentrations and in some cases to identify the major impurity in silicon. A simple apparatus for making these measurements with liquid hel ium is described. Typical results are presented and correlated with l ifetime data at room temperature. Interpretation of the Hall coefficient measurements i discussed, and a simplified analysis of the case of the two types of donor impurity is suggested. Experimental Apparatus Low- temperature Hal l measurements have been used by many workers to study impur i ty levels in silicon. 1 ' ~ This paper describes the use of such meas-urements to eva luate h igh-pur i ty Merck silicon. F igure 1 shows the Dewar used for these meas-urements, which is re lat ive ly s imple in design. The l iquid n i t rogen Dewar which serves as a radiat ion shield has been omitted for clarity. The Dewar, made of Pyrex, is arranged so that four samples can be run at one time, and these are fastened to a re la-t ive ly massive brass block which is surrounded by a tube containing hel ium gas at 1 atm.

5000|$|Grooved {{coupling}} {{pipe joining}} systems uses a roll grooving technique to join pipes and pipe joining components. A groove {{is placed on}} the end of two pipes to prepare the pipes engagement with the coupling housing and gasket. The gasket creates a pressure responsive seal on the outside diameter of the pipe, unlike standard compression joints, where pressure acts to separate the <b>seal.</b> The <b>gasket</b> <b>sealing</b> is enhanced as the coupling housing is tightened onto the pipe end.

50|$|Outgassing {{can also}} be reduced simply by {{desiccation}} prior to vacuum pumping.High vacuum systems generally require metal chambers with metal <b>gasket</b> <b>seals</b> such as Klein flanges or ISO flanges, rather than the rubber gaskets more common in low vacuum chamber seals. The system must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing.

As a result, many materials that work well in low vacuums, such as epoxy, will {{become a source of}} outgassing at higher vacuums.With these standard precautions, vacuums of 1 mPa are easily achieved with an assortment of molecular pumps.
