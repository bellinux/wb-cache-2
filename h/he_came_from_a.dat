5|$|Emile Durkheim {{was born}} in Épinal in Lorraine, the son of Mélanie (Isidor) and Moïse Durkheim. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> long line of devout French Jews; his father, grandfather, and {{great-grandfather}} had been rabbis. He began his education in a rabbinical school, but at an early age, {{he decided not to}} follow in his family's footsteps and switched schools. Durkheim led a completely secular life. Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community. Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. Marcel Mauss, a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew. One of his nieces was Claudette (née Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of Maurice Bloch, who became a noted anthropologist.|$|E
5|$|Paul the Deacon was {{the most}} {{important}} Italian writer of the 8th century. Born in the 720s or 730s, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> noble Lombard family from Friuli. He entered the clergy early, and eventually became a monk of the monastery of Monte Cassino. His most famous work is the Historia Langobardorum, a history of the Lombard nation. Written after 787, it is a continuation of his previous major historical work, the Historia Romana, which was based on the Breviarium of Eutropius, with six books added describing historical events up to Justinian's empire. Both of these works mention Thurisind and the third Lombard–Gepid War, which represent the only overlap between the Historia Langobardorum and the Historia Romana. Both books also mention the duel between the kings' sons, an event which is absent in Procopius' writing and is thought to have originated through oral tradition. Similarly, the meeting between Thurisind and Audoin's son at the former's court derives from an oral source.|$|E
