25|$|Some scholars, like Paul Roderick Gregory, have {{suggested}} that a complete abandonment of Korean reunification may be necessary, {{in exchange for the}} North to dismantle <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program</b> and permanently ending the Korean War with a peace treaty.|$|E
25|$|After the International Atomic Energy Agency found {{evidence}} of the ROC's efforts to produce weapons-grade plutonium, Taipei agreed in September 1976 under U.S. pressure to dismantle <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program.</b> Though the nuclear reactor was soon shut down and the plutonium mostly returned to the U.S.|$|E

25|$|In July 2012, Megan Rice, an 82-year-old nun and two fellow pacifists {{entered the}} Y-12 complex and spray-painted antiwar slogans on a {{building}} that houses nuclear bomb fuel. The anti-nuclear activists, who got past fences and security sensors before dawn on July 28, spent several hours in the Complex, conducting a Christian peace ritual, before they were stopped by a lone guard. The security breach prompted private experts to criticize the Department of Energy’s safeguarding of nuclear stockpiles. The agency is to reappraise security measures across <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{table is}} not comprehensive, as {{numerous}} facilities throughout the United States {{have contributed to}} <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program.</b> It includes the major sites related to the U.S. weapons program (past and present), their basic site functions, and their current status of activity. Not listed are the many bases and facilities at which nuclear weapons have been deployed. In addition to deploying weapons on its own soil, during the Cold War, the United States also stationed nuclear weapons in 27 foreign countries and territories, including Okinawa, Japan (during the occupation immediately following World War II), Greenland, Germany, Taiwan, and French Morocco then independent Morocco.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{is known}} to have {{developed}} nuclear weapons. Israel does not officially acknowledge <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program.</b> It is thought Israel possesses between one hundred and four hundred nuclear warheads. It is believed that Jericho intercontinental ballistic missiles are capable of delivering nuclear warheads with a superior degree of accuracy and a range of 11,500km. Israeli F-15I and F-16 fighter-bomber aircraft also have been cited as possible nuclear delivery systems (these aircraft types are nuclear capable in the US Air Force). The U.S. Air Force F-15E has tactical nuclear weapon (B61 and B83 bombs) capability. It has been asserted that Dolphin-class submarines have been adapted to carry Popeye Turbo Submarine-launched cruise missiles with nuclear warheads, so as to give Israel a second strike capacity.|$|E
5000|$|Lee {{has been}} {{described}} as a staunch conservative in the context of South Korean politics. His positions include anti-communism, support for free market capitalism, and a hard-line stance against North Korea. Lee has repeatedly criticized Kim Dae-jung's [...] "Sunshine Policy" [...] of engagement and détente with North Korea, and argued for the cessation of foreign aid until the North should dismantle <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>program.</b> Lee has called for a crackdown on illegal strikes, and for the appointment of more women to government offices.|$|R
500|$|On 8 January 2009 Schlesinger's {{task force}} {{released}} its report regarding the overall DoD's {{management of the}} country's <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> mission. The report criticized the DoD {{for a lack of}} focus and oversight on <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>programs</b> and recommended that the DoD create a new assistant secretary position to oversee <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> management. The task force found that within the DoD only the United States Navy was effectively managing <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> arsenal. The panel stated that it found [...] "a distressing degree of inattention to the role of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in deterrence among many senior DoD military and civilian leaders." ...|$|R
2500|$|South Africa {{also had}} an active program to develop uranium-based <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> but {{dismantled}} <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>program</b> in the 1990s. Experts {{do not believe it}} actually tested such a weapon, though it later claimed it constructed several crude devices that it eventually dismantled. In the late 1970s American spy satellites detected a [...] "brief, intense, double flash of light near the southern tip of Africa." [...] Known as the Vela Incident, it was speculated to have been a South African or possibly Israeli <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> test, though some feel that it may have been caused by natural events or a detector malfunction.|$|R
500|$|Under {{the nuclear}} agreement, an {{important}} policy {{objective was to}} ensure that the Iranian economy benefits from suspending <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program.</b> In the view of commentators Ali Omidi, a professor of international relations at the University of Isfahan, and Saam Borhani, an attorney and commentator on US-Iran relations and sanctions law, the Bank Markazi decision and the 9/11 case threaten to undermine the nuclear deal and American credibility in negotiations with Iran. The head of the Nuclear Committee in Iran's parliament, Ibrahim Karkhaneh, decried the rulings as [...] "cooperation between the American Congress, the government and courts to steal Iranian property." ...|$|E

Obama has criticized Bush for taking so long to engage with North Korea, and has indicated {{that he would be}} eager to engage in a more proactive diplomatic effort to reach an agreement. A senior North Korean official recently told reporters that [...] "we are ready to deal" [...] with the incoming Obama administration.|$|R

50|$|Agreement to {{exchange}} the detailed data described above represented {{a significant degree}} of direct cooperation by the two major nuclear powers {{in the effort to}} control <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> For the first time, each party agreed to make available to the other data relating to <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> test <b>program.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On September 19, 2005, Six-party talks {{resulted}} in an agreement where North Korea agreed to abandon <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program</b> {{for economic cooperation and}} assistance, repeating its right to [...] "peaceful uses of nuclear energy", while the U.S. recognized North Korea's sovereignty and stated that it had no intention to attack. The provision of a nuclear light-water reactor would be discussed at [...] "an appropriate time"; the U.S. and North Korea immediately disagreed on when that should be.|$|E
2500|$|Because North Korea had not {{conducted}} a successful {{test of a}} nuclear device, the extent of <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program</b> remained ambiguous through 2005 and much of 2006. Though North Korea conducted numerous missile tests (some of which were branded failures by international experts), {{the question of whether}} they had actually mastered all aspects of nuclear weapons technology – ranging from material production to complex nuclear weapon design needed to produce the final detonation – remained unanswered. [...] there was agreement in the U.S. intelligence community that North Korea could build a [...] "modest" [...] bomb with a yield of between 6 and 10 kilotons, but disagreement between Defense Intelligence Agency, CIA and the United States State Department over whether it could deploy a miniaturized warhead on a missile.|$|E
2500|$|Financial {{restrictions}} / Trade normalization - The U.S. {{has placed}} heavy financial sanctions on North Korea {{for what they}} see as an uncooperative attitude and unwillingness to dismantle <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program.</b> [...] In addition, other parties such as China have taken actions such as the freezing of North Korean assets in foreign bank accounts, such as the US$24 million in Macau's Banco Delta Asia. [...] With the nuclear test on October 9, 2006, UNSCR 1718 was passed, which included a ban on all luxury goods to North Korea. [...] These funds have since been unfrozen by the US on March 19, 2007 to reciprocate actions by their North Korean counterparts. [...] The United States removed North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism in October 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked {{confidential}} diplomatic cables {{pertaining to}} the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy <b>its</b> potential <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program,</b> describing Iran as [...] "a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination".|$|R
25|$|Prime {{minister}} Zulfikar Ali Bhutto invited Libya to join Project-706 as Libya was {{the sole}} financier of Pakistan's Project-706. Libya also hoped that by following Pakistan's Project-706, Libya could have <b>its</b> own <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>program.</b> Libya responded to the invitation by preparing and sending its small team of nuclear scientists to the Pakistan's high-powered nuclear research institutions.|$|R
50|$|In the May 2006 {{edition of}} the Weekly Standard, McGavick made the {{argument}} that Iran should be banned from the FIFA World Cup due to <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> research <b>program</b> and statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that deny the truthfulness of the holocaust (which is a criminal offense in the 2006 World Cup host country, Germany).|$|R
2500|$|Israel, {{which is}} not a party to the NPT and is widely {{believed}} to possess the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal does not believe the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate conclusion that Iran had stopped <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program</b> in 2003, insisting that it has additional evidence of an active and continued Iranian nuclear weapons program. Israel has also rejected the IAEA's November 2007 and February 2008 reports on Iran, and Israeli officials have called for the resignation of IAEA Director General ElBaradei, accusing him of being [...] "pro-Iranian". Senior Israeli, French, British, German and American officials have reportedly pressured the IAEA to release allegedly censored evidence of an Iranian nuclear weapons program. IAEA spokesman Marc Vidricaire, though, issued a brief statement on the matter, characterizing the allegations against ElBaradei as [...] "misinformation or misinterpretation" [...] which have [...] "no basis in fact".|$|E
2500|$|North Korea {{conducted}} {{its first}} nuclear weapons test in 2006, and {{is widely believed}} to have a substantial arsenal of chemical weapons, deliverable by artillery against South Korea. North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003. [...] Recently during [...] "Six-party talks" [...] North Korea agreed in principle to end <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program</b> {{as part of a}} comprehensive package of measures to normalize relationships. Diplomatic efforts at resolving the North Korean situation are complicated by the different goals and interests of the nations of the region. [...] While none of the parties desires a North Korea with nuclear weapons, Japan and South Korea are very concerned about North Korean counterstrikes in case of military action against North Korea. China and South Korea are also very worried about the economic and social consequences should this situation cause the DPRK government to collapse.|$|E
2500|$|In December, the U.S. NIE (representing the {{consensus}} view of all 16 American spy agencies) [...] "judged with high confidence" [...] that Iran had halted <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program</b> in 2003, with [...] "moderate confidence" [...] {{that the program}} remains frozen, and with [...] "moderate-to-high confidence" [...] that Iran is [...] "keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons". The estimate said that the enrichment program could still provide Iran with enough raw material to produce a nuclear weapon sometime {{by the middle of}} next decade but that intelligence agencies [...] "do not know whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons" [...] at some future date. Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader of the Senate in 2008, said he hoped the administration would [...] "appropriately adjust its rhetoric and policy". The conclusion that Iran had a nuclear weapons program in 2003 was reportedly mainly based on the contents of a laptop computer that was allegedly stolen from Iran and provided to US intelligence agencies by dissidents. The Russians dismissed this conclusion, stating that they had not seen evidence that Iran had ever pursued a nuclear weapons program.|$|E
40|$|Performer: The Institute for Science and International Security Project Lead: David Albright Project Cost: $ 100, 000 FY 15 - 16 Objective: South Africa {{abandoned}} <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>program</b> publicly in {{the early}} 1990 s. It {{is the only state}} to have relinquished its program voluntarily, making it an excellent case study from which to draw lessons. The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) has a wealth of unpublished information on the program’s disarmament and subsequent external verification. This project aims to develop lessons from South Africa’s experience that provide a potential path forward for dealing with other countries, such as North Korea and Iran, which may require similar denuclearization. In addition, the research will provide policy makers with advice on how South Africa’s case can inform international agreements and initiatives to improve U. S. and international nuclear security.

2500|$|In 2011, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (a {{think tank}} founded by [...] "a {{small group of}} visionary Americans {{committed}} to advancing U.S. interests in the Middle East") argued that the U.S.-Israel relationship is [...] "A Strategic Asset for the United States." [...] In discussing their report, Walter B. Slocombe said that while in the popular imagination, the U.S.-Israel relationship is only good for Israel, Israel provides enormous assistance to the United States, including military expertise which has saved American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] Robert D. Blackwill countered {{the claim that the}} U.S.-Israel relationship significantly damages the relationship between the United States and the Arab world. [...] He asked rhetorically: [...] "Would Saudi Arabia's policies toward the United States be markedly different in practice if Washington entered into a sustained crisis with Israel over the Palestine issue during which the bilateral relationship between the United States and Israel went into steep, systemic decline? In that instance, would Riyadh lower the price of oil? Would it stop hedging its regional bets concerning U.S. attempts to coerce Iran into freezing <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program?</b> Would it regard U.S. policy toward Afghanistan any less critically? Would it view American democracy promotion in the Middle East more favorably? Would it be more inclined to reform its internal governmental processes to be more in line with U.S. preferences? Walt [...] and I judge the answer to all these questions [...] 'No.'" [...] When asked how this report could so flatly contradict the Walt and Mearsheimer thesis, Slocombe responded, [...] "There is so much error in the world," [...] and added, [...] "I think {{it would be interesting to}} ask them whether they make the same contrary argument about the other countries to whom we also provide something like this kind of support.
