40|$|The core {{structure}} of multiply quantized vortices is theoretically investigated in fermionic superfluid near Feshbach resonance. Under population imbalance in two hyperfine spin states, the vortex core is filled {{in by the}} ``paramagnetic moment''. Here, we find the spatial oscillation of the magnetization <b>inside</b> the <b>core</b> sensitively due to the topological structure of the pairing field, {{in the range from}} the weak coupling regime to the unitary limit. This magnetization <b>inside</b> the giant <b>core</b> reveals the winding number of the vortex and directly results from the low-lying quasiparticle states bound <b>inside</b> the <b>core.</b> It is therefore proposed that the density profile experiment using phase contrast imaging can provide the spectroscopy of novel core level structures in giant vortices.

A simple, replicable porous-core system that could be aseptically divided into sections at various times was developed to follow the kinetics of microbial growth and metabolism in situ. This core system was used to study the kinetics of growth and the mode of penetration of strains of Escherichia coli through anaerobic, nutrient-saturated, fine Ottawa sand (permeability of 7. 0 microns 2 and porosity of 37 %) under static conditions. The in situ rate of growth of a wild-type, motile, chemotactic strain, RW 262, was two times slower <b>inside</b> <b>cores</b> than it was in liquid cultures. The mode of metabolism of galactose by strain RW 262 was not altered <b>inside</b> <b>cores,</b> as acetate was the only product detected either <b>inside</b> the <b>cores</b> or in liquid cultures.

The cell population moved through cores in a band-like fashion, as the front of the moving cells consisted of high cell concentrations (greater than 10 (5) cells per ml). Until the breakthrough of the cells occurred, galactose consumption and acetate production were observed only in the proximal sections of the core, showing that the cell propagation preceded the complete depletion of the substrate or the accumulation of large amounts of products.

Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a species {{known for its}} sensitivity to landscape-scale disturbance, inhabits the same low elevation sage-steppe in which much of this development is occurring. Wyoming has committed to maintain sage-grouse populations through conservation easements and policy changes that conserves high bird abundance "core" habitat and encourages development in less sensitive landscapes. In this study, we built new predictive models of oil and gas, wind, and residential development and applied build-out scenarios to simulate future development and measure the efficacy of conservation actions for maintaining sage-grouse populations. Our approach predicts sage-grouse population losses averted through conservation action and quantifies return on investment for different conservation strategies. We estimate that without conservation, sage-grouse populations in Wyoming will decrease under our long-term scenario by 14 - 29 % (95 % CI: 4 - 46 %). However, a conservation strategy that includes the "core area" policy and $ 250 million in targeted easements could reduce these losses to 9 - 15 % (95 % CI: 3 - 32 %), cutting anticipated losses by roughly half statewide and nearly two-thirds within sage-grouse core breeding areas. Core area policy {{is the single most}} important component, and targeted easements are complementary to the overall strategy. There is considerable uncertainty around the magnitude of our estimates; however, the relative benefit of different conservation scenarios remains comparable because potential biases and assumptions are consistently applied regardless of the strategy. There is early evidence based on a 40 % reduction in leased hectares <b>inside</b> <b>core</b> areas that Wyoming policy is reducing potential for future fragmentation <b>inside</b> <b>core</b> areas.

40|$|Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) occupy {{sagebrush}} (Artemisia spp.) habitats in 11 {{western states}} and 2 Canadian provinces. In September 2015, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced the listing status for sage-grouse had changed from warranted but precluded to not warranted. The primary reason cited for this change of status {{was that the}} enactment of new regulatory mechanisms was sufficient to protect sage-grouse populations. One such plan is the 2008, Wyoming Sage Grouse Executive Order (SGEO), enacted by Governor Freudenthal. The SGEO identifies "Core Areas" {{that are to be}} protected by keeping them relatively free from further energy development and limiting other forms of anthropogenic disturbances near active sage-grouse leks. Using the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's sage-grouse lek count database and the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission database of oil and gas well locations, we investigated the effectiveness of Wyoming's Core Areas, specifically: 1) how well Core Areas encompass the distribution of sage-grouse in Wyoming, 2) whether Core Area leks have a reduced probability of lek collapse, and 3) what, if any, edge effects intensification of oil and gas development adjacent to Core Areas may be having on Core Area populations. Core Areas contained 77 % of male sage-grouse attending leks and 64 % of active leks. Using Bayesian binomial probability analysis, we found an average 10. 9 % probability of lek collapse in Core Areas and an average 20. 4 % probability of lek collapse outside Core Areas. Using linear regression, we found development density outside Core Areas was related to the probability of lek collapse <b>inside</b> <b>Core</b> Areas. Specifically, probability of collapse among leks > 4. 83 km from <b>inside</b> <b>Core</b> Area boundaries was significantly related to well density within 1. 61 km (1 -mi) and 4. 83 km (3 -mi) outside of Core Area boundaries.

So far no pockmarks were known from the Pacific coast of South America between 51 °S and 55 °S. This article documents an extensive and previously unknown pockmark field in the Seno Otway (Otway Sound, 52 °S) with multibeam bathymetry and parametric echosounding as well as sediment drill cores. Up to 31 pockmarks per square kilometer occur in water depths of 50 to > 100 m in late glacial and Holocene sediments. They are up to 150 m wide and 10 m deep. Below and near the pockmarks, echosounder profiles image acoustic blanking as well as gas chimneys often crosscutting the 20 to > 30 m thick glacial sediments above the acoustic basement, in particular along fault zones. Upward-migrating gas is trapped within the sediment strata, forming dome-like features. Two 5 m long piston cores from inside and outside a typical pockmark give no evidence for gas storage within the uppermost sediments. The <b>inside</b> <b>core</b> recovered poorly sorted glacial sediment, indicating reworking and re-deposition after several explosive events.

This decompression would have led to frequent eruptions of gas trapped in reservoirs below the glacial sediments. However, the sediment fill of pockmarks formed after this event suggests recurrent events throughout the Holocene until today.

To evaluate {{the implications of these}} habitat changes and the potential umbrella resulting from a system of owl reserves on the broader avian community, we estimated occupancy of birds inside and outside of Spotted Owl Home Range Core Areas in northeastern California. We used point count data in a multi-species hierarchical Bayesian model incorporating the detection history of 81 species over a two-year time period (2005 - 2006). A small set of vegetation cover and topography covariates were included in the model to account for broad differences in habitat conditions, as well as a term identifying whether or not a site was within a Core Area.

40|$|The main {{laws that}} govern the charge {{redistribution}} in space charge dominated (SCD) beam during its transport through a periodical channel with solenoidal focusing are considered. Physical mechanisms of halo production and establishment of uniform distribution <b>inside</b> <b>core</b> for matched and mismatched beams are described. The computer codes KERN+HALO generated for redistribution process of charge density and kinetic and potential energies visual representation are described. We have a clear knowledge of matched (or ideal) beam only in case when space charge does not change a frequency of transverse oscillations. The matched (or ideal) beam is a one which transverse behavior is repeated (or has a smooth change) from one period to the next. The question "What a matched beam imply? ” is arisen when the above definition is extended on the case when space charges essential for transverse oscillation frequency. We can denote that ideal beam has well-known K-V distribution and this distribution must be used for focusing field calculation and for a choice of bore radius. But real beam distributions differ from K-V one and its redistribution during beam transport leads to beam size and emittance growths. It means that such ideal beam definition results in an serious error of bore radius. The SCD-beam investigations in channel with different initial beam transverse distributions were made by authors in order to answer on the above question. A simple model must be chosen for better understanding of process of SCD-beam redistribution. It can be a continuous cylindrical beam transporting in longitudinal magnetic field. In this case a Coulomb force calculation is very much simplified.
