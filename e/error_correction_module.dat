In this thesis a Reed-Solomon encoder and decoder have been implemented. The implementations have been synthesized using a 45 nm technology library and power estimations have been performed. To find the most energy efficient implementation, several implementation techniques were evaluated. The implemented system is a 5 -bit, RS(31, 27) code. For a Reed- Solomon encoder with low activity, the energy consumption can be reduced by over 40 % with the use of clock gating. Several different Reed-Solomon decoder configurations were implemented and synthesized. When comparing the energy consumption of the different configurations, a configuration with two-parallel syn- drome cells and pipelined Chien search, Forney and <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>module</b> were found to be the most energy efficient.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} {{applications}} of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) is unique key generation. While the advantages of PUFbased key extraction and embedding have been shown in several papers, physical attacks on it have gained only little interest until now. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of a differential power analysis attack on the <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> <b>module</b> of a secure sketch. This attack can also be applied to code-offset fuzzy extractors because they build upon secure sketches. We propose a codeword masking scheme to protect key generation algorithms used for PUFs. Our proposed countermeasure enables masking of linear Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) without impact on their error correction capabilities while keeping the overhead low. This is achieved by random masking codewords, which can be efficiently generated by the ECC’s encoding function. Further, it allows to consistently protect the PUF-based key generation process and can provide the masked key and its mask to a subsequent crypto module which implements masking as well. We demonstrate the practical protection of our codeword masking scheme by attacking a masked secure sketch implementation. We emphasize that, besides protecting code-offset algorithms, the proposed masking scheme can also be applied to index-based syndrome coding and other security-critical error correction modules...|$|E

One of the prominent functionalities of the proposed HNG gate is that it can work singly as a reversible full adder unit. The proposed reversible full adder contains only one gate. We show that its hardware complexity is less than the existing reversible full adders. The proposed full adder is then applied to the design of a reversible 4 -bit parallel adder.

The decisive combination was used to evaluate the accuracy of the system by plotting bit-error curves against an equivalent floating-point model. System efficiency is employed from the design stage through the use of Look-Up tables as well as cyclic shift registers. Upon implementation, the system is built using settings optimized for speed. In addition, memory management is used to ensure that critical instructions are kept on the fast on-chip memory while different access times for retrieving data on external memory were evaluated for best results. Finally, each software module is profiled to investigate and remove unnecessary latency issues. Processing efficiency is monitored by recording throughput results, which are used to calculate maximum bit-rates. Using these results, estimations are made for bit-rates achievable by higher performance processors.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{quality of service}} (QoS) {{provision}} in wireless IP networks. QoS provision is particularly challenging in wireless networks, where network resources are generally limited, variable over time and shared. In the design of possible measures to assure QoS one should consider that standardization is well established for the network layer Internet Protocol and for many underlying technologies of frequent use (e. g. IEEE 802. 11, BLUETOOTH or HIPERLAN II). Therefore, as far as research on QoS is concerned, there is little room in both the IP and the link-layers for improved IP over wireless interfaces. In this paper we illustrate a solution in which an intermediate Wireless Adaptation Layer (WAL) is transparently interposed between the IP layer and specific link-layer technologies {{as a solution to}} provide QoS. The WAL addresses two main issues: (i) compensation for channel impairments in different platforms in order to enhance wireless channel reliability and (ii) implementation of traffic control and packet scheduling mechanisms to satisfy bandwidth and delay requirements, as well as to enforce a general principle of fairness among the IP associations contending for network resources and achieve optimal exploitation of transmission capacity. The WAL consists of a set of modules, each one in charge of a specific task, which can be enabled or disabled depending on the specific network environment. The novelty of the WAL approach is its capability of adapting itself to different wireless interfaces selecting performance enhancing modules for specific networks. This requires to modify the standard TCP/IP protocol stack by introducing an intermediate layer between the IP layer and the Data Link layer, with performance enhancement purposes. This paper focuses on two modules in particular, namely a traffic control module, which is in charge of performing congestion control and channel state dependent scheduling (CSD) packet scheduling, and a forward <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> (FEC) <b>module,</b> which compensates for channel impairments.
