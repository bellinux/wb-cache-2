30|$|Most {{previous}} studies used knit fabrics {{to compare the}} performance of conventional and HE washers (Ankeny et al. 2014; Klausing et al. 2012). Schlag and Ordonez (2010) used both knit and woven fabrics {{and found that the}} differences between the two types of washers were mostly in the woven fabric. Therefore, in the current study, an 100 % cotton, plain weave, black fabric was used as the test fabric. Dark color fabrics are more vulnerable to the problem of fading than light color fabrics during the laundering process (Fergusson 2008); therefore, a black test fabric was selected to examine the color change after washing (color fastness to washing). The fabric weight was 112.15  g/m 2, which was measured according to ASTM D 3776 /D 3776 M- 09 a (2013): Standard Test Method for Mass per Unit Area (Weight) of Fabric.

40|$|Rolled, {{continuous}} stationary phases {{were constructed}} by tightly rolling and packing a whole piece of textile woven fabric into a chromatography column. Columns packed {{in this manner}} possess important features such as low intraparticle mass transfer and high pressure endurance. These properties, as reflected by a reduction of residence time within a column, show promise in decreasing protein purification costs for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. This technique, once commercialized, will create a new value-added market for textile fabrics. The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate the capabilities of rolled, continuous stationary phase columns in size exclusion chromatography (SEC) separation, ion exchange chromatography (IEC) separation, and pore characterization of cellulase enzyme treated cotton. ^ SEC stationary phase columns were prepared from ten cotton-based fabrics with different yarn diameter, <b>fabric</b> <b>count,</b> fabric compressibility, fabric weave, and/or different chemical treatment(s). The optimal packing parameter with respect to column mass was identified to be 7. 5 – 8 grams for a column with the dimension 180 mm by 10 mm, length by inner diameter. Evaluation of resolution, plate height, and void fraction of the packed column revealed the general requirements of a good SEC separation for a fabric to be large yarns, a small <b>fabric</b> <b>count,</b> and a plain weave with napping. A complete separation of protein from salt was achieved {{on a series of}} cotton flannel stationary phases that were 510 mm long and 10 mm in diameter. Cotton flannel anion exchangers with a static protein capacity of 45 mg/g were prepared from a quaternary ammonium 3 -chloro- 2 -hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride (CHPTAC) with a repeated padding method. Columns packed with CHPTAC derivatized cotton flannel completely resolved BSA and lysozyme. A complete separation of BSA from lysozyme on a scoured cotton flannel column suggested that at pH 8. 0, the fabric is negatively charged on the surface. With the rolled, continuous stationary phase technique, pore volume and surface area of cellulase enzyme treated cotton were characterized. No increase in pore volume or surface area was observed after enzyme hydrolysis, which agrees with the non-increasing dye uptake of enzyme treated fabric. ...|$|E

It is also intended to produce Eco-friendly antimicrobial cotton fabric from Aloe Vera gel extract and to protect the consumer from micro-organisms contamination. Qualitative analysis is carried out to measure the antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (S. aureus, B. subtilis, B. pumilus) and Gram-negative (Pseudo, Candida, E. coli) bacteria. And then, the physical textile properties of treated and untreated cotton fabrics such as sample width, fabric weight, fabric thickness, <b>fabric</b> <b>count,</b> yarn number, absorbency, abrasion, crease recovery, fabric stiffness and strength are analysed. The results show that the antimicrobial activity of Aloe Vera gel treated fabric is excellent for Pseudo and E-coli, good for B. subtilis and B. pumilus bacteria.

Vascular grafts based on permeable textile structures are now a widely accepted technology. The performance of the graft is largely dependent on the ability to allow controlled blood to flow through its thickness, yet predicting this flow rate is still not widely understood. An analytical model is in development based on fabric construction parameters, with the aim being to predict the permeability of a porous textile substrate with specific application to vascular graft materials. To verify the model, novel testing equipment is in place to evaluate air and fluid permeabilies of specially designed fabrics with varying constructions. Background Historically, porosity and permeability have been interchanged when describing textile fabrics. Apparel permeability is most frequently measured by controlled air flow through fabric.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the behavior}} to creasing of some woven materials made from yarns type wool used for ready-made clothes. Factors like fibrous composition, properties of constituent fibers, wovens structure parameters, mechanical properties of {{warp and weft}} yarns and finishing treatments that influenced the recovery capacity from crease/folding were investigated experimentally through several tests which revealed their importance in the process. The creasing of woven materials made from combed yarns type wool used for ready-clothes is an undesired deformation effect with temporary or permanent character, which {{is caused by a}} composed strain of bending and compression during utilization, processing or maintenance. It is manifested by the appearance of wrinkles, folds or stripes on the surface of wovens materials, thus diminishing their qualitative appearance and also their practical value. Creasing is the result of irreversible changes created through the reciprocal sliding of structural fiber components when exposed to a bending strain. Creasing is specific to oriented structures with high crystallinity (cellulosic fibers). The sliding appears because of hydrogen bond breaking which can, however, reform easy in other positions conferring a permanent character to creasing.

5000|$|Cross-stitch {{is a form}} of sewing and {{a popular}} form of counted-thread {{embroidery}} in which X-shaped stitches in a tiled, raster-like pattern are used to form a picture. The stitcher counts the threads on a piece of evenweave fabric (such as linen) in each direction so that the stitches are of uniform size and appearance. This form of cross-stitch is also called counted cross-stitch in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch. Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric (stamped cross-stitch); the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern. Cross-stitch is also executed on easily countable fabric called aida cloth but the threads are not actually counted.Fabrics used in cross-stitch include linen, aida, and mixed-content fabrics called 'evenweave' such as jobelan. All cross stitch fabrics are technically [...] "evenweave" [...] as the term refers {{to the fact that the}} fabric is woven to make sure that there are the same number of threads in an inch both left to right and top to bottom (vertically and horizontally). Fabrics are categorized by threads per inch (referred to as 'count'), which can range from 11 to 40 <b>count.</b> Aida <b>fabric</b> has a lower count because it is made with two threads grouped together for ease of stitching. Cross stitch projects are worked from a gridded pattern and can be used on any <b>count</b> <b>fabric,</b> the <b>count</b> of the <b>fabric</b> determines the size of the finished stitching if the stitchers counts and stitches over 2 threads.

We studied changes in blood coagulation and the fibrinolytic system in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection after stent-grafting to examine risk for consumption coagulopathy. Methods: Thirty-one thoracic aortic aneurysms were treated with stent-grafting (aneurysm group), and 29 aortic dissections were treated with entry closure with stent-grafting (dissection group). The stent-graft was constructed from a self-expanding Z stent and thin-walled woven polyester <b>fabric.</b> Platelet <b>count,</b> fibrinogen, antithrombin III (AT III), and thrombin-AT III complex were assayed as markers of coagulation. Plasminogen, α 2 -plasmin inhibitor, α 2 -plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex, fibrin degradation products fragment E (FDP-E), and fibrin degradation products d-dimer were monitored as markers of fibrinolysis. Blood samples were collected before surgery and on postoperative days 1, 3, 7, and 14. Results: In both groups platelet count significantly decreased on postoperative days 1 and 3, and increased on postoperative day 14. AT III significantly decreased on postoperative day 1, but recovered after postoperative day 7. FDP-E significantly increased on postoperative day 1 in both groups. There was significant correlation of aneurysm diameter with α 2 -plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex, fibrin degradation products, and d-dimer in the dissection group on postoperative day 1. Conclusions: Activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis was observed after stent-grafting to treat thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{extent and}} timing of ice {{advances}} onto the north and southwest Iceland shelf is reconstructed by identifying the depositional environment of four diamicton units present in two marine cores from shelf troughs. We analyze a combination of properties, including sedimentological parameters, microfabric analyses, radiocarbon dates, and foraminiferal assemblage data. This multi-proxy approach for understanding depositional environments of diamicton units is critical in areas where ice sheets extended into the marine environment. The two cores studied contain a lower diamicton unit that is interpreted as subglacial till and an overlying diamicton unit that is interpreted as glacial-marine sediment. Our analysis showed that in general, till is classified by lower water content, lower total organic carbon, and coarser grain size than glacial-marine sediment. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility shows that the till has a sheared fabric, low inclination of the short (K 3) axis, whereas the glacial-marine sediment has a high inclination of the short (K 3) axis and a more random, unsheared <b>fabric.</b> Grain <b>counts</b> on the 106 – 1000 mm fraction in till contain {{a higher percentage of}} basalt, whereas the glacial-marine sediments contain a higher percentage of quartz, volcanic glass, and foraminifera.
