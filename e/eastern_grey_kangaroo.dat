25|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo</b> (Macropus giganteus) is less {{well-known}} {{than the}} red (outside Australia), {{but the most}} often seen, as its range covers the fertile {{eastern part of the}} country. The range of the <b>eastern</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo</b> extends {{from the top of the}} Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland down to Victoria, as well as areas of south-eastern Australia and Tasmania. Population densities of eastern grey kangaroos usually peak near 100 per km2 in suitable habitats of open woodlands. Populations are more limited in areas of land clearance, such as farmland, where forest and woodland habitats are limited in size or abundance.|$|E
25|$|The tall ancient manna gum forests near Whitefriars College {{are home}} to ducks (who nest {{on the tops of}} old stags) crimson rosellas, galahs and other parrots (who nest in old hollows), rare large {{powerful}} owls and rainbow lorikeets. Pied cormorants and night herons cruise the creek pools. Rakali and the occasional platypus, fish for galaxias, gudgeon and yabbies. There are signs of wombat diggings on the hill face but they are rarely seen. The occasional swamp wallaby and <b>eastern</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo</b> visit the gorge. In warm weather skinks, blue tongue lizards and copperhead snakes can be seen. Other rarely seen species include marbled geckos and white-lipped snakes.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroos have single-chambered stomachs quite {{unlike those}} of cattle and sheep. They {{sometimes}} regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then swallow it again for final digestion, {{but this is}} a different, and more strenuous, activity than it is in ruminants, and does not take place as frequently. Different species of kangaroos have different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The <b>eastern</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo</b> is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses, whereas some other species (e.g. the red kangaroo) include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi. Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular, usually spending the days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding.|$|E

2500|$|The {{kangaroo}} is a marsupial {{from the}} family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning [...] "large foot"). In common use the term is {{used to describe the}} largest species from this family, especially those of the genus Macropus: the red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, <b>eastern</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo,</b> and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia. The Australian government estimates that 34.3 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2011, up from 25.1 million one year earlier.|$|E
2500|$|... 128 birds, 39 reptiles, 32 mammals, 23 frog, 5 fish, 2 crayfish, 1 shrimp, 1 {{freshwater}} mussel and 273 invertebrate {{species have been}} recorded in the park. Of these fauna, 23 vertebrate species are listed as threatened. Other species considered rare either generally or within the region are platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), dusky antechinus (Antechinus swainsonii), greater glider (Petaurus breviceps), wombat (Vombatus ursinus), <b>eastern</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo</b> (Macropus giganteus), wallaroo (Macropus robustus), red-necked pademelon (Thylogale thetis), red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). The largest population of koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) in southern Sydney are found in Wedderburn, which is located {{in and around the}} park. Their breeding habitat runs along the creek lines of the Oâ€™Hares Creek and Georges River starting from the Stokes creek junction to north of Kentlyn. Koalas are endangered, and their population is in decline. The eastern pygmy possum, found in the park, is listed as vulnerable. There are also some regionally significant frog and reptile populations found in the park, including the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus) and the great barred frog (Mixophyes fasciolatus). The broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) and the red-crowned toadlet (Pseudophryne australis) inhabit exfoliated rock on the sandstone plateaus. This is a habitat that has been dramatically degraded and fragmented in other Sydney regions but which is relatively undisturbed within the park. Bushrock collection, usually for garden use, {{is considered to be a}} key threatening process for the snake and toadlet as they use the rocks for shelter. There are non-native fauna species found within the protected area include feral cats and dogs, rabbits, foxes, black rat, deer and mosquito fish.|$|E

50|$|Western grey {{kangaroo}} {{is closely}} related to <b>eastern</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo</b> (M. giganteus), and their distribution overlaps extensively, especially in the Murray-Darling basin. However, the two species interbreed only rarely in the wild. Although hybridisation occurs in both directions in the overlap zone between the two species in the wild, this {{does not seem to be}} the case with captive animals. Although interbreeding between the two species does occasionally occur in captive animals, viable offspring are only produced when the mating pair consists of a female <b>eastern</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo</b> and a male western grey kangaroo. This is an example of unidirectional hybridisation.|$|E
