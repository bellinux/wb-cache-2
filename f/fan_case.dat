50|$|Standard axial <b>case</b> <b>fans</b> are 80, 92, 120, 140, 200 and 230 mm {{in width}} and length.

Decorative fans and accessories are popular with case modders. Air filters are often used over intake fans, to prevent dust from entering the case and clogging up the internal components. Heatsinks are especially vulnerable to being clogged up, as the insulating effect of the dust will rapidly degrade the heatsink's ability to dissipate heat.|$|R
40|$|In the {{development}} of advanced aircraft-engine <b>fan</b> <b>cases</b> and containment systems, composite materials are beginning to {{be used due to}} their low weight and high strength. The design of these structures must include the capability of withstanding impact loads from a released fan blade. Relatively complex triaxially braided fiber architectures have been found to yield the best performance for the <b>fan</b> <b>cases.</b> To properly work with and design these structures, robust analytical tools are required {{that can be used in}} the design process. A new analytical approach models triaxially braided carbon fiber composite materials within the environment of a transient dynamic finite-element code, specifically the commercially available transient dynamic finite-element code LS-DYNA. The geometry of the braided composites is approximated by a series of parallel laminated composites. The composite is modeled by using shell finite elements. The material property data are computed by examining test data from static tests on braided composites, where optical strain measurement techniques are used to examine the local strain variations within the material. These local strain data from the braided composite tests are used along with a judicious application of composite micromechanics- based methods to compute the stiffness properties of an equivalent unidirectional laminated composite required for the shell elements. The local strain data from the braided composite tests are also applied to back out strength and failure properties of the equivalent unidirectional composite. The properties utilized are geared towards the application of a continuum damage mechanics-based composite constitutive model available within LS-DYNA. The developed model can be applied to conduct impact simulations of structures composed of triaxially braided composites. The advantage of this technology is that it facilitates the analysis of the deformation and damage response of a triaxially braided polymer matrix composite within the environment of a transient dynamic finite-element code such as LS-DYNA in a manner which accounts for the local physical mechanisms but is still computationally efficient. This methodology is tightly coupled to experimental tests on the braided composite, which ensures that the material properties have physical significance. Aerospace or automotive companies interested in using triaxially braided composites in their structures, particularly for impact or crash applications, would find the technology useful. By {{the development}} of improved design tools, the amount of very expensive impact testing that will need to be performed can be significantly reduced...|$|R

The report explained that [...] "pieces of the failed rotor arm cut through the engine's <b>fan</b> <b>case,</b> the engine bay, an internal fuel tank, and hydraulic and fuel lines before exiting through the aircraft's upper fuselage". Pratt and Whitney, the engine manufacturers, developed two remedies to the problem.

5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} the probable {{cause of this}} accident was {{the disintegration of the}} No. 3 engine fan assembly {{as a result of an}} interaction between the fan blade tips and the <b>fan</b> <b>case.</b> According to the NTSB, [...] "the precise reason or reasons for the acceleration and the onset of the destructive vibration could not be determined conclusively," [...] but enough was learned to prevent the occurrence of similar events. The speed of the engine at the time of the accident caused a resonance wave to occur in the fan assembly when the tips of the fan blades began to make contact with the surrounding shroud. The engine was designed to have a rearward blade retaining force of 18,000 pounds to prevent the blades from moving forward in their mountings slots and subsequently departing the fan disk. The rearward force was not enough. As a result of this accident, GE re-designed the engine so that the blade retaining capability was increased to 60,000 pounds, and that change was incorporated into all engines already in service.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the high-velocity impact response and damage {{evolution of the}} triaxial braided composite <b>fan</b> <b>case,</b> a series of ballistic impact tests using blade-like projectiles were conducted.

In addition, satin woven composites were tested for comparison with respect to failure modes and damage shape. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} main failure modes for the two different fiber reinforcement architectures are similar, that is, fiber shear failure and matrix crush failure in the impact surface and fiber tensile failure, fiber pull-out, matrix cracking, and delamination in the exit surface. The damage area in the exit surface is diamond-shaped for satin woven composites while rounded or elliptic for triaxial braided composites according to projectile geometry. The triaxial braided composites have an improved ballistic resistance and higher ballistic limit than satin woven composites.
