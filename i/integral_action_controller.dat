The model, programmed in Matlab, is based on transfer functions with a decoupled (two single input single output systems) independent proportional and <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> <b>controller</b> that allows setting the desired engine speed and torque under stationary operation conditions. It was implemented in a Freescale HC 08 family microcontroller external to the PC {{in order to avoid the}} risk of losing control during undesirable communication delays on the computer. The model has been validated in a wide range of engine operating modes, from low to high speeds and loads showing a good response. The first order transfer functions with delay have proven to be a good approximation even during the nonlinearities caused by turbocharger and electronic control unit incorporated in the engines.

This paper addresses a new method {{that allows us to}} add <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> also on system variables having relative degree higher than one, while still preserving the Hamiltonian form and, thus, closed loop stability. The new approach is applied to design speed regulation controllers for the permanent magnet synchronous motor.

This theoretically predicted control system performance is illustrated via simulation experiments, which also show that the properties hold under parameter uncertainties. This is in line with the usual practice of including <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> in a <b>controller</b> with the aim of improving its closed loop robustness.

40|$|A minimum-variance control {{problem is}} defined that {{involves}} the minimisation of the integral of estimation error. This introduces <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> into the <b>controller.</b> It is believed that the resulting solution is more valuable for closed-loop performance assessment and benchmarking, than the usual minimum-variance results. This is because most industrial controllers need to have <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> and hence the proposed benchmark, {{which is based on}} a controller that includes an integrator, will often be more appropriate. The advantage over many other benchmarking methods lies in the simplicity of the results. The situation where the controller structure has a limited, or restricted structure, is also considered. That is, a method is presented where the controller structure may be prespecified, and the coefficients obtained by direct parameter optimisation. This provides a more direct basis for comparison with controllers implemented in existing plants, that may only include, say PID, restricted structures...|$|R

Due to the decoupling character of PLS, these controllers are running separately, which is suitable for distributed control framework. In addition, the increment of inner model output is considered in the cost function of MPC, which involves <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> in the <b>controller.</b> Hence, the offset free tracking performance is guaranteed.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} practical {{aspects of}} {{the application of the}} backstepping method to the control of industrial processes. The limitations are emphased and solutions are proposed. The steady-state performances of the backstepping-based controllers are enhanced via the introduction of an <b>integral</b> <b>action</b> in the <b>controller.</b> In presence of non-zero mean perturbations, this modification guarantees vanishing residual errors. The manipulated variable behavior is also improved by the introduction of a new Lyapunov-based filter. In noisy contexts, the later ensures a small variance of the control, without altering the closed-loop stability. Finally, it is shown that an appropriate time scale selection is needed to obtain the desired closed-loop dynamics specification. The proposed scheme is applied to the control of a flotation column. 1 INTRODUCTION Recent years have witnessed a rapid emergence of new methodologies for feedback control of nonlinear systems.

The penalty on sensor induced positioning noise is minimal. A unique benefit of the proposed control scheme is the performance and stability robustness with respect to variations in resonance frequency. This is demonstrated experimentally by a change in resonance frequency from 934 to 140 Hz. This change does not compromise stability or significantly degrade performance. For the scanning probe microscope considered in this paper, the noise is marginally increased from 0. 30 to 0. 39 nm rms. Open- and closed-loop experimental images of a calibration standard are reported at speeds of 1, 10, and 31 lines per second (with a scanner resonance frequency of 290 Hz). Compared with traditional integral controllers, the proposed controller provides a bandwidth improvement of greater than 10 times. This allows faster imaging and less tracking lag at low speeds.
