5|$|The {{fact that}} a person prepares a weapon in order to defend {{themselves}} against expected attack does not preclude the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, {{it may not be}} expected from a defender to wait and rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. The defender may use proportionate accessible means in order to prevent an imminent attack and <b>disarm</b> <b>the</b> attacker.|$|E

5|$|Citizens {{reported}} to Virgil on the Cowboys' movements and their threats {{told him that}} Ike and Tom had left their livery stable and entered town while armed, {{in violation of the}} city ordinance. Virgil Earp was told by several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street. Virgil decided he had to <b>disarm</b> <b>the</b> Cowboys. His decision to take action may have been influenced by the Cowboy's repeated threats to the Earps, their proximity to Holliday's room in Fly's boarding house, and their location on the route the Earps usually took to their homes two blocks further west on Fremont Street.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the {{government}} was involved in launching Gutt's monetary reform plan {{as well as the}} disarming of the resistance as part of the transition to stability. A major crisis emerged within {{the government}} over the refusal of the Front de l'Indépendance (FI-OF) and the Partisans Armés (PA), two large left-wing resistance groups, to disband and disarm. Pierlot, suspicious of the FI's motivatives, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from the government, and the party began agitating against it. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'état, parliament voted through emergency powers allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly <b>disarm</b> <b>the</b> resistance though sporadic strikes continued. The government also voted through important social security reforms.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} events, 91 revolutionaries {{were sentenced to}} exile. Of these, a small group was transported by barges from Giurgiu, {{on their way to}} the Austrian-ruled Svinița, near the Danube port of Orschowa. The revolutionary artist Constantin Daniel Rosenthal and Maria Rosetti, both of whom had been allowed to go free and had {{subsequently}} followed the barges on shore, pointed out that the Ottomans had stepped out of their jurisdiction, and were able to persuade the mayor of Svinița to <b>disarm</b> <b>the</b> guards, which in turn allowed the prisoners to flee.

5|$|In 1991, the United States {{initiated}} Operation Provide Relief (UNOSOM I) {{which was}} part of a United Nations (UN) endorsed effort called The Unified Task Force (UNITAF), to provide humanitarian relief. In August 1992, President George H. Bush sent, 25,000 US troops (mostly US Marines from I MEF) to the Republic of Somalia and the mission was renamed Operation Restore Hope, also known as UNOSOM II. Its main objectives were to provide humanitarian relief, initiate 'nation building', <b>disarm</b> <b>the</b> various factions, restore law and order, help the people set up a representative government, and restore the infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|On April 14, 1775, Gage {{received}} {{instructions from}} Secretary of State William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth, to <b>disarm</b> <b>the</b> rebels and to imprison the rebellion's leaders, but Dartmouth gave Gage considerable discretion in his commands. Gage's decision to act promptly {{may have been}} influenced by information he received on April 15, from a spy within the Provincial Congress, telling him that although the Congress was still divided on the need for armed resistance, delegates were being sent to the other New England colonies to see if they would cooperate in raising a New England army of 18,000 colonial soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{turn left}} towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, {{at the head}} of the advance guard, decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the {{companies}} onto the Common itself, in a confused effort to surround and <b>disarm</b> <b>the</b> militia. Major Pitcairn arrived from the rear of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them. The remaining companies under Colonel Smith lay further down the road toward Boston.|$|E

5|$|The Earps {{hired an}} {{experienced}} trial lawyer, Thomas Fitch, as defense counsel. Wyatt {{testified that he}} drew his gun only after Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury went for their pistols. He detailed the Earps' previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys and explained that they intended to <b>disarm</b> <b>the</b> cowboys. He said they fired in self defense. Fitch managed to produce testimony from prosecution witnesses during cross-examination that was contradictory, or appeared to dodge his questions, or in which they {{said they could not}} remember.|$|E
5|$|The bombing had {{destroyed}} the north {{wing of the}} school. During the search, rescuers found an additional 500pounds (230kg) of dynamite which had failed to detonate in the south wing. The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to <b>disarm</b> <b>the</b> devices, and they found an alarm clock timed to go off at 8:45a.m. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion may have caused a short circuit in {{the second set of}} bombs, preventing them from detonating. They searched the building and then returned to the recovery work.|$|E
5|$|After the {{division}} arrived in England, Ernest Down was posted to India {{to oversee the}} formation of the 44th Indian Airborne Division, and was replaced by Major General Roy Urquhart. In September 1944, for Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands, the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade was attached to {{the division}}. Following Market Garden, fewer than 2,200 men from the 10,000 that were sent to the Netherlands returned to the British lines. Having suffered such severe casualties, the 4th Parachute Brigade was disbanded, with its surviving men being posted to the 1st Parachute Brigade. The division then went through a period of reorganisation, but had still not fully recovered {{by the end of the}} war, due to the acute shortage of manpower throughout the British Army in 1944-1945. Still under strength in May 1945, it was sent to Norway to <b>disarm</b> <b>the</b> German army of occupation; returning to Britain in November 1945 where the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded.|$|E

5|$|Allied forces sent to <b>disarm</b> <b>the</b> Japanese and {{repatriate}} {{prisoners of}} war arrived in Indonesia in September 1945. In Semarang, {{this led to a}} conflict between Japanese forces and Indonesian rebels, that began on 15October; the Indonesians aimed to confiscate the Japanese weapons. Allied forces began landing in the city on 20October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata. Concerned with civilian suffering, the vicar apostolic told the Allies that they must stop the battle; the Allies could not comply as they did not know the Japanese commander. Soegijapranata then contacted the Japanese and, that afternoon, brokered a cease-fire agreement in his office at Gedangan, despite Indonesian forces' firing at the Gurkha soldiers posted in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|Another probe {{was made}} {{early on the}} morning of 28 March on the {{positions}} of the Australian 5th Field Battery, whose eight guns were located east of Toko, on {{the west bank of the}} Puriata river from where they could provide defensive fires in support of the 25th Infantry Battalion's main positions on the knoll. Shortly before dawn one of the booby traps that the Australians had set around their perimeter to provide early warning was set off and one of the sentries opened fire upon what he believed to be a Japanese probe. A short time later, a small section of Japanese stumbled into one of the forward positions and fire was exchanged. Later, as a team was sent out to <b>disarm</b> <b>the</b> remaining booby traps, this team was fired upon and sporadic fighting continued until midday.|$|E
