5|$|Wittgenstein {{believed}} that religion <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> {{it offers a}} particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore {{believed that}} religious language is confessional– a confession of what someone feels and believes– rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} and readers {{have criticized the}} book for what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, {{especially with regard to}} the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) {{played a major role in}} permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Bantam Books {{published}} a movie tie-in novelization written by Mike McQuay that adopts a lean, humorous style {{reminiscent of the}} film. The novel <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> it includes scenes that were {{cut out of the}} film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel provides motivation and backstory to Snake and Hauk— both disillusioned war veterans— deepening their relationship that was only hinted at it in the film. The novel explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for Leningrad in World War III, how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazy son who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel fleshes out the world that these characters exist in, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. The book explains that the West Coast is a no-man's land, and the country's population is gradually being driven crazy by nerve gas as a result of World War III.|$|E

5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began on May 1, 1979 at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Gold Star Studios had become famous through its history with artists like Eddie Cochran and the Beach Boys. At the Ramones' request, Ed Stasium {{helped with the}} album's engineering. During the studio work, Spector's recording methods were different from those the Ramones were accustomed to from their four previous studio albums. The band recorded their earlier compositions in the shortest time possible for the lowest feasible budget, with a relatively low production value. With End of the Century, the band experienced Spector's infamous perfectionism, and a budget of $200,000 to fully record and produce the album. This <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> the band's debut album cost $6,400 total, and their second album cost $10,000. End of the Century {{is the most expensive}} album in the Ramones' career.|$|E

25|$|Meaning-making through {{spirituality and}} religiosity <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> it helps {{individuals}} {{cope with their}} loss, as well as develop their own spiritual or religious beliefs.

25|$|The Beverly Shores/Century of Progress Architectural District <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> it {{encompasses}} houses {{from the}} 1933–34 Chicago Century of Progress Exposition that comprised {{a portion of}} the Home and Industrial Arts Group.

25|$|The altarpiece {{which stands}} out {{most is that}} of the chancel, created by the Monchique master-carver Custódio de Mesquita under a 1709 contract.

25|$|The {{availability}} of the NX bit on 32-bit x86 kernels, which may run on both 32-bit x86 CPUs and 64-bit IA-32-compatible CPUs, <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> a 32-bit x86 kernel would not normally expect the NX bit that an AMD64 or IA-64 supplies; the NX enabler patch assures that these kernels will attempt to use the NX bit if present.|$|E
25|$|The {{coastline}} around Tintagel <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> it {{is composed}} of old Devonian slate; about a mile southwards from Tintagel towards Treknow the coastline was quarried extensively for this hard-wearing roofing surface. Quarries inland at Trebarwith and Trevillet continued to be worked until the mid-20th century. Apart from the island headlands on the coast include Willapark and Start Point.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia {{has been}} {{detected}} in the Draco Nebula and in one or possibly two molecular clouds, which {{are associated with the}} high-latitude galactic infrared cirrus.

25|$|The {{historian}} Timaeus {{was born}} in Sicily but {{spent most of his}} life in Athens. His History, though lost, <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> of its influence on Polybius.

Timaeus also wrote the Olympionikai, a valuable chronological study of the Olympic Games.|$|E
25|$|Recordings of the djembe far {{surpass the}} number of {{recordings}} of any other African drum. Beginning in the late 1980s, a slew of djembe-centric recordings was released, a trend that, as of 2014, {{shows no sign of}} abating. This <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> these recordings are driven by the demand of western audiences: there are almost no djembe recordings within African markets.|$|E
25|$|In July 2003, the {{hierarchy}} of the Catholic Church in Canada protested the Chrétien government's plans to include same-sex couples in civil marriage. This <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> Catholicism has a larger number of adherents in Canada than any other religion or denomination, with 43.6% of the population identifying themselves as Catholic. The church criticisms were accompanied by Vatican claims that Catholic politicians should vote according to their personal beliefs rather than the policy of the government.|$|E

25|$|The House at 902 Selden Road is low, -story, gable-roofed, early 20th-century house.

The house <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> if its fine architectural quality and state of preservation.|$|E
25|$|As {{a border}} town {{situated}} at the Bosnian-Serb Drina river, Zvornik was of great strategic importance. It <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia are linked at that point not only through a road bridge between the Zvornik urban area and the Karakaj industrial zone, and another one in Zvornik itself, but also via a railroad bridge between Karakaj {{and the town of}} Čelopek. It represents an important link along the Belgrade-Sarajevo line, as well as within the Belgrade-Tuzla line.|$|E
25|$|Besides being {{a classic}} example of early forest dwellers in west Africa, Kintampo <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> there is {{evidence}} of a drastic change in food production techniques due to the transition from nomadic hunter-gather lifestyles to life in stationary settlements. This change is known as sedentism and is typical of societies who have access to, or are developing systems of agriculture. Ceramic sculptures of humans and animals indicate that the Kintampo settlements were lived at by practitioners of both pastoralism and horticulture.|$|E
25|$|Both {{publications}} {{are silent}} on Birca's size, layout and appearance. Based on Rimbert's account, Birca <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>because</b> {{it had a}} port {{and it was the}} place for the regional ting. Adam only mentions the port, but otherwise Birca seems to have <b>been</b> <b>significant</b> to him <b>because</b> it had been the bridgehead of Ansgar's Christian mission and because archbishop Unni had been buried there.|$|R
