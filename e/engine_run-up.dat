40|$|Efficient {{analysis}} methods for predicting the vibro-acoustic behavior of vessels are important, {{especially during the}} early design stages. A prediction software tool can help to identify critical points in the ship design and to avoid costly rework subsequent to sea trials. Therefore, an approach based on numerical system-level simulation, to estimate noise, vibration and harshness performance during {{each step of the}} design process is proposed. This paper is focused on the development of numerical models of main excitation sources on board. Parametric excitation models for main engines and pumps as well as structural models for power trains and foundations are built up. The sources introduce excitation forces into the foundations or torsional moments into the power train. The overall simulation model is built up modular and contains structural submodels as well as excitation submodels. System-level simulations using Matlab/Simulink are performed and both stationary operational conditions and transient excitations, e. g. <b>engine</b> <b>run-ups</b> and misfiring, are simulated. The numerical results are presented and the accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing numerical and experimental data...|$|R

5000|$|The Jetstream 31s {{were divided}} into two groups based on design features: 6 Jetstreams were {{equipped}} with Garrett turboprops with Automatic Power Reserve (which came from JetStream International, a USAir commuter. These were the ones with tail numbers N8xxJS), and the remaining 4 Jetstreams were equipped with Garrett turboprops with water-methanol injection. After Amtran's acquisition of Chicago Express in 1999, the Jetstreams were [...] "retired" [...] and most found homes with other (mostly corporate) operators. One aircraft was written-off during an <b>engine</b> <b>run-up</b> immediately prior to its resale to another operator when one propeller struck a ground power unit.|$|E
5000|$|A second former C-54 {{equipped}} with a large double cargo door used to accommodate the loading of freight on pallets, was employed for all shots of the damaged airliner {{on the ground at}} San Francisco in the film's closing sequences. A propellerless, fire-scorched engine on a distorted mount with a 30° [...] "droop" [...] was installed on the left wing of this aircraft to represent the damage which had imperiled the flight. Exterior airport scenes were filmed at the Glendale Grand Central Air Terminal, east of Burbank, California, where an outdoor movie set was constructed to replicate the terminal gates at SFO in the early 1950s. Additional exteriors shots were taken at Oakland International Airport, including all boarding, <b>engine</b> <b>run-up,</b> taxiing and takeoff scenes used in the opening sequences. The external night and damaged in-flight sequences were filmed in a studio where a large-scale miniature was photographed against backdrops. Passenger-cabin and flight-deck interior scenes were all filmed on sets built on a Warner Bros. sound stage.|$|E
5000|$|The 702d Strategic Missile Wing was {{activated}} on 1 January 1959, {{the first}} Douglas C-124 Globemaster II with a Snark arrived on 27 May 1959, and the complex had 6 corrugated hangars ("missile assembly and maintenance buildings") each of 420 x 80 ft with 2 fixed outdoor launch pads. For each launch pad with diameter 160 ft, a missile was stored within the {{building on a}} launcher trailer attached to a tow vehicle, 1 at ready storage to launch from the outdoor pad within 15 minutes and behind it, 1 capable of launch in 30 minutes. Each building had 3 additional missiles in line behind the first wave (readiness of 4 hr, 3 days, and 5 days), and the missile launch control center was a hangar balcony. [...] In addition to the hangars and pads, the complex included [...] "a jet <b>engine</b> <b>run-up</b> building, the warhead maintenance and inspection building, missile maintenance and guidance lab", a dormitory for night alert personnel, and a compressor house for each hangar.|$|E
2500|$|To {{launch the}} missile, the carrier vessel had to surface and deploy the missile and launch apparatus, which {{consisted}} of a zero length launcher. Once deployed, the missile had {{to be linked to}} the submarine or ship's navigation system to align the inertial navigation system and input target co-ordinates. With the navigation system ready and launch authorisation given, the missile <b>engine</b> would be <b>run-up</b> to full power with afterburner and the large solid-fuelled rocket booster ignited, immediately the missile would leave the zero length launcher and [...] continue to the target autonomously.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new order-based method, {{which has been}} developed to automatically identify resonances from operational data in an <b>engine</b> <b>run-up.</b> The method considers the run-up as a multi-sine sweep excitation and combines advanced Order Tracking with Operational Modal Analysis to identify the resonances. A three-steps approach is used. In a first step, an automatic order detection algorithm is applied to identify the significant engine orders in the measured data. These significant orders are then accurately tracked in both amplitude and phase by using an advanced time-varying DFT Order Tracking method. Once this is achieved, the PolyMAX modal parameter estimation algorithm {{is applied to the}} tracked engine orders to identify the resonances. The method is illustrated and discussed using the measured in-vehicle sound data and tacho pulse signal of a 4 -cylinder car in run-up conditions. The obtained resonance identification results are compared with those of a more traditional, spectrum-based method for Operational Modal Analysis. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{major part}} of {{vibrations}} caused by a car engine is transduced into the driver's cabin via the torque arm, which provides {{a connection between the}} engine and the car body. The torque arm supports the engine against rotational movement caused by the angular acceleration of the crank shaft. In a laboratory setup, the torque arm is placed between a shaker and the car's subframe, fixed on a span. The shaker emulates a controlled <b>engine</b> <b>run-up.</b> An inertial mass actuator based on piezoelectric ceramics is attached to the subframe nearby the torque arm aiming to reduce the transmitted vibrations. By means of a multi-order adaptive narrowband controller the performance of the inertial mass actuator in reducing vibration induced into the car body is investigated. The system behavior of the test bed is measured and implemented in a hardware-in- The-loop test facility, which is intended for use as a test and development environment for signal processing units with adaptive contro l algorithms for the purpose of active vibration control. The developed hardware-in- The-loop test facility is subjected to a functional test, by comparing its controllability with the one of the real test bed.

40|$|International audienceThe {{separation}} and ranking of combustion and mechanical noise sources is of prime {{concern for the}} noise control of internal combustion (IC) engines. Signal processing techniques have been devised recently that can achieve such a separation using the cyclostationary property of IC engine signals. The object {{of this paper is}} to extend this framework to the situation where the engine undergoes a transient speed regime, for instance during a run-up. This raises some new and non-trivial questions. First, the assumption of cyclostationarity has to be relaxed and replaced by the vaguer notion of ''cyclo-non-stationarity{''}. Second - and related to the first point - the practice of cyclic averaging has to be revisited. Third, the design of the separation filter must explicitly incorporate speed dependence. This paper proposes simple but robust solutions to these issues, with a special effort to make them practicable from an industrial point of view. In particular, the cyclic difference operator is introduced in lieu of cyclic averaging, and speed-dependence is captured by use of a flexible basis of B-splines whose knots density is automatically selected from the data. Successful examples of separation are then demonstrated on actual data measured during an <b>engine</b> <b>run-up.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} {{emphasizes}} on noise impact of aircraft at the Sultan Ismail Petra Airport, Pengkalan Chepa, Kelantan. Aircraft noise is affects {{people living in}} the vicinity and its surrounding areas and it is the main noise pollution at the airport. Aircraft noise which is produced during <b>engine</b> <b>run-up,</b> take-off, approach, landing and flyover is determined by calculating the average from the A-weighing decibel, dB (A) which is obtained from the data sampling. The equipment used is Pulsar Model 64 Data Logging Sound Level Meter. Sampling are taken at three difference radiuses which are 500 meter outwards from the airport compound, 1. kilometer and 1. 5 kilometer away from the same point. There are 12 sampling locations and four locations at each contour. The study area is covered residential, academic institution (schools and universities), golf club, industrial area, clinics and plantation. Noise contour represented the level of noise in the area (recipient) is determining the current condition of the study area. The study also determines the impacts of aircraft noise towards surrounding community. The result obtained were supported by the unstructured interview session. Results show the first contour which is within the 500 meters from airport compound exceeded the Maximum Permission Sound Level by Department of Environment. Malaysia. The siting and zoning at the area is not suitable and people around complaints about the impact as well...|$|E
