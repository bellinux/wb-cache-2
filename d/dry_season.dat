5|$|Herbivores, {{including}} wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela {{conservation area}} and migration {{corridor to the}} south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b> The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b> The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b> The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy during the <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> when {{water and food}} are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b> Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E
5|$|Northwest Argentina is {{predominantly}} dry, hot, and subtropical. Owing to its rugged and varied topography, {{the region is}} climatically diverse, depending on the altitude, temperature and distribution of precipitation. Consequently, the vegetation will also differ. Under the Köppen climate classification, the region has five different climate types: semi–arid (BS), arid (BW), temperate without a <b>dry</b> <b>season</b> and temperate with a <b>dry</b> <b>season</b> (Cf and CW respectively), and, at the highest altitudes, an alpine.|$|E

However, unlike most tropical savanna climates, a sizeable amount of precipitation also falls during the <b>dry</b> <b>season(s).</b> In essence, this version of the tropical monsoon climate generally has less pronounced <b>dry</b> <b>seasons</b> than tropical savanna climates.|$|R
5000|$|Extraordinarily rainy wet <b>seasons</b> and {{pronounced}} <b>dry</b> <b>seasons.</b> This variation features pronounced <b>dry</b> <b>seasons</b> similar {{in length and}} character to <b>dry</b> <b>seasons</b> observed in tropical savanna climates. However, {{this is followed by}} a sustained period (or sustained periods) of extraordinary rainfall. In some instances, up to (and sometimes in excess of) 1,000 mm of precipitation is observed per month for two or more consecutive months. Tropical savanna climates generally do not see this level of sustained rainfall.|$|R

5|$|American {{alligators}} modify wetland habitats, most {{dramatically in}} flat {{areas such as}} the Everglades, by constructing small ponds known as alligator holes. This behavior has qualified the American alligator to be considered a keystone species. Alligator holes retain water during the <b>dry</b> <b>season</b> and provide a refuge for aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms that survive the <b>dry</b> <b>season</b> by seeking refuge in alligator holes are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of alligator holes, as well as a buildup of soils during the excavation process, provide drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are intolerant of inundation to colonize. Alligator holes are an oasis during the Everglades <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, alligator holes tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable.|$|E

Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early <b>dry</b> <b>season</b> (57.8%).|$|E

5|$|Northwest Argentina is {{predominantly}} dry, hot, and subtropical. Owing to its rugged topography, {{the region is}} climatically diverse, depending on the altitude, temperature, and distribution of precipitation. Consequently, vegetation differs within these different climate types.

5|$|Springbok are {{primarily}} browsers and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young succulents (such as Lampranthus species) before they lignify. They prefer grasses such as Themeda triandra. Springbok can meet their water needs {{from the food}} they eat, {{and are able to}} survive without drinking water through <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b> In extreme cases, they do not drink any water over the course of their lives. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. In places such as the Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where they are available. Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> unlike other African mammals.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{chemical}} characteristics and phytoplankton biomass (measured as chlorophyll-a concentrations) of seven lakes and one reservoir in the Ethiopian rift-valley were studied during the wet and <b>dry</b> <b>seasons</b> between 1990 and 2000. Mean concentrations of three major plant nutrients (nitrate-nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, and silicate) increased during the wet seasons {{in four of}} the seven lakes, presumably as a result of mixing events and input from runoff. The changes in the major nutrient concentrations {{in the rest of the}} lakes were variable, but concentrations were usually higher during the <b>dry</b> <b>seasons,</b> most likely as a response to temporal variation in the phytoplankton biomass. pH measurements of the lakes did not show marked differences between the wet and <b>dry</b> <b>seasons.</b> Salinity (measured as conductivity) and total ions seemed to increase during the wet seasons in some of the lakes, possibly as a result of inflows that might carry high concentrations of solutes due to the heavy rains. Chlorophyll-a concentrations were higher during the <b>dry</b> <b>seasons</b> in most lakes except in three relatively more productive lakes. The results suggest that there could be light limitation in some of the Ethiopian rift-valley lakes, and events associated with the wet and <b>dry</b> <b>seasons</b> could bring about contrasting changes in nutrient levels and phytoplankton biomass in lakes, depending on the physical characteristics of the lakes...|$|R
