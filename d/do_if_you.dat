500|$|On {{his return}} to St. James's Palace, Churchill's {{attention}} was drawn towards other matters, and to a fresh face at court. [...] "I beg you will let me see you {{as often as you}} can", pleaded Churchill in a letter to Sarah Jennings, [...] "which I am sure you ought to <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> care for my love..." [...] Sarah Jennings' social origins were in many ways similar to Churchill's â€“ minor gentry blighted by debt-induced poverty. After her father's death when she was eight, Sarah, together with her mother and sisters, moved to London. As Royalist supporters (despite the fact that Sarah's great uncle, James Temple, was convicted of regicide), the Jennings' loyalty to the crown, like the Churchill's, was repaid with court employment, and in 1673 Sarah followed her sister Frances into the household of the Duchess of York, Mary of Modena, second wife to James, Duke of York.|$|E

"Skyfall" [...] is an orchestral pop {{song with}} a {{duration}} of four minutes and forty-six seconds [...] Epworth stated that although [...] "Skyfall" [...] is an original composition, he and Adele had worked to capture [...] "the James Bond feeling" [...] of previous theme songs. The song intentionally references Monty Norman's [...] "James Bond Theme" [...] after the first chorus. Norman said that the song had his seal of approval and that including the leitmotif he wrote for the Bond character was [...] "a pretty sensible thing to <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to feel the 'James Bond quality' of the music". Epworth said that while [...] "Skyfall" [...] was his first experience writing film music, he had been involved with the production of James Bond music before: while Epworth was a tape operator at AIR Studios, he recorded some film soundtracks including David Arnold's Tomorrow Never Dies.|$|E

500|$|While {{brainstorming}} {{for ideas}} to the game's plot, Sakamoto decided to create an original story instead of remaking a Metroid game because he [...] "always [...] to do something really unprecedented, something people have never played before". He continued, saying, [...] "Many of our designers and creators want to challenge something new rather than simply porting over an old title. That's something I hope we'll always <b>do.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can challenge something new, you {{can look forward to}} the public response, be it good or bad." [...] The game introduces gameplay mechanics that are new to the Metroid series. Metroid Fusion offers a more direct, almost mission-based structure that supports the player to explore areas. Objectives are also flexible in how they can be completed, acting [...] "more as a guide for what the player should do instead of giving a completely blank map and saying 'Here you go, {{figure out what to do}} and how to do it.|$|E

[...] The video alternates between the band playing, the members of U2 standing on Victoria, and scenes from both Wenders films. At the conclusion of the video, Bono leaves the band on their own.

500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would <b>do.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want to play comedy {{then you have to}} be very intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E

[...] Addresses and prices, which range from five shillings to five pounds, are provided. [...] The types of prostitute the lists present vary from [...] "low-born errant drabs", to prominent courtesans like Kitty Fisher and Fanny Murray; later editions contain only [...] "genteel mannered prostitutes worthy of praise". [...] The charms of a Mrs Dodd, who lived at number six Hind Court in Fleet Street, were listed in 1788 as [...] "reared on two pillars of monumental alabaster", continuing: [...] "the symmetry of its parts, its borders enriched with wavering tendrils, its ruby portals, and the tufted grove, that crowns the summit of the mount, all join to invite the guest to enter." [...] In the same edition, a similarly lurid description precedes the latter part of Miss Davenport's entry, which concludes: [...] "Her teeth are remarkably fine; she is tall, and so well proportioned (when you examine her whole naked figure, which she will permit you to <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> perform the Cytherean Rites like an able priest) that she might be taken for a fourth Grace, or a breathing animated Venus de Medicis... she has a keeper (a Mr. Hannah) both kind and liberal; notwithstanding which, she has no objection to two supernumerary guineas." [...] Miss Clicamp, of number two York Street near Middlesex Hospital, is described as [...] "one of the finest, fattest figures as fully finished for fun and frolick as fertile fancy ever formed... fortunate for the true lovers of fat, should fate throw them into the possession of such full grown beauties."

500|$|To {{design the}} missions, the {{designers}} {{began with a}} cohesive area, which they filled with activities for the player. They defined paths to the target areas, and developed and expanded them. They then populated the areas with NPCs, which they assigned to patrol routes and functions. The designers would then observe how players interacted with the level, using their abilities and powers to test whether the area provided a suitable challenge for the available powers, and then redesigned the level as needed. At first, the levels featured little directional information to emphasize the player's ability to traverse them as they choose, but in testing, players became lost or obeyed NPC commands to not enter an area, leaving them unable to proceed. In response, the developers introduced more visual cues and verbal hints to direct players. Some features and ideas were removed during the design process, including a mental institution where Corvo would have faced sound-sensitive patients. Discussing {{the use of violence}} and the consequences of in-game freedom, developer Joe Houston recounted his experience while watching a tester play a mission to infiltrate a masquerade ball; Houston determined that not killing the NPCs opened up more objectives and interactions, but the tester systematically killed every NPC in the level, which Houston found disconcerting. The team came under pressure to excise a scene {{from the end of the}} game where Samuel, in response to a player killing indiscriminately throughout the game, can betray Corvo by alerting enemies to his presence. Smith explained [...] "Everybody just wants to be told in a video game that youâ€™re great, no matter what you <b>do.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> slaughter everybody â€“ you killed the maids, you killed the old people, you killed the beggars â€“ youâ€™re great, hereâ€™s a medal, youâ€™re a hero...
