5|$|Beginning {{the tour}} with a duck, Kippax {{recovered}} with 89 at Leicester before contracting a <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> influenza that {{forced him to}} miss the next four matches. On his return, he struggled for form, and was not chosen for the first Test. Kippax was the third selector on tour, and was out-voted by his fellow selectors, so the press speculated that the decision caused disharmony within the team. Australia won the game and Kippax failed {{in the next two}} tour matches, so he missed out on the next Test at Lord's, which was lost.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian social credit {{movement}} was largely an out-growth of the Alberta Social Credit Party, and the Social Credit Party of Canada was strongest in Alberta during this period.

He added a <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> fundamentalist Christianity to C. H.

We are reporting one such case of delirium tremens, which required very <b>heavy</b> <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> benzodiazepines and was ultimately controlled by using infusion of propofol.

25|$|Rivière quickly {{passed the}} blame for his fall and his broken back on the team {{mechanic}}, accusing him of leaving oil on the wheels and the brakes for not working. The mechanic was outraged, and the doctors soon found the real reason – that so much painkiller was in Rivière's blood that his hands were too slow to operate the brakes. He had taken a <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> the opioid painkiller dextromoramide (Palfium), to help him stay with Nencini on Col de Perjuret. Rivière later admitted to being a drug addict, telling a newspaper how he had doped to beat the world hour record, and admitted downing thousands of tablets a year.|$|E

Another UMass punt and then three plays later running back James White scores on a 51-yard touchdown run. UMass then put together a nice drive that got down to the Badgers 38-yard line but Wisconsin CB Sojour Shelton intercepted the UMass pass. The Badgers took over at their own 22-yard line and five plays later they were in the end zone again with a 57-yard touchdown pass to Jared Abbrederis from Joel Stave.

500|$|In an {{interview}} for The Hindu, Fahadh called Maheshinte Prathikaaram a [...] "serious comedy". Despite its title, the film differed from earlier Malayalam revenge-centred films. It begins with Mahesh bathing in a pond, humming a popular song from 2000's Narasimham (a cult action film). It also alludes to the doomed character Sethumadhavan's vengeance in Kireedam (1989) and Chenkol (1993). In his review for The Times of India, Sanjith Sidhardhan called the film the [...] "sweetest tale of revenge"; it [...] "is not a regular revenge thriller; it has a <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> rib-tickling comedy that stems from the actions of its rustic characters and their sensibilities".|$|E
500|$|The {{sound of}} 30 Seconds to Mars takes on many musical stylistic shifts. Elizabeth Bromstein from Now {{magazine}} {{described it as}} a concoction of '80s electronics, industrial music and nu metal with a <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> progressive rock. Jaan Uhelszki of Alternative Press felt that the album is made of [...] "sterner stuff", with the band's prog-metal foundation [...] "enhanced by an unexpectedly powerful sense of melody". Smiley Ben of BBC Collective noted in the album alternative rock tendencies. Ryan Rayhill from Blender found the album befitting prog-rock prototypes Rush and opined that Thirty Seconds to Mars [...] "emerged with an eponymous debut that sounds like Tool on The Dark Side of the Moon", referring to the 1973 album by Pink Floyd.|$|E
500|$|MTV Buzzworthy's Chris Ryan gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} video, stating that it [...] "marks {{a change in the}} way we look at music videos as a medium -- it's less a music video, more a modern art montage with a <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> ancient Egyptian imagery and possible references to Michelangelo's [...] "The Creation of Adam" [...] (with a fair Kanye-esque helping of chesty females). In it, Kanye West ironically builds an unattainable artistic empire fit for a king (or pharaoh), while condemning the role power plays in our lives. So much to think about." [...] Beningo of Daily News compared the video to the work of Michael Jackson, calling it an event of a video. Hitfix's Katie Hasty mused that West [...] "put on a crown for 'Jesus Walks,' so {{it was only a matter}} of time before he ascended into heaven", describing the video as a [...] "little weird, a little funny".

500|$|Nolan {{began with}} the {{structure}} of a heist movie, since exposition is an essential element of that genre, though adapted it to have a greater emotional narrative suited to the world of dreams and subconscious. Or, as Denby surmised, [...] "the outer shell of the story is an elaborate caper". Kristin Thompson argued that exposition was a major formal device in the film. While a traditional heist movie has a <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> exposition at the beginning as the team assembles and the leader explains the plan, in Inception this becomes nearly continuous as the group progresses through the various levels of dreaming. Three-quarters of the film, until the van begins to fall from the bridge, are devoted to explaining its plot. In this way, exposition takes precedence over characterisation. Their relationships are created by their respective skills and roles. Ariadne, like her ancient namesake, creates the maze and guides the others through it, but also helps Cobb navigate his own subconscious, and as the sole student of dream sharing, helps the audience understand the concept of the plot.|$|E
