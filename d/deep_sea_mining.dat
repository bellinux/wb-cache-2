25|$|Because <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>mining</b> is a {{relatively}} new field, the complete consequences of full-scale mining operations are unknown. However, experts are certain that removal of parts of the sea floor will result in disturbances to the benthic layer, increased toxicity of the water column, and sediment plumes from tailings. Removing parts of the sea floor disturbs the habitat of benthic organisms, possibly, {{depending on the type of}} mining and location, causing permanent disturbances. Aside from direct impact of mining the area, leakage, spills, and corrosion would alter the mining area's chemical makeup.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the impacts}} of <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>mining,</b> {{sediment}} plumes could have the greatest impact. Plumes are caused when the tailings from mining (usually fine particles) are dumped back into the ocean, creating a cloud of particles floating in the water. Two types of plumes occur: near-bottom plumes and surface plumes. Near-bottom plumes occur when the tailings are pumped {{back down to the}} mining site. The floating particles increase the turbidity, or cloudiness, of the water, clogging filter-feeding apparatuses used by benthic organisms. Surface plumes cause a more serious problem. Depending {{on the size of the}} particles and water currents the plumes could spread over vast areas. The plumes could impact zooplankton and light penetration, in turn affecting the food web of the area.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze two major aspects of U. S. ocean policy-making, viz. the politics of new coastal zones of resource-related coastal state jurisdiction and the politics of <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>mining.</b> With respect to coastal zones the purpose was to try to explain, first, why the Nixon Administration decided to support the idea of a 200 -mile economic zone at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) as substantive negotiations started in 1974, and, second, why Congress passed and President Ford signed the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (FCMA). With respect to <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> the objective was to explain, first, why the Ford Administration decided to support the parallel system, which would allow both an International Seabed Authority (ISA) and private companies to mine the mineral resources of the <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> beyond the continental margins, and, second, why the Carter Administration decided to support U. S. <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> legislation. ^ Four models were developed and applied. An international interdependence model singled out the role of international agenda setting, learning processes, the use of linkage strategies and transnational coalition formation. A bureaucratic politics model dealt with the missions and policy inputs of different bureaucratic agencies. And a domestic politics model dealt with the role of public opinion, interest organizations, Congress, and the salience of issues. Finally, a fourth model was developed to deal with the cross time bargaining aspects of the decision-making process. It borrowed notions from cognitive psychology and introduced the role of feedback and adversity in bargaining situations. ^ It was found that a combined use of the models was necessary to explain U. S. ocean policy, but that domestic politics and the perceived need to secure free naval use of ocean space through an international agreement were especially important factors. Although the mechanisms singled out by the international interdependence model were at work, they were not found to be of major importance. ^ Major bureaucratic agencies, such as the State, Defense, Interior and Commerce Departments, contributed with policy inputs which could be explained very well by the bureaucratic missions of those agencies. But it was found that the impact of these agencies depended on wider societal forces and phenomena, such as, for instance, the 1973 energy crisis. It was therefore concluded that bureaucratic politics was epiphenomenal. ^ The U. S. acceptance of the 200 -mile economic zone and the parallel system of <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> fitted the bargaining perspective very well. These were tactical decisions made in an effort to strike an international bargain. But only domestic politics could explain the enactment of the FCMA. Since it contributed to the legitimization of what was mainly sought by a majority of the states in the international negotiations, viz. coastal state jurisdiction over coastal zone resources, without securing the quid pro quo sought by the United States, viz. free naval use of ocean space, it actually led to a U. S. loss of bargaining leverage. ^ The Carter Administration 2 ̆ 7 s decision to support U. S. <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> legislation was found to be a signal to the majority of states within UNCLOS III, reminding it that only a small group of industrialized states has the unilateral option in respect to <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>mining.</b> But <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> has had less domestic salience than fishing. And as a superpower the United States has remained interested in securing navigational rights, including unimpeded passage of international straits, through a widely accepted new ocean treaty. So the United States has kept negotiating, despite adversity. ...|$|R

40|$|The deep oceans house astonishingly {{high levels}} of {{biodiversity}} and are critical to the Earths ecological health and human well-being. Venturing into this extraordinary environment, human exploration for raw materials has reached new depths with mineral deposits being explored on the deep ocean floor, up to 6000 meters below the surface. Commercial-scale <b>mining</b> of <b>seabed</b> minerals is likely to start {{in the near future}} and presents a range of uncertainties as well as risks of significant environmental harm. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) has exclusive competence over minerals on the international seabed. It is critically important that the ISA applies a precautionary approach to <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> to ensure environmental harm will not exceed an acceptable level once mining commences. This thesis examines the environmental mandate of the ISA and the implementation of the precautionary principle by the ISA in its regulation and management of <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>mining.</b> In doing so, the analysis is not limited to an examination of the inclusion, or otherwise, of the precautionary principle into the legal framework of the ISA. Rather, this thesis examines the actual implementation of the principle in practice through the work of the ISA. In particular, this thesis examines the ISAs ongoing work on the development of a system of environmental protection standards and measures as well as procedural safeguards and decision-making processes that facilitate risk assessment and risk management. Synthesising the literature on the meaning and implementation of the precautionary principle, this thesis develops a set of steps, identified as an implementation cycle, by which the precautionary principle can be operationalised. This implementation cycle is then used as the framework against which the ISAs risk assessment and risk management measures are analysed and evaluated. This thesis identifies strengths in the manner and extent to which the ISA is implementing the precautionary principle. However, it also reveals significant weaknesses and lacunae in the existing regulatory framework of the ISA. This thesis identifies a range of protective measures as well as procedural and institutional arrangements that may be adopted to ensure the precautionary management of <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>mining</b> by the ISA...|$|R
40|$|Under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the {{international}} <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> area is named “the Area”, which, together with its resources, {{is the common}} heritage of mankind. 1 No State should claim or exercise sovereignty or sovereign rights over {{any part of the}} Area or its resources, nor should any State or natural or legal person appropriate any part thereof. 2 Since <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> areas beyond the limit of national jurisdiction have been treated as the common heritage of mankind, all activities there are governed by {{the international}} regime created under the UNCLOS.
