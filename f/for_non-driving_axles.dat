50|$|Axles are an {{integral}} component of most practical wheeled vehicles. In a live-axle suspension system, the axles serve to transmit driving torque to the wheel, {{as well as to}} maintain the position of the wheels relative {{to each other and to}} the vehicle body. The axles in this system must also bear the weight of the vehicle plus any cargo. A <b>non-driving</b> <b>axle,</b> such as the front beam axle in heavy duty trucks and some two-wheel drive light trucks and vans, will have no shaft, and serves only as a suspension and steering component. Conversely, many front-wheel drive cars have a solid rear beam axle.|$|R

30|$|This study {{included}} no objective {{test of the}} drivers’ situation awareness, though the Cooper–Harper Scales indicated that the drivers rated their situation awareness higher in both partial and full automation than in the baseline condition. Despite this, several {{studies have demonstrated that}} with automation, car drivers are less prepared for unexpected events [18, 27]. Studies have also demonstrated that with automation, car drivers are more willing to engage in non-driving tasks such as in-vehicle entertainment, paying less attention to the road ahead [3, 10, 11]. Although the literature treats car drivers and our study treats truck drivers, whose driving tasks differ, this finding may nevertheless indicate that drivers, whether of cars or trucks, believe that they have more situation awareness than they actually do, using their “spare” attentional resources <b>for</b> <b>non-driving</b> activities.|$|R
40|$|Industrialised and {{developing}} countries face an urgent challenge to decouple economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate where the largest potentials are to the Swedish industry decrease greenhouse gas emissions without increasing their costs. To limit the scope of the study is made by assessing the 10 largest categories of production by value sold in Sweden. The objectives are to investigate: (a) which the 10 largest categories are; (b) how much the productions of the products in the categories emit and where in the production those emissions come from; and (c) if policies or other actions can help lowering the amount emitted. For (a) statistics from Eurostat is used, for (b) an EIO-LCA database is used for most cases, but forestry is done with the help of a report on Swedish forestry emissions, while (c) is done by a literature review regarding the industries included in the study. The top 10 categories by value sold is: (1) Vehicle compression-ignition internal combustion piston engines; (2) Chemical wood pulp, soda or sulphate, other than dissolving grades; (3) Coniferous wood; (4) Pine wood; (5) Parts and accessories of bodies; (6) Bodies for motor vehicles including completely equipped and incomplete bodies; (7) Drive-axles with differential, <b>non-driving</b> <b>axles</b> and their parts; (8) Spruce wood and fir wood; (9) Prefabricated buildings of wood; And (10) Other parts and accessories for vehicles. Results show that chemical wood pulp had the largest emissions both per value produced and total. Additionally, chemical wood pulp is the category where the most clear cut improvements can be done. Besides, it is found that improvement possibilities exist for forestry and motor vehicle parts production, while prefabricated buildings of wood are very sustainable compared to other building methods. Suggestions are also made for policies that could decrease greenhouse gas emissions from chemical wood pulp and forestry. A suggestion for further investigation is to assess whether those would be better than improving existing broad policies in Sweden. ...|$|R

40|$|Changes {{in travel}} mode choices among young adults have been {{observed}} in Europe and North America with marked declines in the percentages of those with drivers’ licences. Declines in licensing rates {{have the potential to}} affect future transportation needs, preferences <b>for</b> <b>non-driving</b> transport modes, vehicle purchases, road safety and the environment. This study aimed to identify any changes in population-based driver and motorcycling licensing rates among young adults in Victoria, Australia. Licensing data for all Victorian adults from 2001 - 2014 was tabulated with ABS population data to examine age-related trends in licensing rates. The results indicated that driver licensing rates among Victorians aged 18 - 30 years have declined since 2001. In 2014, over 40 % of 18 - 21 year old Victorians did not have a driver’s licence. This licensing decline was accompanied by substantial increases in the proportions of licensed drivers aged over 50 years, indicating that the decline is specific to young adults. The licensing data also revealed that motorcycling licensing rates have increased during recent years across most age groups in Victoria. However young adults aged 18 - 25 years have the highest rates of motorcycle only licences, with motorcycling only licensing rates increasing most notably among 22 - 25 year olds. Potential implications of such changes in travel modes include reduced road infrastructure revenue and costs, reduced traffic congestion, environmental benefits and reduced road deaths and injuries, but also a need for safer infrastructure for motorcycling and other travel modes.

The results indicate that there was a significant structural break in the fatalities data that coincided with the introduction of a number of policy measures, notably the increased implementation of the Random Road Watch program, installation of speed cameras, and increased use of random breath testing. The effect of the structural break was to reduce the average number of fatalities per month by 7. 64, a fall of some 22 %. This overall reduction comprised a fall of 5. 18 per month in fatalities among drivers, and a fall of 3. 14 per month among other road users.

40|$|Introduction: To date, {{there has}} been little {{research}} on driving or transportation use in retirement living seniors or the associations with quality of life, including staying active, socially engaged and connected with the outside community. This thesis {{is part of a larger}} project being conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Waterloo to examine these issues in collaboration with the Schlegel-UW Research Institute for Aging, the Schlegel Villages and Luther Village on the Park. Purpose: The primary objectives of this thesis were to: 1) examine the actual driving practices and other modes of travel in relation to functional abilities and other characteristics; 2) examine associations between driving and other modes of travel with community engagement; 3) examine fall status and compare fallers and non-fallers; and 4) compare current drivers to a sample of former drivers with respect to falls, balance confidence, depression, activity levels in and out of Village (engagement) and travel patterns. Methods: A convenience sample of 55 drivers (mean age 81. 9 ± 6. 2, 49 % male) from five retirement villages located in Southern Ontario were assessed between February and October, 2013. Participants completed questionnaires (background and driving history, activities inside and outside the village), scales (depression, well-being, self-reported driving restrictions, perceived driving abilities, balance and driving confidence) and assessments of cognition and executive function, lower body mobility and contrast sensitivity. In addition, participant vehicles were equipped with two electronic data logging devices (vehicle diagnostics and GPS) for two weeks, while they concurrently kept trip logs (for driving trips) and travel diaries (<b>for</b> <b>non-driving</b> trips). Falls were assessed through both self-report and incident reports from the villages. Similar data (from scales, questionnaires, travel diaries, falls) previously collected on a sample of 20 former drivers from these retirement villages was merged into the database to permit statistical comparisons between current and former drivers. Primary Results: Overall, the sample reported driving less after moving to the villages. Compared to prior studies with community seniors, older drivers living in the retirement villages had more restricted driving practices. Residents who were considering driving cessation were not only restricting their driving, but had diminished functional abilities, were more likely to fall, had worse balance and driving confidence, and were less engaged with the community. Compared to current drivers, former drivers were more likely to have fallen in the past year, had lower balance confidence, and were less active outside the village, although they were equally socially engaged. Level of independent living (townhomes versus apartments or suites, versus assisted living rooms) emerged as a significant predictor of community engagement. When level of independent living was controlled for, greater community engagement was associated with younger age, being able to walk 1 / 4 mile and better balance confidence scores. Driving status approached significance with higher community engagement scores associated with being a current (versus former) driver. Conclusions: The results indicate that although residents of retirement villages may not drive as much as community living seniors, continuing to drive enables them to stay more connected to the broader community. Although few had considered driving cessation prior to relocation, about half the sample were now considering this transition. Retirement living may make the transition to driving cessation easier, particularly for those who take advantage of village shuttle buses and retain the ability to walk to shops and services in the area. Alternate modes of transportation are critical as older adults retire from driving to ensure continued mobility and independence, as well as to maintain productive community and social engagement...|$|R
40|$|The AutoPlay prototypes {{have been}} {{designed}} to explore the implementation of non-driving activities into the context of a future autonomous driving situation. The conceptual design goal was to maintain a pleasurable situational awareness of the inactive driver by integrating the driving context as a meaningful input into the interaction system. In this chapter, we introduce the design of three experimental applications for autonomous driving and report on explorative user studies conducted to investigate the impact of the three AutoPlay prototypes: AutoGym, an in-car exertion game that translates car speed and traffic situations into an individual exercise program. AutoJam, a touch sensitive steering wheel cover to generate interactive music experiences in a creative interplay with car&# 039;s driving dynamics. AutoRoute, a discovery application for future urban commuting in autonomous cars that enables an exploration of the city based on spontaneous routing and rerouting. Furthermore, we reflect on the outcome of the user studies and propose three motivational affordances of autonomous driving: drivability, performability, and explorability. Each of these concepts, help to understand the motivational possibilities of the autonomous driving situation and facilitates a meaningful alignment of interaction systems and the driving context. We discuss the underlying concepts of the three affordances by relating them to the experiences identified in the user studies. Subsequently the contribution of this chapter is twofold: (1) We introduce the AutoPlay prototypes as inspirational concepts <b>for</b> aligning <b>non-driving</b> activities with the autonomous driving context and (2) we propose three motivational affordances as design targets for the implementation of non-driving activities in order to initiate a broader discussion on the pleasures of autonomous driving beyond instrumental motives...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Almost all the {{research}} on transportation use and travel patterns of older adults has been confined to community-dwelling seniors. This multi-phase project was initiated {{to gain a better}} understanding of transportation modalities (including driving) and travel patterns of seniors living in retirement complexes. The current study, Phase IV of the project, focused on residents who were still driving. Previous phases included surveys to determine driving status (Phase I) and general transportation use (Phase II), as well as an in-depth examination of residents 65 + who had recently stopped driving in the past two years (Phase III). Purposes: The primary objective of this study was to examine the actual driving practices of older drivers living in retirement communities, including associations with driver characteristics, perceptions of driving comfort and abilities, indicators of well-being, and extent of activity and group participation inside and outside the villages. This study also examined travel patterns outside the village, in addition to driving themselves. Methods: A convenience sample of 38 drivers (mean age 81. 9 ± 5. 6, range 70 to 91, 42 % male) from five urban retirement villages located across Southern Ontario (Kitchener, Waterloo, Guelph, Etobicoke and Whitby), were assessed between February and July, 2013. Participant vehicles were equipped with two electronic data logging devices (one with GPS) for two weeks, during which time they also filled out trip logs (for each driving trip) and daily travel diaries (<b>for</b> <b>non-driving</b> trips). Participants also completed questionnaires (background and driving history, activities inside and outside the village) and scales to assess depression, well-being, perceptions of driving comfort and abilities and balance confidence. Interviews were conducted to examine their experiences over the two week period, as well as gather feedback on transportation at the retirement facilities. Results: Overall, the sample was highly educated, reported being in good health and not depressed. They were also considerably older and had a greater proportion of females than most community studies. Driving data were obtained for 32 participants. Participants drove an average of three days a week (range 0. 5 to 6. 5 days/week), and only eight (32 %) drove at night. Consistent with findings on older drivers living in the community, driving trips were most often for shopping and errands (65 % of total trip segments), followed by social and entertainment purposes (18 %). The sample showed more restricted driving patterns when compared to prior studies with community seniors; driving substantially less at night (trips and distance). Most of the sample (73 %) did not drive on days with bad weather. Driving perceptions (particularly night comfort) were significantly (p< 0. 05) associated to many driving indicators (days driven, trips, stops, duration and night driving indicators). As expected, the number of non-driving trips outside the village increased as the amount of driving decreased. The sample did not take many non-driving trips over the two weeks (3. 7 ± 6. 6, range 0 to 29) while some took many trips due to frequent walking trips. Walking (66 % of total trips) and being a passenger in a vehicle (29 %) were the most common modes of non-driving trips, with public transportation only accounting for less than 1 % of all total trips. Non-driving trips were most often for recreational and social reasons, followed by shopping trips. Interviews suggested the sample was starting to think about driving cessation (20 / 38 or 53 %) since moving to the village, where prior to that only one person (2. 6 %) had thought about it. Conclusions: Compared to community living seniors, older drivers living in retirement complexes are driving less. Services and amenities within the communities appear to be well utilized, which may reduce the need for travel outside the villages. Although use of public transit, taxis, paratransit and the facility bus (for group outings) was minimal, walking was popular for physical activity and going to shopping areas nearby. Participants reported driving less often after moving to the village and a significantly larger proportion thought about driving cessation only after moving. It is possible that living in a retirement residence makes driving less essential and therefore residents are leaving the village less often than someone living in the community. Although the study did not have a sufficient sample to conduct comparisons between village locations, the sample represented five different locations, therefore providing a better depiction of retirement living residents. The next phase of the project will help build on current findings by increasing the sample size and allowing for additional comparisons...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExpressed by Fitts in 1954, {{there is}} an inverse {{relationship}} between movement time and target size and/or {{the distance between the}} participant and a target; smaller and further away targets require longer movement times than larger, closer targets. Here, the applicability of Fitts’ law to an in-vehicle, dual-task setting is under investigation. In the current experiment, different target sizes and spaces between target and non-target elements (target-element space), were investigated in simulated driving and non-driving scenarios in two age groups (18 – 35 and 45 – 65 years old). The aim of this experiment was to investigate whether target size and target-element space (i. e., the space between targets and non-targets) would {{have an effect on the}} mean movement times of younger and older participants <b>for</b> driving and <b>non-driving</b> conditions. Participants pointed to and touched targets on a smartphone touch screen in a vehicle mock-up. Movement times were recorded while concurrently performing a simulated driving task (dual-task condition) and while performing just the pointing task (single task condition). Errors were defined and are presented. Mean movement times in the dual-task condition were significantly faster than in the single task condition. Additionally, in line with Fitts’ law, in-vehicle movement time decreased as a function of target size. Elements that had the most target-element space were moved to most quickly, however, the medium and small spaces did not differ. Differences between the two age groups were not found...|$|R
40|$|Automated driving {{technologies}} {{promise a}} relief from stressful or frustrating driving situations. Fully-autonomous cars {{of the future}} are expected {{to take over the}} responsibilities of driving and allow the now inactive driver to perform much more engaging non-driving activities than ever before. However, the design space of the autonomous driving situation is uniquely different from traditional driving. For example, research on advanced driving automation systems have shown that the transfer of the driving task from the driver to the system can be experienced as a loss of autonomy and competency and may result in a feeling of being at the mercy of technology. Furthermore, the relationship with our cars is not only instrumental. The car is a personal artefact, an extension of the driver&rsquo;s body connoted with feelings of independence and power. The car&rsquo;s emancipation to an autonomous agent require a new basis of interacting with the inactive driver to facilitate a pleasurable and meaningful driving experience. On the other hand, the relief from the driving task provides a unique opportunity for new types of activities during the piloted journey, amongst them, new forms of in-situ entertainment and games that are grounded in the contextual specificity of the automotive, mobile situation. This leads to the research objectives: What type of activities can support autonomous driving as pleasurable and meaningful? How should they be implemented to compensate for the constraints and drawbacks of the autonomous driving situation, but also {{to take advantage of the}} unique affordances of this new technology? To answer those questions, I designed and developed three working prototypes with the goal to envision future autonomous driving as a pleasurable and meaningful activity. Based on a research-through-design approach, I explored the potentials of the design space of autonomous driving by systematically aligning the core-interactions of the prototypes with the contextual constraints of dense urban traffic. Furthermore, I studied the impact of the three prototypes on the driving experience in a simulator set up as well as in a series of in-car user studies. This exegesis introduces the three prototypes as design artefacts and reflects on the findings of the complementary user studies. In doing so, it articulates a novel frame for understanding autonomous driving as a future design challenge for contextual activities. This research contributes to the increasing importance of user experience and game design in the automotive domain. As such, the contribution is threefold: (1) As design artefacts, the prototypes articulate a desired future of driving experiences in autonomous cars. (2) As a contextual design practice, the research contributes intermediate knowledge in the form of novel ideation methods and implementation strategies of non-driving activities. (3) As a conceptual frame for understanding autonomous driving, I propose three motivational affordances of autonomous driving (that were tangible experiences of the prototypes) as targets <b>for</b> aligning <b>non-driving</b> activities. The three prototypes presented in this exegesis articulate a desired pleasurable vision of autonomous driving of the future. As an inspirational frame, the three prototypes are studied to gain experiential insights into the challenge of designing pleasurable and meaningful non- driving interactions in a future autonomous driving context...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Psychological SciencesLaura A. BrannonThe current {{research}} investigated strategies to reduce cell phone use while driving. Anti-distracted driving campaigns, which typically communicate risk information and target driver behavior, may produce limited effects because {{people tend to}} underestimate their risk from this behavior (e. g., Schlehofer et al., 2010). Study 1 compared the effects of messages targeting drivers to messages targeting non-drivers {{in order to examine}} the potential of discouraging people from having cell phone communication with others who are driving. Some anti-distracted driving campaigns have emphasized the potential harm to both the driver and others, but whether one approach (self-oriented or other-oriented messaging) is more persuasive than the other has not been examined empirically. Study 1 compared messages that were self-oriented, other-oriented, or neutral in terms of who could be affected by cell phone use while driving. Although cell phone use while driving generally is perceived as dangerous, people may make justifications for engaging in the behavior on at least some occasions, and these justifications may override the influence of risk knowledge on behavior. Consistent with inoculation theory (McGuire, 1961), if given the opportunity to practice refuting these justifications in a controlled setting, people {{will be more likely to}} defend themselves against justifications to engage in cell phone use while driving. Thus, Study 1 tested the prediction that participation in an inoculation task would reduce the likelihood of cell phone use while driving. Results from Study 1 suggested an advantage of targeting non-driving participants of cell phone conversations to enhance efforts for reducing on-the-road cell phone use. Study 1 also demonstrated a positive effect of inoculation, but primarily <b>for</b> behavior of <b>non-driving</b> participants of cell phone conversations. In addition to overconfidence in ability to avoid risk, habitual tendencies also may impede the influence of risk communication campaigns (Bayer & Campbell, 2012). Study 2 investigated the potential of mindfulness-based and implementation intentions techniques for helping people overcome habitual responses to their cell phone when doing so is inappropriate or inconvenient. Results indicated that pairing mindfulness-based training with risk information may be significantly more effective than risk information alone at inhibiting inappropriate cell phone use...|$|R
