The technique shows promise {{for the study of}} the load-bearing performance (consolidation) of articular cartilage and changes in articular cartilage accompanying osteoarthritis. Consolidation of articular cartilage involves the recording of two transient characteristics: the change over time of strain and the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>excess</b> pore <b>pressure</b> (HEPP). MRI study of cartilage consolidation under mechanical load is limited by difficulties in measuring the HEPP in the presence of the strong magnetic fields associated with the MRI technique.

30|$|The décollement {{zone in the}} Nankai Trough off the Cape Muroto exists {{within a}} hemipelagic {{mudstone}} sequence of the lower Shikoku Basin in lithostratigraphic unit IV (Taira et al. 1991) (Fig.  4). No significant difference in host lithology is found {{above and below the}} décollement (Heuer et al. 2017 b). Thus, the characteristic drop of EST in zone B cannot be attributed to a change in lithology. An alternative explanation is the existence of high pore fluid pressure below the décollement, which has also been noted in previous studies (Gamage and Screaton 2006; Tsuji et al. 2008). Evidence for the existence of high fluid pressure at site C 0023 comes from the observation of low seismic velocity zone in seismic reflection data, which was found to be a characteristic feature in subducting sediments below the frontal décollement in this Muroto transect (Figs.  1 and 4) (Tsuji et al. 2008). The normalized pore pressure ratio (λ*) below the décollement is estimated to be 0.4 – 0.7 (Tsuji et al. 2008). If the pore pressure is higher than the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> (<b>excess</b> pore <b>pressure),</b> the effective pressure applied to the sediment decreases and its in-situ strength would also decrease.|$|R

This study examined the effect of relief wells with different diameters at different distances downstream of a homogeneous earth dam using Seep/W software. Also the effect of upstream water level of reservoir on seepage flow to each well was carried out. Results show that by decreasing the distance between relief wells and increasing {{the diameter of the}} relief wells, total uplift pressure decreases.

40|$|Uniform <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> dike model We {{assume that}} uniform <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> acts {{everywhere}} {{on the wall}} of the magma body, with no shear traction. This uniform-pressure boundary condition is physically more plausible than a kinematic displacement boundary condition if we can assume that low-viscous fluid such as basaltic magma is at hydrostatic (or magmastatic) pressure equilibrium. Magma at depth migrates commonly in the form of a crack. We divide the crack into elements that either open or remained closed. The open elements define the geometry of the crack. The uniform pressure boundary condition is enforced on all the open elements. In an inversion various combinations of open and closed elements are selected, and for each combination (i. e. crack geometry), the opening distribution of the entire crack is uniquely determined by a boundary element calculation under the uniform <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> (1). Figure S 1 shows an example of this procedure.

The first series was designed to study the competition between the external stress and the liquid <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> in controlling the propagation direction. We systematically controlled the external stress and the liquid <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> by changing the surface load and the liquid volume. An ascending crack progressively deflected to be perpendicular to the maximum tensile direction of the external stress. The degree of deflection depends on {{the ratio of the}} shear stress on a crack plane to the average liquid <b>excess</b> <b>pressure.</b> More deflection was observed for a crack with a larger ratio. No significant deflection was observed for the ratio less than 0.2. The volcanic activity in a compressional stress field might be understood {{in the context of this}} competition. The first series also demonstrated the importance of the gradient of the crack normal stress as a driving force for propagation. The vertical gradient of the gravitational stress generated by a mountain load can control the emplacement depth of magmas, and it might lead to the evolution of eruption style during the lifetime of a volcano. The second series was designed to study the three-dimensional interaction of two parallel buoyancy-driven cracks. The deflection of the second crack takes place, when the ratio of the shear stress generated by the first one to the average <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> of the second crack is larger than 0.2. If the second crack reaches the first one, the interaction can lead to the coalescence of two cracks. It has directivity: the region of coalescence extends more in the direction perpendicular to the first crack than in the direction parallel to it. It reflects the stress field around the first crack. This directivity might cause a characteristic spatial variation of magma chemistry through magma mixing.|$|R

Our recordings cover a transition in explosive style from ash-rich to ash-free explosions followed again by {{a phase of}} high ash discharge. To assess the present paradigm of Strombolian behavior {{in this study we}} investigate the geophysical signature of these different explosive episodes and compare our results to observations at Stromboli volcano, Italy. To this end we characterize Yasur's surface activity in terms of material movement, temperature and <b>excess</b> <b>pressure.</b> The joint temporal trend in these data reveals smooth variations of surface activity and regime-like persistence of individual explosion forms over days. Analysis of all data types shows ash-free and ash-rich explosive styles similar to those found at Stromboli volcano. During ash-free activity low echo powers, high explosion velocities and high temperatures result from the movement of isolated hot ballistic clasts. In contrast, ash-rich episodes exhibit high echo powers, low explosion velocities and low temperatures linked to the presence of colder ash-rich plumes. Furthermore ash-free explosions cause high <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> signals exhibiting high frequencies opposed to low-amplitude, low-frequency signals accompanying ash-rich activity. To corroborate these findings we compare fifteen representative explosions of each explosive episode. Explosion onset velocities derived from Doppler radar and infrared camera data are in excellent agreement and consistent with overall observations in each regime. Examination of infrasound recordings likewise confirms our observations, although a weak coupling between explosion velocity and <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> indicates changes in wave propagation. The overall trend in explosion velocity and <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> however demonstrates a general correlation between explosive style and explosion intensity, and points to stability of the uppermost conduit on timescales shorter than at Stromboli volcano...|$|R
40|$|We {{model the}} ascent and {{eruption}} of lunar mare basalt magmas with new data on crustal thickness and density (GRAIL), magma properties, and surface topography, morphology and structure (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter). GRAIL recently measured the broad spatial {{variation of the}} bulk density structure of the crust of the Moon. Comparing this with the densities of lunar basaltic and picritic magmas shows that essentially all lunar magmas were negatively buoyant everywhere within the lunar crust. Thus positive <b>excess</b> <b>pressures</b> must have been present in melts at or below the crust–mantle interface {{to enable them to}} erupt. The source of such <b>excess</b> <b>pressures</b> is clear: melt in any region experiencing partial melting or containing accumulated melt, behaves as though an <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> is present {{at the top of the}} melt column if the melt is positively buoyant relative to the host rocks and forms a continuously interconnected network. The latter means that, in partial melt regions, probably at least a few percent melting must have taken place. Petrologic evidence suggests that both mare basalts and picritic glasses may have been derived from polybaric melting of source rocks in regions extending vertically for at least a few tens of km. This is not surprising: the vertical extent of a region containing inter-connected partial melt produced by pressure-release melting is approximately inversely proportional to the acceleration due to gravity. Translating the ∼ 25 km vertical extent of melting in a rising mantle diapir on Earth to the Moon then implies that melting could have taken place over a vertical extent of up to 150 km. If convection were absent, melting could have occurred throughout any region in which heat from radioisotope decay was accumulating; in the extreme this could have been most of the mantle. The maximum <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> that can be reached in a magma body depends on its environment. If melt percolates upward from a partial melt zone and accumulates as a magma reservoir, either at the density trap at the base of the crust or at the rheological trap at the base of the elastic lithosphere, the <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> at the top of the magma body will exert an elastic stress on the overlying rocks. This will eventually cause them to fail in tension when the <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> has risen to close to twice the tensile strength of the host rocks, perhaps up to ∼ 10 MPa, allowing a dike to propagate upward from this point. If partial melting occurs in a large region deep in the mantle, however, connections between melt pockets and veins may not occur until a finite amount, probably a few percent, of melting has occurred. When interconnection does occur, the <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> at the top of the partial melt zone will rise abruptly to a high value, again initiating a brittle fracture, i. e. a dike. That sudden <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> is proportional to the vertical extent of the melt zone, the difference in density between the host rocks and the melt, and the acceleration due to gravity, and could readily be ∼ 100 MPa, vastly greater than the value needed to initiate a dike. We therefore explored <b>excess</b> <b>pressures</b> in the range ∼ 10 to ∼ 100 MPa. If eruptions take place through dikes extending upward from the base of the crust, the mantle magma pressure at the point where the dike is initiated must exceed the pressure due to the weight of the magmatic liquid column. This means that on the nearside the <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> must be at least ∼ 19 ± 9 MPa and on the farside must be ∼ 29 ± 15 MPa. If the top of the magma body feeding an erupting dike is a little way below the base of the crust, slightly smaller <b>excess</b> <b>pressures</b> are needed because the magma is positively buoyant in the part of the dike within the upper mantle. Even the smallest of these <b>excess</b> <b>pressures</b> is greater than the ∼ 10 MPa likely maximum value in a magma reservoir at the base of the crust or elastic lithosphere, but the values are easily met by the <b>excess</b> <b>pressures</b> in extensive partial melt zones deeper within the mantle. Thus magma accumulations at the base of the crust would have been able to intrude dikes part-way through the crust, but not able to feed eruptions to the surface; in order to be erupted, magma must have been extracted from deeper mantle sources, consistent with petrologic evidence. Buoyant dikes growing upward from deep mantle sources of partial melt can disconnect from their source regions and travel through the mantle as isolated bodies of melt that encounter and penetrate the crust–mantle density boundary. They adjust their lengths and internal <b>pressure</b> <b>excesses</b> so that the stress intensity at the lower tip is zero. The potential total vertical extent of the resulting melt body depends on the vertical extent of the source region from which it grew. For small source extents, the upper tip of the resulting dike crossing the crust–mantle boundary cannot reach the surface anywhere on the Moon and therefore can only form a dike intrusion; for larger source extents, the dike can reach the surface and erupt on the nearside but still cannot reach the surface on the farside; for even larger source extents, eruptions could occur on both the nearside and the farside. The paucity of farside eruptions therefore implies a restricted range of vertical extents of partial melt source region sizes, between ∼ 16 and ∼ 36 km. When eruptions can occur, the available <b>pressure</b> in <b>excess</b> of what is needed to support a static magma column to the surface gives the pressure gradient driving magma flow. The resulting typical turbulent magma rise speeds are ∼ 10 to a few tens of m s− 1, dike widths are of order 100 m, and eruption rates from 1 to 10 km long fissure vents are of order 105 to 106 m 3 s− 1. Volume fluxes in lunar eruptions derived from lava flow thicknesses and surface slopes or rille lengths and depths are found to be of order 105 to 106 m 3 s− 1 for volume-limited lava flows and > 104 to 105 m 3 s− 1 for sinuous rilles, with dikes widths of ∼ 50 m. The lower end of the volume flux range for sinuous rilles corresponds to magma rise speeds approaching the limit set by the fact that excessive cooling would occur during flow up a 30 km long dike kept open by a very low <b>excess</b> <b>pressure.</b> These eruptions were thus probably fed by partial melt zones deep in the mantle. Longer eruption durations, rather than any subtle topographic slope effects, appear to be the key to the ability of these flows to erode sinuous rille channels. We conclude that: (1) essentially all lunar magmas were negatively buoyant everywhere within the crust; (2) positive <b>excess</b> <b>pressures</b> of at least 20 – 30 MPa must have been present in mantle melts at or below the crust–mantle interface to drive magmas to the surface; (3) such pressures are easily produced in zones of partial melting by pressure-release during mantle convection or simple heat accumulation from radioisotopes; (4) magma volume fluxes available from dikes forming at the tops of partial melt zones are consistent with the 105 to 106 m 3 s− 1 volume fluxes implied by earlier analyses of surface flows; (5) eruptions producing thermally-eroded sinuous rille channels involved somewhat smaller volume fluxes of magma where the supply rate may be limited by the rate of extraction of melt percolating through partial melt zones...|$|R
