5000|$|Demise charter: The <b>demise</b> <b>charter</b> is {{the least}} used in the tramp trade because it heavily favors the owner. [...] The ship owner only {{provides}} a ship devoid of any crew, stores, or fuel. It is the Charterer's responsibility to provide everything the ship will need. The ship owner must provide a seaworthy vessel, but once the charterer accepts the vessel, the responsibility of seaworthiness is the charterer's. The charterer crews the vessel, but the owner can make recommendations. There are no standardized forms in a <b>demise</b> <b>charter,</b> contracts can vary greatly, and are written up {{to meet the needs}} of the charterer.|$|E
50|$|A {{bareboat charter}} or <b>demise</b> <b>charter</b> is an {{arrangement}} for {{the hiring of}} a vessel whereby no administration or technical maintenance is included {{as part of the}} agreement. The charterer obtains possession and full control of the vessel along with the legal and financial responsibility for it. The charterer pays for all operating expenses, including fuel, crew, port expenses and P&I and hull insurance. In commercial demise chartering, a subtype of bareboat chartering, the charter period may last for many years and may end with the charterer acquiring title (ownership) of the ship. In this case, a <b>demise</b> <b>charter</b> is a form of hire-purchase from the owners, who may well have been the shipbuilders. Demise chartering is common for tankers and bulk-carriers.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are legal}} {{differences}} between a bareboat charter {{and other types}} of charter arrangements, commonly called time or voyage charters. In a voyage or time charter, the charterer charters the ship (or part of it) for a particular voyage or for a set period of time. In these charters the charterer can direct where the ship will go but the owner of the ship retains possession of the ship through its employment of the master and crew. In a bare-boat or <b>demise</b> <b>charter,</b> on the other hand, the owner gives possession of the ship to the charterer and the charterer hires its own master and crew. The bare-boat charterer is sometimes called a [...] "disponent owner". The giving up of possession of the ship by the owner is the defining characteristic of a bareboat or <b>demise</b> <b>charter.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1614 the {{property}} was disputed as Gerhard of the Horst who was married to the daughter of Gerhard of Malbergs claimed the title. During the 17th century the castle and sovereignty got into the ownership of the Family of Ouren which referred to themselves as the Lords of Ouren, Tavigny, Limbach and Feilen. In 1680 their son John Francis Ignaz of Ouren leased the castle and the sovereignty to Peter de la Branche. In 1690 the <b>demise</b> <b>charter</b> was renewed for several six years.|$|E

Detaljno se analiziraju i komentiraju odredbe PZ-a o zakupu broda, a proučavaju se i drugi supsidijarni izvori domaćeg pozitivnog prava, ponajprije odredbe ZOO-a o zakupu te opće odredbe ZOO-a. Iscrpno se obrađuju prava i obveze ugovornih stranaka, a upozorava se na sva važna pitanja koja izravno utječu na njihov opseg i sadržaj. U okviru toga podrobno se proučava njihova ugovorna odgovornost te opisuje kako sudjeluju u rizicima i koristima koji nastaju zakupom broda kao oblikom njegova iskorištavanja. Radi boljeg razumijevanja složenih odnosa koji sklapanjem i izvršavanjem ugovora o zakupu nastaju između ugovornih stranaka, posebno se razmatra pravna priroda tog ugovora te svi njegovi bitni sastojci. Rad obrađuje i ugovorne odnose stranaka iz ugovora o podzakupu broda. This paper {{analyses}} {{the legal}} regulation of <b>demise</b> <b>charter</b> (bareboat charter) in the Republic of Croatia. The {{provisions of the}} Maritime Act on the <b>demise</b> <b>charter</b> of vessels are analysed and discussed in detail, as are other subsidiary sources of the valid domestic law {{and in particular the}} provisions of the Law on Obligation dealing with lease, and its general provisions. In {{the first part of the}} paper, the definitions of the bareboat charter and of the contractual parties are explained. In order to better understand the very complex relations between the contractual parties arising when entering and exercising a contract, the legal nature of that contract and its main components are analysed in detail. The central part of the paper analyses in depth the rights and obligations of the contractual parties and points to all the important issues impacting on their scope and content. Within this broader issue, the parties’ contractual liability is examined, as well as the way in which the parties participate in the risks and benefits arising from the bareboat charter as a form of its exploitation. The paper also deals with the contractual relations of the parties to the contract arising from the subcharter contract. In the conclusion, various changes are recommended related to the valid regulation of the bareboat charter with respect to the content and terminology in the provisions of the Maritime Act. Such changes could contribute to a better regulation of the bareboat charter in the Croatian law de lege ferenda...|$|E

40|$|The {{deregulation}} of the European airline industry has had a dramatic impact on regional airports across the Union. Furthermore, the policy has changed the strategy of the so-called traditional full service network carriers, such as British Airways who {{as a consequence of}} this legislation have created powerful alliance networks and consolidated their position at fortress hubs. In comparison, low cost carriers have built a network presence around regional airports as they offer such carriers a variety of cost savings. The <b>demise</b> of <b>charter</b> airlines due to the continued fall in holiday makers booking package tours has further changed the management dynamics of regional airports. This paper examines the consequences of the above actions and evaluates how these issues have been played out within the South West of England and Wales...|$|R

40|$|The Ocean Victory In 2013 in The Ocean Victory, 1 Teare J {{held that}} time charterers were in {{breach of the}} safe port clause, and that the breach had caused the total loss of the vessel. They had ordered Ocean Victory to Kashima in Japan, and the {{casualty}} had occurred {{as a result of}} a combination of “long waves” and very high northerly winds, not perhaps so rare in isolation, but certainly very rare in combination. The peril of long waves had persuaded the master to leave the port, in the course of which very strong headwinds, in the fairway, had led to Ocean Victory foundering against a breakwater. There was also a damages issue. The time charter was a sub-charterparty, and the principal action was by the (demise) head charterers against the defendant sub-charterers. 2 The sub-charterers argued that the head charterers had suffered no loss, because a clause in the head charter requiring charterers to insure the hull was to be taken as a complete code, 3 to the exclusion of other liability for damage to the ship. The argument was that, because the order to Kashima therefore occasioned the claimants no liability under the safe port clause in the head charter, there were no damages to be awarded, even if there was a breach of the sub-charter. Teare J rejected the sub-charterers’ argument. Commenting on this case in 2014, 4 I observed that “Teare J [had] systematically demolished the charterers’ arguments at every stage. The judgment has the impression of being very pro-owner”. His decision has now been reversed in the Court of Appeal, both on the issue of breach, and on the complete code argument. 5 Because there was no breach, the appellate court did not need to decide, and did not decide, whether Teare J had been correct on the causation issue. 6 1.

40|$|Classical {{political}} economy {{was dedicated to}} the principle that the state could best encourage economic development by leaving entrepreneurs alone, free of regulation and subsidy. The development of classical economic policy in the United States dramatically changed {{the concept of the}} business corporation. Within the preclassical, mercantilist model, the corporation was a unique entity created by the state for a special purpose and enjoyed a privileged relationship with the sovereign. The very act of incorporation presumed state involvement. State subsidy and the incorporators 2 ̆ 7 public obligation were natural corollaries. Business firms that relied on the market alone to determine their prospects were simply not incorporated. As classical theory replaced the mercantilist model, the business corporation gradually evolved into a device for assembling large amounts of capital in a manner that could be controlled efficiently by a small number of managers. The classical model of the corporation did not emerge mature in a single decision. It evolved gradually in the nineteenth century, reaching its apogee in the 1880 s and 1890 s. The developing model of the classical corporation included two fundamental premises: (1) the corporate form is not a special privilege but merely one of many ways of organizing a business firm; and (2) the peculiar advantage of the corporation which the law should encourage is its ability to raise and concentrate capital more efficiently than other forms of business organization. These important developments formed the core of the classical corporate model: (1) the attack on the Marshall era contract clause; (2) the <b>demise</b> of the <b>charter</b> theory of business regulation; (3) the rise of the General Corporation Act and the decline of the special subsidy; (4) the application of the fourteenth amendment 2 ̆ 7 s protections to corporations; (5) the expansion of limited shareholder liability; (6) the narrowing scope of quo warranto and ultra vires; (7) the facilitation of multistate corporate business activities; and (8) the separation of ownership and control...|$|R
