50|$|<b>Delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment</b> or DvP is {{a common}} form of {{settlement}} for securities. The process involves the simultaneous delivery of all documents necessary {{to give effect to}} a transfer of securities in exchange for the receipt of the stipulated payment amount.

40|$|Like {{many other}} {{research}} subjects in obstetrics, research on immediate <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> expectant monitoring {{for women with}} hypertensive disorders of pregnancy faces certain challenges {{when it comes to}} interpretation and generalisation of the results; relatively rare outcomes are studied, in a clinically heterogeneous population, while the clinical practice in some countries has dictated that studies in term pregnancy were completed before earlier gestational ages could be studied. This has resulted in multiple smaller studies, some studying surrogate outcome measures, with different in- and exclusion criteria, and without enough power for reliable subgroup analyses. All this complicates the generation of definitive answers and implementation of the results into clinical practice. Performing multiple studies and subsequently pooling their results in a meta-analysis can be a way to overcome the difficulties of studying relatively rare outcomes and subgroups with enough power, as well as a solution to reach a final answer on questions involving an uncertain and possibly harmful intervention. However, {{in the case of the}} current studies on <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> expectant monitoring in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, differences regarding eligibility criteria, outcome measures and subgroup definitions make it difficult to pool their results in an aggregate meta-analysis. Individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA) has the potential to overcome these challenges, because it allows for flexibility regarding the choice of endpoints and standardisation of inclusion and exclusion criteria across studies. In addition, it has more statistical power for informative subgroup analyses. We therefore propose an IPDMA on immediate <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> expectant monitoring for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and advocate the use of IPDMA for research questions in obstetrics that face similar challenge...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPregnant {{women are}} a highly mobile group, yet studies suggest {{exposure}} error due to migration in pregnancy is minimal. We aimed {{to investigate the}} impact of maternal residential mobility on exposure to environmental variables (urban fabric, roads and air pollution (PM 10 and NO 2)) and socio-economic factors (deprivation) that varied spatially and temporally. MethodsWe used data on residential histories for deliveries at ≥ 24 weeks gestation recorded by the Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey, 2000 – 2008 (n= 5399) to compare: (a) exposure at conception assigned to maternal postcode at <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> maternal postcode at conception, and (b) exposure at conception assigned to maternal postcode at <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> mean exposure based on residences throughout pregnancy. ResultsIn this population, 24. 4 % of women moved during pregnancy. Depending on the exposure variable assessed, 1 – 12 % of women overall were assigned an exposure at delivery > 1 SD different to that at conception, and 2 – 25 % assigned an exposure at delivery > 1 SD different to the mean exposure throughout pregnancy. ConclusionsTo meaningfully explore the subtle associations between environmental exposures and health, consideration {{must be given to}} error introduced by residential mobility...|$|R
5000|$|Settlement {{involves}} {{the delivery of}} securities from one party to another. Delivery usually takes place against payment known as <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment,</b> but some deliveries are made without a corresponding payment (sometimes {{referred to as a}} free delivery, free of payment or FOP delivery, or in the United States, delivery versus free). Examples of a delivery without payment are the delivery of securities collateral against a loan of securities, and a delivery made pursuant to a margin call.|$|E
50|$|A major {{development}} of 1998 was {{the implementation of}} a central depository system, in which all listed companies are registered. This system allows <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment</b> (DVP) on a T+3 day rotating basis. The establishment of a clearinghouse, through the Bank of Mauritius, provided for a guarantee fund, which incorporates measures for securities and fund settlement failure. The exchange, in collaboration with international advisers, drafted new listing and reporting rules to ensure greater transparency for investors. These rules came into force {{during the first half of}} 1998.|$|E
50|$|In an {{electronic}} settlement system, electronic settlement takes place between participants. If a non-participant wishes to settle its interests, it {{must do so}} through a participant acting as a custodian. The interests of participants are recorded by credit entries in securities accounts maintained in their names by the operator of the system. It permits both quick and efficient settlement by removing the need for paperwork, and the simultaneous delivery of securities with the payment of a corresponding cash sum (called <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment,</b> or DVP) in the agreed upon currency.|$|E
40|$|Publish-subscribe {{messaging}} middleware typically offers limited and low-level options for quality of service, such as best-effort <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> reliable <b>delivery,</b> or ordered <b>versus</b> unordered. We propose a new, high-level approach to specifying quality of service, {{in which the}} consumer specifies an event stream interpretation function that maps an event stream into a state that represents the consumer's semantics of the stream. Under this approach, the system may deliver either the subscribed event stream, or any alternative stream whose image under the interpretation function yields the same state. Event stream interpretation gives consumers the ability to more accurately specify the tolerable distortions of perfect message delivery, and gives middleware implementations the exibility to use more ecient protocols for message delivery and failure recovery while preserving application safety...|$|R

50|$|Securities {{clearing}} {{was required}} to ensure payment had been received and the physical stock certificate delivered. This caused a few days delay between the trade date and final settlement. To reduce the risk associated with failure to deliver on the trade on settlement date, a clearing agent or clearing house often sat between the trading parties. The trading parties would deliver the physical stock certificate and the payment to the clearing house, who would then ensure the certificate was handed over and the payment complete. This process is known as <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{comparative}} {{analyses of}} gross and net settlement {{have focused on}} the credit risk of the central counterparty in net settlement arrangements, and on the incentives for participants to alter the risk of the portfolio under net settlement. By modeling the trading economy that generates the demand for payment services, we are able to show some largely unexplored advantages of net settlement. We find that net settlement can prevent certain gridlock situations, which may arise in gross settlement in the absence of <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment</b> requirements. In addition, we show that net settlement can economize on collateral requirements and avoid trading delays...|$|E
