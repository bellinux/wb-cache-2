5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced <b>exposure</b> <b>in</b> {{the developed world}} since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is {{the primary source of}} lead <b>exposure</b> <b>in</b> most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Manganese <b>exposure</b> <b>in</b> United States is {{regulated}} by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). People can be exposed to manganese in the workplace by breathing it in or swallowing it. OSHA has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for manganese <b>exposure</b> <b>in</b> the workplace as 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 3mg/m3. At levels of 500mg/m3, manganese is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E

5|$|After {{four years}} in Washington, he spent four years as Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), the number two position, at Embassy Moscow. These years {{cemented}} his reputation within the State Department as a Soviet expert. In early 1976, the State Department made public {{the fact that the}} Soviet Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many years. This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation. Ironically, it was Soviet research that documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave <b>exposure.</b> <b>In</b> the United States, the standards for safe exposure to microwaves were much more lenient than in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|At {{least a dozen}} {{recordings}} {{were issued}} {{in the wake of}} the success of the Nonesuch recording, and the work enjoyed significant <b>exposure</b> <b>in</b> a number of artistic media worldwide. The work was repeatedly used by filmmakers in the 1990s and onwards to elicit a sense of pathos or sorrow, including as an accompaniment to a plane crash in Peter Weir's Fearless (1993), and in the soundtrack to Julian Schnabel's Basquiat (1996). An art gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico opened an exhibit in 1995 dedicated entirely to visual art inspired by the piece.|$|E

5|$|Evans became {{embroiled in}} several {{internal}} Klan conflicts that gained media <b>exposure.</b> <b>In</b> January 1921, {{he and a}} group of grand dragons expelled the publicist Clarke, who had been critical of Evans' efforts to involve the Klan in electoral politics. Evans also clashed with Henry Grady, a judge from North Carolina who served in the Klan from 1922 to 1927, reaching the rank of Grand Dragon. Before Evans gained control of the Klan, Grady had been considered a potential successor to Simmons. After Grady dismissed a Klan-backed law that would have banned the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal service organization, Evans revoked his membership. Grady subsequently leaked his correspondence with Evans to the media.|$|E

5|$|Lead <b>exposure</b> <b>in</b> {{children}} is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead <b>exposure</b> <b>in</b> childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Molybdenum dusts and fumes, {{generated}} by mining or metalworking, can be toxic, especially if ingested (including dust {{trapped in the}} sinuses and later swallowed).

OSHA regulations specify the maximum permissible molybdenum <b>exposure</b> <b>in</b> an 8-hour day as 5mg/m3. Chronic exposure to 60 to 600mg/m3 can cause symptoms including fatigue, headaches and joint pains. At levels of 5000mg/m3, molybdenum is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
