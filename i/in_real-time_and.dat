5|$|Vagrant Story is a solo action {{role-playing}} game, {{in which}} the player controls Ashley Riot from a third-person perspective while exploring Leá Monde and the catacombs underneath. The player may also switch into first-person perspective {{to allow for a}} 360° view using the START button or right analog stick on the game controller. Characters and sprites are proportionate with each other, and the player navigates Ashley on a three-dimensional field map. Navigation is <b>in</b> <b>real-time,</b> <b>and</b> areas accessed by the player are stored in an in-game map menu.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{occur when}} the player {{character}} encounters an enemy while traversing the world. Combat takes place <b>in</b> <b>real-time,</b> <b>and</b> in the location the player found the enemy rather than a separate battle screen. The main character can equip a variety of weapons, armors, and accessories. Weapons let the player perform abilities in combat. Referred to as Special Techs, these abilities are powerful attacks by the main characters and support characters {{that can be used}} when the special move meter is full. This meter fills as the player damages enemies. Each weapon, such as a sword or spear, has a set number of special attacks to learn, which can hit single or multiple targets and can be assigned to different buttons on the controller.|$|E
5|$|Combat occurs <b>in</b> <b>real-time,</b> <b>and</b> {{the player}} {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking {{near the bottom of}} the screen may result in a jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E

5|$|Like live action, machinima is {{recorded}} <b>in</b> <b>real-time,</b> <b>and</b> real people can act {{and control the}} camera. Filmmakers are often encouraged to follow traditional cinematic conventions, such as avoiding wide fields of view, the overuse of slow motion, and errors in visual continuity. Unlike live action, machinima involves less expensive, digital special effects and sets, possibly with a science-fiction or historical theme. Explosions and stunts can be tried and repeated without monetary cost and risk of injury, and the host environment may allow unrealistic physical constraints. University of Cambridge experiments in 2002 and 2003 attempted to use machinima to re-create {{a scene from the}} 1942 live-action film Casablanca. Machinima filming differed from traditional cinematography in that character expression was limited, but camera movements were more flexible and improvised. Nitsche compared this experiment to an unpredictable Dogme 95 production.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} a city on the planet Efate. Here, as on all explorable planets in this game, the player observes the party and its {{surroundings}} from a directly overhead {{point of view and}} issues commands via hotkeys or clickable icons displayed onscreen. The explorable terrain of planets is limited to certain cities and immediately adjacent regions. Cities feature several types of buildings that are a recurrent feature on most planets, including a store for purchasing or selling armor, weapons and other items, a library, hospital, police station, and a starport for launching and outfitting a spaceship. Some cities host additional visitable buildings which may include a tavern or a hotel in which important non-player characters are located. Building types are color-coded for easier player identification. The player directs the party's movements and issues commands to perform various actions such as communicating with non-player characters, using objects or firing a weapon. Combat takes place <b>in</b> <b>real-time</b> <b>and</b> requires the player to direct individual party members to target opponents and fire their weapons, reload, or move to a better position.|$|E

25|$|As a first-person shooter, combat {{takes place}} <b>in</b> <b>real-time</b> <b>and</b> from a first-person perspective. The player can use several weapons, {{including}} submachine guns, shotguns, a tranquilizer gun, a sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher. Weapons must be reloaded {{after a certain}} number of shots. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Heavy and Light Armor power-ups that absorb extra damage can be collected throughout the game. These power-ups, however, cannot protect the player from extreme falls or radiation. The game features several lengthy cuts from the film as cutscenes.|$|E
25|$|Combat in Mass Effect: Andromeda {{takes place}} <b>in</b> <b>real-time,</b> <b>and</b> unlike {{previous}} installments in the series, pausing {{the game to}} aim or use skills from a menu {{is no longer a}} feature. During action sequences, the player has direct control of Ryder from an over-the-shoulder perspective, who can move around the battlefield in a variety of ways, including a side-to-side dash or vertical leap into the air using a jetpack. When the player approaches an object, Ryder will automatically take cover, providing the player with protection in battle. The game encourages players to keep moving during combat with large, open battlefields and enemies that attack from all angles, but also allows for both aggressive and defensive strategies.|$|E
40|$|The common {{procedure}} for detecting potentially malignant (PMOL) or malignant oral lesions consists of visual inspection, followed by biopsy of any suspicious lesions found. However, {{the processing of}} biopsy material and {{the interpretation of the}} results inevitably leads to diagnostic delay and the added possibility of taking an unrepresentative sample. Therefore, techniques that can distinguish between benign from malignant types in a reliable and noninvasive way would be very useful. This review provides an overview of the literature how spectroscopic techniques are useful and can provide tissue diagnosis <b>in</b> <b>real-time,</b> noninvasively <b>and</b> <b>in</b> situ.

500|$|The expansion's zombie {{enemies are}} {{similar to that of}} other games. [...] "Walker" [...] zombies are slow from afar but run when they near the character. Fat zombies attempt to knock the player-character down and others spew green venom. Marston has new weapons, {{including}} holy water, bait for the undead, and a blunderbuss that uses zombie parts as ammunition. The player can use a combination of these skills to defeat hordes of reanimated humans, who stop only once their heads explode. For example, Marston can bait a group to an area to set off a bomb, use the time-slowing Dead Eye mode to shoot each in the head, or eliminate enemies from a roof because zombies cannot climb. Other non-playable characters who contract the infection turn into the undead <b>in</b> <b>real-time</b> <b>and</b> are likely to attack the player.|$|E

In this paper we present an overview of some scheduling algorithms for real-time systems on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems and men-tion some that are optimal in each category. This overview also includes minor explanations of important concepts <b>in</b> <b>real-time</b> systems <b>and</b> scheduling. 1...|$|R
500|$|Combat in Kingdom Hearts II is <b>in</b> <b>real-time</b> <b>and</b> {{involves}} heavy hack and slash elements with button presses which initiate {{attacks by}} the on-screen character. A role-playing game menu on the screen's bottom left, {{similar to those}} found in Final Fantasy games, provides other combat options such as using magic or items, summoning beings to assist in battle, or executing combination attacks with other party members. A new feature is the [...] "Reaction Command", special enemy-specific attacks that are triggered when the player presses the triangle button at the correct time during battle. Reaction Commands can be used to defeat regular enemies or avoid damage, and are sometimes necessary to complete a boss battle. In addition to the main character, two party members are usually present who also participate in combat. Although these characters are computer-controlled, the player is allowed to customize their behavior to a certain extent through the menu screen, such as attacking the same enemy Sora targets.|$|E
500|$|The team {{worked to}} {{discover}} the causes and mechanics of fear, and they analyzed horror films for inspiration. [...] "Robbing the Cradle" [...] includes influences from the Silent Hill and System Shock series, from the films The Devil's Backbone, Jacob's Ladder and Session 9, and from the books House of Leaves, From Hell and The Shining. Thomas applied psychological horror techniques that he hoped would stay with the player even after the level's end. To generate fear, he used a combination of scripted sequences and unplanned, emergent factors. Every light source in the level dims and brightens at an imperceptibly slow speed, which Thomas hoped would create a [...] "subconscious sense of breathing" [...] and thereby make the Shalebridge Cradle feel like a living entity. Lights were programmed to flicker when approached by Puppets; however, Puppets roam the level <b>in</b> <b>real-time,</b> <b>and</b> so Thomas was unable to predict which lights would flicker at which times. He believed that this gave the player {{the feeling of being}} hunted.|$|E
500|$|On July 1, 1956, a National Hurricane Information Center {{had become}} {{established}} in Miami, Florida {{which became a}} warehouse for all hurricane-related information from one office. [...] The Miami Hurricane Warning Office (HWO) was moved from Lindsey Hopkins Hotel to the Aviation Building [...] to the northwest on July 1, 1958. [...] Forecasts for tropical cyclone movement were extended to two days in advance (at one day intervals) in 1961. [...] The Miami HWO moved to {{the campus of the}} University of Miami in 1964, which is when tropical cyclone forecasts were extended to three days into the future, at one day intervals. [...] The Miami HWO tropical cyclone reports were done regularly and took on their modern format in 1964. [...] In 1970, NHC began analyzing tropical cyclone initial positions <b>in</b> <b>real-time</b> <b>and</b> added a 12‑hour forecast. [...] Beginning in 1973, a portion of the National Meteorological Center (later renamed the Weather Prediction Center) gained advisory responsibility for dissipating inland tropical depressions. [...] The World Meteorological Organization assumed control of the Atlantic hurricane naming list in 1977.|$|E
