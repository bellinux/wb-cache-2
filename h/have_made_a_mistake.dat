5|$|Despite the {{retirement}} in Australia, the next 5 rounds saw {{a string of}} point-scoring positions, including a 4th at Monaco in the wet, {{one of the few}} finishers not to <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and subsequent pit-in, however his performance was overshadowed by Hamilton's win. Until 2009, this was Webber's best start to an F1 season since 2005 with Williams, managing five consecutive points scoring races.|$|E

Maria overhears the pair's conversation and chips in saying that she feels that Maddy is perfect. Michael knows Maria is right but Ric thinks he might <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and he explains to Maddy that he is withdrawing her interview offer. Maddy is devastated.|$|E
5|$|The prime universe's Peter succumbs to {{his illness}} and dies, and Walter {{and his wife}} Elizabeth (Orla Brady) mourn their loss, {{supported}} by Walter and William's friend, Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) and Walter's lab assistant, Carla Warren (Jenni Blong). Walter, through his window, shows Elizabeth the other Peter, and asserts they should be happy knowing another Peter exists. Later, Walter watches Walternate explore other cures. Walternate is distracted {{by the arrival of}} an Observer, September (Michael Cerveris), and fails to see the telltale color change indicating a cure. Walter is able to recreate and stabilize Walternate's cure, and then decides to use untested equipment to cross over to give the cure to Peter. Carla tries to stop Walter, knowing the technology could damage the fabric of space-time, and contacts Nina for help. Separately, September informs his fellow Observers that he may <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and assures them he will correct it.|$|E

5|$|For {{approximately}} five days the armies therefore confronted {{each other across}} the plain of Marathon in stalemate. The flanks of the Athenian camp were protected either by a grove of trees, or an abbatis of stakes (depending on the exact reading). Since every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer, the delay worked in favor of the Athenians. There were ten Athenian strategoi (generals) at Marathon, elected by each of the ten tribes that the Athenians were divided into; Miltiades was one of these. In addition, in overall charge, was the War-Archon (polemarch), Callimachus, who had been elected by the whole citizen body. Herodotus suggests that command rotated between the strategoi, each taking in turn a day to command the army. He further suggests that each strategos, on his day in command, instead deferred to Miltiades. In Herodotus's account, Miltiades is keen to attack the Persians (despite knowing that the Spartans are coming to aid the Athenians), but strangely, chooses to wait until his actual day of command to attack. This passage is undoubtedly problematic; the Athenians had little to gain by attacking before the Spartans arrived, and there is no real evidence of this rotating generalship. There does, however, seem to have been a delay between the Athenian arrival at Marathon, and the battle; Herodotus, who evidently believed that Miltiades was eager to attack, may <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> whilst seeking to explain this delay.|$|E

25|$|In the book, Manji {{says that}} Arabs <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> by denying that Jews have a {{historical}} bond with Palestine. Manji {{writes that the}} Jews' historical roots stretch back {{to the land of}} Israel, and that {{they have a right to}} a Jewish state. She further argues that the allegation of apartheid in Israel is deeply misleading, noting that there are in Israel several Arab political parties, that Arab-Muslim legislators have veto powers, and that Arab parties have overturned disqualifications. She also writes that Israel has a free Arab press, that road signs bear Arabic translations, and that Arabs live and study alongside Jews.|$|E
25|$|Later {{research}} {{showed that}} Howland's position was misplaced on their chart by approximately five nautical miles. There is also some motion picture {{evidence to suggest}} that a belly antenna on their Electra might have snapped on takeoff (the purpose of this antenna has not been identified, however radio communications seemed normal as they climbed away from Lae). One relatively new theory suggests that Noonan may <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in navigation due to the flight's crossing of the International Date Line. Further recent research has indicated that on July 2, 1937, Earhart's aircraft was not (contrary to current literature) flown over the great circle New Guinea-to-Howland.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{discussion}} with Anytus, Socrates returns to quizzing Meno {{for his own}} thoughts on whether the sophists are teachers of virtue and whether virtue can be taught.

2500|$|On 11 April 1939 the Foreign Policy Committee {{decided that}} the {{question}} of Russia's potential as an ally should be referred to the Chiefs of Staff. Chatfield said that it was clear the political arguments against a Russian alliance outweighed any possible military benefits and that the Chiefs of Staff should only report on Russia's military capability. On 24 April 1939 the Chiefs of Staff submitted their report and rated Russia's military effectiveness low. The next day Chatfield gave the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Policy a summary of this report: [...] "Russia, although a great Power for other purposes, was only a Power of medium rank for military purposes...Her assistance would be of considerable, though not of great, military value". On 16 May 1939 Lord Halifax said that the political reasons for not allying with Russia were stronger than the strategic reasons for such an alliance. Chatfield responded: [...] "...if for fear of making an alliance with Russia we drove that country into the German camp we should <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> of vital and far-reaching importance".|$|E
