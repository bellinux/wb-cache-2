6000|$|... "I can't," [...] says I. [...] "Excitement's just eating me up." [...] And then <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{yell and}} turned loose my forty-five through the skylight.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd an {{exciting}} dream last night for once," [...] said Dan triumphantly. [...] "I dreamt old Peg Bowen chased me. I thought I {{was up to}} her house and she took after me. You bet I scooted. And she caught me--yes, sir! I felt her skinny hand reach out and clutch my shoulder. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> screech--and woke up." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then it {{was that}} <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> few links. I called him {{a son of a}} toad. I called him all the other things he had called me. And then I called him a few {{additional}} things. I came from the West, where men knew how to swear, and I wasn't going to let any mangy shack on a measly New England [...] "jerk" [...] put it over me in vividness and vigor of language. At first the shack tried to laugh it down. Then he made the mistake of attempting to reply. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> few more links, and I cut him to the raw and therein rubbed winged and flaming epithets. Nor was my fine frenzy all whim and literary; I was indignant at this vile creature, who, in default of a dollar, would consign me to three months of slavery. Furthermore, I had a sneaking idea that he got a [...] "drag" [...] out of the constable fees.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> nearly <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> damn at this. But {{just then}} the {{respected}} Miss Blank put her head in, {{and said that the}} cab was at the door, if Mr. Stonor wanted to catch the eleven three up.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{the action}} scenes, Jet Li {{said he had}} never been this {{exhausted}} before. Li said, After fighting the White Snake, fight the Green Snake. After fighting the Green Snake, then fight the Demon. After fighting this Demon, then fight another Demon. After fighting this Demon, then fight the Water Monster. Everyday on set <b>I</b> was <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> big sigh.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> {{could have}} <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> yell {{of joy and}} relief. The formal words of welcome were {{pronounced}} by Sir Cuthbert Wallace who, as Dean of the Medical School of St. Thomasâ€™, had rebuked me {{a few years earlier}} for being so frivolous as to go off to South America before I had qualified. (ibid, 2002) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{then the}} beans were spilled [...] . by accident. Come {{a letter from}} Wisconsin. My Aunt Eliza 'd died and up and left me her big farm. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> whoop when I read it; but I could have canned my joy, for I was jobbed out of it by the courts and lawyers afterward--not a cent to me, and I'm still paying 'm in instalments.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed like}} a dream. Too good to be true! <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> shout when I hooked him and a yell of joy when he broke water--a big swordfish, over two hundred pounds. What really transpired on Captain Dan's boat the {{following}} few moments I cannot adequately describe. Suffice {{to say that it}} was violent effort, excitement, and hilarity. I never counted the leaps of the swordfish. I never clearly saw him after that first leap. He seemed only a gleam in flying spray. Still, I did not make any mistakes.|$|E
60|$|A large pinyon, {{with a dead}} top, {{suggested}} a good outlook, so I climbed it, and saw I could sweep a large section of the slope. It was a strange thing to look down hill, over the tips of green trees. Below, perhaps four hundred yards, was a slide open for a long way; all the rest was green incline, with many dead branches sticking up like spars, and an occasional crag. From this perch I heard the hounds; then followed a yell I thought was Jim's, and after it the bellowing of Wallace's rifle. Then all was silent. The shots had effectually checked the yelping of the hounds. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> yell. Another cougar that Jones would not lasso! All at once I heard a familiar sliding of small rocks below me, and I watched the open slope with greedy eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cut the ropes!" [...] vociferated Byfield; {{and to my}} {{infinite}} relief I {{saw that}} Dalmahoy was doing his best. A hand clutched at my heel. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> viciously, amid <b>a</b> roar of the crowd; felt the kick reach and rattle home on somebody's teeth; and, as the crowd made a rush and the balloon swayed and shot upwards, heaved myself over the rim into the car.|$|R
60|$|I {{continued}} to dwell upon the matter, hoping {{he might be}} provoked into telling me for what purpose he counted on taking from the Bridewell one of our {{people who had been}} captured at Breed's hill; but the scoundrel was sharp enough to hold his peace regardless of what <b>I</b> said, never <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> word that could serve as an inkling to that portion of the plan.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is so, my lord! I {{heard only}} last night, {{down in a}} tavern below, such unbelieving talk as made me mad, my lord; and {{if it had not}} been after supper, and my hand was not oversteady, <b>I</b> would have <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> pottle of Alicant from some of their hoopings, and sent them to Dick Surgeon, to wrap them in swaddling-clouts, like whining babies as they are. Marry come up, what says Scripture? 'He that is fearful and faint-hearted among you, let him go and'--what? son Dick there? Thou'rt pious, and read'st thy Bible. What's that text? A mortal fine one it is, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{remember}} much after that. All hands got {{me over the}} side, {{and it seems to}} me I went to sleep, sitting in the stern-sheets and watching that Adamu steer. Then I saw the Flibberty's mainsail hoisting, and heard the clank of her chain coming in, and I woke up. 'Here, put me on the Flibberty,' I said to Adamu. 'I put you on the beach,' said he. 'Missie Lackalanna say beach plenty good for you.' Well, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> yell and reached for the steering-sweep. I was doing my best by my owners, you see. Only that Adamu gives me a shove down on the bottom- boards, puts one foot on me to hold me down, and goes on steering. And that's all. The shock of the whole thing brought on fever. And now I've come to find out whether I'm skipper of the Flibberty, or that chit of yours with her pirating, heathen boat's-crew." ...|$|E
60|$|I saw him--huge, brown, wide, weaving {{after my}} bait. Then he hit {{it with his}} sword. I {{imagined}} I could feel him cut it. Winding in, I found the bait cut off neatly back of the head. While Dan hurried with another bait I watched for the swordfish, and saw {{him back in the}} wake, rather deep. He was following us. It was an intensely exciting moment. I let the bait drift back. Almost at once I felt that peculiar rap at my bait, then another. Somehow I knew he had cut off another flying-fish. I reeled in. He had severed this bait in the middle. Frantically we baited again. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> long line, and we drifted. Hope was almost gone when there came a swift tug on my line, and then the reel whirred. I thumbed the pad lightly. Dan yelled for me to let him have it. I was all tingling with wonderful thrills. What a magnificent strike! He took line so fast it amazed me.|$|E
60|$|Still, a more {{interesting}} and important discovery was to come, and the pleasure and honor of it fell to me. My eyes were sharp and peculiarly farsighted--the Indian sight, Jones assured me; and I kept them searching the walls in such places as my companions overlooked. Presently, under a large, bulging bluff, I saw a dark spot, which took {{the shape of a}} figure. This figure, I recollected, had been presented to my sight more than once, and now it stopped me. The hard climb up the slippery stones was fatiguing, but I did not hesitate, for I was determined to know. Once upon the ledge, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> yell that quickly set my companions in my direction. The figure I had seen was a dark, red devil, a painted image, rude, unspeakably wild, crudely executed, but painted by the hand of man. The whole surface of the cliff wall bore figures of all shapes--men, mammals, birds and strange devices, some in red paint, mostly in yellow. Some showed the wear of time; others were clear and sharp.|$|E
5000|$|... "Anamika, please stop," [...] {{she whispered}} urgently.If she really didn't {{want me to}} she could scream or move away or kick me. [...] "You're beautiful," [...] I said as I slid my hand between her thighs where her bloomers should have been. She closed her eyes again, but this time I couldn't tell if she was enjoying it or not. I pushed with my finger. I wasn't slow, the way I had been with India and Rani. I was afraid if I was too gentle she would use it to move away. I used all the force <b>I</b> could muster.She <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> howl. [...] "Stop, it hurts."I pulled back and said, [...] "I just fucked you." [...] There was blood on my finger. (Chapter xviii) ...|$|R
60|$|What a {{good and}} happy life might be spent in a paradise like this! And yet, at that very moment, the besotted Duke (ah! <b>I</b> have <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> secret which <b>I</b> meant to keep to myself; but the ten shillings must pay for all) was in that very garden (for the guide told us so, and cautioned our young people {{not to be too}} uproarious), and, if in a {{condition}} for arithmetic, was thinking of nothing nobler than how many ten-shilling tickets had that day been sold. Republican as I am, I should still love to think that noblemen lead noble lives, and that all this stately and beautiful environment may serve to elevate them a little way above the rest of us. If it fail to do so, the disgrace falls equally upon the whole race of mortals as on themselves; because it proves that no more favorable conditions of existence would eradicate our vices and weaknesses. How sad, if this be so! Even a herd of swine, eating the acorns under those magnificent oaks of Blenheim, would be cleanlier and of better habits than ordinary swine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] {{the young}} man answered, still in the same half-guilty tone of voice as before. [...] "He's of a {{poisonous}} kind, you know; but his fangs have been extracted. He won't do you any injury. He's perfectly harmless. Aren't you, Sardanapalus? Eh, eh, my beauty? But I oughtn't to have let him loose in the carriage, of course," [...] he added, after a short pause. [...] "It's calculated to alarm a nervous passenger. Only I thought I was alone, and nobody would come in; so <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him <b>out</b> for <b>a</b> bit of a run between the stations. It's so dull for him, poor fellow, being shut up in his box {{all the time when}} he's travelling." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{my first}} idea to have crawled, and then I thought speed was the main thing, and stood half up to make a rush. The same moment from somewhere {{between me and the}} sea there came a flash and a report, and a rifle bullet screeched in my ear. I swung {{straight}} round and up with my gun, but the brute had a Winchester, and before I could as much as see him his second shot knocked me over like a nine-pin. I seemed to fly in the air, then came down by the run and lay half a minute, silly; and then I found my hands empty, and my gun had flown over my head as I fell. It makes a man mighty wide awake to be in the kind of box that I was in. I scarcely knew where I was hurt, or whether I was hurt or not, but turned right over on my face to crawl after my weapon. Unless you have tried to get about with a smashed leg you don't know what pain is, and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> howl like a bullock's.|$|E
5000|$|The Simpsons creator Matt Groening named Nelson {{after the}} wrestling {{hold of the}} same name. Nelson was also said to be named after popular Brat Pack actor Judd Nelson, who portrayed the {{character}} John Bender in the eighties classic The Breakfast Club, partially of whom Nelson Muntz's character has similarities. Cast member Nancy Cartwright voices the character, which {{first appeared in the}} fifth episode of the first season, [...] "Bart the General" [...] (1990). American voice actress Dana Hill was first supposed to provide Nelson's voice, and attended the read-through of the episode. However, as Cartwright wrote in her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, [...] "the producers were still putting together this ensemble of actors and, come Monday, at the recording, she {{was nowhere to be found}} and the part was assigned to me. I didn't have time to ask why and I still don't have a clue." [...] Cartwright also commented that when she first found out she would be voicing Nelson, [...] "I asked myself, 'What does a bully sound like?' Well... what you hear is what you get. When I first uttered, 'I'll get you after school, man!' <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> sigh of relief when I got through the line and a double-sigh when it got a laugh." ...|$|E
6000|$|As I became better {{acquainted with}} Takahashi I learned {{to think more}} of the Japanese. I studied Takahashi very earnestly and I grew to like him. The Orientals are mystics and hard to understand. But any one could see that here was a Japanese who was a real man. I never saw him idle. He resented being told what to do, and after my first offense in this regard I never gave him another order. He was a {{wonderful}} cook. It pleased his vanity to see how good an appetite I always had. When I would hail him: [...] "George, what you got to eat?" [...] he would grin and reply: [...] "Aw, turkee!" [...] Then <b>I</b> would <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> yell, for <b>I</b> {{never in my life}} tasted anything so good as the roast wild turkey Takahashi served us. Or he would say: [...] "Pan-cakes--apple dumplings--rice puddings." [...] No one but the Japs know how to cook rice. I asked him how he cooked rice over an open fire and he said: [...] "I know how hot--when done." [...] Takahashi must have possessed an uncanny knowledge of the effects of heat. How swift, clean, efficient and saving he was! He never wasted anything. In these days of American prodigality a frugal cook like Takahashi was a revelation. Seldom are the real producers of food ever wasters. Takahashi's ambition was to be a rancher in California. I learned many things about him. In summer he went to the Imperial Valley where he picked and packed cantaloupes. He could stand the intense heat. He was an expert. He commanded the highest wage. Then he was a raisin-picker, which for him was another art. He had accumulated a little fortune and knew how to save his money. He would have been a millionaire in Japan, but he intended to live in the United States.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{for all my}} {{admiration and}} alarm, neither I nor anyone else thought it wrong to outwit his {{violence}} or his rigour; and his lack of suspicion and a certain helplessness made that easy while it stirred our affection. When I must have been still a very little boy, {{seven or eight years}} old perhaps, an uncle called me out of bed one night, to ride the five or six miles to Rosses Point to borrow a railway-pass from a cousin. My grandfather had one, but thought it dishonest to let another use it, but the cousin was not so particular. <b>I</b> was <b>let</b> <b>out</b> through <b>a</b> gate that opened upon a little lane beside the garden away from ear-shot of the house, and rode delighted through the moonlight, and awoke my cousin in the small hours by tapping on his window with a whip. I was home again by two or three in the morning and found the coachman waiting in the little lane. My grandfather would not have thought such an adventure possible, for every night at eight he believed that the stable-yard was locked, and {{he knew that he was}} brought the key. Some servant had once got into trouble at night and so he had arranged that they should all be locked in. He never knew, what everybody else in the house knew, that for all the ceremonious bringing of the key the gate was never locked.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh bad--very bad! Poor chap, he got excited, and do blaspeam terribly, since <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> some gossip by accident--the more to my blame. But there--you must excuse {{a man in}} {{suffering}} for what he says, and I hope God will forgive him." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> {{the best}} of it first--that is to say, I told him what I have related in the {{preceding}} pages. Fritz was deeply interested: full of compassion for Jack Straw, but not in the least converted to my aunt's confidence in him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do in {{the winter}} time, {{but not in the}} summer. I've got a tidy farm down the river <b>a</b> bit, and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> my hosses to the company to haul timber. It's cash money, you see, when the haulin' is goin' on." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was up on}} {{the deck}} when a yell from below made me jump. I ran back. Some one was holding my rod, and on the instant that a huge {{swordfish}} got the bait had not {{the presence of mind}} to throw off the drag and <b>let</b> <b>out</b> line. We hurried to put on another flying-fish and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> the line.|$|R

6000|$|... "Having {{got as far}} as that, I {{stopped to}} {{consider}} how I should put the questions to him that I was burning to ask. But I was too confused, I suppose, or perhaps too impatient to consider. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> what was uppermost in my mind, in the words that came first.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>let</b> him {{pray for}} a short time undisturbed, and then as I was about to suggest that we had better be pushing along one of the bears in our rear <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> roar that made the earth fairly tremble beneath our feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I wasn't going to. Half the {{pleasure}} of a feeling lies {{in being able to}} express it {{on the spur of the}} moment, and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>out</b> mine.
