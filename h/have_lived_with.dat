She was prioress by 1521 and held the post until {{the dissolution of the}} priory in 1538. Later she seems to <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> her sister Agnes Beech and nephew John. One of the other nuns at Black Ladies at the dissolution was Alys Beech, possibly a relative.|$|E
25|$|Elias {{was the son}} {{of another}} Elias Naudain and Jahel Arnaud. They were both native to La Tremblade, Santonge, France and were {{naturalized}} in London in 1682. Jahel Arnaud came to America with her four children about 1686, probably within a year after the death of her first husband, {{and was one of the}} first colonists of Narragansett. She married Jacob Ratier there and moved to New York City when the Narragansett Colony disbanded in 1691. She is believed to <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> her son, Elias, in Delaware after Jacob died in late 1702 and to have died there in 1720 or 1721.|$|E
25|$|Cocea's {{marriages and}} {{relationships}} resulted in four children: Tantzi, Dina, Radu and Ioana-Maria (also known as Maria Cocea). Florica Mille, {{who was his}} first wife, left him for his many affairs with younger women, even though, Dina Cocea recalls, she was forever fascinated by his intellect. After the 1920 divorce, Cocea is said to <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> a Maria or Zoe Grigorescu. Tantzi, who was born to him from this relationship (1909), was the first wife of Liviu Ciulley (father of the award-winning filmmaker Liviu Ciulei). The writer's second marriage, to Lila Stănescu, was allegedly one of convenience, and {{he was at the}} time still in a physical relationship with Gina Manolescu-Strunga, the reason for his statutory rape trial. Their affair continued even after Gina married art critic Petru Comarnescu, and she was carrying Cocea's child when that marriage was annulled.|$|E

500|$|Murasaki {{may have}} died in 1014. Her father made a hasty return to Kyoto from his post at Echigo Province that year, {{possibly}} because of her death. Writing in A Bridge of Dreams: A Poetics of [...] "The Tale of Genji", Shirane mentions that 1014 is generally accepted as the date of Murasaki Shikibu's death and 973 as the date of her birth, making her 41 when she died. Bowring considers 1014 to be speculative, and believes she may <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> Shōshi until as late as 1025. Waley agrees given that Murasaki may have attended ceremonies with Shōshi held for her son, Emperor Go-Ichijō around 1025.|$|E
500|$|Films {{should be}} realistic, which is {{possible}} only when the filmmakers <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> the popular masses, much like {{the ideal of the}} revolutionaries of the Korean resistance. However, this [...] "realism" [...] entails unadulterated worship for the leader and Juche, making it incomparable to conventional types of realism in film, like Italian neorealism. Kim builds on the idea that contemporary North Korea has transcended class conflict and no real conflicts exist to be portrayed in cinema, bar historical and external ones. This {{can be seen as a}} reassertion of the Stalinist Zhdanov Doctrine. No [...] "negative people" [...] who would disagree with the party's policies can exist. Depicting conflicts within North Korean society in film could be considered being critical of the regime. When historical themes are depicted, traditions should be portrayed selectively to support present ideological needs, purged of [...] "feudal ideologies" [...] of traditional tales and legends.|$|E

A recent statement by the Brotherhood on the issue of violence and assassinations condemned the killing of [...] "Sheikh Osama bin Laden" [...] by the United States, saying: [...] "The whole world, and especially the Muslims, <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> a fierce media campaign to brand Islam as terrorism and describe the Muslims as violent by blaming the September 11th incident on al-Qaeda." ...|$|E

On 17 May 2015, Querétaro progressed to the semi-finals after defeating Veracruz 4–3 aggregate. In the second match, Ronaldinho scored a free kick {{with the help}} of the opponent's goalkeeper who made contact with the ball. In June 2015, Ronaldinho, now 35, announced his departure from the club and thanked the Mexican people and fans of Querétaro: [...] “I want to thank all the Mexican nation for all the days that I <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> people so special, you will be forever in my heart.

2500|$|Davis won {{the first}} ranking event of the 1988/1989 season with a 12–6 win over White in the International Open; in the same match, {{he became the first}} player to make three {{consecutive}} century breaks in a major tournament. In October, Davis won the Grand Prix, beating Alex Higgins 10–6 in the final to hold the World, UK, Masters, Grand Prix, Classic and Irish Masters titles simultaneously. However, his four-year unbeaten run at the UK Championship came to an end in December with a 3–9 semi-final loss to Hendry. He did not win another major title that season until the 1989 World Championship, where he beat Hendry 16–9 in the semi-finals before going on to complete the heaviest victory in a world final of the modern era with an 18–3 win over John Parrott, his last world championship. This match in particular was regarded as one of his greatest performances, and was cited in the Guinness Book of Snooker as [...] "The greatest display of potting, break building and safety play ever seen" [...] with the further observation [...] "no-one could <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> Davis the way he played at the Crucible in 1989". In October he retained the Grand Prix, beating Dean Reynolds 10–0 in the final, the first whitewash in a ranking event final. By the end of the 1980s, Davis was snooker's first millionaire.|$|E
2500|$|The funeral {{took place}} on Wednesday 16 October 1940 at [...] in Brunswick Square, Herne Bay, Kent. The Reverend A.W. Parry Williams officiated {{in the church and}} at the committal by the graveside; there was a surpliced choir at the church service, and the organ played I know that my Redeemer liveth from Handel's Messiah as the coffin was borne into the church. There were many mourners {{including}} the Sultan at the church and cemetery, and a large number of floral tributes. The Sultan's wreath was [...] "laid in the grave with the coffin". The interment was at Herne Bay Cemetery at Eddington. [...] In plot BBR46 at {{the eastern edge of the}} cemetery is an elaborate, marble monument to her; it is blue and white like her house. It was paid for by the Sultan and adorned with a standing Saxon-style cross, a marble floor with an engraved poem and an iron fence. The inscription says: [...] "In loving memory of Lydia Cecily Hill; born 20th July 1913; died 11th October 1940. [...] This monument has been erected by a devoted friend. Somewhere back of the sunset / Where loveliness never dies / She dwells in the land of glory/ 'Neath the blue and gold of the skies / And we who <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> and loved her / Whose passing has caused us tears / Will cherish her memory for ever / Down through the passing years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Oral {{tradition}} in the Spokane area may give an entirely different account of this child. This tradition holds that, {{in the fall of}} 1853, John Mullan met and married Mary Ann Finley (or [...] "Finlay"), granddaughter of Jaco Finlay. Her age is unclear; she was born in either 1834 or 1836, making her either 19 or 17 years of age {{at the time of her}} marriage. She was one-half Native American. On June 9, 1855, Mary Ann died giving birth to a son, whom she named Peter Mullan. Historian Glen Adams argues that Peter Mullan was not John Mullan's child. Rather, a full-blood Native American probably impregnated Mary Ann, and that Peter is the boy whom John Mullan raised for a time. (Whether there was a John Mullan III in addition to Peter Mullan is not resolved by Adams.) Mullan biographers Louis C. Coleman and Leo Rieman examined much of the same evidence, and came to the same conclusions as Adams. Historian Keith Petersen, however, argues that it is plausible that Mullan fathered Peter Mullan. He argues that there is confusion over whether the mother was Mary Ann Finley or another woman, Rose Laurant. Laurant was Salish, and she may <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> the Bitterroot Salish in 1853 when John Mullan was in the same area. Limited evidence in the oral tradition confuses Finley with Laurant, Petersen believes, and he concludes (a) that Peter Mullan is not the same person as John Mullan III, and (b) it is not unreasonable to believe that Peter Mullan was John Mullan's biological son.|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West and Trefusis eloped {{several times}} from 1918 on, mostly to France. While there Sackville-West {{dressed as a}} man when they went out together. The affair ended badly. The mothers of both women, Lady Sackville and Mrs. Keppel, joined forces to {{sabotage}} the relationship and force both women back to their husbands. Both women were deeply interested in Spain, especially the Spanish Romany, with Trefusis writing to Sackville-West that they should go to Spain to show [...] "you my pupil, I as your cicerone...I will show eyes of black velvet...the sevillana, the fandango, undulating bodies, throbbing castanets". In another letter, Trefusis wrote of her wish to live forever in Spain with Sackville-West, [...] "a world of sun and love, and singing, and dancing". Trefusis sought to appeal to Sackville-West's fascination with the Romany people by telling {{her that she was}} turning into a [...] "Gypsy", writing: [...] "They said, this evening after you gone, that you were like a dazzling Gypsy. A Gypsy potentate, a sovereign-what you will, but still a Gypsy". Trefusis and Sackville-West both used Romany phrases to express intensely held feelings such as man camelo tuti ("I can't live without you"), nonero jeli ("our love"), and sartute loude gayeres ("escape with you"). Both families were concerned that the women were creating scandal. In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Trefusis, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "I never ought to marry you or anybody else; I ought just to <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> you {{for as long as you}} wanted me...I ought never to have married until I was thirty. I really think that is the best solution for people like me. Women ought to have the freedom the same as men when they are young. It's a rotten and ridiculous system at present, it's simply cheating one of one's youth. It was all right for the Victorians. But this generation is disregarding, and next will have disregarded, the chrysalis." [...] At another point, Sackville-West wrote to Nicolson [...] "if wasn't for you, I would go off with V." [...] Trefusis continued to pursue Sackville-West to great lengths until Sackville-West's affairs with other women finally took their toll. In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote in her diary that she was [...] "down on" [...] herself with [...] "serious thoughts" [...] of suicide as she believed that Nicolson [...] "would be happier without" [...] her in the world. [...] The two women apparently made a bond to remain faithful to one another, meaning that although both were married, neither could engage in sexual relations with her own husband. Sackville-West, who already had two children by Nicholson, was prompted to end the affair when she heard allegations that Trefusis had been involved sexually with her own husband, indicating that she had broken their bond. When she decided to end the affair with Trefusis, Sackville-West again contemplated suicide, writing in her diary that she [...] "hated myself to the extent of thinking I better vanish" [...] from the world forever. Despite the rift, the two women were devoted to one another, and deeply in love. They continued to have occasional liaisons for a number of years afterwards, but never rekindled the affair.|$|E
