5000|$|An {{approach}} to the design and development of reliable product to prevent failure, based on the knowledge of root cause failure mechanisms. The Physics of Failure (PoF) concept {{is based on the}} understanding of the relationships between requirements and the physical characteristics of the product and their variation in the manufacturing processes, and the reaction of product elements and materials to loads (stressors) and interaction under loads and their influence on the <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> with respect to the use conditions and time.|$|E

There are many definitions of data quality but data is generally considered high quality if it is [...] "fit for its intended uses in operations, decision making and planning.". Alternatively, data is deemed of high quality if it correctly represents the real-world construct to which it refers. Furthermore, apart from these definitions, as data volume increases, the question of internal data consistency becomes significant, regardless of <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> for any particular external purpose. People's views on data quality can often be in disagreement, even when discussing the same set of data used for the same purpose. Data cleansing may be required in order to ensure data quality.|$|E
5000|$|Limit state design (LSD), {{also known}} as load and {{resistance}} factor design (LRFD), refers to a design method used in structural engineering. A limit state is a condition of a structure beyond which it no longer fulfills the relevant design criteria. [...] The condition may refer to a degree of loading or other actions on the structure, while the criteria refer to structural integrity, <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>use,</b> durability or other design requirements. A structure designed by LSD is proportioned to sustain all actions likely to occur during its design life, and to remain fit for use, with an appropriate level of reliability for each limit state. Building codes based on LSD implicitly define the appropriate levels of reliability by their prescriptions.|$|E

30|$|Resolution {{is a key}} notion to {{the field}} of {{geographic}} information science (GIScience): it is critical in determining a data set’s <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> a given <b>use</b> (see [1]), and influences the patterns that can be observed during an analysis process (see [2]). In addition, as Goodchild [3] pointed out, resolution determines the volume of data which is generated and therefore the processing costs and storage volume. Finally, resolution is necessarily present in any data collection process because the world is too complex to be studied in its full detail (see for instance [1] and [4]).|$|R
