In particular, the energy of nonlinear localized excitations centered on the bending decreases when curvature increases, i. <b>e.</b> <b>bending</b> manifests itself as a trap for excitations. Moreover, the potential of this trap is double-well, thus leading to a symmetry breaking phenomenon: a symmetric stationary state may become unstable and transform into an energetically favorable asymmetric stationary state. The essentials of symmetry breaking are examined analytically for a simplified model.
