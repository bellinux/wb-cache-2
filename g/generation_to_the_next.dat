5|$|Repeat {{this process}} {{a number of}} times, {{randomly}} reproducing each generation of marbles to form the next. The numbers of red and blue marbles picked each generation fluctuates; sometimes more red and sometimes more blue. This fluctuation is analogous to genetic drift– {{a change in the}} population's allele frequency resulting from a random variation in the distribution of alleles from one <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} {{column for the}} Detroit Free Press, Marta Salij said that Cal's {{identity}} crisis resembles Odysseus's fate. Whereas the mythical hero is troubled by Poseidon and succored by Athena, the intersex protagonist is affected by his chromosomes in a similar manner. John Sykes, professor of English and religion education, noted another Greek-hero reference. In {{a manner similar to}} Oedipus's fulfillment of Pythia's prophecy to slay his father and marry his mother, Callie validates the prediction her grandmother made before her birth by adopting a male identity. Eugenides also used the allusions to Greek mythology and modern pop music to show the passing of familial traits and idiosyncrasies from one <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, {{what they}} knew (their empirical observations) about {{the different kinds of}} plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture from one <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed from one <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> via DNA, a {{molecule}} that encodes genetic information. DNA {{is a long}} biopolymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, {{in a manner similar}} to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E

50|$|Deprivation passes {{down from}} one <b>generation</b> of women <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next,</b> leading <b>to</b> a {{perpetual}} feminization of poverty. The main reason behind this {{cycle of poverty}} is the lower earnings of women, due to having {{to care for their}} offspring. In many places, persistent gender discrimination in the work force does not allow the majority of women quality work.|$|R
50|$|Selection {{operators}} give {{preference to}} better solutions (chromosomes), {{allowing them to}} pass on their 'genes' <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> of <b>the</b> algorithm. The best solutions are determined using some form of objective function (also known as a 'fitness function' in genetic algorithms), before being passed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crossover operator. Different methods for choosing the best solutions exist, for example, fitness proportionate selection and tournament selection; different methods may choose different solutions as being 'best'. The selection operator may also simply pass the best solutions from <b>the</b> current <b>generation</b> directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> without being mutated; {{this is known as}} elitism or elitist selection.|$|R

30|$|Similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{proposed}} {{method in}} 5 – 2 - 4 for GB-LCA, at first all chromosomes of current population, children chromosomes and mutation chromosomes must be merged and then npmembers with lower cost are selected as population of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> generation. Therefore, in this method, the best chromosomes of each <b>generation</b> are transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> and <b>the</b> historical {{memory of the}} algorithm is preserved.|$|R
50|$|Besides a {{plot that}} is both {{colourful}} and rich of intrigue, the novel focuses on the actual struggle for control over Ancient Rome and specifically on the acts of heroism and heroic deaths therein. For this fact it was quickly considered a novel for boys in the German Empire, newly founded in 1871; the book was continuously handed over from the previous <b>generation</b> of adolescents <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> until <b>the</b> 1940s.|$|R
25|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in eukaryotes is {{a process}} whereby organisms form offspring that combine genetic traits from both parents. Chromosomes are passed on from one <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> in this process.

25|$|For most of {{the history}} of the Upper House, Lords Temporal were landowners who held their estates, titles and seats as an {{hereditary}} right passed down from one <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> – in some cases for centuries. In 1910, for example, there were nineteen whose title was created before 1500.|$|E
25|$|Rocket League {{has been}} one of the leading titles in {{supporting}} cross-platform play between personal computers and multiple consoles. Dunham sees cross-platform play helps establish a stable player base and avoid the snowball effect that can cause isolated player bases on individual platforms to wane, particularly in the transition from one console <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike organisms, a gene {{is passed}} down from a <b>generation</b> of organisms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> either as perfect replicas of itself or as {{slightly}} mutated descendant genes. While organisms have ancestry graphs and progeny graphs via sexual reproduction, a gene has a single chain of ancestors and a tree of descendants. An organism produced by sexual cross-fertilization (allogamy) has at least two ancestors (its immediate parents), but a gene always has one ancestor per generation.|$|R
30|$|Mutation Mutation {{operator}} makes a new mutated chromosome {{by making}} a random modification. Mutation operator is used from one <b>generation</b> of population <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next,</b> <b>to</b> avoid getting trapped in local optimum. In this study, the mutation operates as follows: first, for each column of solution matrix (i.e., for each decision variable), two points (r 1, r 2) are randomly selected, and then, each point is replaced by the other one. Subsequently, the feasibility of the new offspring is checked; if the new solution was feasible, we regard it {{as a part of}} new generation.|$|R
40|$|We {{have created}} a genetic {{algorithm}} {{that can be used}} for exploring the design space of processors. We evaluate the performance of this algorithm on a large design space using a subset of the SPEC 2000 benchmarks. Our algorithm uses fixed size generations that have an odd number of entities. Each transition occurs through the use of stochastic sampling followed by 2 -point crossover and mutation. Furthermore the fittest entity in each <b>generation</b> is propagated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> unchanged. We have found that our algorithm is e#ective at finding good processor designs. ...|$|R
25|$|Triple X {{is due to}} {{a random}} event. Triple X can result either during the {{division}} of the mother's reproductive cells or during division of cells during early development.

Diagnosis is by chromosomal analysis.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} other generic terms, there are many {{definitions}} of tradition. The concept includes a number of interrelated ideas; the unifying one is that tradition refers to beliefs, objects or customs performed or believed in the past, originating in it, transmitted through time by being taught by one <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next,</b> and are performed or believed in the present.|$|E
25|$|Studies of Paramecium {{have contributed}} to our {{understanding}} of the function of meiosis. Like all ciliates, Paramecium has a polyploid macronucleus, and one or more diploid micronuclei.
