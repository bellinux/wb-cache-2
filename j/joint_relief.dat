40|$|This paper investigates {{experimentally}} a tubular bonded butt specimen {{with relief}} grooves carved {{close to the}} adherend-adhesive interface. The specimen is {{used to assess the}} strength of a thin adhesive layer, as usually occurs in structural bonded joints. Hence, this configuration overcomes the problems related to the differences in chemical and mechanical properties which could occur in bulk adhesive tests. The aim is to verify experimentally the reduction of the stress concentrations at the interface given by the presence of the grooves, observed in a previous numerical work of the authors. Finite element analyses show that the groove geometry adopted here, although slightly simplified with respectto the optimum shape previously proposed, produces a strong reduction of the edge effects. This work performs an indirect assessment by comparing tensile strength of bonded specimens with and without relief grooves. A two-level factorial experimental campaign is performed, according to Design of Experiment criteria. The variables are: presence of the grooves, adherends material, and adhesive thickness. The response of the tests is the maximum tensileload carried by the specimen which is found to depend strongly on the adherends’ materials. In the case of steel <b>joints,</b> the <b>relief</b> grooves near the adherend-adhesive interface lead to higher loads regardless of the adhesive thickness. In the case of aluminium <b>joints</b> the <b>relief</b> grooves play a minor role, while tensile strength decreases as the adhesive thickness increases...|$|R

40|$|Fatty acids {{with double}} bonds beyond the ninth carbon from the {{carboxyl}} end {{are classified as}} essential for human health, including omega- 3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA). The main sources of omega- 3 fatty acids are fatty fish species such as herring, mackerel, sardine and salmon. Oils from the marine algae Cryptecondium conchii are mainly rich in DHA only, while fish oil contains both EPA & DHA. Why is it important to microencapsulate EPA & DHA? Because these fatty acids cannot be synthesized by the human body but have to be obtained through nutrition uptake. The beneficial effects of these fatty acids including lowering cholesterol, decreasing the risk of arrhythmia, lowering the blood pressure, preventing diabetes in pregnancy, and positive effects on <b>joints</b> (<b>relief</b> of arthritis). EPA and DHA also {{play an important role}} in early infant nutrition and the imbalance of these fatty acids is believed to cause a variety of diseases. Because of their sensitivity to oxidation, these fatty acids need to be stabilized to protect them from oxidation. In food application, their interaction with other food ingredients needs to be prevented. Attempts to prevent oxidation to allow omega- 3 fatty acids to fulfill their functions are not trouble-free. Fish oils in their natural state have a taste and smell that make them less attractive to consumers. Processing technology for masking the smell and taste of fish oil in food faces great challenges. Therefore, to address the problems concerning the susceptibility of fish oil to oxidation and its unpleasant smell, microencapsulation, where the oil is packaged within coating materials, may be used to replace bulk oils. This paper discusses great challenges faced by the scientists to microencapsulate omega 3 fatty acids from fish oil after introducing concise information related to microencapsulation and its advance techniques. As the demand of functional food containing omega- 3 is continuously growing, overcoming those challenges mean solving one problem in providing healthy food for the worl...|$|R

As a latecomer to colonization, Germany repeatedly came into conflict with the established colonial powers and also with the United States, which opposed German attempts at colonial expansion in both the Caribbean and the Pacific. Native insurrections in German territories received prominent coverage in other countries, especially in Britain; the established powers had dealt with such uprisings decades earlier, often brutally, and had secured firm control of their colonies by then. The Boxer Rising in China, which the Chinese government eventually sponsored, began in the Shandong province, in part because Germany, as colonizer at Kiautschou, was an untested power and had only been active there for two years.

An instruction manual for responding to disasters had been developed and was exercised through drills. Action: In accordance with the manual, the hospital disaster task force was established. The Ishinomaki Zone <b>Joint</b> <b>Relief</b> Team coordinated medical support from organizations such as physicians associations, dental associations, self-defence forces medical teams, pharmacists associations, the Japanese Red Cross and relief teams from hospitals all over the country. In three days, the <b>joint</b> <b>relief</b> team directly visited all emergency shelters to make an initial assessment and to collect information about the number and state of health of evacuees, provision of food and drinking water and the availability of electricity, water and sewerage. Outcome: Initial assessment revealed that 35 emergency shelters lacked a sufficient food supply and that 100 shelters had unsanitary conditions.

40|$|Purpose: The squat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used exercises in sports training and competitions. There are several squat variations: i) the front squat (FS), ii) the high-bar back squat (HBS) and iii) the low-bar back squat (LBS). As the biomechanics of the LBS technique have been studied to a lesser extent, therefore the purpose of this pilot study was to analyze the differences in knee joint net muscle torque between the HBS and LBS. Methods: One healthy male subject (180. 0 cm, 76. 0 kg, 26 years) performed 10 steady paced squats (5 HBS and 5 LBS) with additional weight (40. 4 kg) to a 90 ° knee angle. Kinematic and kinetic data were gathered using a high-speed camcorder and a force plate, respectively. The maximal and average knee joint net muscle torques (Mmax and Mavg) were then calculated via 2 -dimensional inverse dynamics. Results: A significantly greater Mavg was observed using the HBS technique as compared to the LBS, both during the entire range of the squat (MavgHBS = 221. 6 ± 5. 1 Nm, MavgLBS= 203. 3 ± 10. 2 Nm; p = 0. 026) as well as during the eccentric (MavgHBS = 226. 0 ± 5. 9 Nm, MavgLBS= 202. 0 ± 14. 0 Nm; p = 0. 043) and concentric (MavgHBS = 216. 2 ± 3. 6 Nm, MavgLBS= 205. 0 ± 7. 9 Nm; p = 0. 021) phase separately. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the lower Mavg during the LBS could be due to the load transfer to the hip joint, most likely because of the greater anterior tilt of the torso, which is a direct response to a lower and more posterior bar placement on the back to finally maintain an unchanged centre of mass. Confirmation of these findings in a larger sample would imply that the LBS could be a more appropriate squat technique when knee <b>joint</b> <b>relief</b> is desired...|$|E
