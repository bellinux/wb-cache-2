5000|$|The WPF text engine also {{supports}} built-in spell checking. It {{also supports}} such features as automatic line spacing, enhanced international text, language-guided line breaking, <b>hyphenation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>justification,</b> bitmap effects, transforms, and text effects such as shadows, blur, glow, rotation etc. Animated text is also supported; this refers to animated glyphs, {{as well as}} real-time changes in position, size, color, and opacity of the text.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, desktop {{publishing}} became available, {{starting with the}} Apple Macintosh, Aldus PageMaker (and later QuarkXPress) and PostScript. Improvements in software and hardware, and rapidly lowering costs, popularized {{desktop publishing}} and enabled very fine control of typeset results much less expensively than the minicomputer dedicated systems. At the same time, word processing systems, such as Wang and WordPerfect, revolutionized office documents. They did not, however, have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complicated book layout, graphics, mathematics, or advanced <b>hyphenation</b> <b>and</b> <b>justification</b> rules (H and J).|$|E

5000|$|IBM {{created and}} {{inspired}} {{a family of}} typesetting languages with names that were derivatives of the word [...] "SCRIPT". Later versions of SCRIPT included advanced features, such as automatic generation of a table of contents and index, multicolumn page layout, footnotes, boxes, automatic <b>hyphenation</b> <b>and</b> spelling verification.|$|R

50|$|The hamlet is {{believed}} to have been founded as a medieval village. A writer in Notes and queries in 1932 noted that the Buslingthorpe (shared with Buslingthorpe, Leeds and Buckfastleigh, Devon) contains 13 different letters, exactly half the alphabet, none repeated <b>and</b> with no <b>hyphenation,</b> <b>and</b> wondered whether that was unique.|$|R
50|$|Taking English text as input, TJ-2 aligns {{left and}} right margins, {{justifying}} the output using white space <b>and</b> word <b>hyphenation.</b> Text is marked-up with single lowercase characters combined with the PDP-1's overline character, carriage returns, and internal concise codes. The computer's six toggle switches control the input and output devices, enable <b>and</b> disable <b>hyphenation</b> <b>and</b> stop the session. Words can be hyphenated with a light pen on the computer's CRT display and from the session's dictionary in memory.

25|$|The Paperwhite 3 is {{the first}} {{e-reader}} to include the Bookerly font, a new font designed by Amazon, and includes updated formatting functions such as <b>hyphenation</b> <b>and</b> improved spacing.

The official Amazon leather cover for the Paperwhite 3 is the same item as was used with the previous two Paperwhite devices.|$|R
25|$|Word {{processing}} {{added to}} the text editor {{the ability to control}} type style and size, to manage lines (word wrap), to format documents into pages, and to number pages. Functions now taken for granted were added incrementally, sometimes by purchase of independent providers of add-on programs. Spell checking, grammar checking and mail merge were {{some of the most popular}} add-ons for early word processors. Word processors are also capable of <b>hyphenation,</b> <b>and</b> the management and correct positioning of footnotes and endnotes.|$|R

Multi-language spell-checking, <b>hyphenation</b> <b>and</b> thesaurus is supported, and it has an integrated five-language translation dictionary (English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish).|$|R

Localised releases may include dictionaries for particular primary and secondary languages. Dictionaries are now available as downloadable extensions, separately for each language. Go-oo installation from version 3 on includes dictionaries in many languages, as a single extension, being a part of installation files. Inclusion of {{a large number of}} dictionaries in a default installation may affect performance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a method of}} effective handling of linguistic data by means of covering and inhibiting patterns – patterns that “compete” each other. A methodology of developing such patterns is outlined. Applications {{in the areas of}} morphology, <b>hyphenation</b> <b>and</b> part-of-speech tagging are shown. This pattern-driven approach to language engineering allows the combination of linguist expertise with the data learned from corpora – layering of knowledge. Searching for information in pattern database (dictionary problem) is blindingly fast – linear with respect to the length of searching word as with other finite-state approaches. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>hyphenation</b> of {{electrochemistry}} <b>and</b> solution-phase nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} spectrometry (EC-NMR) has made significant progress in several areas:. •dedicated NMR probes integrating the electrodes with minimal impact on spectral quality;•different strategies regarding the relative placement of electrodes versus magnet/radiofrequency coils;•solutions in aspects of the hyphenation, such as noise reduction strategies or 1 H NMR silent electrolytes;•applications, e. g., studies of oxidative metabolism and electronic polymers. Because EC-NMR has moved from sporadic reports to systematic investigation in this decade, we summarize the developments in this nascent field. We focus on aspects related to <b>hyphenation</b> <b>and</b> highlight applications and a newer development: miniaturized EC-NMR. EC-NMR should become increasingly valuable for fundamental and applied studies related to electrochemical reactions, partly because it is highly complementary to other techniques, such as EC-electron spin-resonance spectrometry and EC-mass spectrometry...|$|R
