500|$|Spanish {{critic and}} philosopher Miguel de Unamuno {{comments}} of the book, [...] "I never took Facundo by Sarmiento {{as a historical}} work, nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> very valued in that regard. I always {{thought of it as}} a literary work, as a historical novel". However, Facundo cannot be classified as a novel or a specific genre of literature. According to González Echevarría, the book is at once an [...] "essay, biography, autobiography, novel, epic, memoir, confession, political pamphlet, diatribe, scientific treatise, [...] travelogue". Sarmiento's style and his exploration of the life of Facundo unify the three distinct parts of his work. Even the first section, describing Argentina's geography, follows this pattern, since Sarmiento contends that Facundo is a natural product of this environment.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Woody Harrelson was {{attached}} to the film to play Ron Woodroof, but left the film because of financing issues. In 2002, Brad Pitt {{was attached}} to play the lead role. In June 2008, Ryan Gosling was in talks to join the film for the lead role to play Woodroof, but couldn't take the role. In 2009, producer Brenner sent the script to actor Matthew McConaughey and got him involved to star in the film. Wondering whether the Texas native was interested in playing another Texas native (he's originally from Uvalde), Brenner says that he asked himself: Who is Ron Woodroof?' And in my mind, it was Matthew. Like Ron, he's from Dallas, he's handsome, and he has a twinkle in the eye. Matthew also has intensity and intelligence like Ron did, mixed with that cowboy charisma and fighter's spirit. He was beyond perfect for the role." [...] Writer Borten said: [...] "Ron was a very charismatic, funny and persuasive, a real salesman. Even if he was making fun of you, you wanted him to continue because he was so charming. Matthew possesses a lot of those same qualities." [...] On March 9, 2011, Los Angeles Times confirmed that McConaughey would star in the film as Woodroof and quoted McConaughey as saying: [...] "It's a great script and a great story. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a great movie." [...] Woodroof's sister Sharon Woodroof Braden was reportedly pleased with the casting of McConaughey as Woodroof because he had a similar swagger and personality. She had shown concern earlier in the development process when Pitt and Gosling were attached, due to their personalities not matching Woodroof's.|$|E
500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E

60|$|Well, it is {{the anxiety}} and {{fretting}} about colds, and fevers, and draughts, and getting our feet wet, and about forbidden food eaten in terror of indigestion, that brings on the cold and the fever and the indigestion and the most of our other ailments; and so, if the Science can banish that anxiety from the world <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> reduce the world's disease and pain about four-fifths.|$|R

[...] It is also {{said to have been}} {{strongly}} influenced by his new girlfriend, Ulla Munch, from Vanløse in Copenhagen, Denmark. The album also emphasized the distance Morrison had moved away from R and was inspired by Irish music. He commented at the time, [...] "It's important for people to get into the music of their own culture... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> dangerous to not validate the music of where you're from, for anybody, whether it's Bulgaria or whatever." ...|$|E

Trumka {{was asked to}} respond to the possibility that some coal companies might hire permanent replacement workers. He told the Associated Press in September 1993, [...] "I'm saying if you strike a match and you put your finger in it, you're likely to get burned." [...] He also said, [...] "That doesn't mean I'm threatening to burn you. That just means if you strike the match, and you put your finger in it, common sense will tell you it'll burn your finger. Common sense will tell you that in these strikes, that when you inject scabs, a number of things happen. And a confrontation is one of the potentials that can happen. Do I want it to happen? Absolutely not. Do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> happen? Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> happen."

40|$|What {{has been}} called the “affective turn” at this year’s MLA {{reflects}} a growing interest in questions of emotion and affect in humanities research. My own work makes use of theories of emotion and affect to think about modern and contemporary poetry, and my feminist approach to this research has led me to seek out theories of affect that account for gender, or to critique or reformulate theories that don’t.
