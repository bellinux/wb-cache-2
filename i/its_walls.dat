5|$|A small {{offering}} chapel is adjoining {{the eastern}} side of the main pyramid and is barely visible today. It consisted of a central two pillared room with a large quartzite false door and two narrow chambers on the sides. Like the mortuary temple, the chapel was floored with black basalt. <b>Its</b> <b>walls</b> however were made of Tura limestone and granite and were adorned with fine reliefs of offering scenes.|$|E

5|$|During the Samaritan {{revolt of}} 529, Bethlehem was sacked and <b>its</b> <b>walls</b> and the Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on {{the orders of}} the Emperor Justinian I. In 614, the Persian Sassanid Empire, {{supported}} by Jewish rebels, invaded Palestina Prima and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the magi depicted in Persian clothing in a mosaic.|$|E
5|$|Her {{interest}} in {{education has been}} one of her most obvious surviving charitable legacies. She founded schools in all the villages surrounding the Roseberys' estates. The Mentmore estate alone was serviced by three schools founded by her at Wingrave, Cheddington and Mentmore itself. Not only were the children educated at her expense by trained teachers, each was also provided with seasonal gifts of new clothes. Cheddington School remains in its original building with her cypher on <b>its</b> <b>walls,</b> while Wingrave School, which opened in 1877, survives in new premises.|$|E

The outer ring, which is built of load-bearing brick, includes all four exterior {{walls and the}} library carrel spaces immediately inside them. The middle ring, which is built of reinforced concrete, holds the heavy book stacks. The inner ring is a dramatic atrium with enormous circular openings in <b>its</b> <b>walls</b> that reveal several floors of book stacks.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the fort}} is leased to the Malta Film Commission, {{and it has been}} used {{extensively}} as a location for various films and serials. In recent years, huge sets were built within <b>its</b> <b>walls</b> for the films Gladiator (2000), Troy (2004) and Agora (2009). In these films, the fort stood in as Rome, Troy and Alexandria respectively. The fort was also used in the filming of Assassin's Creed (2016).|$|E
5|$|On both {{approach}}es, the dropoff is steep {{enough for}} Highway 82 {{to require a}} 6% grade and switchbacks: one on the west and three on the east. The former approach uses the narrow valley of the Roaring Fork River, {{a tributary of the}} Colorado, which rises from Independence Lake west of the pass. <b>Its</b> <b>walls</b> are steeper but shallower than those of the North Fork of Lake Creek, which drains into Twin Lakes Reservoir and the headwaters of the Arkansas River, on the east.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rooms in}} the state suite include the Red Room— so called because <b>its</b> <b>walls</b> are covered in red brocade— a large drawing room {{containing}} paintings by Jan Brueghel and Charles Le Brun. Like much of the palace the room contains ornate 18th-century French-style furniture. From the Red Room leads the York Room. Furnished as a state bedchamber, this room is frescoed with illustrations of the four seasons by Gregorio de Ferrari. The following room, known as the Yellow Room (or sometimes as the Louis XV Bedchamber), is another state bedroom.|$|E

5|$|The Dening Hall has Daoist murals {{painted on}} three of <b>its</b> <b>walls.</b> The western wall's mural, {{said to have}} been painted in the Tang Dynasty, {{measures}} 17 by 7 meters and features a local water deity with a winged being at the top. With similar dimensions to the western mural, the eastern mural portrays the Dragon King. The hall contains nine statues, all dating from a more recent period than the hall.|$|E
5|$|The Round Church {{contains}} many medieval inscriptions, both official and scratched on <b>its</b> <b>walls</b> as graffiti. One study counted {{a total of}} 193signs and 30drawings, the vast majority bearing some kind of Christian symbolism. As a whole, the epigraphy of the Round Church dates from the 10th century, and three alphabets are represented: the Greek, the Glagolitic, and the Cyrillic, {{as well as two}} languages: Byzantine Greek and Old Bulgarian (the eastern Bulgarian recension of Old Church Slavonic). The Glagolitic inscriptions of the Round Church bear evidence that the use of that alphabet in Preslav continued alongside Cyrillic.|$|E
5|$|The rectory is a Grade II listed {{building}} and stands opposite the village pond. A building of several periods, the rectory was first {{built in the}} 17th century although includes 18th and 19th century additions. The building consists of two storeys with an exposed timber-framed core, with taller attachments at the south. A tiled roof is hipped {{at the north end}} and <b>its</b> <b>walls</b> consist of red brick with Flemish Bond. A K6 telephone box beside the village pond is also Grade II listed. The telephone box was designed in 1935 by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and was made by various contractors.|$|E

5|$|The {{respective}} remits of the National and Tate Galleries, {{which had}} long been contested by the two institutions, were more clearly defined in 1996. 1900 was established as the cut-off point for paintings in the National Gallery, and in 1997 more than 60 post-1900 paintings from the collection {{were given to the}} Tate on a long-term loan, in return for works by Gauguin and others. However, future expansion of the National Gallery may yet see the return of 20th-century paintings to <b>its</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{framework of}} the building utilises a simple system of reinforced concrete beams and slabs, and was originally clad in square mosaic and rectangular ceramic tiles on <b>its</b> <b>walls</b> and columns. The building's foundation comprises large diameter bored piles installed in decomposed sandstone. Beams span an average 7.6 metres except at the main entrance where post-tensioned concrete beams span 15 metres. The auditorium is roofed over by 24-metre long steel trusses with a composite reinforced concrete covering.|$|E
5|$|With the Ordos now {{adequately}} fortified, the Mongols avoided <b>its</b> <b>walls</b> by riding east {{to invade}} Datong and Xuanfu (宣府; present-day Xuanhua, Hebei Province), which were two major garrisons guarding {{the corridor to}} Beijing where no walls had been built. The two defence lines of Xuanfu and Datong left by the Northern Qi and the early Ming had deteriorated by this point, and {{for all intents and}} purposes the inner line was the capital's main line of defence.|$|E

5|$|Although the College {{building}} was saved from the war, <b>its</b> <b>walls</b> and roof {{were left in}} a perilous state. In 1954 a decision was forced upon heralds, whether to abandon the old building (which would have been profitable financially) or repair it on a scale far beyond the College's resources. Eventually {{with the help of}} the Ministry of Works and a public subscription, the {{building was}} repaired in time for the College's 4th centenary of being in possession of Derby Place. The present gates to the building were added in 1956, and came originally from Goodrich Court in Herefordshire. The new gates displayed the College's arms and crest.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of <b>its</b> <b>walls.</b> In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
5|$|Constantine's {{advisers}} and generals cautioned against preemptive attack on Maxentius; even his soothsayers recommended against it, {{stating that the}} sacrifices had produced unfavorable omens. Constantine, with a spirit that left a deep impression on his followers, inspiring some {{to believe that he}} had some form of supernatural guidance, ignored all these cautions. Early in the spring of 312AD, Constantine crossed the Cottian Alps with a quarter of his army, a force numbering about 40,000. The first town his army encountered was Segusium (Susa, Italy), a heavily fortified town that shut its gates to him. Constantine ordered his men to set fire to its gates and scale <b>its</b> <b>walls.</b> He took the town quickly. Constantine ordered his troops not to loot the town, and advanced with them into northern Italy.|$|E

50|$|Volborthella {{has been}} {{described}} as a 'failed attempt in mineralisation'; it constructed <b>its</b> <b>wall</b> by agglutinating grains of sediment, much like some foramanifera, and declined in conjunction with the origin of truly-biomineralising organisms. However, its similarity to Salterella, which contained embedded sediment grains in <b>its</b> mineralised <b>wall,</b> suggests a possible biological relationship - Salterella may have begun to mineraluse <b>its</b> agglutinated <b>wall.</b> Some Volborthella specimens do show taphonomic hints that some form of lightly mineralised sheath may have enclosed its agglutinated shell.|$|R
