40|$|Different {{beliefs about}} how fair social {{competition}} {{is and what}} <b>determines</b> <b>income</b> inequality, influence the redistributive policy chosen democratically in a society. But the composition of income {{in the first place}} depends on equilibrium tax policies. If a society believes that individual effort <b>determines</b> <b>income,</b> and that all have a right to enjoy the fruits of their effort, it will chose low redistribution and low taxes. In equilibrium effort will be high, the role of luck limited, market outcomes will be quite fair, and social beliefs will be self-fulfilled. If instead a society believes that luck, birth, connections and/or corruption determine wealth, it will tax a lot, thus distorting allocations and making these beliefs self-sustained as well. We show how this interaction between social beliefs and welfare policies may lead to multiple equilibria or multiple steady states. We argue that this model can contribute to explain US vis a vis continental European perceptions about income inequality and choices of redistributive policies. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report {{was to examine the}} {{relationship}} of household income distribution in agriculture-dependent counties in the NOgrth Central region with selected social policy and structural endowment variables. Data for the analysis included information on 397 non-metropolitan counties in the 13 -state region for the years 1960, 1970, and 1980. Income distribution was measured using the Gini coefficient method. Social policy variables included per capita retirement transfer payments, per capita income maintenance transfer payments, per capita unemployment transfer payments, per capita county government eVpenditures, and population change. Structural variables included level of education, percent of labor force employed in manufacturing, percent of the labor force employed in manufacturing, percent of labor force comprised of women, and commercial farms as a percent of all farms. Correlational and regression procedures were used to determine relationships between the structural and policy variables and the qini coefficient. Following are h/ghljghts of the results. * While policy variables were most influential in <b>determining</b> <b>income</b> distribution in 1960, policy and structural variables were equally influential in <b>determining</b> <b>income</b> distribution in 1970. In 1980, structural variables were considerably stronger determinants of income distribution than were policy variables. * The most powerful and consistent structural determinant of income distribution was level o...|$|E

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Table  1 that there are great {{differentials}} on the density and distribution of the income distribution between monopoly industries and competition industries at different income levels, thus concerning only about the gap between the average values will neglect the differential and source of income distribution at different levels. DFL methods have taken the differential of income distribution at different levels into account, but excluding the differential on the elemental rate of returns for income at different places of income distribution. Machado and Mata (2005) proposed a regression model for conditional quantiles, supposing the equations to <b>determine</b> <b>income</b> at different quantiles with different income distributions between monopoly industries and competition industries. First, we should estimate equations to <b>determine</b> <b>income</b> for different quantiles in accordance with conditional quantiles’ model. Then we use the elemental rate of returns for different quantiles that have been estimated. For the features of monopoly industries’ practitioners, we can compose the counterfactual distribution under the assumption that those elemental features of monopoly industries acquire income in accordance with the elemental rate of returns from competition industries and then compare the gap between the income distribution of monopoly industries and counterfactual distribution. Finally, we can get the influence caused by the inexplicable factors of different elemental rate of returns and those explicable factors of different distributions of practitioners’ characteristics in producing the gap between monopoly industries and competition industries.|$|R
