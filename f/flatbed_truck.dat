5|$|On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, aged 24, {{was killed}} in a {{motorcycle}} accident a day after returning to the band's home of Macon, Georgia. Allman was riding at a high speed in his motorcycle at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck</b> carrying a lumber crane approached. The <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck</b> stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either {{the back of the truck}} or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle. The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing several internal organs. Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries. The loss devastated all who knew Allman, just as At Fillmore East climbed into the top 15 of the national album charts.|$|E
5|$|Portland {{has had two}} {{replicas of}} Philadelphia's {{original}} Liberty Bell. The first replica was purchased in 1962 for $8,000. It arrived in Portland in June 1963, with a damaged base and beam since the sculpture had slipped off its supports. Repairs were made before the replica was paraded through the city on a <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck,</b> then put into storage until Independence Day. The bell was publicly rung {{for the first time}} during holiday celebrations and installed in City Hall's rotunda on May 5, 1964.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Government {{required}} that all cemeteries and burial grounds be moved. This included the Harvey tomb, {{and it was}} no easy task. In 1962 contractor Harald Mathis of Springdale took nine days to raze the 40-ton tomb and one to move it. The first attempt broke a <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck.</b> Another contractor from Huntsville with a stronger truck then had to be called in. A new road was laid to the new site of Harvey's tomb. The tomb was placed on the crest of a hill donated by Harvey's longtime friends and neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Doescher. Today, the tomb sits on private property visible from the Monte Ne boat launch on Beaver Lake. Relocation of the aging tomb put pressure on it, causing it to crack.|$|E

5|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{many of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Red Dog Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, then 24, {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon. Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck</b> carrying a lumber crane approached.

25|$|Nonprofit {{community}} groups and LGBT-oriented local businesses contribute {{more than half}} of the contingents.

Stratfor's concluded that a Buk system had moved from the Russian border toward Donetsk on 15 July 2014, and then {{moved back to the}} east on the afternoon of 17 July 2014, hours before Flight MH17 was shot down.|$|E
25|$|Mankiewicz and speechwriter Adam Walinsky drafted {{notes for}} Kennedy's use, {{but he refused}} them, using some he likely had written during the ride to the site. The Indianapolis chief of police advised Kennedy {{that he could not}} provide {{protection}} and was worried he would be at risk in talking about the death of the revered leader. Kennedy decided to go ahead. Standing on a <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck,</b> Kennedy spoke for four minutes and fifty-seven seconds.|$|E
25|$|While Austin began feuding with Triple H, Rikishi's {{tension with}} The Rock boiled over. He lost their match at the 2000 Survivor Series. He then {{participated in a}} six-man Hell in a Cell WWF Championship match at Armageddon. Vince McMahon drove a <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck</b> ringside {{in an effort to}} {{dismantle}} the cage and stop the match. Before he could, The Undertaker chokeslammed Rikishi {{from the top of the}} cell onto the wood chip-covered bed. Angle later retained the title.|$|E

25|$|On February 8, 2013, The New York Times {{published}} a review by John M. Broder about a trip between Washington, D.C., and Boston using Tesla's Supercharger network. At {{the time it}} included only two stations on the East Coast. Broder made a variety of critical claims about the battery's performance in cold weather and the distance between charging stations. The trip ended with the Model S carried by a <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck</b> to the Milford, Connecticut, station.|$|E
25|$|The band later {{changed its}} name to Mammoth when they {{discovered}} the name Genesis was already being used. In 1974, Mammoth officially {{changed its name}} to Van Halen. According to Roth, this was his brainchild. He felt it was a name that had power, like Santana. They played backyard parties and on a <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck</b> at Hamilton Park. Van Halen played clubs in Pasadena and Hollywood to growing audiences, increasing their popularity through self-promotion: before each gig they would pass out flyers at local high schools. This sort of self-promotion soon built them a major following. Later that year, the band got its first break when it was hired to play at Gazzarri's, a formerly famous but down-at-the-heels night club on the Sunset Strip which closed in 1996.|$|E
25|$|The {{portable}} toilet is used {{on construction}} sites, film locations, and large outdoor gatherings {{where there are no}} other facilities. They are typically self-contained units that are made to be easily moved. Most portable toilets are Unisex single units with privacy ensured by a simple lock on the door. The units are usually light weight and easily transported by a <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck</b> and loaded and unloaded by a small forklift. Many portable toilets are small molded plastic or fiberglass portable rooms with a lockable door and a receptacle to catch waste in a chemically treated container. If used {{for an extended period of}} time, they have to be cleaned out and new chemicals put in the waste receptacle. For servicing multiple portable toilets, tanker trucks (vacuum trucks or honeywagons) are equipped with large vacuums to evacuate the waste and replace the chemicals. Portable toilets can also be urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E
50|$|Technically speaking, any RV {{that can}} be easily {{dismounted}} from its carrying vehicle qualifies as a truck camper. In Australia it is very common to see them mounted on <b>flatbed</b> <b>trucks,</b> or even on what, in North America, would be considered a car.|$|R

50|$|On August 10, 2009, a pair {{of large}} <b>flatbed</b> <b>trucks</b> packed with bombs {{exploded}} simultaneously shortly after dawn, destroying a Shabaki village known as Khazna, about 10 mi east of Mosul and a few kilometres away from Bartella. The blast shattered windows at many homes in Bartella.|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the man-carrying machine known as a Rotachute, {{also known as a}} Hafner H.8, evolved from November 1940 and {{throughout}} 1941. In September 1941, the Central Landing Establishment was renamed the Airborne Forces Establishment. The Rotachute Mark I design initially comprised a tubular steel framework with a single seat, rubber-mounted rotor hub, hanging control column, skid undercarriage, and a self-inflating rear fairing made of rubberised fabric with integral tailplane. The two rotor blades, of wooden construction, could achieve flapping and coning characteristics via hinges on the rotor hub. Fixed footrests were provided, plus fittings below the seat to accommodate a soldier's weapon, such as a Bren gun. The control column offered two-axis control, rolling and pitching, with turns made via controlled rolling movement. Air Ministry Specification No. 11/42 was issued retrospectively to describe the outline requirements. The Ministry of Aircraft Production sub-contracted construction of parts to specialist firms including F. Hills and Sons, Airwork General Trading, Dynaflex, Dunlop, and H. Morris & Co. Some full size rotor trials were carried out using a pivoting rig mounted on a Ford <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck,</b> and full-size unmanned airframes were used in ground-based and inflight trials.|$|E
500|$|In December 2005, thieves {{entered a}} {{courtyard}} at the Henry Moore Foundation {{and stole a}} cast of Moore's Reclining Figure 1969-70 (LH 608) [...] a 3.6 metre-long, 2.1-tonne bronze sculpture. Closed-circuit-television footage showed that they used a crane to lower the piece onto a stolen <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck.</b> A substantial reward was offered by the Foundation {{for information leading to}} its recovery. By May 2009, after a thorough investigation, British officials said they believe the work, once valued at £3 million (US$5.3 million), was probably sold for scrap metal, fetching about £5,000. In July 2012 the [...] bronze Sundial 1965, valued at £500,000, was stolen from the Moore Foundation. Later that year, following the details of the theft being publicised on the BBC Crimewatch television programme, the work was recovered, and the thieves were sentenced to twelve months' custody.|$|E
500|$|By October 1974, the Australia-only album High Voltage {{had been}} recorded. It took only ten days and {{was based on}} {{instrumental}} songs written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott. Within a few months, the band's line-up had stabilised, featuring Scott, the Young brothers, bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd. Later that year they released the single [...] "It's a Long Way to the Top", for which a well-known promotional video was made for the program Countdown, featuring the band miming the song {{on the back of}} a <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck.</b> The song is regarded as their perennial rock anthem. It was included on their second album, TNT (1975), which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand. T.N.T. featured the song [...] "High Voltage", which was the first song written and recorded for the album. Because [...] "High Voltage" [...] was released as a single before T.N.T. was released, some people thought it was the title track to AC/DC's debut album.|$|E
5000|$|A replica {{was built}} during Expo 86 and {{anchored}} in [...] "Deep Sea Adventure Lake" [...] at West Edmonton Mall. Built at False Creek in Vancouver, British Columbia, {{the ship was}} hand-carved and hand-painted, and then transported by <b>flatbed</b> <b>trucks</b> across the Rocky Mountains to Edmonton, Alberta.|$|R
50|$|Tracked {{vehicles}} {{have more}} traction off-road and more maneuverability, including a minute turn radius. Due {{to the limited}} service life of their treads, plus the wear they cause on roads, tracked vehicles are typically transported over long distances by rail, <b>flatbed</b> <b>trucks</b> or purpose built transporters.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} ran {{in three}} forms.

2500|$|His dynamic {{performance}} style {{can be seen}} in films such as High School Confidential (he sang the title song from the back of a <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck),</b> and Jamboree. He has been called [...] "rock & roll's first great wild man" [...] and also [...] "rock & roll's first great eclectic". Classical composer Michael Nyman has also cited Lewis's style as the progenitor of his own aesthetic.|$|E
5000|$|The TK range {{replaced}} the S type in 1959, {{and served as}} the basis for a variety of derivatives, including fire engines, military, horse boxes, tippers, <b>flatbed</b> <b>trucks,</b> and other specialist utilities. A General Post Office (later British Telecom) version used for installing telegraph poles was known as the [...] "Polecat".|$|R
