The tornado then crossed Missouri Route 141, where it blew a Honda CR-V into a highway barrier; {{the driver of}} the vehicle suffered critical injuries and died eleven days later from those injuries. After crossing the highway, a number of buildings were damaged including a church, elementary school, and parsonage. <b>Damage</b> in this area was rated as EF2 due to the partial debarking of a nearby tree.

The surveyed <b>damaged</b> pavement sections are classified through this method. The definition of <b>damaged</b> pavement correction coefficient is given, using gradual approach method to decrease <b>damaged</b> pavement correction coefficient till the error of capacity of road section is lower than admissible error, the <b>damaged</b> pavement correction coefficients of different levels of <b>damaged</b> pavement were obtained based on the parameter that surveyed on different level of <b>damaged</b> pavement sections...|$|R
