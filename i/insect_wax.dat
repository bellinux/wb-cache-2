(Bangles {{made by the}} lost-wax process are characteristic of northeast Thailand.) Some of the bangles from Ban Na Di revealed a dark grey substance between the central clay core and the metal, which on analysis was identified as an unrefined form of <b>insect</b> <b>wax.</b> It is likely that decorative items, like bracelets and rings, were made by cire perdue at Non Nok Tha and Ban Chiang.There are technological and material parallels between northeast Thailand and Vietnam concerning the lost-wax technique. The sites exhibiting artifacts made by the lost-mould process in Vietnam, such as the Dong Son drums, come from the Dong Son, and Phung Nguyen cultures, such as one sickle and {{the figure of a}} seated individual from Go Mun (near Phung Nguyen, the Bac Bo Region), dating to the Go Mun phase (end of the General B period, up until the 7th century BC).|$|E

For {{the wide}} {{application}} of <b>insect</b> <b>wax,</b> it was studied on its thermal properties under different {{conditions in which}} the wax was stored at cold, dark, indoor and sunshine environment. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was selected to achieve thermal parameters and reveal the influence of temperature on {{the stability of the}} wax. The result showed that within 20 months of natural storage, it was significant influence on the melting enthalpy of Hunan <b>insect</b> <b>wax,</b> the melting point of Sichuan <b>insect</b> <b>wax</b> and the melting peak of Sichuan <b>insect</b> <b>wax</b> with the Sig values were 0. 013, 0. 009 and 0. 000. And the quality of wax was characterized by IR, XRD and physical-chemical indexes. The results showed that within 20 months, it was slightly changed in the crystallinity and chemical constituents. Therefore, the wax with good stability can be used for medicine, food, functional materials and other industrial purposes safely...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of consumer organisms in ancient ecosystems has been indicated mainly by {{the occurrence of}} fossilized mineral skeletons. In comparison with primary producers and bacteria, nonphotosynthetic enkaryotic organisms are minute contributors to organic carbon preserved in sediments. In principle, however, organic compounds produced by heterotrophs {{have the potential to}} enter the sedimentary record. The biomass of respiring heterotrophs is enriched in ¹³C relative to its carbon source, and it has been shown in the modern environment that the carbon isotopic fractionation between photosynthetic primary producers and heterotrophs increases {{as a function of the}} trophic level of the consumer. In ancient sediments, identification of organic compounds derived from specific heterotrophs and determination of their isotopic compositions are potential tools to reconstruct palaeo-food-web relationships. Here, we present unprecedented evidence of the presence in sediments of organic compounds derived from <b>insect</b> <b>waxes.</b> Analyses of the ¹³C contents of these materials indicate that insects utilized the organic material of cyanobacterial mats as their main source of carbon and, thus, demonstrate that molecular palaeontology can reveal food-web relationships in ancient communities. The observations confirm that the identification in sediments of specific refractory organic compounds from higher organisms and the determination of their stable carbon isotopic compositions provide valuable information regarding trophic relationships at the time of deposition. The molecular-isotopic approach appears likely to provide one of the only means for secure detection of products of consumer organisms and for placement of those organisms within ancient trophic systems...|$|R

40|$|From Introduction: Wax and wax-like {{substances}} {{have been}} defined in many ways. One reasonably extensive definition, by Hatt and Lamberton (1956) is given below: "The term "wax" seems best used to denote {{a group of}} substances which qualitatively have certain physical properties in common. These properties are familiar ones, for in almost all countries some natural wax - beeswax, Japan wax, Chinese <b>insect</b> <b>wax,</b> the carnauba and candelilla waxes of the Americas - {{has been an important}} material in art and industry from prehistoric times. Waxes are understood to be opaque or translucent solids, which melt without decomposition to form mobile liquids at temperatures in the region of 100 ⁰C. They differ in hardness, but are all essentially soft substances with poor mechanical strength. Most waxes can be easily shaped or kneaded at a little above ambient temperatures. In fact, the term could easily have been made to cover the whole class now named thermoplastics. " Pure n-paraffins would be too crystalline and brittle for use as waxes, whereas mixtures of n-paraffins have some valuable properties. The molecules bear such close resemblance to one another that they form mixed crystals of lowered crystallinity and the melting point {{is a function of the}} mean molecular weight. This is a desirable feature for it permits crystallinity and brittleness to be reduced without a marked loss in the melting point or hardness. It also allows a mixture to simulate a pure compound very closely. Waxes, in general, have been put to a large number of uses. They are used, for example, in candles, polishes, paper-coating, plastics, printing, matches, rust protectants and insulation. Each application requires its own appropriate range of wax properties...|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} known animal wax is beeswax, but other <b>insects</b> secrete (release) <b>waxes.</b> A {{major component of}} the beeswax used in constructing honeycombs is the ester myricyl palmitate which is an ester of triacontanol and palmitic acid. Its melting point is 62-65 °C. Spermaceti occurs in large amounts in the head oil of the sperm whale. One of its main constituents is cetyl palmitate, another ester of a fatty acid and a fatty alcohol. Lanolin is a wax obtained from wool, consisting of esters of sterols.|$|R
40|$|Steinernema scapterisci n. sp., {{isolated}} in Uruguay from the mole cricket Scapteriscus vicinus, {{can be distinguished}} from other members in the genus {{by the presence of}} prominent cheilorhabdions, an elliptically shaped structure associated with the excretory duct, and a double-flapped epitygma in the first-generation female. The spicules of the male are pointed, tapering smoothly to a small terminus, and the shaft (calomus) is long, bearing a sheath. The gubernaculum has a long, upward-bent anterior part. The ratio of head to excretory pore divided by tail length of the third-stage juvenile is greater for S. scapterisci n. sp. than for S. carpocapsae. Steinernema scapterisci n. sp. did not hybridize with S. carpocapsae strain Breton. In laboratory tests, S. scapterisci n. sp. killed 10 % or less of non-orthopteran <b>insects,</b> including the <b>wax</b> moth larva, a universal host for other species of Steinernema...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe pitcher-shaped {{leaves of}} Nepenthes {{carnivorous}} {{plants have been}} considered as pitfall traps that essentially rely on slippery surfaces to capture insects. But {{a recent study of}} Nepenthes rafflesiana has shown that the viscoelasticity of the digestive fluid inside the pitchers plays a key role. Here, we investigated whether Nepenthes species exhibit diverse trapping strategies. We measured the amount of slippery wax on the pitcher walls of 23 taxa and the viscoelasticity of their digestive liquid and compared their retention efficiency on ants and flies. The amount of wax was shown to vary greatly between species. Most mountain species exhibited viscoelastic digestive fluids while water-like fluids were predominant in lowland species. Both characteristics contributed to <b>insect</b> trapping but <b>wax</b> was more efficient at trapping ants while viscoelasticity was key in trapping insects and was even more efficient than wax on flies. Trap waxiness and fluid viscoelasticity were inversely related, suggesting the possibility of an investment trade-off for the plants. Therefore Nepenthes pitcher plants do not solely employ slippery devices to trap insects but often employ a viscoelastic strategy. The entomofauna specific to the plant's habitat may exert selective pressures, favouring one trapping strategy {{at the expense of the}} other...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{decided to}} explore whether diatomaceous earths (DEs) might meet the grain {{protection}} demands of rural households. These inert dusts are non-toxic to mammals but deadly to <b>insects</b> absorbing the <b>wax</b> from the <b>insect’s</b> cuticle {{which leads to}} water loss and death. Following laboratory studies, promising commercial DEs were trialled collaboratively by researchers and farmers as grain protectants in Zimbabwe. Protect-lt and Dryacide applied at 0. 1 %w/w were {{as effective as the}} synthetic conventional insecticide, Actellic Super dust, in limiting insect damage on stored maize, sorghum and cowpea grains for periods of eight months. However, laboratory studies revealed that the devastating larger grain borer now spread throughout many African countries was more tolerant to DEs than the storage pests found in Zimbabwe. This initiated the testing of DEs in combination with other products. Higher DE application rates of 0. 25 %w/w, a DE-pyrethroid combination and a local African DE were successfully tested by farmers in Tanzania. During this work the importance of the link between a potential technology such as DEs and the wider post-harvest service provision context became clearer. This led to the exploration of this context using: an enquiry approach to learn about post-harvest decision making amongst diverse rural households; and an experimental learning process to empower farmers. As the nature of the different stakeholders within the agricultural innovation system and their information requirements became more central to the work, the importance of the patterns of interaction amongst them and associated attitudes was repeatedly revealed. A learning alliance of key post-harvest stakeholders was established to explore and test opportunities for stakeholders to work together differently to help overcome institutional and other constraints.

5000|$|According to {{an article}} in a November 1932 {{magazine}} article in the journal Nature by Herbert Beardsley, [...] "...the male larvae of a white insect, {{about the size of}} a mosquito, built a cocoon of pure, shining wax. The tree that produces the white <b>wax</b> <b>insect</b> grows in the Chien-Chang Valley, and there, about march, one may see, on the limbs and branches, round, brown forms, which contain innumerable white insects. If they are allowed to remain where they are, they will eventually drop off in a dead mass, for the food is not right for them; but if they are transported to other kinds of plants, the females will lay their eggs, the larvae will thrive and the male larvae will construct their shining palaces, which yield a profit to the wax-farmers. So, late in March, the insects are tied up in a leaf of the wood oil tree, then placed in gourd like receptacles which are packed into two large bamboo baskets. Runners or porters lift the baskets on their shoulders, and, traveling entirely at night - for to submit the insects to the midday heat would cause the pupal stage to end too soon - traverse the rocky paths and lofty ascents of the Cze-Chuan Mountains to arrive finally at the farming districts. The baskets of insects are distributed to the farmers, who proceed at once to place the creatures upon the food plant, which is generally a species of flowering ash about five or six feet high. They are tied to the branches in small bags made of leaves, and holes are punched in the bags with a blunt needle so the adults may find their way out. When first emerging, the insects creep rapidly up to the leaves of the food plant, where they nestle for nearly two weeks. After this they begin to scatter and crawl along the branches. About the first of June, the females begin to lay their eggs, and the wax cocoons are formed in August in time completely coating every branch and stem. By the first of September the whole tree is literally covered with layers of pure white wax a quarter of an inch thick. The farmers then scrape the branches, and prepare the wax of the market." ...|$|R
