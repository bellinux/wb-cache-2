Because [...] "existence" [...] means more than simply life, it is projective, containing an irreducibly fictive element, but in this [...] "being more than" [...] life, it is therefore contaminated by mortality. Nancy is giving an interpretation of Kiarostami's statement that lying is the only way to truth.|$|E

60|$|Now, is {{this growth}} of large towns really, as one may allege, {{a result of}} the {{development}} of railways in the world, or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> a change in human circumstances that happens to have arisen at the same time? It needs only a very general review of the conditions of the distribution of population to realize that the former is probably the true answer.|$|E

50|$|Electromagnetic radiation, which {{includes}} light, carries energy and momentum {{that may be}} imparted to matter with which it interacts. The radiation and matter have a symbiotic relationship. Radiation does not simply act on a material, nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> acted on upon by a given material; radiation interacts with matter.|$|E

For example, {{the make}} and model of a car categorises or describes a number of physical vehicles. The relationship between the blue description and green party, place or thing is a type-instance relationship based on differences in the values of data items held in the 'type' object.|$|E
5000|$|Jim Qwilleran {{decides to}} get out of the city for a while and go on {{vacation}} to Moose County, Pickax, in the countryside. He stays at a lakeside cabin, owned by his old friend, Aunt Fanny. He has plans to write a book, however his plans get delayed when a peaceful fishing trip catches a body.

60|$|In short, Mr Stuart {{became a}} {{converted}} man, {{and there was}} no mystery whatever in his conversion. Great though its effects <b>were,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> this,--that the Holy Spirit had enabled him to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.|$|R

50|$|Whatever {{the reason}} for {{choosing}} the street, the street is a place with {{a different set of}} possibilities than the conventional theatre space. Sue Gill of Welfare State International argues that a street theatre performance is not a lesser form than an indoor performance, nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> taking what you do on stage and placing it outdoors, but a form with an energy and an integrity of its own.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of FFict allows the rotational observers and the inertial observers {{to agree on}} the tension in the string. However, we might ask: [...] "Does this solution fit in with general experience with other situations, or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> a [...] "cooked up" [...] ad hoc solution?" [...] That question is answered by seeing how this value for FFict squares with the general result (derived in Fictitious force): ...|$|E
50|$|Is the poet's mind flattered, like a king, by the youth's presence, or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> a {{truth that}} is being told by his eyes that ugly things are made {{beautiful}} by the mental image of the youth? Surely it must be flattery, that he consumes like a king. He knows he enjoys it even if it's poisonous. Even if it is, it's less of a sin because his eye is motivated by love.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{arguments}} between Horacio and Ossip, one that threatens to put a rift in the club, is what Horacio deems [...] "the conundrum of consciousness" [...] (99). Does art prove consciousness? Or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> a continuation of instinctual leanings toward the collective brain? Talita argues a similar point in her seesaw-questions game with Horacio, who believes that only when one lives in the abstract and lets go of biological history can one achieve true consciousness.|$|E
50|$|Thus, in Racine the hamartia, {{which the}} thirteenth chapter of Aristotle’s Poetics had {{declared}} {{a characteristic of}} tragedy, is not merely an action performed in all good faith which subsequently has the direst consequences (Œdipus's killing a stranger {{on the road to}} Thebes, and marrying the widowed Queen of Thebes after solving the Sphinx's riddle), nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> an error of judgment (as when Deianira, in the Hercules Furens of Seneca the Younger, kills her husband when intending to win back his love); it is a flaw of character.|$|E
50|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} and matter have a symbiotic relationship. Radiation {{does not simply}} act on a material, nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> acted upon by a given material. Radiation interacts with matter. Cloaking applications which employ metamaterials alter how objects interact with the electromagnetic spectrum. The guiding vision for the metamaterial cloak is a device that directs the flow of light smoothly around an object, like water flowing past a rock in a stream, without reflection, rendering the object invisible. In reality, the simple cloaking devices of the present are imperfect, and have limitations.One challenge {{up to the present}} date has been the inability of metamaterials, and cloaking devices, to interact at frequencies, or wavelengths, within the visible light spectrum.|$|E
50|$|The {{derivation}} of {{the word}} tutu is unknown. The word was not recorded anywhere until 1881. One theory <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> derived from the word tulle (one of the materials from which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> made).|$|R
50|$|Having {{completed}} {{the book in}} 1924, Barton initially experienced difficulty getting his work published, as the material was considered to <b>be</b> controversial. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> seen by some as wrong to compare Jesus to ordinary men.|$|R
2500|$|... "From {{the very}} beginning, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} another American classic by the composer of 'Rhapsody in Blue'—even if critics couldn't quite {{figure out how}} to evaluate it. Was <b>it</b> opera, or <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> an ambitious Broadway musical? 'It crossed the barriers,' per theater historian Robert Kimball. 'It wasn't a musical work per se, and it wasn't a drama per se – it elicited response from both music and drama critics. But the work has sort of always been outside category." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1843, Töpffer formalised his {{thoughts}} on the picture story in his Essay on Physiognomics: [...] "To construct a picture-story does not mean you must set yourself up as a master craftsman, to draw out every potential from your material—often down to the dregs! It does not mean you just devise caricatures with a pencil naturally frivolous. Nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> to dramatize a proverb or illustrate a pun. You must actually invent some kind of play, where the parts are arranged by plan and form a satisfactory whole. You do not merely pen a joke or put a refrain in couplets. You make a book: good or bad, sober or silly, crazy or sound in sense." ...|$|E

50|$|Clearly {{the process}} in this play is open to interpretation. Is the process wholly internal, the man remembering someone real from his past or {{is he trying to}} conjure up some {{external}} manifestation of her, her ghost? And what is his motive for trying to evoke her? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> to satisfy memory, to wallow in the moment awhile as Krapp does, or is she in some way his muse, an enabling force that makes the words come? Either way it is clear that he cannot control events directly, by the power of his will, things take place at best, as a byproduct almost of his actions, but more likely they are entirely out of his control and all he can do is wait on them.|$|E
