50|$|In macro{{economic}}s, <b>discretionary</b> <b>policy</b> is {{an economic}} policy based on the ad hoc judgment of policymakers as opposed to policy set by predetermined rules. For instance, a central banker could make decisions on interest rates {{on a case-by-case basis}} instead of allowing a set rule, such as the Taylor rule or Friedman's k-percent rule, to determine interest rates or the money supply. In practice most policy actions are discretionary in nature.|$|E
50|$|Thus the {{monetary}} authority {{would have to}} be sufficiently astute in its policy timing, in trying to counteract anticipated fluctuations in velocity, that the correlation of its money supply changes with velocity changes is not merely negative, but sufficiently negative to overcome the inherently GDP-variance-magnifying effects of money supply variation.

50|$|Demand {{management}} at the macroeconomic level {{involves the use of}} <b>discretionary</b> <b>policy</b> and is inspired by Keynesian economics, though today elements of it are part of the economic mainstream. The underlying idea is for the government to use tools like interest rates, taxation, and public expenditure to change key economic decisions like consumption, investment, the balance of trade, and public sector borrowing resulting in an 'evening out' of the business cycle. Demand management was widely adopted in the 1950s to 1970s, and was for a time successful. However, it did not prevent the stagflation of the 1970s, which is considered to have been precipitated by the supply shock caused by the 1973 oil crisis.|$|E

50|$|In March 2014, the Charter for Budget Responsibility was {{modified}} {{to include a}} new cap on welfare expenditure alongside the Government’s fiscal mandate.

As part of this assessment, the OBR is required to produce a forecast for welfare spending in scope of the cap in its Economic and fiscal outlook.
