5|$|The {{inclusion}} of specific Final Fantasy characters {{was based on}} the opinions of both fans and staff. Another criterion for inclusion was whether the staff felt the characters would fit into the storyline and in the Kingdom Hearts universe. Initially, Nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design, because he was unfamiliar with the backstory of such characters. For Kingdom Hearts II, he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff. Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games. Nomura does this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination. He has stated that with speculation, even though a game gets old, people can still be <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added the subtitle The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write everything that they had wanted, so they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1975 Lynch allowed Charles Haughey {{to return}} to his Front Bench as Spokesperson on Health. There was much media {{criticism}} of Lynch for this move. In the same year the Foreign Affairs Spokesperson, Michael O'Kennedy, published a Fianna Fáil policy document calling for a withdrawal of British forces from Northern Ireland. The document was an echo of Fianna Fáil's republican origins, and although Lynch was not <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> he did not stop it.|$|E

25|$|However, {{because the}} game {{had to be}} ready to ship to {{coincide}} with the DVD release of the film in North America, development was rushed, and the game was released before the developers were fully <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> After finishing with Blade II, Mucky Foot began work on two more film adaptations; Bulletproof Monk for Empire Interactive and The Punisher for THQ. However, THQ were unimpressed with Blade II, and cancelled The Punisher, which left Mucky Foot in the position of being unable to complete Bulletproof Monk without letting staff go, which they were unwilling to do. They spent several months re-pitching Sky Ships, the game which had developed into Blade II, to various publishers, but were unable to generate any interest, and the company closed in October 2003.|$|E

They also wrote and filmed Playing Shop, a comedy television pilot for BBC2 about two men who operate a business out of their shed. Although the BBC commissioners were <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> Mitchell and Webb scrapped it themselves, as they felt it was too similar to Peep Show. A new pilot had been commissioned, but the plan was later shelved. Mitchell and Webb voiced a robotic duo in the Doctor Who episode [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] in 2012.|$|E

I think you can't get much more operatic or passionate than that. I was trying to write a song about dead things coming to life. I was trying to write a song about being enslaved and obsessed by love, not just enchanted and <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> It was about the dark side of love; about the ability to be resurrected by it...

500|$|Bert Berns, Them’s {{producer}} and composer of their 1965 hit, [...] "Here Comes the Night", persuaded Morrison {{to return to}} New York to record solo for his new label, Bang Records. Morrison flew over and signed a contract he had not fully studied. Then, during a two-day recording session at A & R Studios starting 28 March 1967, eight songs were recorded, originally intended {{to be used as}} four singles. Instead, these songs were released as the album Blowin' Your Mind! without Morrison being consulted. He said he only became aware of the album's release when a friend mentioned on a phone call that he had just bought a copy of it. He later commented to Donal Corvin in a 1973 interview: [...] "I wasn't really <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> He picked the bands and tunes. I had a different concept of it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2010, it was {{announced}} that Stenson had decided to quit the serial to pursue a career in musical theatre. She deemed it [...] "one of the most difficult decisions [...] ever made", stating that Hollyoaks had been her [...] "dream job" [...] and that she would miss her friends in the cast and crew. She made the decision to resign around June 2009, but was convinced by then-producer Lucy Allan to play out a long exit storyline, which concluded filming in September 2010. Before filming her final scenes, Stenson secured her first West End role. Though she had previously felt ready to leave the series, when the time came, she was upset because she felt the reality of it. She called her final scenes [...] "really sad and emotional", and stated that while she had not had any input in Steph's exit, she was <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

I'm really <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> just being a comic." [...] Vaughan has stated that they are open to the possibility, though it is not a priority for them. However, merchandise based on the series has been produced, including a line of T-shirts featuring Lying Cat, which have become visible in popular media. In [...] "Pac-Man Fever", the April 24, 2013 episode of the American TV series Supernatural, the character Charlie Bradbury (played by Felicia Day) is seen wearing a Lying Cat T-shirt.

500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by many reviewers, though some {{were not as}} <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> The enthusiastic ones cited the combination of humor and tears, past events and present revelation, while those who were more critical felt {{there was not enough}} time to wrap up all the storylines or that it strayed into sappiness. Particular praise was given to the scene with Burt and Kurt Hummel that featured the former's [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)" [...] number, which was the favorite performance of the reviewers, and the scene when Finn tells Rachel he's sending her to New York instead of marrying her, which was described as Monteith's and Michele's best acting on the show. Monteith was also praised for his solo in the song [...] "You Get What You Give", and Michele's rendition of [...] "Roots Before Branches" [...] received even higher marks.

Many, but not all, merely signed a statement saying that they were <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, sent back a detailed review. He had concerns about the amount of credit being given to different people and organizations, and recommended that [...] "full credit be given to H. D.

[...] Smyth was given credit, but no such statement was issued. To prepare the final draft for the printer, Groves brought typists with the required security clearances to Washington, D.C., from the Manhattan District's headquarters in Oak Ridge.|$|E
500|$|Kenney met Lampoon writer Ramis at the {{suggestion}} of Simmons. Ramis drew from his own fraternity experiences as a member of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at Washington University in St. Louis and was working on a film treatment about college called [...] "Freshman Year", but the magazine's editors were not <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Kenney and Ramis started working on a new film treatment together, positing Charles Manson in a high school, calling it Laser Orgy Girls. Simmons was cool to this idea so they changed the setting to a [...] "northeastern college... Ivy League kind of school". Kenney was a fan of Miller’s fraternity stories and suggested using them as a basis for a movie. Kenney, Miller and Ramis began brainstorming ideas. They saw the film's 1962 setting as [...] "the last innocent year... of America", and the homecoming parade that ends the film as occurring on November 21, 1963, the day before President Kennedy's assassination. They agreed that Belushi should star in it and Ramis wrote the part of Bluto specifically for the comedian, having been friends with him while at Chicago's The Second City.|$|E

Rae Votta of Billboard wrote that [...] "there simply isn't enough time to settle the fates of so many seniors in a mere hour", a sentiment also expressed by Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson, who thought the episode might have [...] "felt a little more logical if it was given a full two hours to breathe". Hankinson also said it left him with [...] "mostly questions" [...] but also [...] "some fury". TV Guide two reviewers were both enthusiastic: Kate Stanhope described is as a [...] "perfect mix of the kids' past, present and future", and Damian Holbrook wrote that the [...] "class of 2012 went out on a high note with a season finale so solid, emotional and entertaining, you would have thought you were watching one of the show's first 13 episodes".|$|E
