500|$|Authors {{considering}} attachment in non-Western {{cultures have}} noted the connection of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time. As children's experience of care changes, so may attachment-related experiences. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers or being cared for outside the home while the mothers work. This social change has {{made it more difficult}} for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries. There has been {{an increase in the number}} of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources in first-world countries. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and gained legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time. Issues have been raised to the effect that the [...] model characteristic of attachment theory cannot address the complexity of real-life social experiences, as infants often have multiple relationships within the family and <b>in</b> <b>child</b> <b>care</b> settings. It is suggested these multiple relationships influence one another reciprocally, at least within a family.|$|E

A {{recent study}} {{reported}} that the average annual fees for full-time infant <b>care</b> <b>in</b> a <b>child</b> <b>care</b> center ranged from $ 3, 803 in Alabama to $ 13, 480 in Massachusetts. This study analyses this variation <b>in</b> state-level average <b>child</b> <b>care</b> center prices using a standard economic model of supply and demand. We found that {{a large proportion of}} the variation <b>in</b> average <b>child</b> <b>care</b> prices can be explained by a small set of variables, including median family income, wages paid to <b>child</b> <b>care</b> workers, and the number of young <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the state. Although the gov-ernment plays an important role <b>in</b> the <b>child</b> <b>care</b> market, the wide variation in average fees across states mostly reflects what parents can afford to pay. Given the importance of quality <b>child</b> <b>care</b> to current workforce needs and future human capital development, strategies to in-crease affordability such as <b>child</b> <b>care</b> subsidies and tax credits should be considered along with direct investments in quality improvements...|$|R
500|$|All higher mammals (excluding monotremes) share {{two major}} adaptations for {{care of the}} young: live birth and lactation. These imply a group-wide choice of a degree of parental care. They may build nests and dig burrows to raise their young in, or feed and guard them often for a {{prolonged}} period of time. Many mammals are K-selectors, and invest more time and energy into their young than do r-selectors. When two animals mate, they both share {{an interest in the}} success of the offspring, though often to different extremes. Mammalian females, both r- and K-selectors, exhibit some degree of maternal aggression, another example of parental care, which may be targeted against other females of the species or the young of other females; however, some mammals may [...] "aunt" [...] the infants of other females, and care for them. Mammalian males {{may play a role in}} child rearing, as with tenrecs, however this varies species to species, even within the same genus.

2500|$|Like {{a number}} of other {{alternative}} mental health treatments for children, attachment therapy is based on some assumptions that differ strongly from the theoretical foundations of other attachment based therapies. In contrast to traditional attachment theory, the theory of attachment described by attachment therapy proponents is that young children who experience adversity (including maltreatment, loss, separations, adoption, frequent changes <b>in</b> <b>child</b> <b>care,</b> colic or even frequent ear infections) become enraged at a very deep and primitive level. This results in a lack of ability to attach or to be genuinely affectionate to others. Suppressed or unconscious rage is theorized to prevent the child from forming bonds with caregivers and leads to behavior problems when the rage erupts into unchecked aggression. Such children are said to fail to develop a conscience, to not trust others, to seek control rather than closeness, to resist the authority of caregivers, and to engage in endless power struggles. They are seen as highly manipulative and as trying to avoid true attachments while simultaneously striving to control those around them through manipulation and superficial sociability. Such children are said to be at risk of becoming psychopaths who will go on to engage in very serious delinquent, criminal, and antisocial behaviors if left untreated. The tone in which the attributes of these children are described has been characterized as [...] "demonizing".|$|E

The aim of the current dissertation is to shed more light on indicators of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> quality <b>in</b> center <b>child</b> <b>care</b> and to answer the question whether narrow-focused caregiver interventions are effective <b>in</b> improving <b>child</b> <b>care</b> quality.
