5|$|On 16 January 1945, {{following}} the Wehrmacht's {{defeat in the}} Battle of the Bulge, Misch {{and the rest of}} Hitler's personal staff moved into the Führerbunker and Vorbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin. His FBK commanding officer, Franz Schädle, appointed Misch to be the bunker telephone operator. Misch handled all of the direct communication from the bunker. He did not leave it for any significant period of time until the war ended in May 1945. On 22 April 1945, Schädle called <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and told him there was a place reserved for his wife and young daughter on one of the last planes out of Berlin. Misch was temporarily released from duty and drove to pick up his family to take them to the aircraft. However, his wife refused to take their daughter and leave him and her parents in Berlin. Upon returning to the Reich Chancellery, Misch learned that Hitler was releasing most of the remaining staff to leave Berlin. By that date, as the Red Army was entering Berlin, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda brought their six young children to stay in the Vorbunker. Joseph Goebbels moved into the room next to Misch's telephone exchange in the lower level of the Führerbunker. The Goebbels children would play in the corridor around Misch's post.|$|E

Among the six reasons McCartney gave for dissolving the Beatles was that Klein's company, ABKCO, had caused [...] "intolerable interference" [...] by overdubbing [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] without consulting McCartney. In his written affidavit, Starr countered this statement by saying that when Spector had sent acetates of Let It Be to each of the Beatles for their approval, with a request also for feedback: [...] "We all said yes. Even at the beginning Paul said yes. I spoke to <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> and said, 'Did you like it?' and he said, 'Yeah, it's OK.' He didn't put it down." [...] Starr added: [...] "And then suddenly he didn't want it to go out. Two weeks after that, he wanted to cancel it." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} May, Josh Brolin was {{revealed}} {{as the voice of}} Thanos, with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character. Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula. In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are [...] "the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into Avengers films in the future." [...] On casting Brolin, Feige said, We reached out to him {{and it was one of}} those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it’s very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [...] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of Avengers. Then we shot him and recorded for it.|$|E

We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously."

6000|$|I went {{round to}} Percy's {{to try to}} grovel in the dust before him, but he wouldn't see me.

I then got the present idea. Mark how all things work {{together}} for good. When they come to you and say [...] "No title for you.

When he talks to his grandmother she asks if it's true that he took Anne, and said she'll be praying for him. Tony tells his grandmother that he's going to kill Anne, and then himself.

50|$|She {{explains}} that the research her father was uncovering was the marijuana. She {{explains that}} the marijuana was believed to belong to an ancient tribe that has gone around for generations, which she calls the Poontang Tribe. Cyril knew Velicity's father from college and after her father's death, she called him to help her with her father's research and they discovered that marijuana {{can be used to}} help people's pain problems and severe injuries, explaining the reason how Cyril is able to walk again, and Velicity is planning <b>on</b> using <b>the</b> marijuana to give to doctors so she could help those who have cancer. Bachman then tells them that if the marijuana helped Cyril, it could probably help them with their side effects. Velicity wonders if the bong is in any connection with the marijuana from the poontang tribe. Larnell pulls out a bag, revealing a few pieces the blown up bong, Eebee. After putting the pieces together, forming her face, Velicity easily recognizes the bong as being the work of the tribe. Suddenly, Eebee (voiced by Michele Mais) comes back to life. Alister theorizes that the proximity of the marijuana has brought her back to life, which Eebee agrees. Larnell puts her back in the bag and Velicity tells them that she'll show her to Cyril. As she finds Cyril, she finds <b>him</b> talking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with a guy who he was planning on selling to. Realizing that he was planning on selling it to the black market and was planning on helping her at all, she confronts him until she steals Eebee out of his hands and goes off to cry to the others. Hearing about Cyril's plan <b>on</b> selling <b>the</b> marijuana, Eebee tells him that he can bring her back to her original form with the marijuana, and tells him that she and he will rule the world.|$|R

[...] Cosby became silent, leading to an awkward radio exchange in which Simon verbally described Cosby's actions to listeners: [...] "you're shaking your head no." [...] Simon continued asking Cosby to comment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> allegations before finally wrapping up the interview with no further communication from Cosby. In a November 6, 2014, interview with Associated Press reporter Brett Zongker, Cosby appeared visibly rattled by unexpected Buress questions and told Zongker, [...] "No, no, we don't answer that." [...] In the proceeding minutes, Cosby repeatedly attempted to get Zongker to confirm that the AP would edit out the Buress questions, implying that Zongker's [...] "integrity" [...] and ability to be a [...] "serious reporter" [...] would be compromised if that portion of the interview was not [...] "scuttled". When Zongker failed to guarantee this request, Cosby turned to his off-camera publicist David Brokaw and told <b>him</b> to get <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with Zongker's editors [...] "immediately".
