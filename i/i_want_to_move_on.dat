40|$|There are {{two things}} I’d like {{to talk with you}} about today. First, I want to talk about how our field—“diplomatic history, ” {{as it used to be}} called, or the history of {{international}} relations, or even just plain “international history”—has changed over the last thirty or forty years—that is, even since I did my own graduate work in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s. And then <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to what many of you might find a more interesting, although not unrelated, topic, and that’s the question of how this field should develop in the years to come. But let me start by talking neither about the past nor about the future of the discipline, but about the present. Where do we stand now? What are we to make of the kind of work that is being done today? This is not an easy question to answer in any simple way. I don’t know how many of you are familiar with the sentence that Charles Dickens used at the start of A Tale of Two Cities—“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times”—but I couldn’t get that sentence out of my mind when I was trying to decide what to say here today. In some ways, we’re living in a golden age: the best works today—I think, for example, of Adam Tooze’s history of the “making and 2 breaking of the Nazi economy, ” his book The Wages of Destruction—are quite extraordinary, better than anything that had been produced in the past. Just compare that book with another book on the same topic that came out in 1959, Germany’s Economic Preparations for War by Burton Klein. Tooze’s analysis is just much deeper and more penetrating: what is impressive is not simply the mass of evidence that he presents, although that’s extraordinary in itself, but the way that evidence is marshaled into an argument—and even more the way that argument forces you to rethink, in a very fundamental way, your whole understanding of the origins of the Second World War. Or compare Paul Kennedy’s Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism (which came out in 1980) with Raymond Sontag’s Germany and England: Background of Conflic...|$|E

[...] In October 1983, after releasing several singles and three albums, and gaining a small underground following, Danzig disbanded the Misfits due to increasing animosity among the band members and his dissatisfaction with their musical abilities.

40|$|Film {{and video}} {{releases}} in the UK are amongst the most tightly regulated in the Western World, and {{are subject to}} greater censorship than any other artistic medium.

However, {{following in the footsteps}} of Michel Foucault, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> beyond what Annette Kuhn might call a ‘prohibitive model’ of censorship and suggest that this power has been highly productive in its effects. In particular, what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate is that the wider discourses of censorship (which includes scientific studies and popular debate as well as the ‘official’ stance of the BBFC) actively constitute a particular form of contemporary spectatorship. That is, within the discourses of regulation and censorship, particularly those concerning issues of sex and violence on the screen, the body of the spectator becomes a central term around which these discourses revolve. As such, the discourses of censorship not only constitute a theoretical form of ‘corporeal spectatorship’, but actively shape the experience of watching certain kinds of ‘controversial’ films...|$|R

Although debate is the normal state of affairs in any scientific endeavour, my focus here is on two broad camps we might call ‘alarmists’ and ‘sceptics’. While alarmists have characterised the ‘obesity epidemic’ as a looming global health catastrophe, sceptics have argued that the consequences of rising obesity levels have either been greatly exaggerated or are unclear. In focusing on obesity, my intention is not to prove the case of one camp or the other but rather to construct a kind of anatomy of the obesity controversy. In this essay, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> beyond the idea of there being two camps in debates about obesity and provide a more complex account of the different groups that make up both sides.
