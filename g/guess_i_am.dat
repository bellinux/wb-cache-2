500|$|In his 2006 book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, Jonathan Gray {{analyzed}} the many advertisement parodies featured in The Simpsons. He commented on [...] "Bart to the Future", writing: [...] "As if ads in children's toys or in churches are not enough, in 'Bart to the Future,' an episode {{in which an}} Indian shaman at a casino treats Bart to a vision of his future, even his vision is interrupted when future-Bart says, 'I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an embarrassment,' and a ghost responds, 'You sure are. But, hey, there's an embarrassment of riches at the Caesar's Pow-Wow Indian Casino. You can bet on it!' Here [...] The Simpsons uses parody with great effect, not only to illustrate how annoyingly and disrespectfully ads infringe on any territory, but also to mock their logic and rhetoric." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1951, after {{a series}} of {{differences}} with Bradbury and other scientists, Teller resigned from Los Alamos, and returned to the University of Chicago. At about the same time, Ulam went on leave as a visiting professor at Harvard for a semester. Although Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report on their design and jointly applied for a patent on it, they soon became involved in a dispute over who deserved credit. [...] After the war, Bethe returned to Cornell University, but he was deeply involved in the development of thermonuclear weapons as a consultant. [...] In 1954, he wrote an article {{on the history of the}} H-bomb, which presents his opinion that both men contributed very significantly to the breakthrough. [...] This balanced view is shared by others who were involved, including Mark and Fermi, but Teller persistently attempted to downplay Ulam's role. [...] "After the H-bomb was made," [...] Bethe recalled, [...] "reporters started to call Teller the father of the H-bomb. For the sake of history, I think it is more precise to say that Ulam is the father, because he provided the seed, and Teller is the mother, because he remained with the child. As for me, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the midwife." ...|$|E
500|$|While experts found Bundy's precise {{diagnosis}} elusive, {{the majority}} of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). [...] Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as [...] "sociopaths" [...] or [...] "psychopaths"), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. [...] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. [...] "It hurts you ... I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in the enviable position of not {{having to deal with}} guilt." [...] There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. [...] "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, [...] "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody." [...] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: [...] "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. [...] "I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all." [...] Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{publication}} of the first volume, Rossiter was asked to run the NSF's program on the History and Philosophy of Science while its director took a year of leave during 1982–1983. In 1983–1984 she was a visiting professor at Harvard, where she continued work on her second volume. Still unable to find a tenure-track position, she applied for the NSF's Visiting Professorships for Women program, and received a one-year appointment to Cornell, which she stretched to two years (1986–1988). Cornell agreed to keep her on for another three years, but her funding was split between three departments including women's studies, agriculture, and history. In many ways, at this stage of her career she felt like some of the women she wrote about, saying [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> like a 78 [...] record in a 33 world".|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulties}} encountered {{during the}} peace talks {{between the government and}} the Zapatistas were due mostly to the initiatives promoted by the Attorney General of Mexico (PGR). On 23 October 1995, in order to derail {{the peace talks}}, the PGR arrested and sent Fernando Yañez Muñoz to prison. These actions violated the governing peace talks law, which granted a guarantee of free passage to all Zapatistas during the negotiations and suspended outstanding arrest warrants against them. On 26 October, the Zapatista National Liberation Army denied any association with Muñoz and announced a Red Alert, while Marcos returned to the mountains. That same day, the PGR dropped all charges against the alleged Comandante German. The COCOPA agreed with the determination. On 27 October, Muñoz was freed from the Reclusorio Preventivo Oriente. He said: [...] "I was arrested for political reasons and I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> set free for political reasons, my arrest was with the objective purpose of sabotaging the peace talks." [...] On 29 October 1995 the Zapatistas lifted the Red Alert and negotiations were resumed.|$|E
2500|$|Though the game's {{director}} [...] "deliberately created Bayonetta from scratch" [...] and {{has called}} its story [...] "completely original", he has admitted using [...] "some names from Scandinavian mythology" [...] and playing [...] "about half of" [...] Devil May Cry 4 for research. [...] As {{a fan of}} folk music, he named Bayonetta's set of four handguns after the old English ballad [...] "Scarborough Fair", and its individual guns Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme. [...] Hiroshi Yamaguchi focused on composing music for the game that has a [...] "nice up-tempo beat" [...] and expresses femininity through female choirs, pianos, and other beautiful' instruments"—though some tracks also use pure orchestra or folk instruments—while Kenichiro Yoshimura transformed Shimazaki's Bayonetta design into a game model and used the digital sculpting tool ZBrush to create normal maps for its details. [...] He worked with Shimazaki on the model's makeup, referred to foreign models with similar bodies, and said [...] "I really wanted to get Bayonetta's backside perfect. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> into that sort of thing..." [...] The language spoken by the Angels and for all Infernal Summons is Enochian.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then? Oh! Then. Oh yes, sure, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> scared, all right!... Say, we {{got that}} seat padded so she's darn {{comfortable}} now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to blame," [...] replied Shadow, sheepishly. [...] "I rubbed him in {{the rear}} with my stick. He didn't {{appreciate}} the handling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, I'm {{sorry for}} what I said to you the other day an' for--for everythin' else. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a bit lit up. I beg pardon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{beats me}} too, Simcoe. As you may <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> always most {{cautious}} about it, and always {{take a very}} roundabout way {{of going to the}} station." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do not know, Lily, and yet I can <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure, sweet, that {{he wishes}} {{you to take}} my brother Geoffrey, and leave me on one side.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> able, {{although}} my head aches a good bit, I {{can tell you}} that. I am much obliged for {{what you have done}} for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, I'm not hungry,' he answered, averting his head, and {{speaking}} rather contemptuously, {{as if he}} <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to divine the occasion of his good humour.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought he}} might reform, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mistaken," [...] said Phil. [...] "Say, we had better do as Buster suggests,--keep our eyes peeled for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get out--don't chew me up!" [...] groaned Whopper, {{and then}} sat up and rubbed his eyes. [...] "Wha--what's the matter? Oh, I--er--I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dreaming," [...] he said sheepishly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, I wish I {{had never}} thought of such a joke," [...] moaned Peter, trying in vain to find a {{comfortable}} position. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> served just right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{can keep}} {{on the tracks}} all right," [...] she assented. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a little easier to deal with, for instance, than your friend Mr. Jocelyn Thew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> Joe," [...] replied Cap'n Bill, [...] "for {{in such a}} wet {{country the}} fishes {{have the best of}} it. But I ain't sure I'd like this sort o' thing always." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought he}} did have, but--er--I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mistaken. Oh, come on and help me!" [...] pleaded Nat, and set to work without further delay, to clear the road.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, my boy. I had {{a reason}} such as you very wisely <b>guessed.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> anxious {{for you to be}} here when a rather {{important}} phase of our local history occurred." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never did}} when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a boy, but--well--I {{did have a}} couple of fights when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on the cattle-boat and in England. Neither of them {{amounted}} to very much, though, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> scared stiff!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll get out now. It's real nice, but I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too heavy," [...] said Bab, as {{the face}} before her got redder and redder, and the breath {{began to come}} in puffs.|$|E
6000|$|Jefferson laughed. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> {{or these}} brutes wouldn't {{try to take}} {{advantage}} of me. Still, in another minute you're going to see me make a hole in somebody!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will not}} think that," [...] said Morley. [...] "At present we {{will think of}} other things. You may <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a bit wearied; I think I'll say good night; you have strangers with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ferget it," [...] whispered Byrne, [...] "fer a {{week ago}} <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a coward. Dere seems to be more'n one kind o' nerve--I'm jest a-learnin' of the right kind, I guess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Amram, [...] "I think I do; you desert folk are so reckless and athletic. Also, to be frank, as you {{may have}} <b>guessed,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unarmed. Now, what do you propose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] Joe {{admitted}} reluctantly. [...] "I {{thought you}} was turnin' me down, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mistaken. But you can't lick me, Mart, in a stand-up fight. I've got the reach on you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am!</b> You are {{a set of}} trumps, and we'll {{give you}} a {{first-class}} spread after the play to pay for it. Won't we, fellows?" [...] answered Jack, much gratified, and feeling that now he could act his own part capitally.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not much}} of a visitor, Brother McMurdo," [...] he said at last. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too busy over the folk that visit me. But I thought I'd stretch a point and drop down to see you in your own house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a mite {{suspicious}} too. It {{had been}} {{got away from}} me once, and I determined I wouldn't let on I'd got it until a photographer had made a dozen copies of it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Her father laughed out. [...] "Mother {{been telling}} you? Well, I WAS pretty blue last night; but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> more scared than hurt. How'd {{you like to}} go to the theatre to-night? Sellers at the Park. Heigh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How fare you neighbour?" [...] said a pale {{young woman}} {{carrying}} an infant to the comely dame. [...] "Here's an awful crowd, surely. The {{women will be}} fighting and tearing to get in, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> much afeard." ...|$|R
