5|$|The vast {{majority}} of American made vehicles continued to use simple Live rear axles into the 1980s, but Americans could access four wheel <b>Independent</b> <b>suspension</b> technology on imported cars, like the 1952 Volkswagen Beetle, 1961 Jaguar E-Type, and 1968 Datsun 510.|$|E
5|$|The rear-wheel {{steering}} was {{dropped from the}} production car to save weight and reduce complexity, as was the height adjustable suspension and active aerodynamic technology. The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of front and rear <b>independent</b> <b>suspension,</b> double unequal length wishbones, inboard coil springs and anti-roll bars, with Bilstein gas-filled dampers. The suspension was designed {{in accordance with the}} FIA Group C specifications.|$|E
25|$|More {{unconventional}} {{was the use}} of a backbone chassis and four-wheel <b>independent</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{multi-link}} suspension {{is a type}} of vehicle suspension design typically used in <b>independent</b> <b>suspensions,</b> using three or more lateral arms, and one or more longitudinal arms. A wider definition considers any <b>independent</b> <b>suspensions</b> having three control links or more {{multi-link suspension}}s. These arms {{do not have to be}} of equal length, and may be angled away from their [...] "obvious" [...] direction. It was first introduced in the late 1960s on the Mercedes-Benz C111 and later on their W201 and W124 series.|$|R
5000|$|The 2008 Acadia has a 118.9 in {{wheelbase}} and 67.28 in front/rear tracks. The <b>independent</b> front <b>suspension</b> is a MacPherson strut design, with a direct-acting {{stabilizer bar}} and aluminum knuckles. The <b>independent</b> rear <b>suspension</b> uses a [...] "H" [...] Linked design.|$|R
50|$|The 2008 HX show car {{was smaller}} than both the H2 and H3. It {{featured}} a 3.6 L V6 engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. The HX shared with other Hummers a body-on-frame design, with front and rear <b>independent</b> <b>suspensions,</b> four-wheel-disc brakes, and full-time four-wheel drive.|$|R
25|$|The Enzo has 4 wheel <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> with {{push-rod}} actuated {{shock absorbers}} {{which can be}} adjusted from the cabin, complemented with anti-roll bars at the front and rear.|$|E
25|$|The Medallion {{featured}} four-wheel <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> with MacPherson struts in {{the front}} with negative offset for stability and inclined lower wishbones for anti-dive effect, while the rear suspension is controlled by a V-section cross-member with four transverse torsion bars and inclined shock absorbers.|$|E
25|$|Daimler-Benz {{also has}} a history in four-wheel drive. In 1907 the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft had built a four-wheel-driven vehicle called Dernburg-Wagen, also {{equipped}} with four-wheel steering, that was used by German colonial civil servant, Bernhard Dernburg, in Namibia. Mercedes and BMW, in 1926, introduced a rather sophisticated four-wheel drive, the G1, the G4 and G4 following. The 1937 Mercedes-Benz G5 and BMW 325 4×4 featured full-time four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, three locking differentials, and fully <b>independent</b> <b>suspension.</b> They were produced because of a government demand for a four-wheel-drive passenger vehicle. The modern G-series/Wolf such as the G500 and G55 AMG still feature some of the attributes, {{with the exception of}} fully <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> since it hinders suspension articulation. The Unimog is another Mercedes truck.|$|E
50|$|Swing axles were supplanted {{in general}} use by De Dion tube axles {{in the late}} 1960s, though live axles {{remained}} the most common. Most rear suspensions {{have been replaced by}} more modern <b>independent</b> <b>suspensions</b> in recent years, and both swing and deDion types are virtually unused today.|$|R
50|$|In February 1981 GX trim was added. L20E sedan with <b>independent</b> rear <b>{{suspension}}</b> in {{the vehicle}} suspension formula (a six-link <b>independent</b> rear <b>suspension</b> was equipped as standard on the turbocharged cars). In November 1981 the car received some improvement and the Turbo Medalist model was new to the lineup.|$|R
25|$|Same as the SB {{except for}} <b>independent</b> front <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
25|$|The four-wheel <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> {{provides}} uncharacteristically accurate handling for {{a vehicle}} {{of its size}} and price range. However, due {{to the use of}} multiple suspension pivot and attachment points (similar to the Corvette's suspension architecture), maintaining the suspension is more costly than some less technical suspension systems.|$|E
25|$|Development of {{automotive}} technology was rapid, {{due in part}} to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910–1911), <b>independent</b> <b>suspension,</b> and four-wheel brakes.|$|E
25|$|The ATOM {{is based}} on a {{modified}} chassis of the French 8×8 VCBI featuring an automatic gearbox and transmission with <b>independent</b> <b>suspension.</b> The chassis, drive with <b>independent</b> <b>suspension,</b> and fire control system are developed and implemented by Renault Trucks while the artillery turret gun is designed by Petrel. In the front of the vehicle, the driver's compartment is located on the left side and power pack on the right side. In the center, the combat compartment is located. The crew consists of three people and eight passengers can be carried. The hinged ramp {{at the rear of the}} chassis and four hatches located on the roof serve as an entry and exit point for the vehicle's crew and passengers. The volume of the interior passenger compartment is 10.7 cubic meters.|$|E

25|$|Three British car companies– Alvis, Bentley, and Sunbeam– entered {{vehicles}} in local racing events between 1920 and 1930. Alvis and Sunbeam were {{at that time}} the only British companies building cars to Grand Prix formula racing specifications. Of these, Alvis was the only company whose race cars were characterized by front-wheel drive and fully <b>independent</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1898, de Dietrich debuted the Torpilleur (Torpedo) racer, which {{featured}} a four-cylinder engine and <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> in front, for the Paris-Amsterdam Trial; Gaudry wrecked en route, but still placed third. The response was substantial, exceeding one million gold francs. The 1899 torpilleur was less successful, despite underslung chassis, a rear-mounted monobloc four, and twin carburettors; poor preparation left {{none of the}} works teams able to complete the Tour de France.|$|E
25|$|Coil spring <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> {{features}} {{by way of}} a MacPherson strut type with stabilizer and strut bar up front, and a MacPherson rear setup with parallel lower arms. Steering uses a {{rack and}} pinion design; braking hardware is made up of front ventilated discs and rear drums with a double proportioning valve to suppress lock-up. Innovatively, a sensor is fitted to detect worn-out brake pads, alerted by use of an audible chime.|$|E

25|$|The leaf-spring {{suspension}} configuration is independent, {{because the}} movement of one wheel is not determined by {{the position of the}} other. Control arms are utilized to define the motion of the wheel as the suspension is compressed. The usual coil springs are replaced with a single FRP spring, which spans the width of the car. As in <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> systems using coil springs, and unlike the common leaf-spring supported Hotchkiss rear axle, the suspension kinematics are defined only by the control arms.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} of the DMC-12 is a four-wheel <b>independent</b> <b>suspension,</b> coil springs, and telescopic shock absorbers. The front suspension uses double wishbones, while the rear is a multi-link setup. In its original development stages, the car {{is said to have}} handled quite well. Design drawings clearly show that the design met NHTSA minimum bumper and headlight heights of the time. Many owners have subsequently replaced or modified the front springs to return the front height to the original design specification.|$|E
25|$|The {{design has}} a {{monocoque}} (unibody) construction with four-wheel independent air suspension. Air suspension allowed variable ride height and achieved similar axle articulation {{to the previous}} live axle design. This retained off-road abilities while improving on-road performance. The new Range Rover's introduction in late 2002 as a 2003 model for the North American market resulted in the Range Rover and Ford Expedition (also new for 2003) being the only two SUVs in the full-size sport utility class with four-wheel <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> systems at that time.|$|E

25|$|The next model {{produced}} by TVR was the Grantura Mark 1, which used a fastback-style body over the existing chassis design (with the same trailing-arm <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> front and rear.) Engine options included the Ford 100E sidevalve (normally aspirated or supercharged), the Ford 105E OHV unit, two different Coventry Climax units, or the MGA's BMC B-series. The {{interior of the}} Grantura was cramped, with the short doors and 17"-diameter steering wheel proving impediments to ingress. Climax-powered cars would be finished with a leather interior, while cars with the lower-specification engines were trimmed with vinyl.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 {{the company}} {{was taken over by}} David Brown and moved in with Aston Martin, which he had also bought, in Feltham, Middlesex. The old Staines works at Egham Hythe passed to Petters Limited, in which A.P. Good had {{acquired}} the controlling interest. Production restarted with the last prototypes from W. O. Bentley, the 1948 2.6-Litre with new chassis featuring fully <b>independent</b> <b>suspension.</b> Its new 2580 cc twin overhead cam straight 6 became the basis for the Aston Martin engines of the 1950s. The engine grew to 3 litres in 1953 and continued to be available until 1958.|$|E
25|$|Celica Camry {{utilizes}} the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive {{layout and}} in A40 guise, a standard four-link rigid axle suspension system with gasoline inline-four engines displacing 1.6liters for the 12T-U (TA41) and 1.8liters with the 13T-U (TA46). Initial model grades comprised: 1600 LT, 1600 XT, 1800 LT, 1800 XT, and 1800 XT Super Edition. In August 1980, Toyota released high-end models with four-wheel <b>independent</b> <b>suspension,</b> denoted A50 (front MacPherson struts, rear semi-trailing arm setup; four-wheel disc brakes). For the TA57 series 1800 SX, Toyota fitted the 1.8-liter 3T-EU engine. Toyota designated the new 2.0-liter grades, the 21R-U powered 2000 SE and 18R-GEU-based 2000 GT as RA56 and RA55, respectively.|$|E
