Malachi quickly goes on {{to point out that}} the people have not been faithful. In fact, the people are not giving God all that God deserves. Just as the priests have been offering unacceptable sacrifices, so the people have been neglecting to offer their full tithe to Elohim. The result of these shortcomings <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> come to believe that no good comes out of serving God.|$|E

25|$|One {{objection}} is that {{a democratic}} republic built on freedom of dissent should not require its citizens to pledge allegiance to it, and that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right to refrain from speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech {{in the context of}} the ritual of pledging allegiance. Another objection <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who are most likely to recite the Pledge every day, small children in schools, cannot really give their consent or even completely understand the Pledge they are making. Another criticism {{is that a}} government requiring or promoting this phrase violates protections against the establishment of religion guaranteed in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E

25|$|European {{constitutional}}/absolute monarchies. Liechtenstein and Monaco are constitutional monarchies {{in which}} the Prince theoretically retains many powers of an absolute monarch. In reality, he is a figurehead who is expected not to use that power. For example, the 2003 Constitution referendum which gives the Prince of Liechtenstein the power to veto any law that the Landtag (parliament) proposes and the Landtag can veto any law that the Prince tries to pass. The Prince can hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee {{from his or her}} post. However, what makes him not an absolute monarch <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> can call for a referendum to end the monarchy's reign. When Crown Prince Alois threatened to veto a referendum to legalize abortion in 2011 (which didn't actually happen), voters were surprised because the Prince hasn't vetoed any law for over 3 decades. The Prince of Monaco has simpler powers but cannot hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post, but he can elect the minister of state, government council and judges. Both Albert II and Hans-Adam II are theoretically very powerful, but in practice even they have very limited power compared to the Islamic monarchs (see below). They also own huge tracts of land and are shareholders in many companies.|$|E

It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. But I want to do it for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album. The natural progression of soul, the next step to soul is funk".|$|E
2500|$|The {{prevailing}} {{point of}} view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people's</b> adherence to Kim Jong-il's cult of personality was solely {{out of respect for}} Kim Il-sung or out of fear of punishment for failure to pay homage.

Katz said it was [...] "probably true" [...] that the Mafia carried out the killing, but that the gangsters suspected of the crime were either dead or missing. The verdict in the trial was {{not the end of the}} matter, since by June 2007 the prosecutor's office in Rome had opened a second investigation implicating, among others, Licio Gelli.|$|E
50|$|A {{historical}} {{example of}} this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Europeans in <b>the</b> Middle Ages believed <b>that</b> lice <b>were</b> beneficial to your health, since there would rarely be any lice on sick <b>people.</b> <b>The</b> reasoning <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> got sick because the lice left. The real reason however <b>is</b> <b>that</b> lice <b>are</b> extremely sensitive to body temperature. A small increase of body temperature, such as in a fever, will make the lice look for another host. The medical thermometer {{had not yet been}} invented, so this increase in temperature was rarely noticed. Noticeable symptoms came later, giving <b>the</b> impression <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lice left before the person got sick.|$|R

2500|$|Another news <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> {{watching}} the show could vote by telephone or SMS which was their suspected Mole during all the game; so, the most suspected contestant became the first executable member of the Team. Next, {{it was time for}} the Team nominations: each of the participants had to nominate his suspected Mole(with secret votes only in the first and second series): the contestant receiving most of the votes became the second executable Team member; in case of draw between some contestants, the one of them who received most of the votes by the audience was declared the Team suspected contestant. So, the 2 suspects had to answer a 10 questions questionnaire about the Mole identity: the contestant who got most of the answers wrong had to leave the game. In case of draw, in the first series the contestant spending more time answering the questions was eliminated from the game; in the second series, during the questionnaire contestants heartbeat was controlled by a [...] "cardio frequency meter", so the contestant having the fastest average heartbeat was executed: that made the Mole executable too! In this eventuality (never happened), a new Mole had to be selected by the production crew.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} alternative weekly Montreal Mirror on June 8, Day addressed some of the perceptions that he was homophobic. He began by denying that he had ever referred to homosexuality as a [...] "mental disorder". He acknowledged having gay staffers working on his campaign: [...] "First of all, {{as far as my}} campaign, I don't ask people if they're homosexual, lesbian or heterosexual. People who are working on my campaign are doing so because they believe in me. That doesn't mean that they necessarily agree 100 per cent with everything I believe. But in principle they're saying we think you can take this Alliance to the next step and we think you'd be good for Canada. So I don't ask. Nobody has to pass a sex test to be on this campaign." [...] But the statement that made headlines in newspapers across the country was Day's acknowledgment that he would indeed consider using the Notwithstanding Clause to block a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, then a distinct possibility that was unnerving many social conservatives. After being pressed by journalist Matthew Hays on the Notwithstanding Clause question, Day replied [...] "Yes, and the reason I say that is because such a significant number of constituents would reflect concern on that and would want the discussion. The Alberta position on this is that the definition of marriage changing would allow {{for the use of the}} Notwithstanding Clause. That's because the sense of the elected officials in Alberta <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> would be significantly motivated on that issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his resignation, {{from his}} post as Commissioner of the Food and Drugs Administration in December 1969, Dr. Herbert L. Ley, Jr. [...] In an {{interview}} to the New York Times, warned {{the public about the}} FDA’s inability to safeguard consumers. People were being misled, he believed “The thing [...] that bugs me <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> think the FDA is protecting them - it isn’t. What the FDA is doing and what the public thinks it’s doing are as different as night and day,” he said. The agency, in his opinion, did not have the motivation to protect consumers, faced budget shortfalls, and lacked support from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Dr. Ley was critical of Congress, the Administration and the drug industry, he stated that he had [...] "constant, tremendous, sometimes unmerciful pressure" [...] from the drug industry and that the drug company lobbyists, combined with the politicians who worked on behalf of their patrons, could bring “tremendous pressure” to bear on him and his staff, to try preventing FDA restrictions on their drugs. The interview concluded with Ley stating that the entire issue was about money, “pure and simple”. On December 15, 1999, interviewed for the oral history program of the FDA History Office, Dr. Ley shared that from the first controversy in his tenure as FDA Commissioner he had a [...] "gut feeling" [...] that his life expectancy at the FDA was probably limited. He said he had done everything by the book, both in the FDA and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and he thinks that what the Administration was really wishing, was that he would stonewall the whole Academy report, because it was goring too many pharmaceutical companies.|$|E

[...] Ayaan Hirsi Ali stated that, in her opinion, [...] "The Christian extremists here, in the United States, who take the Bible and use it to kill people and hurt people, they are the fringe, but unfortunately, what we are seeing in Muslim countries <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who feel they should be governed under the Sharia Law, are not a fringe.
