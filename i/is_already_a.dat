5|$|After the {{contract}} in 1513 for {{the entrance of}} the cathedral of Chiari, Cairano is no longer named in any document known. The first relevant text following, in chronological order, is a policy of valuation in 1517 of Bianca, his wife, which states she <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> widow. The death of Cairano is then placed between these two dates, probably around 1515 or a little later.|$|E
5|$|N. R. Malkani finds Aurobindo's {{theory of}} {{creation}} to be false, as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond normal human experiences. He says {{the theory is}} an intellectual response to a difficult problem and that Aurobindo uses the trait of unpredictability in theorising and discussing things not based upon truth of existence. Malkani says that awareness <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> reality and suggests {{there would be no}} need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness.|$|E
5|$|After Kosovo's {{declaration}} of independence from Serbia in 2008, its broadcaster Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK) applied for EBU membership, and wished to enter Kosovo into Eurovision Song Contest 2009. Kosovo would have made their Eurovision Song Contest debut in 2009 if it could have joined the EBU. There <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> cooperation agreement signed between the EBU and RTK and the EBU supports the membership of RTK. As of 2013, RTK has observer status within the EBU and did participate in the Eurovision Young Dancers 2011. According to the Kosovan newspaper Koha Ditore, a possible entry would be selected via a national final called Akordet e Kosovës, a former pop show that had been taken off the air some years ago.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of Fleming's first book, Casino Royale, Bond <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> 00 agent, having been given the {{position}} after killing two enemy agents, a Japanese spy on the thirty-sixth floor of the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center in New York City and a Norwegian double agent who had betrayed two British agents; it is suggested by Bond scholar John Griswold that these were part of Bond's wartime service with Special Operations Executive, a British World War II covert military organisation. In 1954, according to the Soviet file on him in From Russia, With Love, Bond is made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.|$|E
5|$|If he accepts, and <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> bishop, he {{immediately}} takes office. If {{he is not}} a bishop, however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest is elected, the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself—Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger—was elected pope. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.|$|E
5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and has {{introduced}} goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side of the gorge for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{characters}} from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern {{over the loss of}} innocent life. However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's protégée is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity. In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking LSD to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a Quran is found in his possession.|$|E

In this case, Rosh Hashanah in year 1 is postponed from Tuesday (the third deḥiyyah). As it cannot be postponed to Wednesday, it is postponed to Thursday, and year 1 ends up with 354 days.|$|E
25|$|In 1836, rural Olive Township {{was formed}} in western Elkhart County, and in 1849, as the {{population}} grew, a post office named Mt. Olive opened.

Since there <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> town named Salem in Indiana, the name was changed to Wakarusa in 1859. The Mt. Olive Post Office was renamed for Wakarusa a year later.|$|E
