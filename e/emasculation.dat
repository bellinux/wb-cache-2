5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the <b>emasculation</b> of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration.

5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of <b>emasculation</b> at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E

In {{spite of all the}} cultural <b>emasculations,</b> the denigrations of slaves by their slave masters in this present day age and low esteem with which Africans and Caribbeans of African descent are regarded in world opinion, they were able to cling on to their African cultural elements. To the Caribbean person of African descent it was worse off than the African person because of having undergone a double process of enslavement and colonization. This article has chosen to compare the Brazilian carnivalesque celebrations to show the retention of firmer linkages with the African cultures particularly with the Zimbabwean Pungwe as offering carnival space during and after the Chimurenga War...|$|R

Tarailo—Californian grape breeders {{working for}} the ARS, the chief scientific research agency of the USDA—crossed Thompson Seedless and Concord in order to answer a technical question about a newly developed procedure for breeding novel, superior seedless grapes. The researchers wanted to demonstrate that plants created from embryo culture were derived from fertilized eggs (zygotic) instead of the maternal tissue (somatic). From 1231 <b>emasculations</b> (removal of male flower parts to control pollination) of Thompson Seedless, the researchers produced 130 ovules using embryo rescue procedures. From these, 40 embryos developed and three seedlings were planted. The original seedling of Thomcord was planted in 1984 in plots in cooperation with California State University, Fresno. It was later selected in 1986 by Ramming and Tarailo and tested in the San Joaquin Valley under the name A29-67, and was introduced as [...] "Thomcord." ...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{initiated}} at ICRISAT to cross kabuli chickpea cv. ICCV 6 and desi cv. GL 769 using a perennial wild species, C. canariense, as the male parent. <b>Emasculations</b> and pollinations {{were carried out}} in the morning between 8. 00 h and 10. 00 h. An aqueous mixture of growth regulators consisting of gibberellic acid, NAA, and kinetin (7 : 1 : 1) was applied {{to the base of the}} pollinated pistils 5 h after pollination. Light and fluorescent microscopic studies showed that the pollen grains germinated normally on the stigma. Swelling of the pollen tubes was rarely observed. Pod initials were observed at 6 days after pollination (DAP). By 14 DAP, yellowing of the pods was observed; hence pods were harvested at 14 - 18 DAP. The maximum pod size obtained was 4 mm × 4. 5 mm and ovule width was 2 mm. Ovules did not show growth even after 45 days of culture. Globular embryos were observed. In the pollinated pistils where growth regulators were not applied, development of pod initials was not observed...|$|R
5|$|Other scriptures {{describe}} other {{visits by}} Shiva to Deodar Forest in his Bhikshatana form. The Vamana Purana mentions Shiva entering the Deodar Forest twice as a beggar. Maddened {{by the death}} of his first wife Sati but chased by the love-god Kamadeva, Shiva escapes to the Deodar Forest and lives as a mendicant. The sages' wives who come to grant him food become sexually excited at the mere sight of him. The sages curse his Linga to fall off and it becomes the infinite pillar. Brahma and Vishnu propitiate him and Shiva reabsorbs the Linga into his body. In another instance, while passing the Deodar Forest, Parvati notices sages who worship Shiva and have emaciated their bodies with fasts and severe vows. Parvati requests Shiva to save them from further pain, but Shiva declares that the sages are simply foolish and have not restrained their passion and anger. He enters the forest as a handsome man, wearing only a garland of sylvan flowers. He entices the sages' wives, who give him alms. As before, the Linga of the cursed Shiva falls off, but eventually the sages realise their folly and worship the Linga. Similar accounts of Bhikshatana-Shiva's visit to the Deodar Forest to humble and enlighten the false sages, Bhikshatana-Shiva's <b>emasculation</b> and establishment of Linga worship also appear in the Mahabharata, the Shiva Purana, and the Bhagavata Purana.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was very strong, {{maintained}} by <b>emasculation</b> of civil society, engineered elections, liberal use of military's coercive powers, {{and a strong}} economy.

25|$|Heterosis, or {{hybrid vigor}} (as in the {{familiar}} F1 hybrids of maize), occurs in common (hexaploid) wheat, {{but it is difficult}} to produce seed of hybrid cultivars on a commercial scale (as is done with maize) because wheat flowers are perfect and normally self-pollinate. Commercial hybrid wheat seed has been produced using chemical hybridizing agents; these chemicals selectively interfere with pollen development, or naturally occurring cytoplasmic male sterility systems. Hybrid wheat has been a limited commercial success in Europe (particularly France), the United States and South Africa. F1 hybrid wheat cultivars should not be confused with the standard method of breeding inbred wheat cultivars by crossing two lines using hand <b>emasculation,</b> then selfing or inbreeding the progeny many (ten or more) generations before release selections are identified to be released as a variety or cultivar.|$|E
40|$|Although diet {{might be}} a {{valuable}} adjunct to prostate cancer care, men typically have poorer diets than women and {{are less likely to}} change the way they eat after a cancer diagnosis. Gender theory suggests that dominant ideals of masculinity shape men 2 ̆ 7 s health and food practices; however, the role of female partners in men 2 ̆ 7 s diets is poorly understood. Through qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews, this article explores accounts of 14 Canadian couples 2 ̆ 7 food practices guided by a gender relations framework to expose how tacit performances of masculinity and femininity interact to shape the diets of men with prostate cancer. Findings show that many men became more interested and involved in their diets after a prostate cancer diagnosis, practices that might be theorized as a counter hegemonic project or 2 ̆ 7 feminization 2 ̆ 7, adding to other prostate cancer induced <b>emasculations</b> (i. e., treatment induced incontinence and impotence).

25|$|In {{traditional}} agricultural systems wheat populations often {{consist of}} landraces, informal farmer-maintained populations that often maintain {{high levels of}} morphological diversity. Although landraces of wheat are no longer grown in Europe and North America, {{they continue to be}} important elsewhere. The origins of formal wheat breeding lie in the nineteenth century, when single line varieties were created through selection of seed from a single plant noted to have desired properties. Modern wheat breeding developed {{in the first years of}} the twentieth century and was closely linked to the development of Mendelian genetics. The standard method of breeding inbred wheat cultivars is by crossing two lines using hand <b>emasculation,</b> then selfing or inbreeding the progeny.

25|$|At Birkenau, about 37,000 Salonicans were gassed immediately, {{especially}} women, {{children and}} the elderly. Nearly {{a quarter of all}} 400 experiments perpetrated on the Jews were on Greek Jews, especially those from Salonika. These experiments included <b>emasculation</b> and implantation of cervical cancer in women. Most of the twins died following atrocious crimes. Others from the community last worked in the camps. In the years 1943–1944, they accounted for a significant proportion of the workforce of Birkenau, making up to 11,000 of the labourers. Because of their unfamiliarity with Yiddish, Jews from Greece were sent to clean up the rubble of the Warsaw Ghetto in August 1943 in order to build a camp.

25|$|The Khitan {{adopted the}} {{practice}} of using eunuchs from the Chinese and the eunuchs were non-Khitan prisoners of war. The Khitan were a nomadic Mongolic people and originally did not have eunuchs {{as part of their}} culture. When the Khitan founded the Liao Dynasty they developed a harem system with concubines and wives and adopted eunuchs as part of it. The eunuchs were not Khitan and they came from two sources, all of their eunuchs were captured ethnic Chinese from the Central Plains. The Khitan captured Chinese people who were already eunuchs at the Jin court when they invaded the Later Jin. Another source was during their war with the Chinese Song dynasty, the Khitan would raid China, capture Han Chinese boys as prisoners of war and emasculate them to become eunuchs. The <b>emasculation</b> of captured Chinese boys guaranteed a continuous supply of eunuchs to serve in the Liao Dynasty harem. The Empress Dowager Chengtian played a large role in the raids to capture and emasculate the boys.|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} <b>emasculation</b> is {{prevalent}} in Hemingway's work, {{most notably in}} The Sun Also Rises. <b>Emasculation,</b> according to Fiedler, {{is a result of}} a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained emancipation. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning in the book. Her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times. Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the [...] "natural" [...] versus the [...] "unnatural". In [...] "Alpine Idyll" [...] the [...] "unnaturalness" [...] of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the [...] "unnaturalness" [...] of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter.

Midas's initial joy in acquiring gold is symbolic of contemporary England, [...] "racing headlong into its new identity as an industrialized, consumerist society financed by political and mercantile imperialism". For Shelley, these commercial efforts are particularly masculine; Midas's ears, which symbolise <b>emasculation,</b> are juxtaposed to masculinising gold. Furthermore, Shelley suggests that when political leaders become feminised, they lose their political power. She draws an analogy between Midas and George III and George IV, British kings who were often viewed as feminised.|$|E

[...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so {{for the first time we}} can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal <b>emasculation,</b> are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings.

This post, which can be traced up to c. 680, was usually held by close members of the imperial family, often virtual heirs apparent. Thus it was the support of his men that secured Justin I (r. 518–527), who held the post {{at the time of the}} death of Anastasius I, his elevation to the throne. Similarly, Justin II (r. 565–578) relied on the support of the Excubitors for his unchallenged accession; their count, Tiberius, was a close friend who had been appointed to the post through Justin's intervention. Tiberius was to be the Emperor's right-hand man throughout his reign, eventually succeeding him as Tiberius II (r. 578–582). He too would be succeeded by his own comes excubitorum, Maurice (r. 582–602). Under Maurice, the post was held by his brother-in-law Philippicus, and under Phocas (r. 602–610) by Priscus. Another powerful occupant was Valentinus, who secured it during the power struggles that accompanied the regency of Empress-dowager Martina in 641, before deposing her and her son Heraklonas and installing Constans II (r. 641–668) as emperor. Valentinus dominated the new regime, but his attempt to become emperor in 644 ended in his being lynched by the mob.

Mr. Ghent, who is sympathetic with the socialist movement, follows with cynic fear every aggressive act of the capitalist class. Mr. Brooks, who yearns for the perpetuation of the capitalist system as long as possible, follows with grave dismay each aggressive act of the labor and socialist organizations. Mr. Ghent traces the <b>emasculation</b> of labor by capital, and Mr. Brooks traces the <b>emasculation</b> of independent competing capital by labor. In short, each marshals the facts of a side in the two sides which go to make a struggle so great that even the French Revolution is insignificant beside it; for this later struggle, {{for the first time in}} the history of struggles, is not confined to any particular portion of the globe, but involves the whole of it.|$|E

In the Antilope niger the male is black, the female {{as well as the}} young being brown; in A. sing-sing the male is much brighter coloured than the hornless female, and his chest and belly are blacker; in the male A. caama, the marks and lines which occur on various parts of the body are black instead of as in the female brown; in the brindled gnu (A. gorgon) “the colours of the male are nearly the same as those of the female, only deeper and of a brighter hue.”[357] Other analogous cases could be added.|$|E
60|$|Voice and Musical Powers.—In {{some species}} of Quadrumana {{there is a}} great {{difference}} between the adult sexes, {{in the power of the}} voice and in the development of the vocal organs; and man appears to have inherited this difference from his early progenitors.

According to Sir Duncan Gibb,[403] the voice differs in the different races of mankind; and with the natives of Tartary, China, &c., the voice of the male is said not to differ so much from that of the female, as in most other races.|$|E
