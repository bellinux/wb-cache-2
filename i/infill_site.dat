40|$|Barber is {{well known}} as one of the most talented British architects {{operating}} in housing design, linking his research into the nature of street life with the creation of high-density housing models. This built project, completed and inhabited in 2002, consists of an ultra-dense mixed-use urban regeneration scheme on a 4. 5 m wide slot <b>infill</b> <b>site</b> in Hackney. The project wraps a retail unit, two maisonettes and a live/work unit around a central courtyard at first-floor level; by doing so it achieves a density level which is equivalent to 650 habitable rooms per hectare, almost three times the density of local development. Research issues explored by Barber included how to design models of high-density mixed-use building that could help improve urban sustainability, and how to utilise new fabrication technologies – notably the parabolic roof vault to the rear – given a tight budget and construction schedule. In terms of research, Barber’s scheme offers a novel spatial and technical response to the pressure on mixed-use development in a city like London with its land shortage and extremely high land unit costs. As such, Doris’s Place contributes squarely to contemporary research into higher densities of urban living, as being urged upon the profession by bodies such as the Urban Task Force and by architectural figures like Lord Richard Rogers and Ricky Burdett. The project was shortlisted for a RIBA London Region Award, and was written up variously in the Guardian, Independent, etc.; the innovative roof construction was subsequently analysed in Building Design (6 May 2005, p. 22). Barber is frequently invited to give public lectures, now having presented nearly 50 talks across Britain and abroad – including a special session on housing policy at the Labour Party Conference in Manchester (October 2006), and at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tehran, Iran (October 2007) ...|$|E

40|$|Smart growth policies, {{in order}} to curtail low-density sprawl, seek to {{increase}} development in existing communities. These policies promote infill development, projects built on underutilized parcels in and surrounded by developed areas. While smart growth advocates view reduced sprawl as a benefit, local residents often fear infill will increase traffic congestion, eliminate open space, and result in other costs. Unfortunately, we know little about infill development overall and its impacts specifically. This dissertation addresses this gap by exploring residential infill development in Montgomery County, MD during the l 990 s and early 2000 s. This highly developed suburban jurisdiction experienced growing pains due to increased development during this time. The county also saw smart growth policies enacted, making it an excellent case study. The research first describes county residential infill trends from 1990 to 2006 and identifies <b>infill</b> <b>sites.</b> This section defines and offers a measure for infill development and identifies trends and patterns, focusing on changes in infill levels or characteristics. Next, the research uses hedonic pricing models to explore changes in nearby home values pre- and post-infill. A difference-in-difference design provides a comparison group analysis. Twenty-six <b>infill</b> <b>sites</b> were selected because they were built in relatively undisturbed residential neighborhoods, making such analysis possible. This research found infill to be a common occurrence throughout the study period, regularly comprising 70 % of all residential units built. The study did not find changes in infill development coinciding with a particular smart growth policy. Instead, infill mimicked overall development trends. Infill did have considerably smaller lot and structure sizes than non-infill. The hedonic pricing models found negative impacts on home values associated with some infill projects, with price declines ranging from 2 to 5 %. The impact varied by development type, with large projects causing the greatest price declines. Additionally, wealthier neighborhoods experienced a negative infill home price effect, while poorer areas experienced a positive effect [...] although not significant. Overall, positive outcomes were not the rule, and infill appears to generate costs. Planners and policymakers need to take this in to consideration when promoting infill...|$|R

Extended-range luminescence dating techniques, namely post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIR-IR) dating of K-feldspars and thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence (TT-OSL) dating of individual quartz grains, were applied to fossil-bearing sediments at Galería. The luminescence dating results are in good agreement with published chronologies derived using alternative radiometric dating methods (i. e., ESR and U-series dating of bracketing speleothems and combined ESR/U-series dating of herbivore teeth), as well as biochronology and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions inferred from proxy records (e. g., pollen data). For the majority of samples dated, however, the new luminescence ages are significantly (∼ 50 %) younger than previously published polymineral thermoluminescence (TL) chronologies, suggesting that the latter may have overestimated the true burial age of the Galería deposits. The luminescence ages obtained indicate that {{the top of the}} basal sterile sands (GIb) at Galería have an age of up to ∼ 370 thousand years (ka), while the lowermost sub-unit containing Mode II Acheulean lithics (base of unit GIIa) was deposited during MIS 9 (mean age =  313 ± 14 ka; n =  4). The overlying units GIIb-GIV, which contain the richest archaeopalaeontological remains, were deposited during late MIS 8 or early MIS 7 (∼ 240 ka). Galería Complex may be correlative with other Middle Pleistocene sites from Atapuerca, such as Gran Dolina level TD 10 and unit TE 19 from Sima del Elefante, but the lowermost archaeological horizons are ∼ 100 ka younger than the hominin-bearing clay breccias at the Sima de los Huesos site.

40|$|South Australia’s {{planning}} {{system has}} been the subject of review and changes in recent years. The changes have been largely driven by pressure from the development industry which has complained that the system for development assessment and approval is too slow and bureaucratic. One measure designed to address these concerns is the introduction of a Residential Code for Development. This code makes a large number of residential and minor forms of development “complying” and thus must be granted approval. It also specifies a number of proposals which do not require development plan consent. The code is not designed to apply in some more sensitive areas and zones (eg heritage and flood-prone areas). In order to be classified as a residential form of development, a development must meet a range of prescriptive criteria. The article concludes that the onerous nature of many of the criteria will limit the code’s effectiveness. Development on greenfield sites will most suit the application of the code’s provisions. Development on <b>infill</b> <b>sites</b> will be less able to meet the code’s prescriptive criteria. Disappointingly, the code fails to promote more sustainable forms of development.

This {{piece of legislation}} aimed for greater flexibility and speed in the planning of land use, and made public participation a statutory requirement {{in the preparation of}} development plans. The Act also introduced a new system of process planning under which the spatial distribution of social and economic trends superseded physical standards as the principal concern of planners. According to Maureen Rhoden, this effectively meant that the development control system operated by local authorities 'policed' new housing demand. This allowed for new development on <b>infill</b> <b>sites</b> or on the edge of larger towns and villages, [...] "but preventing development in the open countryside and in designated areas such as green belts and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty."

General improvement areas covering 23,254 dwellings had been declared by September 1970, with work having been completed on 683 dwellings. In addition, the Labour government went further than previous administrations in aiming to safeguard the housing programme from wider economic problems.|$|R
