2500|$|In March 1965 the Spitfire Mark II was launched. It {{was very}} similar to the Mark I but {{featured}} a more highly tuned engine, through a revised camshaft design, a water-cooled intake manifold, and tubular exhaust manifold, increasing the power to [...] at 6000 rpm. The coil-spring design clutch of the Mark I was replaced with a Borg and Beck <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> clutch; North American models retained the coil-spring housing and were also equipped with AC-Delco distributors. The exterior trim was modified with a new grille and badges. The interior trim was improved with redesigned seats and by covering most of the exposed surfaces with rubber cloth. The original moulded rubber floor coverings were replaced with moulded carpets.|$|E
50|$|For 2013, new {{features}} include EFI Fuel-injection, a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> clutch and a lighter battery.|$|E
50|$|September 1964: Revisions: {{all models}} have <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> clutch, {{improved}} heater, crush-style sun visors and plastic-framed rear-view mirror.|$|E
50|$|A {{coil spring}} {{flattens}} into an oval shape when the sides are compressed. This rim {{is not as}} strong as the arcing spring, and may only be used by women with average or firm vaginal tone. If an arcing <b>spring</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is uncomfortable for a woman or, during intercourse, her partner, a coil spring may prove more satisfactory. Unlike the arcing <b>spring</b> <b>diaphragms,</b> coil <b>springs</b> may be inserted with a device called an introducer.|$|R
50|$|Modern clutch {{development}} focuses {{its attention}} on the simplification of the overall assembly and/or manufacturing method. For example, drive straps are now commonly employed to transfer torque as well as lift the pressure plate upon disengagement of vehicle drive. With regard to the manufacture of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>springs,</b> heat treatment is crucial. Laser welding is becoming more common {{as a method of}} attaching the drive plate to the disc ring with the laser typically being between 2-3KW and a feed rate 1m/minute.|$|R

50|$|The FJ1200 uses a {{five-speed}} sequential constant-mesh close ratio gearbox.The clutch {{is of the}} wet, multiple-disc <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> {{type and}} is hydraulically operated. Final drive is by O-ring chain and sprockets.|$|E
5000|$|The CBX750P {{is based}} on a Japanese CB750SC [...] "Horizon". Which is like a CB750SC/CB700SC Nighthawk S, but with an 18inch front wheel.Unlike the Honda CB700SC, CBX750P uses a slipper clutch (back-torque limiter) and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> to engage clutch.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its aluminium engine, {{it was the first}} mass-produced British car to have an engine in the back and the first car to use a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> clutch. The baulk-ring synchromesh unit for the transaxle compensated for the speeds of gear and shaft before engagement, which the Mini had suffered from during its early production years.|$|E

50|$|The DCSC {{controls}} the feed gas {{pressure in the}} dosage chamber by changes of bellows angle, which {{is proportional to the}} change in volume in the loop. A mechanical linkage connects the bellows cover plate to an oscillating cam which controls loading of the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring.</b> The spring force controls a diaphragm in the dosage regulator which actuates the inlet and outlet valves.|$|E
50|$|A two plate dry disk <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> clutch drove Fuller four-speed {{main and}} three-speed {{auxiliary}} transmissions. The main transmission had a “low” first gear and three road gears, 4th being direct. The auxiliary had low, direct, and overdrive gears. The low gear allowed several very low gears for extreme off-road use. The direct and overdrive allowed the three road gears to be split, making 6 road gears.|$|E
50|$|Friction-disc {{clutches}} {{generally are}} classified as push type or pull type depending on {{the location of the}} pressure plate fulcrum points. In a pull-type clutch, the action of pressing the pedal pulls the release bearing, pulling on the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> and disengaging the vehicle drive. The opposite is true with a push type, the release bearing is pushed into the clutch disengaging the vehicle drive. In this instance, the release bearing can be known as a thrust bearing (as per the image above).|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} sliding {{electrical}} contact phenomenon, a four-channel testing {{system is designed}} to simulate sliding process of electrical contacts, including a mechanical unit, a measuring unit and a controlling unit. In this testing system, the sliding stage is driven by a slider-crank mechanism to generate 1 - 2. 2 cm reciprocating sliding at 0. 5 - 2 Hz frequency between a pair of simulated contacts. A novel loading structure of double <b>diaphragm</b> <b>springs</b> is designed to supply 0 - 3 N normal force for each contact pair. By four-point method, contact resistance of 40 points is measured in one sliding cycle and is collected by a NI data acquisition card. Lab VIEW software is used to control the stepping motor, select test channels, measure contact voltage, process resistance data and display resistance curves in real time. Sliding simulation results prove this sliding test system to be credible and stable...|$|R
40|$|The {{stratospheric and mesospheric sounder}} (SAMS) {{experiment}} on Nimbus 7 includes a 2 axis scanning mirror and 7 pressure modulator cells. The SAMS experiment is a limb sounding instrument {{to measure the}} temperature profile and minor constituents of the atmosphere. The limb scan requires small mirror steps over a 3 deg range, while the scan in azimuth is in larger steps over a 15 deg range. The mirror is plane, 20 cm in diameter, and of zero expansion glass-ceramic. It is supported on two tilt tables, fitted one on the other, with the axes at right angles. The angle of tilt is adjusted by means of recirculating ball screws which are ion plated with lead for lubrication and driven by stepper motors. The seven gas filled cells are each pressure modulated by a 3 cm diameter, 0. 3 cm stroke piston which is supported by <b>diaphragm</b> <b>springs</b> and driven electromagnetically at the system's mechanical resonant frequency. The mean pressure of the filling gas, which is the atmospheric constituent being measured, is changed by varying the temperature of a suitable molecular sieve...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{incorporated in}} the vertical sounding infrared radiometry experiments which were launched on Nimbus 5 in 1972 and on Nimbus 6 in 1975 are discussed. Both use dry lubricants. The Nimbus 5 radiometer includes a rotating chopper driven via a carbon fiber-acetal resin gearwheel. The driving motor runs at 2000 rpm and has completed over 7 x 10 to the 9 th power revolutions. Four gear driven filter wheels powered by stepper motors have each completed 2 x 10 to the 8 th power changes. The input calibration mirror mechanism and its field of view compensation mechanisms are also described. All 25 ball races used in the experiment are of the film transfer type. The Nimbus 6 radiometer includes two cells. Each contains a piston supported on <b>diaphragm</b> <b>springs</b> and driven electromagnetically. The pistons are 6 cm in diameter with a stroke of 1 cm and are driven at their mechanical resonant frequency of approx. 15 Hz. The calibrating mirrors rotate periodically to view a target. The support pivots are synthetic sapphire ring stones with separate end thrust stones. The problems of mounting these stones to withstand vibration loads is described...|$|R
50|$|Motorcycles {{typically}} {{employ a}} wet clutch with the clutch {{riding in the}} same oil as the transmission. These clutches are usually {{made up of a}} stack of alternating plain steel and friction plates. Some plates have lugs on their inner diameters that lock them to the engine crankshaft. Other plates have lugs on their outer diameters that lock them to a basket that turns the transmission input shaft. A set of coil springs or a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> plate force the plates together when the clutch is engaged.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} adoption of electronic fuel injection, most carbureted automobile engines used mechanical fuel pumps to transfer fuel from {{the fuel tank}} into the fuel bowls of the carburetor. Most mechanical fuel pumps are diaphragm pumps, which are a type of positive displacement pump. Diaphragm pumps contain a pump chamber whose volume is increased or decreased by the flexing of a flexible diaphragm, similar to the action of a piston pump. A check valve is located at both the inlet and outlet ports of the pump chamber to force the fuel to flow in one direction only. Specific designs vary, but in the most common configuration, these pumps are typically bolted onto the engine block or head, and the engine's camshaft has an extra eccentric lobe that operates a lever on the pump, either directly or via a pushrod, by pulling the diaphragm to bottom dead center. In doing so, the volume inside the pump chamber increased, causing pressure to decrease.This allows fuel to be pushed into the pump from the tank (caused by atmospheric pressure acting on the fuel in the tank). The return motion of the diaphragm to top dead center is accomplished by a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring,</b> during which the fuel in the pump chamber is squeezed through the outlet port and into the carburetor. The pressure at which the fuel is expelled from the pump is thus limited (and therefore regulated) by the force applied by the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|E

25|$|Diaphragm-type first stages {{are more}} complex and have more {{components}} than the piston type. Their design makes them particularly suited to cold water diving and to working in saltwater and water containing {{a high degree of}} suspended particles, silt, or other contaminating materials, since the only parts exposed to the water are the valve opening <b>spring</b> and the <b>diaphragm,</b> all other parts are sealed off from the environment. In some cases the <b>diaphragm</b> and <b>spring</b> are also sealed from the environment.|$|R
50|$|By 1964 Laycock's {{principal}} products were: Laycock de Normanville overdrives and <b>spring</b> <b>diaphragm</b> clutches for {{the motor}} industry and flexible couplings also for industrial use. Dual clutches for tractors, garage equipment, railway air and vacuum brakes, control valves for fluids and gases were also manufactured.|$|R
50|$|In European style systems, {{the size}} and shape of the venturi of the {{carburettor}} is designed to match the converter. In USA style systems, the air valve and metering pins in the mixer are sized to match the <b>diaphragm</b> size and <b>spring</b> stiffness in the converter. In both cases, the components are matched by the manufacturers and only basic adjustments are needed during installation and tuning.|$|R
5000|$|The 2008 KTM 300 EXC is {{the first}} {{electric}} start two-stroke enduro bike to be released by a major manufacturer. For 2010, Husaberg the other KTM owned bike company, offered the TE300, an XC-W with minor modifications to the body and suspension settings. From 2011 on the 300s got 6-speed gearboxes, a new exhaust pipe and silencer, and translucent fuel tanks. The 2012s got improvements to the starter, more frame changes resulting in more wheel travel, and a new air box with a filter that can be replaced {{without the use of}} tools. The 2013s got a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> clutch, a stronger starter and lighter battery. In 2013, the Husaberg became the Husqvarna TE300 and was given the linkage rear suspension. The 2014 had a new CDI ignition system. The 2015 model chromoly steel frame is painted orange like the motocross models. All the 2015 models have the new White Power 4CS forks with revised damping, the ability to make adjustments on the fly and a smaller front axle. The triple clamps have 2 mm less offset resulting in more trail and different steering characteristics. The rear shock is longer but the travel is unchanged. The electric starter has different gearing to provide higher initial torque from the electric motor, and the battery is lighter and stronger.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject in}} {{of this paper}} is to show {{possible}} ways to optimize pressure force which act on <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> intended for use in motor vehicle clutch. During the exploitation of the clutch, because of friction linings wearing, pressure force which act on the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> is changing. The difference of the acting force when it acts on the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> and new linings, and when it acts on <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> and wear linings (in limits), must be kept in very tight limits. This means that the force in both cases has to be constant. Possible solution to achieve this condition is to have changes in <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> thickens and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> finger angle, and during those changes the diameter of the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> will stay unchanged. ...|$|E

Stress and strain variation of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> was obtained by using static analysis, and each modal, frequency and amplitude was all achieved by applying modal analysis. And the results may provide a theoretical reference to improving structure design of automotive <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> clutch...|$|E
50|$|Inhalation will {{decrease}} the bellows angle, which reduces the spring loading, {{and the internal}} pressure in the dosage chamber will lift the <b>diaphragm</b> against the <b>spring,</b> opening the dosage outlet valve and allowing the gas to flow into the breathing circuit until the pressure in the dosage chamber is matched by the spring force, and the diaphragm is pushed back against the outlet valve to close it.|$|R
50|$|An arcing spring folds into an arc shape {{when the}} sides are compressed. This {{is the strongest}} type of rim {{available}} in a diaphragm, and may be used by women with any level of vaginal tone. Unlike other spring types, arcing springs may be used by women with mild cystocele, rectocele, or retroversion. Arcing <b>spring</b> <b>diaphragms</b> may be easier to insert correctly than other spring types.|$|R

40|$|A {{friction}} clutch is mechanical assemblies built between {{the engine and}} transmission, that with friction transfers torque from the driving part to the driven (working) part (engine gearbox and other transmission). A <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> {{is one of the}} key component of a clutch assembly. A <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> is piece to high stress concentration in driving condition, this is often the cause of cracks and crashes spring.

40|$|The <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parts of the motor vehicles clutch assembly provides the compressive force on the pressure disk. This force is needed for generating friction between the coupling of the flywheel and the pressure disk and transmitting the torque from the engine to the transmission. Therefore the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> is subjected to complex loads. The nominal stress for dimensioning the spring is the tangential stress, which is calculated by the terms of Almen and Laszlo. The aim of this research is analyzing the location of the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> supporting points of the clutch assembly and its effect on the caused stresses by using the Finite Element Method. ...|$|E
25|$|Cold water kits {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the risk of {{freezing}} inside the regulator. Some regulators come with this as standard, and some others can be retrofitted. Environmental sealing of the <b>diaphragm</b> main <b>spring</b> chamber using a soft secondary diaphragm and hydrostatic transmitter or a silicone, alcohol or glycol/water mixture antifreeze liquid in the sealed spring compartment can be used for a diaphragm regulator. Silicone grease in the spring chamber can be used on a piston first stage. The Poseidon Xstream first stage insulates the external spring and spring housing from the rest of the regulator, so that it is less chilled by the expanding air, and provides large slots in the housing so that the spring can be warmed by the water, thus avoiding the problem of freezing up the external spring.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} modeling, {{simulating}} (transient), and designing controllers for turbocharged engine systems is presented. The method is specific to spark ignition (SI) engines equipped with pneumatic, <b>spring</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> wastegate actuators, with solenoid valve active boost control. The method {{revolves around the}} joint simulation of the engine with Ricardo WAVE software and the control algorithm with Simulink®. A component by component modeling approach is outlined using WAVE, including an experimental approach for modeling the solenoid valve. Controls are designed in MATLAB® using the Zeigler-Nichols’s PID tuning method, and a new approach that uses system identification and state-space techniques.

40|$|Abstract-Valve {{stiction}} {{is one of}} {{the prominent}} stand-alone reasons for oscillatory behavior in process industry. Stiction is a common problem in <b>spring</b> <b>diaphragm</b> type valves, which are widely used in the process industry. This behavior leads control valves to deliver accurate feed and thereby allowing wastage of utility. Recently, there have been many attempts to understand, define, model and detect stiction in control valves. Most of the available methods cannot simultaneously detect and quantify stiction. The paper presents an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy methodology for identification of stiction. For a vertical two tank level process with Kano’s model of stiction is considered to obtain necessary required data to formulate objective function. The proposed methods for detecting and quantifying stiction are applied on the flow control valve using MATLAB/Simulink platform...|$|R
