25|$|Alaska's economy depends {{heavily on}} {{increasingly}} expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at {{the time of}} the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population. The cost of a <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> in urban Alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, Boyett Petroleum {{acquired}} {{wholesale distributor}} Toms Sierra Company. After the deal Boyett Petroleum had 110 branded accounts and was marketing over 20 million <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> a month. In 2011, the company introduced the CRUISE Americard, a universal fleet fueling card, which is accepted at over 230,000 service and fuel locations nationwide. They also own and operate eight Cruiser convenience stores serving the Central Valley. In 2015, the company purchased fuel distribution contracts for ninety Valero and 76 gas stations from MCW Energy group. The deal grew its network {{to more than}} 500 stations in California and Nevada and increased sales to 400 million <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> per year.

50|$|Vehicles in the WSC's Cruiser {{class are}} allowed a small battery-pack {{which can be}} plugged in to the power mains for {{additional}} charging. Although Stella was mostly relying on its 1.5 kilowatt solar array, the team did use their maximum allowance of 64.0 kWh of external charging during the race. For comparison: according to the EPA, one <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> gasoline is equivalent to 33.7 kWh. So, effectively, each top-up of the 15.0 kWh lithium-ion battery gives the car about 0.44 <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> and for the entire 3022 km race distance, the total external energy consumption was equal to less than two <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b> On average, the car's solar array is able to generate more energy than would be consumed by normal daily commuting for most people, and if the car were plugged into the electrical grid, or to an owners house, when parked, it could contribute more energy than it would need to take out, making the car energy positive.|$|R

50|$|Gas {{shortages}} {{throughout the}} region led to an effort by the U.S. federal government to bring in gasoline and set up mobile truck distribution at which people could receive up to 10 <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> free <b>of</b> charge. This caused lines of up to 20 blocks long and was quickly suspended.

2500|$|In 1991, Giant Eagle {{introduced}} the [...] "Advantage Card", an electronic loyalty card discount system (already popular in many chains), as a sophisticated {{version of the}} obsolete stamp programs. The card was later modified to double as a video rental card for Iggle Video. [...] More recently the company has started the Fuelperks! program to entice customers. [...] This program allows customer the opportunity to earn 10 cents off each <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> (20 cents in select markets) with fifty dollars worth of authorized purchases. In early 2009, Giant Eagle launched the Foodperks! program, mainly geared towards GetGo. This program allows customers who use their fuelperks at GetGo to also earn foodperks to save on groceries purchased at Giant Eagle. Every 10 gallons of gas purchased earns a 1% discount. This can be used up to 20% maximum at a time on a purchase of up to $300. Foodperks are good for 90 days and fuelperks are good for 60 days. If the customer has more than {{the price of gasoline}} or more than the 20%, those discounts will stay on their card {{for the remainder of the}} 90/60 days, and if they are not used by then, they expire.

5000|$|The average {{fuel economy}} is higher in Europe due to the higher cost of fuel. In the UK, a <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> without tax would cost US$1.97, but with taxes cost US$6.06 in 2005. The average cost in the United States was US$2.61.

50|$|Early on, {{the company}} was {{recognized}} for streamlining its business {{through the use of}} four-passenger Embraer Phenom 100s as its primary aircraft. This allows for fluid execution when it comes to conducting maintenance and piloting the aircraft. Moreover, these planes are fuel efficient because they consume 90 <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> in an hour versus more than 230 gallons per hour on some other private jets. This fact allows for cost savings, which can be passed along to the consumer.|$|R
