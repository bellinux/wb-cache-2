5|$|At the 19th Screen Actors Guild Awards, both Fey and Baldwin won {{for their}} {{performances}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Female</b> and Male comedy categories, respectively, while the cast received their final nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{providing}} the primary function of flight, wings also have secondary functions of self-defence, camouflage and thermoregulation. In some Lepidoptera families {{such as the}} Psychidae and Lymantriidae, the wings are reduced or even absent (often <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> but not the male).|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} most crabs, the abdomen is folded under the thorax and shows clear sexual dimorphism: in males it is {{comparatively}} narrow, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> it is wider.|$|E
50|$|The head is small, {{with large}} and globose lateral eyes. Legs {{are long and}} slender. The males have a long slender abdomen with a curved upward end, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> <b>the</b> abdomen is stouter and not curved. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> are also smaller and with more angular wings. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> <b>the</b> abdomen has three {{longitudinal}} black lines.|$|R
5000|$|Polyommatus daphnis has a {{wingspan}} of 36 - 38 mm. These small butterflies {{present a}} sexual dimorphism. The upperside of the wings is bright blue in males, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> it is usyally blue bordered with dark brown. The {{underside of the}} wings tends to be pale ocher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> and grey-bluish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> males, with black spots surrounded by white. The hindwings are distinctly scalloped, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b>|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{urinary tract}} infections, {{especially}} chro n ic cystitis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> were satisfactorily treated by simultaneous administration of UROCYDAL and YUBERA. No side effect was encountered. Gynecologic conditions {{are thought to}} be closely related to urinary tract infections <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> and <b>the</b> effects of Vitamin E were discussed with emphasis on this point...|$|R
5|$|Sivaji Ganesan {{was cast}} in the title role, Telugu actor N. T. Rama Rao as Krishna, and R. Muthuraman as Arjuna. Actresses Devika and Savitri were cast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> lead roles, and S. A. Ashokan as Karna's friend Duryodhana.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} {{in the blue}} wildebeest is 58. Chromosomes were studied in a male and a female wildebeest. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> all except a pair of very large submetacentric chromosomes {{were found to be}} acrocentric. Metaphases were studied in the male's chromosomes, and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well, similar to those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> both in size and morphology. the rest were acrocentric. The X chromosome is a large acrocentric while the Y chromosome a minute one.|$|E
5|$|Sex-specific {{responses}} to stress {{have also been}} demonstrated in the rat, {{to have an effect}} on the hippocampus. Chronic stress in the male rat showed dendritic retraction and cell loss in the CA3 region but this was not shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> This was thought to be due to neuroprotective ovarian hormones.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} this study are {{compatible}} with results of Goyal and Goyal (2013) who found that forwardly directed rugae (48.3 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> males and 40.8 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females)</b> were more common than backwardly directed rugae (17.8 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> males and 19.6 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females)</b> among Rwandan populations. Additionally, non-significant differences between both sexes were noticed.|$|R
50|$|Metasomal terga III-IV show apical bands. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> <b>the</b> spot between antennal socket and eye is absent.|$|R
50|$|Dynastes satanas {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 50 - 115 mm in males, of about 30 - 55 mm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> <b>The</b> males have one large horn on the pronotum, with a dense reddish pubescence on the {{underside}} of the horn. A smaller horn arises from the head. Body, pronotum and elytra are black in both sexes. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> <b>the</b> clypeus is narrowly rounded at apex.|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian {{blackcap}} (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.|$|E
5|$|The areolar glands {{are in the}} areola that {{surrounds}} the nipple <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> breast. These glands secrete an oily fluid that lubricates the nipple, and also secrete volatile compounds that are thought {{to serve as an}} olfactory stimulus for the newborn. During pregnancy and lactation these glands, also called Montgomery's glands, become enlarged.|$|E
5|$|The close {{relationship}} between the katipo and redback is shown when mating, The male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo can not mate with the female redback as the male katipo is heavier than the male redback and when it approaches the web it triggers a predatory response <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> leading to the katipo being eaten before mating occurs. There is evidence of interbreeding between katipo and redbacks in the wild.|$|E
50|$|Hipparchia fagi has a {{wingspan}} of 66 - 76 mm. These large butterflies have {{dark brown}} uppersides of the wings, with a fringed margin, a white submarginal band more evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> and one black eyelet {{at the apex}} of each forewings. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> males the white band has a single very small eyelet on each hindwing, sometimes showing a white pupil, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> it shows one or two ocelli.|$|R
50|$|Femora of the {{hind legs}} are red on the bottom, while tibiae are {{yellowish}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> and black <b>in</b> males.|$|R
50|$|Dufour’s gland, an {{abdominal}} gland found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> {{of nearly all}} members of the suborder Apocrita, is named after him.|$|R
5|$|The genital {{openings}} (gonopores) of {{both sexes}} are located {{on the underside of}} the third body segment (near the second pair of legs) and may be accompanied in the male by one or two penes which deposit the sperm packets onto the gonopods. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> the genital pores open into paired small sacs called cyphopods or vulvae, which are covered by small hood-like lids, and are used to store the sperm after copulation. The cyphopod morphology can also be used to identify species. Millipede sperm lack flagella, a unique trait among myriapods.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} is the regular natural change that occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> {{reproductive}} system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle {{is required for}} the production of ovocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as premenstrual syndrome in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy to mate with the female redback, as it triggers a predatory response <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> when it approaches the web, causing the female to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E

5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> <b>the</b> tiny {{dark brown}} wings are {{partially}} {{hidden under the}} pronotum, while the males have very short tegmina. <b>The</b> <b>females</b> have a slightly curved ovipositor, which is somewhat shorter than the body.|$|R
5|$|As in {{closely related}} insect {{groups in the}} {{superorder}} Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3–4 weeks as opposed to 4–6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous ("short-winged"), particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4–8 weeks, while larger species may live 4–6 months.|$|E
5|$|Circumcision has a {{protective}} effect against {{the risks of}} penile cancer in men, and cervical cancer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> sexual partners of heterosexual men. Penile cancer is rare, with about 1 new case per 100,000 people per year in developed countries and higher incidence rates per 100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa (for example: 1.6 in Zimbabwe, 2.7 in Uganda and 3.2 in Swaziland). The number of new cases is also high in certain South American countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay at about 4.3 per 100,000. It is least common in Israeli Jews—0.1 per 100,000—related {{in part to the}} very high rate of circumcision of babies.|$|E
5|$|Distinct {{signs of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} {{are seen in}} the antelope. The male is considerably larger than the female. The females, as well as juveniles, have a rufous coat, whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker {{after the age of}} two years. The male has a prominent black crest of hair on the neck, but this feature is not well-developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> One long white stripe runs along the back, with 11–14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black stripe, and there is no throat beard. A black stripe runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face. A chevron is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches, and two white spots appear {{on each side of the}} lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The lesser kudu is characterised by large, rounded ears. Its tracks are similar to the greater kudu's. Females have four teats. The average lifespan is 10 years in the wild, and 15 years in captivity.|$|E
40|$|National Natural Science Foundation, China [20777061]; Educational Commission of Henan Province, China [12 B 240001]Since {{the brain}} plays {{important}} roles <b>in</b> reproduction, <b>the</b> brain aromatase (Cyp 19 b), estrogen receptor (ER), retinoid X receptor (RXR) alpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma {{were examined in}} rockfish after TBT exposure (1, 10, and 100 ng L- 1). The {{results showed that the}} Cyp 19 b expression was elevated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> male rockfish, while no effect was produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> Inconsistently, serum testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol showed no change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> males, while an increase of testosterone and a decrease of 17 beta-estradiol were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> TBT affected <b>the</b> ER expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> males depending on the concentrations, however, no change was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> <b>In</b> addition, TBT elevated the RXR alpha expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> males but produced an opposite effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> <b>In</b> conclusion, TBT might have had sex-different effects on the brain Cyp 19 b, ER and RXR expression in rockfish, indicating a complex endocrine disrupting effect of TBT.

5|$|Female {{and male}} flowers in each syconium mature at {{different}} times. Female wasps enter the syconium and lay eggs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> flowers as they mature. These eggs later hatch and the progeny mate. The females {{of the new}} generation collect pollen from the male flowers, which have matured by this point, and leave to visit other syconia and repeat the process. A field study in Brisbane found that F. obliqua trees often bore {{both male and female}} syconia at the same time—this could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations, such as those on islands. The same study found a slightly reduced number of male phase syconia in winter, thought due to increased mortality of the wasp pollinator in cooler months.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Nvidia {{launched}} the GTX Titan, a consumer graphics card {{that uses the}} same GPU die as the K20X GPUs in Titan. Titan underwent acceptance testing in early 2013 but only completed 92% of the tests, short of the required 95%. The problem was discovered to be excess gold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> edge connectors of the motherboards' PCIe slots causing cracks in the motherboards' solder. The cost of repair was borne by Cray and between 12 and 16 cabinets were repaired each week. Throughout the repairs users were given access to the available CPUs. On March 11, they gained access to 8,972 GPUs. ORNL announced on April 8 that the repairs were complete and acceptance test completion was announced on June 11, 2013.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> the pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the {{chelicera}} (mouthpart), is serrate, not {{smooth as}} in A.gymnuromys. The idiosoma (main {{part of the}} body) is 630 to 670μm long and 370 to 435μm wide and the dorsal shield (covering the upper side) is 620 to 655μm long and 360 to 370μm wide. The dorsal setae (bristles) are long relative to A.gymnuromys. The sternal shield (on the lower {{side of the body}}) is 115 to 125μm long and 184 to 200μm wide and is more ornamented than in A.gymnuromys. Unlike A.eliurus, A.voalavo lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between the lyrifissures (sensory organs) iv1 and iv2 on the lower side of the body. The other shields on the lower side of the body are the genitoventral shield (232 to 253 by 170 to 182μm), the peritrematic shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm), and the anal shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm). On the soft part of the cuticle, there are nine pairs of setae. The first segments of the legs, the coxae, lack hooks. On the coxae of the third pair of legs, the setae at the back are spur-like.|$|E
