5000|$|An {{interaction}} of the adhesion forces has nonlinear features which {{are related to the}} creep value and strongly depends on the wheel-rail zone condition and track geometry (when driving on a curve section of the track). In many modern mechanical systems torsional structural deformability plays an important role.

50|$|The {{engineers}} of the Islamic world developed several {{solutions to}} achieve the maximum output from a water wheel. One solution was to mount them to piers of bridges {{to take advantage of}} the increased flow. Another solution was the shipmill, a type of water mill powered by water wheels mounted on the sides of ships moored in midstream. This technique was employed along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in 10th-century Iraq, where large shipmills made of teak and iron could produce 10 tons of flour from corn every day for the granary in Baghdad. The flywheel mechanism, which is used to smooth out the delivery of power from a driving device to a <b>driven</b> <b>machine,</b> was invented by Ibn Bassal (fl. 1038-1075) of Al-Andalus; he pioneered the use of the flywheel in the saqiya (chain pump) and noria.

40|$|LecturePg. 43 - 50 A {{turbine shaft}} {{end at the}} {{coupling}} is exposed not only to constant torque load but to various variable loads as well. These externally imposed variable loads come from sources like compressor surge, misalignment between turbine shaft, and the <b>driven</b> <b>machine,</b> to name a few. These loads can be bending or torsional in nature. To assure reliability, the design method should include the influence of such loads on the final sizing of the shaft end. The design method should also include the effects of shrink fits, keyways, fillets, chrome plating and fretting on the fatigue properties of the shaft material. Due to variable nature of loads superimposed on the steady torque load, the design method {{must be based on}} fatigue behavior of materials. Many fatigue theories have been used in the design of components of turbomachinery. These depend {{on the nature of the}} load, type of material and component being designed. A designer should realize not only the nature of loads imposed on the. shaft and their source but also have an estimate of the magnitude of those loads. A design method is described which includes many of the factors governing the useful life of the shaft at the coupling end. This method is based on the von Mises reliability criteria, including the influence of the <b>driven</b> <b>machine</b> and the choice of coupling type. This design method has resulted in many successful designs throughout the years and has helped in selecting a less costly but reliable option in many rerate situations...|$|E

40|$|Current {{control in}} {{inverter}} <b>driven</b> <b>machine</b> systems {{is arguably the}} most important part of the control system. If accurate and rapid current control is achieved then, given the correct reference currents, fast and accurate torque control can be achieved.

This paper examines one of these effects, dead-time, and considers the influence it has on the performance of predictive current controllers (PCCs). The paper presents analysis that shows that PCC implicitly compensates for voltage loss due to dead-time. Also a modified PCC is introduced that reduces the zero current clamp problem caused by dead-time. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the analysis and confirm the performance of the new algorithm...|$|E

40|$|The {{drive system}} is a key {{component}} of an elevator installation that supplies energy into the system, coupling the car-rope and the counterweight-rope subsystems.

In this paper a non-stationary distributed-parameter model describing vertical dynamics of an elevator system that accommodates the <b>drive</b> <b>machine,</b> the car, the counterweight and the suspension ropes has been developed. The model is used to analyze the influence of the <b>drive</b> <b>machine</b> on the elevator system performance. The dynamic behaviour is described by a set of partial differential equations. Those are discretized by expanding the vertical displacements in terms of the linear mode shapes to obtain a set of ordinary differential equations.

The discrete model is then solved numerically in Matlab-Simulink using parameters of a real installation. The numerical simulation results predict transient resonance phenomena in the system...|$|R
