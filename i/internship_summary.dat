40|$|Background: As a {{new course}} {{and one that is}} based on student-centred {{principles}} of learning, it is essential that the School of Medicine Fremantle evaluate the effectiveness of its 4 year MBBS course. Program developers are accountable to the students, the School’s accrediting body and the community at large in ensuring that students are well prepared for <b>internship.</b> <b>Summary</b> of work: As such, the Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM) was administered to students in each year level at the end of 2008. Findings in the literature suggest that students’ perceptions of their learning environment actually influence learning outcomes. The global DREEM score was calculated for all four years as well as the global score for each of the five subscales. Summary of results: The global score was 118 out of a possible 200 (59 %) suggesting that the students are relatively satisfied with their learning environment. This is also evident in the students’ perceptions of learning (62 %), atmosphere (62 %), social life (65 %) and academic self-perceptions (63 %). However, they were not as satisfied with the teaching environment (47 %). Conclusions: These findings suggest that as a new medical school, Notre Dame is progressing relatively well. Take-home messages: Nevertheless, DREEM has identified areas that need to be improved, namely students’ perceptions of teaching...|$|E
40|$|The {{scaling down}} of {{technologies}} presents new challenges in reliability, {{one of them}} being electromigration. Electromigration was not cause of concern until interconnects widths shrunk to the micrometer scale. At this point, research was focused into electromigration analysis of interconnects. International conferences on reliability have recognized electromigration {{as one of the}} biggest problems in reliability. This thesis focuses on electromigration analysis of signal nets and was carried out in Design Methodology department at a company in Eindhoven. The purpose of this thesis work was to setup a flow for electromigration analysis using existing tools at the company. Comparison of  tools and theoretical study of electromigration also forms a big part of this <b>internship.</b> A <b>summary</b> of theoretical studies on electromigration phenomenon and their implications on  design parameters is investigated in this thesis report. The approach of setting up tools, evaluation strategy and results of the evaluation are also documented in this report. Lastly a conclusion in a form of an effective design methodology and comparison of tools are presented. This report also contains challenges encountered while setting up of tools and motivation for enabling different options for electromigration analysis. Trade-offs between simulation run time, parasitic extraction, chip area and reliability concerns are also discussed in this report...|$|R
40|$|My summer {{internship}} {{is in the}} Technical Services, the City of Worcester, {{starting from}} June to August of 2015. My supervisor is Claire Brill who gave me guidance at each step of my internship. I devoted to customizing a web application for Election Polling Places in the City of Worcester. This application aims to provide citizens with the latest information about their related polling place and elected officials. For the project, I collected data for elected officials and transferred data for polling places, precincts, and others from the Geodatabse of the City of Worcester to a new Local Government Geodatabase I created. I published data related to the web application and customized {{a draft of the}} Election Polling Places application in the City of Worcester. This report introduces the organization of the internship, the detailed content of the program as well as my jobs and progress for this <b>internship,</b> and the <b>summary</b> for what I’ve learned from this internship...|$|R
40|$|Why {{are so many}} {{university}} graduates unemployed? The research reported in this paper addresses this question from the employer’s {{point of view and}} then articulates recommendations to universities regarding how to improve graduate employability. Research was conducted with 73 employers from multiple disciplines, 53 of whom were surveyed and the other 20 interviewed. There were three main findings. First, communication, motivation/initiative and leadership were the most desirable attributes and characteristics of {{university graduates}} from the perspective of employers. Second, while employers expected that university graduates had developed solid discipline-based knowledge and respectable grades, they said that they do not recruit only those who were {{at the top of the}} class. Notably, a number of the participating employers believe that many students who achieve the highest grades do so at the expense of extra-curricular activities that would help them to become well-rounded and thereby employable. Third, the top strategies and approaches employers believe that universities should be using and/or supporting to enhance the employability of graduates are work experience and internships, extra-curricular activities and volunteering. The three respective recommendations to universities for future-proofing their graduates and therefore higher education are as follows. First, embed employability throughout the everyday curriculum so that each and every educator takes responsibility for assuring discipline-based and transferable capabilities in graduates. Second, avoid making university curriculum and assessment so demanding that students do not have time or energy for pursuits beyond the classroom, and integrate their beyond-classroom pursuits with pedagogical activities to develop co-curriculum. Third, align and partner with industry, increasing opportunities for all students to participate in work experiences and/or <b>internships.</b> In <b>summary,</b> future universities are those that actively assure their graduates’ futures through designing, developing and sustaining a quality student experience that prepares graduates for fulfilling careers...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore Swedish {{pharmacist}} students’ learning during pharmacy internship. Internships are meant to introduce students to professional practice. Education programs have to reflect changes in the professional role, and {{take into account that}} learning in a professional practice setting differs from organized formal education. This thesis includes both quantitative and qualitative research approaches and applies workplace learning theories. A scheme for measuring pharmacy students’ reflective ability was developed and shown to be feasible and reliable. Factors important for reflection were found to be primarily social and contextual, especially trained tutor and small pharmacy size. Notably, learning style or critical thinking did not correlate to students’ reflective ability. Tutors and students perceived that students used a wide variety of activities supporting learning of a broad repertoire of knowledge and skills, preparing them for coming professional working life. Tutors are most important to support learning. However, the current curriculum and formal activities do not address all these outcomes and learning activities used, e. g. workplace learning. The first overall conclusion is that internship plays an essential part in the pharmacist education program. The integration of formal and informal learning activities during internship, including raising awareness of incidental learning, is important to support students in learning the professional practice of pharmacy. This integration could possibly be strengthened by introducing further tutor training, different assignments, and by using portfolios. The second conclusion is that the community of practice is essential for students’ learning during internship, especially the student-tutor interaction. Hence, the entire social context has to be considered and it is important to ensure a good learning environment at pharmacies during <b>internship.</b> In <b>summary,</b> this thesis contributes to the understanding of students’ learning during pharmacy internship and introduces educational research on the Swedish undergraduate pharmacy education programs...|$|R
