25|$|Two {{variants}} of the Pilot rocket were built; the Pilot-1, with battleship second to fifth stages, {{was used for}} ground-launched atmospheric tests from China Lake, and the Pilot-2, an air-launched version, was used for orbital launch attempts. Orbital launches were conducted from a stripped–down <b>jet</b> <b>carrier</b> aircraft, an F4D–1 Skyray, flying from Point Mugu Naval Air Station, and releasing the rocket over the Santa Barbara Channel Drop Zone. Of the ten launches, four were of Pilot-1s, and the rest Pilot-2s.|$|E
25|$|In June 1952, she {{was ordered}} reactivated, and work began on her at Puget Sound. On 15 December 1952, she {{was placed in}} commission, in reserve, at Bremerton. Her {{conversion}} continued into 1953 and she conducted post-conversion trials late in January. On 20 February 1953, Yorktown was placed in full commission as an attack carrier (CVA), with Captain William M. Nation in command. The aircraft carrier conducted normal operations along the west coast {{through most of the}} summer of 1953. On 3 August, she departed San Francisco {{on her way to the}} Far East. She arrived in Pearl Harbor and remained there until 27 August, at which time she continued her voyage west. On 5 September, the carrier arrived in Yokosuka, Japan. She put to sea again on 11 August to join TF 77 in the Sea of Japan. The Korean War armistice had been signed two months earlier; and, therefore, the carrier conducted training operations rather than combat missions. She served with TF 77 until 18 February 1954, at which time she stood out of Yokosuka on her way home. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor along the way and then moored at Alameda once more on 3 March. After a brief repair period at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, Yorktown put to sea to serve as a platform for the filming of the Academy Award nominated short subject documentary film <b>Jet</b> <b>Carrier.</b> She conducted further, more routine, operations along the west coast until 1 July, at which time she headed back to the Orient. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 8–28 July before continuing on to Manila, where she arrived on 4 August.|$|E

50|$|The airline was {{established}} in March 2002 and started operations in October 2002. It was the launch customer for the Bombardier CRJ-900. The airline was started so that Mesa Air Group could fulfill its contractual obligations to operate the CRJ-900 as America West Express for America West Airlines. Establishing Freedom was necessary as Mesa Airlines was also operating as US Airways Express under a code share agreement for US Airways. US Airways' collective bargaining agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association prohibited contract carrier code share arrangements with regional <b>jet</b> <b>carriers,</b> if that carrier operated aircraft with more than 70 seats. Mesa Airlines, therefore, could not operate as US Airways Express and operate the CRJ-900.|$|R

40|$|Within the First World, {{observed}} {{differences across}} air carriers in passenger death risk are almost never statistically significant. But given the rarity of fatal crashes, even a lopsided split of crashes across airlines {{is unlikely to}} achieve significance. For greater perspective about relative airline safety performance, we supplemented an analysis of overall mortality data with a two-part statistical procedure. The first part [...] which {{was inspired by the}} way the Oakland Athletics Major League baseball team evaluates individual baseball players [...] allows for a sharp test of a key aspect of an equal-safety hypothesis, related to the frequency with which individual airlines suffer life-threatening events. The second test considers a further aspect of safety, namely the ability to recover from emergencies given that they have occurred. When applied to U. S. domestic jet services over 1983 - 2002, the test procedures indicate that long-established airlines have been about equally (and hugely) successful in protecting their passengers from accidental death and that established airlines are not demonstrably safer than the "new-entrant" <b>jet</b> <b>carriers</b> formed after U.

50|$|Servomotors are {{generally}} {{used as a}} high-performance alternative to the stepper motor. Stepper motors have some inherent ability to control position, as they have built-in output steps. This often allows them {{to be used as}} an open-loop position control, without any feedback encoder, as their drive signal specifies the number of steps of movement to rotate, but for this the controller needs to 'know' the position of the stepper motor on power up. Therefore, on first power up, the controller will have to activate the stepper motor and turn it to a known position, e.g. until it activates an end limit switch. This can be observed when switching on an inkjet printer; the controller will move the ink <b>jet</b> <b>carrier</b> to the extreme left and right to establish the end positions. A servomotor will immediately turn to whatever angle the controller instructs it to, regardless of the initial position at power up.|$|E

40|$|Generation Orbit Launch Services, Inc. (GO) is {{currently}} developing GOLauncher 2, a dedicated nanosatellite launch system {{capable of providing}} responsive and affordable space transportation services to the emerging marketplace of government, commercial, and academic nanosatellite developers. GOLauncher 2 is designed around a novel air-launch approach, utilizing an existing business <b>jet</b> <b>carrier</b> aircraft {{and a set of}} expendable rocket stages to place up to 100 pounds of payload into Low Earth Orbit. As a systems integrator, GO has built a best-in-class team of partners and suppliers to provide major components of the system including aircraft modifications, propulsion, and avionics, all while leveraging ongoing technology development efforts to reduce development costs and development schedules. Additionally, GO has reached an agreement with Cecil Spaceport in Jacksonville, FL for initial operations of GOLauncher 2 under an FAA launch license. System development {{is currently}} on schedule to meet demand for government and commercial launch services starting in 2016.
