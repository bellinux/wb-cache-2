5|$|Out {{of the ten}} {{tropical}} storms, seven reached hurricane intensity, {{of which}} four made landfall on the United States. The strongest hurricane was a Category3 on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale which struck New England at that intensity, one of four storms to do so. <b>It</b> <b>left</b> heavy damage, killing at least twelve people. The most notable hurricane of the season was the Saxby Gale, which was predicted nearly a year in advance. The hurricane was one of six to produce hurricane-force winds in Maine, where <b>it</b> <b>left</b> heavy damage and flooding. The Saxby Gale left 37deaths along its path, with its destruction greatest along the Bay of Fundy; there, the hurricane produced a 70.9ft (21.6m) high tide near {{the head of the}} bay.|$|E

5|$|After {{initializing}} {{the concept}} in January 2013, the two discussed {{the project for}} three or four months before creating an outline for the whole story. The original outline was for 12 issues, but <b>it</b> <b>left</b> room for improvisation and a few points were removed as the story progressed. They looked at past and present social movements for civil rights for inspiration for how one would progress and how people might respond to a movement for android rights. Luna wrote the first draft of issue one, then the two worked together to rewrite it.|$|E
5|$|Although No Code debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200, <b>it</b> <b>left</b> a large section of the band’s fanbase {{unsatisfied}} and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but the album being considered inconsistent. The album became the first Pearl Jam album to not reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single platinum certification by the RIAA in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Daybreaker debuted {{at number}} one on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart and at number 42 on the UK Album Charts for selling 3,208 copies.

5|$|Delivered to the United States Army Air Forces on 19 March 1945, Bockscar was {{assigned}} to Captain Frederick C. Bock and crew C-13, and flown to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah in April. The name chosen for the aircraft, and painted on it after the mission, was a pun on {{the name of the}} aircraft commander. <b>It</b> <b>left</b> Wendover on 11 June 1945 for Tinian, where it arrived 16 June. It was originally given the Victor (unit-assigned identification) number 7 but on 1 August was given the triangle N tail markings of the 444th Bombardment Group as a security measure, and had its Victor changed to 77 to avoid misidentification with an actual 444th aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the end of}} Melissenos's revolt, <b>it</b> <b>left</b> a {{profound}} legacy: although Melissenos himself submitted to Alexios Komnenos, the towns he had occupied and garrisoned with Turkish soldiers in Ionia, Phrygia, Galatia, and Bithynia remained in their hands. Thus, by becoming involved in the Byzantine civil wars as mercenaries and allies – especially through their use by Botaneiates and Melissenos during their respective revolts to hold down various cities for them – the Turks completed their relatively peaceful take-over of central and western Asia Minor.|$|E

5|$|Flick entered semi-professional {{baseball}} by chance. When he was 15 years old, {{he was at}} a {{train station}} to support the local baseball team as <b>it</b> <b>left</b> for a road trip. Only eight of the team's players showed up at the station, so Flick was recruited to go on the trip with the team. Though Flick did not have a uniform or shoes, he hit well in both games of the doubleheader, though Bedford lost both games. He joined the Bedford team on a regular basis, and he continued to play semi-pro baseball throughout his teenage years.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, the Series again drew criticism, {{this time}} for {{allowing}} games to be called early because of weather and treating them as official games. After the Yokohama BayStars lost a 5-inning game in the 2017 Central League Climax Series, Coskrey wrote that playoff games should never end like in that manner. He suggested that NPB could have easily suspended the game and resumed where <b>it</b> <b>left</b> off {{the next day or}} even postponed the game entirely until the next day.|$|E
5|$|Jennings {{had been}} a heavy drinker of alcohol {{for much of his}} life. His {{addiction}} worsened {{after the death of his}} first wife, Ann, and his development of rheumatism. Jennings's alcoholism led to defeat in his reelection campaign in 1830. In retirement his condition worsened and he was unable to work his farm. When his finances collapsed, his creditors sought to take his land holdings and Charlestown farm. To protect his friend, U.S. Senator John Tipton purchased Jennings's farm and permitted him to continue living there. After Jennings's death, his estate was sold, but <b>it</b> <b>left</b> no funds to purchase a headstone for his grave, which remained unmarked for fifty-seven years.|$|E
