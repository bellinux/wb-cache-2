40|$|The {{absorption}} spectra of the coenzyme [pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate (PLP) ] in glycogen phosphorylase a (GPha), glycogen phosphorylase b (GPhb) {{and of the}} latter bound to various effectors and substrates were analysed {{on the basis of}} log-normal distribution curves. The results obtained showed that the ionization state of the PLP and GPha environment differs from that of GPhb. This divergence was interpreted in terms of tautomeric equilibria between some forms of the Schiff base of PLP and enzymic Lys- 679. The ionic forms are slightly more predominant in GPha than they are in GPhb, so ionic and/or hydrogen-bonding interactions between the aromatic ring of PLP and GPha must be stronger than with GPhb. This confirms the purely structural role of the aromatic ring of the coenzyme. Binding of GPhb to AMP and Mg 2 + results in the coenzyme adopting a similar state as in GPha.

40|$|The {{vision of}} multivalency as a {{strategy}} limited to achieve affinity enhancements between a protein receptor and its putative sugar ligand (glycotope) has proven too simplistic. On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>binding</b> of a glycotope in a dense glycocalix-like construct to a lectin partner {{has been shown to}} be sensitive to the presence of a third sugar entity (heterocluster effect). On the other hand, several carbohydrate processing enzymes (glycosidases and glycosyltransferases) have been found to be also responsive to multivalent presentations of binding partners (multivalent enzyme inhibition), a phenomenon first discovered for iminosugar-type inhibitory species (inhitopes) and recently demonstrated for multivalent carbohydrate constructs. By assessing a series of homo- and heteroclusters combining α-d-glucopyranosyl-related glycotopes and inhitopes, it was shown that multivalency and heteromultivalency govern both kinds of events, allowing for activation, deactivation or enhancement of specific recognition phenomena towards a spectrum of lectin and glycosidase partners in a multimodal manner. This unified scenario originates from the ability of (hetero) multivalent architectures to trigger glycosidase binding modes that are reminiscent of those harnessed by lectins, which should be considered when profiling the biological activity of multivalent architectures.

30|$|The physico-chemical {{properties}} and Ni 2 +, Pb 2 +, Hg 2 + binding ability of leachate-derived DOM were investigated by spectroscopic techniques. The results suggested that leachate {{could be a}} potential pollutant in term of high organic load and biological pollution. Clear fluorescence spectral shifts were observed due to the addition of metal ions. Results also highlighted the higher %f and LogK of young DOM (L- 2) sample indicating highest toxic metal binding affinity. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>binding</b> affinity of Pb 2 + was higher than the other metals (Ni 2 + and Hg 2 +) with L- 2. Binding affinity of DOM with metals showed the following pattern-Ni 2 + binding affinity: L- 2  > L- 3  > L- 1, Pb 2 + binding affinity: L- 2  > L- 3  > L- 1 and Hg 2 + binding affinity: L- 2  > L- 1  > L- 3. Overall, DOM in leachate samples showed variations in metal complexing capacity depending on DOM composition, structure and initial metal concentrations. As metal – DOM complexation plays {{a vital role in}} the toxicity and bioavailability of heavy metals in the environment, dissolved organic load of leachate should be treated effectively before discharge to avoid the potential threat of organic and heavy metal pollution on surrounding soil and aquatic environment.|$|E
