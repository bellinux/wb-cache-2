50|$|Sire de Grugy was {{expected}} to return at Cheltenham in November, but {{was found to be}} lame shortly before his scheduled comeback: subsequent veterinary tests revealed a hip injury.

Ewoks live high among the trees of their home moon's forests, in villages built on platforms between the closely spaced trees.|$|E

5000|$|The municipality, {{especially}} San Carlos, {{is popular}} with visitors from Arizona and Sonora {{but much of}} the coastal area, where the stark desert landscape meets the calm waters of the Gulf of California, is still undeveloped. San Carlos is an important destination for sportfishing with modern piers and 800 species that can be caught including sailfish, marlin, yellowtail and others.

[...] The most notable peak in San Carlos is called the Tetacawi or Teta de Cabra, which appears to have two horns. Teta de Cabra means “goat’s udder” which it is supposed to resemble. Other sports that can be practiced here include kayaking, sailing, jetskiing, snorkeling, scuba diving, mountain biking and hiking. San Pedro Island off the coast is popular for snorkeling, scubadiving and visiting the sea lions that live there.The Bacochibambo or Miramar Bay also attracts some tourism.
