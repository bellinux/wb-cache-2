40|$|The use {{of optical}} {{feedback}} for improving response linearity of electrooptic light modulators has been investigated. The modulator is configured as a straight channel waveguide flanked by electrodes in a lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) substrate. Light is coupled into the waveguide in both TE and TM polarizations, and a voltage applied across electrodes causes a relative phase shift between two polarization components. An output analyzer converts the phase modulation to intensity modulation. Optical feedback {{of light in}} both polarization modes results from reflection of light at the polished edges of the substrate. Channel waveguides supporting a single guided mode for TE and TM polarizations were fabricated in x-cut LiNbO 3 substrates using titanium-indiffusion technique. The waveguides and modulators were characterized at a wavelength of 1. 55 ??m using a distributed feedback laser. The modulators were driven with a sinusoidal voltage waveform. To minimize harmonics of the modulating frequency in the intensity output, {{the magnitude of the}} optical feedback and the substrate temperature were adjusted. The feedback level was altered by applying refractive index-matching liquid to one or both ends of the waveguide {{at the edges of the}} crystal. It was found that a high degree of response linearity in the presence of feedback was achievable at certain substrate temperatures. The spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) relative to the noise floor was measured at different feedback levels and substrate temperatures in an effort to maximize the modulator response linearity. An SFDR of 68. 04 dB, limited by third-order nonlinearity, was achieved by applying <b>index-matching</b> <b>fluid</b> to the input end of the substrate. This compares with an SFDR of 64. 84 dB limited by second-order nonlinearity when <b>index-matching</b> <b>fluid</b> was applied at both ends of the substrate.

Using a laser sheet scanning technique to visualize internal grain motion, a high-speed camera, and particle tracking, we can measure the trajectory of each grain throughout an impact event.

The source of the noise as well as the signal attenuation of the FBG sensing system is analyzed.

The cause of the ORL in fiber-optic elements (such as jumper cables connector and fiber end) is presented. In addition, suggestions to optimize the fiber optical sensing network in order to improve the SNR are presented. Methods to suppress noises caused by the fiber end interfaces of FBGs, including using <b>index-matching</b> <b>fluid,</b> bending fiber pigtails in the way mentioned in this paper and cleaving the slant angle of the fiber interfaces to be 8 °, all contribute to the optimized SNR.

Data were sampled on a 5 -mm grid {{throughout most of}} the interior of the blood chamber, using two orthogonal LDA configurations from which 3 D velocity data were synthesised. Data were subjected to statistical analysis of quasistatic time intervals and approximation by Fourier series. The velocity vector fields were explored statically (via 2 D plots) and dynamically (using 3 D animations of the reduced data). Reynolds stresses were computed and visualised in 2 D. Fluid pathlines were simulated and plotted in 3 D. The flow was found to be dominated by an irrotational vortex that accelerated and precessed in phase with the pumping diaphragm. Two unexpected flow structures, a rising, swirling near-wall layer in diastole and a reflection of the outflow vortex upon valve closure, enhanced washing of the walls. The thickness of the boundary layer was estimated to be 2 mm. Fluid velocities were generally lower than those reported in steady-flow studies on the SV VAD, although turbulence was comparable. Under the weaning mode, the coherence of the main vortex was degraded and flow recirculation was observed distal to the inflow port; this operating mode must be regarded as an indication for anticoagulation. In both pumping modes, turbulence was elevated in association with asymmetric buckling of the pneumatically driven diaphragm. Suboptimal orientation of the tilting-disc inlet valve gave rise to augmented turbulence production and skewing of the main vortex; similar results were obtained for an axisymmetric polymer (Jellyfish) valve, despite its advantageous haemodynamics. Flow stagnation was apparent where the inflow stream impinged on the wall, opposite the inflow port. The overall design of the SV VAD appears to almost ideal, in the context of current technology. However, elimination of recirculation/stagnation zones, especially in the weaning mode, remains a priority for the ultimate optimisation of haemocompatibility.

An approach of current topical interest is hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), {{and the study of}} associated tumor and normal tissue radio-biology. Rodent SBRT is extremely challenging, requiring the precise delivery of radiation beams on the order of several millimeters. At present there are no methods to comprehensively verify these delivery techniques due to the requirements for ultra-high resolution and ability to measure the dose in 3 dimensions (3 D). This work introduces a potential solution to the rodent SBRT verification challenge: radiochromic rodent-morphic 3 D dosimeters compatible with ultra-high resolution optical computed tomography (optical-CT) dose read-out. Rodent-morphic dosimeters were produced by 3 D-printing molds of rodent anatomy directly from X-ray CT data, and using these molds to create tissue-equivalent phantoms both with and without high-Z spinal inserts for cone-beam CT targeting. Feasibility was evaluated through a series of irradiations, including a 180 -degree spinal arc treatment. Dose distributions were measured in high-resolution (0. 5 mm isotropic voxels) with an in-house built optical-CT system, which determined dose from the change in optical density throughout the dosimeters from pre-and post-irradiation scans. Optical-CT data was calibrated to absolute dose using a calibration curve determined from irradiating small volumes of radiochromic material from the same batch as the rodent-morphic dosimeters to known doses in a 6 MV beam (negligible energy response was assumed). Independent verification of absolute dose at a point was made with a novel scintillator comprised of europium and lithium doped yttrium oxide nanocrystals, with a sub-mm active length. Independent verification of the dose distribution was performed using EBT 2 radiochromic film positioned in the dosimeters, which had been sliced in half. Contrast-to-noise ratio between high-Z spinal inserts and tissue-equivalent PRESAGE material was found to be ~ 10, sufficient for bony alignment and isocenter targeting with on-board CBCT image guidance. Absolute dose calculated at isocenter through optical-CT was found to agree with nano-detector measurement within 3 %, while relative dose distributions in two orthogonal planes were found to agree with film within 4 %. PRESAGE rodent-morphic dosimeters demonstrated much promise in the verification of precise radiation treatment given by the X-Rad 225 Cx micro-irradiator. Practical challenges involved in optical-CT imaging were addressed through the investigation of an in-house Fresnel-based optical-CT system with considerably less refractive <b>index-matching</b> <b>fluid.</b> The "DFOS" (Duke Fresnel-based Optical-CT System) system differed from current optical-CT systems by replacing cumbersome convex telecentric lenses with a lighter and much less expensive Fresnel system.

PRESAGE radiochromic dosimeters were irradiated with orthogonal parallel-opposed treatments and a brain IMRT treatment and dose distributions were readout by the DFOS system and compared to both treatment planning software prediction and other in-house optical-CT systems.

40|$|The photoacoustic {{signal of}} an optical {{absorber}} in a turbid medium {{is proportional to}} the local laser fluence, the optical absorption coefficient and the Gruneisen parameter. The local fluence at a subsurface absorber is determined by the initial incident fluence and optical properties of the media. Knowledge of laser fluence at subcutaneous tissue locations will improve our ability to estimate local chromophore concentrations and will lead to more quantitative estimates of blood oxygen saturation with photoacoustics. By integrating an oblique incidence reflectance (OIR) system in a photoacoustic imaging system, we are able to estimate optical properties of the turbid medium. To do this, we use a unique photoacoustic probe consisting of a 45 -degree optical prism in an optical <b>index-matching</b> <b>fluid.</b> An oblique CW-laser beam interrogates the tissue surface at the same location as a pulsed laser, used for photoacoustic interrogation. Photoacoustic signals collected from the tissue are deflected by the prism to a focused 10 MHz ultrasound transducer.

We fixed a tube filled with known concentrations of an absorbing dye below the probe in an Intralipid bath. We obtained the OIR and photoacoustic measurements for different Intralipid concentrations (providing a μs ’ between 1 and 10 cm- 1). The OIR measurements were used to estimate the bulk optical parameters. Using these values, models of light transport were then used to calculate the local laser fluence to normalize the photoacoustic measurements.

40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} various {{pathological}} and cardiovascular device flows are performed {{to assess their}} hemodynamic pathologic basis and {{to better understand the}} potential mechanisms which can be developed to improve them. ^ A Viscous Impeller Pump (VIP) based on the Von Karman viscous pump is specifically designed to provide cavopulmonary assist in a univentricular Fontan circulation. The technology will make it possible to biventricularize the univentricular Fontan circulation. Ideally, it will reduce the number of surgeries required for Fontan conversion from three to one early in life, while simultaneously improving physiologic conditions. Later in life, it will provide a currently unavailable means of chronic support for adolescent and adult patients with failing Fontan circulations. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations demonstrate that the VIP can satisfactorily augment cavopulmonary blood flow in an idealized total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). When the VIP is deployed at the TCPC intersection as a static device, it stabilizes the four-way flow pattern, and is not obstructive to flow. As a rotational device, it will augment the flow. Experimental studies are carried out to assess performance, hemodynamic characteristics and flow structures of the VIP in an idealized TCPC model. Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV) is applied using index-matched blood analog. Results show excellent performance of the VIP, without cavitation and with reduction of energy losses. The non-rotating VIP smooths and accelerates flow, and decreases stresses and turbulence in the TCPC. The rotating VIP generates the desired low-pressure Fontan flow augmentation (0 - 10 mmHg) while maintaining acceptable stress thresholds. ^ Dynamic Mode Decomposition is applied to SPIV data for unpowered Fontan hemodynamics to extract underlying coherent flow features of the flow problem. This shows that unpowered Fontan flow is unstable with alternation of one and two counter-rotating vortex rings along the pulmonary arteries. ^ Ultrasound measurements are performed on the in vitro experimental setup to show that this technique {{can be used as a}} means to optimize the placement of the temporary VIP in the TCPC of patients and maximize the univentricular function. ^ In addition to the above study, this work also examines flows associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms, a defect induced by the acquired cardiovascular disease atherosclerosis.

These include multimode optic fiber pairs and a micro-focusing-lens structure, embedded downstream of the separation channel. For detection purposes, the fluorescence signals are enhanced by positioning micro-focusing-lens structures at the outlets of the excitation fibers and the inlets of the detection fibers. In this study, two types of micro-focusing-lens are proposed—fixed-focal-length and controllable micro-lenses. They are made from different materials—PMMA and PDMS, respectively. With regard to the fixed-focal-length micro-lenses, {{the profile of the}} micro-lens curve can be formed by the defined master mold with specific temperatures and pressures. With regard to the controllable micro-lens design, deformations of the two flexible surfaces can be generated after pressurized <b>index-matching</b> <b>fluid</b> is injected into the pneumatic side-chambers. The side-chambers can be deflected as a double convex lens to focus both the excitation light source and the fluorescent emission signal. Experimental results revealed that the power amplitude of the excitation laser light can be enhanced by up to 5. 4 fold. Fluorescein isothiocyanate, dye labeled protein samples and DNA markers are then utilized for micro-CE chip testing. The results indicated that signal amplitude can be enhanced from 1. 7 to 2. 6 fold when compared with cases without the micro-lens. According to the experimental results, the developed device has a great potential to be integrated with other microfluidic devices for further biomedical applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{decay of}} {{evanescent}} field intensity beyond a dielectric interface depends upon beam incident angle, enabling the 3 -d distribution of fluorophores to be deduced from {{total internal reflection}} fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) images obtained at multiple incident angles. Instrumentation was constructed for computer-automated multiple angle-TIRFM (MA-TIRFM) using a right angle F 2 glass prism (n(r) 1. 632) to create the dielectric interface. A laser beam (488 nm) was attenuated by an acoustooptic modulator and directed onto a specified spot on the prism surface. Beam incident angle was set using three microstepper motors controlling two rotatable mirrors and a rotatable optical flat. TIRFM images were acquired by a cooled CCD camera in approximately 0. 5 degree steps for > 15 incident angles starting from the critical angle. For cell studies, cells were grown directly on the glass prisms (without refractive <b>index-matching</b> <b>fluid)</b> and positioned in the optical path. Images of the samples were acquired at multiple angles, and corrected for angle-dependent evanescent field intensity using "reference" images acquired with a fluorophore solution replacing the sample. A theory was developed to compute fluorophore z-distribution by inverse Laplace transform of angle-resolved intensity functions. The theory included analysis of multiple layers of different refractive index for cell studies, and the anisotropic emission from fluorophores near a dielectric interface. Instrument performance was validated by mapping the thickness of a film of dihexyloxacarbocyanine in DMSO/water (n(r) 1. 463) between the F 2 glass prism and a plano-convex silica lens (458 mm radius, n(r) 1. 463); the MA-TIRFM map accurately reproduced the lens spherical surface. MA-TIRFM {{was used to compare}} with nanometer z-resolution the geometry of cell-substrate contact for BCECF-labeled 3 T 3 fibroblasts versus MDCK epithelial cells. These studies establish MA-TIRFM for measurement of submicroscopic distances between fluorescent probes and cell membranes...|$|E
40|$|The {{advancement}} of optical systems arises from furthering {{at least one}} of the three fields of optical development: design, fabrication, and testing. One example of such advancement is the growth in customization of contact lenses, which is occurring in part due to advances in testing. Due to the diverse quantities that can be derived from it, the transmitted wavefront is the tested parameter. There are a number of tests that can evaluate a transmitted wavefront, including moire deflectometry, Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing, and interferometry. Interferometry is preferred for its sensitivity and spatial resolution. The dynamic range issue is mitigated by the required immersion of the contact lenses in saline due to the complex nature of the lens material. The partial index-match between the lens and surrounding saline reduces the measured power of the lens and enables testing in an absolute, or non-null, configuration. Absolute testing allows for the generation of ophthalmic prescriptions and power maps from the transmitted wavefront. Designing a non-null interferometer is based on three principles. The transmitted light must be collected, the resulting interference must be resolved, and the imaged wavefront must be calibrated. The first two principles are fulfilled by proper choices for the imaging lens and detector. Calibration comes from removing the wavefront-dependent induced aberrations via reverse raytracing. Reverse raytracing demands an accurate model of the interferometer. With such a model, theoretical wavefronts can be produced and compared to measured wavefronts. The difference between measured and modeled wavefronts quantifies the answer to the fundamental question in transmitted wavefront testing: does the optic perform as desired? Immersion in <b>index-matching</b> <b>fluid</b> provides an adjustable increase in the dynamic range of the interferometer. The increase comes at the expense of sensitivity. The tradeoff between dynamic range and sensitivity can be quantified by the dimensionless ratio between the two numbers. This ratio is interpreted as a degree of difficulty for a measurement. Combined with absolute testing, immersion provides the ability to measure fast cylindrical lenses, which are notoriously difficult to test. Understanding the parameters of the interferometer provides a simple condition for determining the gain from immersion...|$|E
