5|$|The {{gray wolf}} {{is the second}} most {{specialised}} member of the genus Canis, after the <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf,</b> as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature, and its highly advanced expressive behavior. It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species, such as the eastern wolf, coyote, and golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids. It is the only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds, and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene, colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean. It is a social animal, travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring. The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it. It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.|$|E

5|$|The {{ancestor}} {{of the golden}} jackal {{is believed to be}} the extinct Arno river dog that lived in Mediterranean Europe 1.9million years ago. It is described as being a small, jackal-like canine. Genetic studies indicate that the golden jackal expanded from India at the end of the last ice age around 20,000 years ago. The oldest golden jackal fossil is 20,000 years old and was found at the Ksar Akil rock shelter near Beirut, Lebanon. The oldest golden jackal fossils in Europe were found in Greece and are 7,000 years old. There are seven subspecies of the golden jackal. The golden jackal is not closely related to the African black-backed or side-striped jackals, being instead more closely related to the gray wolf, coyote, African golden wolf, and <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf.</b> It is capable of producing fertile hybrids with both the gray wolf and the African golden wolf. Dog-jackal hybrids called Sulimov dogs are in service at the Sheremetyevo Airport near Moscow where they are deployed by the Russian airline Aeroflot for scent-detection.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf</b> is {{restricted}} to just six isolated mountaintop areas of the Ethiopian highlands. With a total world population of approximately 400 individuals, the <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf</b> is the most endangered carnivore in Africa and most endangered canid in the world. As a result it is legally protected in the country from any activities that may threaten its survival. Habitat loss, caused by unsustainable and rapidly expanding cattle and crop farming is the most severe underlying threat, but diseases (rabies and canine distemper) transmitted from domestic dogs are a serious immediate threat and have recently caused population crashes in the Bale Mountains.|$|E
25|$|Mammals of {{paramount}} importance in BMNP include the endangered <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf</b> (Canis simensis), the Mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni), the Big-headed mole-rat, and the Bale Mountains vervet−Bale monkey (Chlorocebus djamdjamensis). The Afro-alpine area is home to {{over half of the}} global population of the <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf,</b> the rarest canid in the world with only 400 animals surviving. The northern juniper-hagenia woodlands harbor the largest population of the endemic and similarly endangered Mountain nyala, estimated to be approximately two-thirds of the global population. Furthermore, the entire population the big-headed molerat and most of the Bale monkey population are contained within the park.|$|E

40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} pose {{an important}} extinction {{risk for a}} number of endangered carnivore populations. Wild canids are particularly susceptible to generalist pathogens transmitted from domestic dogs - particularly rabies virus and canine distemper virus (CDV). Here we present a review of rabies as a threat to <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves,</b> an endangered canid restricted to a few isolated Afro-alpine ranges in the Ethiopian highlands, and the impact of rabies on the largest population in the Bale Mountains. In the Bale Mountains, two confirmed rabies outbreaks among <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves</b> in 1991 - 1992 and 2003 - 2004 were each responsible for over 70 % mortality among focal packs and a third rabies outbreak was suspected in 1990.

25|$|Ethiopia has 31 {{endemic species}} of mammals. The African wild dog prehistorically had {{widespread}} {{distribution in the}} territory.

25|$|Almost {{one third}} of the 47 mammals that live in BMNP are rodents. The rodent community, {{particularly}} of the Afro-alpine plateau are keystone species in the Bale Mountains National Park. They are the main prey for <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf,</b> and natural grazers of the Afro-alpine areas where important cryoturbation processes happen.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia is an ecologically diverse country, {{ranging from}} the deserts along the eastern border to the {{tropical}} forests {{in the south to}} extensive Afromontane in the northern and southwestern parts. Lake Tana in the north {{is the source of the}} Blue Nile. It also has a large number of endemic species, notably the gelada, the walia ibex and the <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf</b> ("Simien fox"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} {{geological}} origins, the mountains are almost unique, with only South Africa's Drakensberg having been {{formed in the}} same manner and thus appearing similar. Notable animals in the mountains include the walia ibex, gelada, and caracal. There are a few <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Among <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves,</b> most females {{disperse}} {{from their}} natal pack at {{about two years}} of age, and some become [...] "floaters" [...] that may successfully immigrate into existing packs. Breeding pairs are most often unrelated to each other, suggesting that female-biased dispersal reduces inbreeding.|$|R
25|$|A wolfdog (also {{called a}} wolf–dog hybrid or wolf hybrid) is a canid hybrid {{resulting}} from the hybridization of a domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) to one of four other Canis sub-species, the gray (Canis lupus), eastern timber (Canis lycaon), red (Canis rufus), and <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves</b> (Canis simensis).|$|R
25|$|Bale Mountains National Park {{is faced}} with many threats {{associated}} with an ever developing and an increasingly populated Ethiopia. One of the biggest threats to the park is grazing. For example, within the Web Valley, a prime <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf</b> habitat, cattle density is estimated at 250 per square kilometer. Other threats include increasing settlements within the park. Currently over 40,000 people live within the park’s boundaries, increasing pressure on the natural resources of the area and diminishing natural habitats of wild animals. With these settlements come domestic dogs, which pose a great threat to the <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf.</b> Dogs transmit rabies and canine distemper, and in 2010 killed 106 individuals (approximately 40% of the Bale population). Other serious threats {{include the use of}} the wolf habitat by livestock for grazing which significantly reduces the availability of rodent prey. Over 12 million people, their livestock and the environment in the south of Ethiopia as well as neighboring Somalia and northern Kenya rely on the water that originates from the Bale massif. Unsustainable use and pollution are major threats. Conservationists suggest that if conservation efforts in the Bale Mountains are not successful and people continue to exploit the resources in an unsustainable way, more species of mammal would go extinct than any other area of equivalent size on the planet.|$|E
25|$|The African wolf {{generally}} {{manages to}} avoid competing with black-backed and side-striped jackals by occupying a different habitat (grassland, {{as opposed to}} the closed and open woodlands favoured by the latter two species) and being more active during the daytime. Nevertheless, the African wolf has been known to kill the pups of black-backed jackals, but has in turn been observed to be dominated by adults during disputes over carcasses. It often eats alongside African wild dogs, and will stand its ground if the dogs try to harass it. Encounters with Ethiopian wolves are usually agonistic, with Ethiopian wolves dominating African wolves if the latter enter their territories, and vice versa. Although African wolves are inefficient rodent hunters and thus not in direct competition with Ethiopian wolves, it is likely that heavy human persecution prevents the former from attaining numbers large enough to completely displace the latter. Nevertheless, {{there is at least one}} record of an African wolf pack adopting a male <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf.</b>|$|E
500|$|The skull is {{most like}} that of the dingo, and is closer to that of the coyote (C.latrans) and the gray wolf (C.lupus) than to that of the black-backed jackal (C.mesomalas), the side-striped jackal (C.adustus), and the <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf</b> (C.simensis). Compared with the wolf, the skull of the golden jackal is smaller and less massive, with a lower nasal region and shorter facial region; the {{projections}} of the skull are prominent but weaker than those of the wolf; the canine teeth are large and strong but relatively thinner; and its carnassial teeth are weaker. The golden jackal is a less specialized species than the gray wolf, and these skull features relate to the jackal's diet of small birds, rodents, small vertebrates, insects, carrion, fruit, and some vegetable matter. Occasionally, the golden jackal develops a horny growth on the skull referred to as a [...] "jackal's horn", which usually measures [...] in length and is concealed by fur. This feature was once associated with magical powers by the people of Sri Lanka.|$|E

50|$|This {{region is}} known for its mammals, {{amphibians}} and birds including many endemic species. The Sanetti Plateau once was habitat to packs of the endangered painted hunting dog, Lycaon pictus, but the presence of this canid is now in question here due to the population pressures of expanding human presence.

50|$|Although {{similar to}} a small grey wolf, the golden jackal is {{distinguished}} by a more slender build, a narrower, more pointed muzzle, a shorter tail, and a lighter tread.

Despite its name, the golden jackal is not closely related to black-backed or side-striped jackals, being instead {{more closely related to}} grey <b>wolves,</b> coyotes, and <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves.</b> It is capable of producing fertile hybrids with both grey and African wolves.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolf</b> {{is listed}} as {{endangered}} by the IUCN, on account of its small numbers and fragmented range. Threats include increasing pressure from expanding human populations, resulting in habitat degradation through overgrazing, and disease transference and interbreeding from free-ranging dogs. Its conservation is headed by Oxford University's <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>Wolf</b> Conservation Programme, which seeks to protect wolves through vaccination and community outreach programs.|$|E
50|$|Rabies outbreaks, {{stemming}} from infected dogs, have killed many <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves</b> over the 1990s and 2000s. Two well-documented outbreaks in Bale, one in 1991 {{and another in}} 2008-2009, resulted in the die-off or disappearance of 75% of known animals. Both incidents prompted reactive vaccinations in 2003 and 2008-2009, respectively. Canine distemper is not necessarily fatal to wolves, though a recent increase in infection has occurred, with outbreaks of canine distemper having been detected in 2005-2006 in Bale and in 2010 across subpopulations.|$|R
40|$|<b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves,</b> Canis simensis, live {{in large}} multi-male family packs, where males are philopatric {{and do not}} disperse.

Regardless of paternity, all males in a pack help rear the pups. We non-invasively studied patterns in fecal testosterone and glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations using radioimmunoassays of fecal samples collected from nine wild male <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves</b> between August 2007 and February 2008.

Contrary to the predictions of the Challenge Hypothesis, we did not detect patterns in fecal testosterone metabolite concentrations associated with reproductive stage during our study period. Similarly, we found no patterns associated with reproductive stage in male fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations. Dominant males had higher average fecal testosterone and glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations than did subordinates, which may be related to higher rates of aggression and mate guarding in dominant males of group-living canids, a pattern also reported in African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus...|$|R

25|$|Intra-hybridization between {{dogs and}} other {{subspecies}} of gray wolves {{are the most}} common wolfdogs since dogs and gray wolves are considered the same species, are genetically very close, and have shared vast portions of their ranges for millennia. Such hybridization in the wild have been detected in many populations scattered throughout Europe and North America, usually occurring in areas where wolf populations have declined from human impacts and persecutions. At the same time, hybrids are also often bred in captivity for various purposes. Inter-hybridization of dogs and two other North American wolf species have also occurred historically in the wild, although it is often difficult for biologists to discriminate the dog genes in the eastern timber and red wolves from the gray wolf genes also present in these wolf species due to their historical overlaps with North American gray wolves as well as with coyotes, both of which have introgressed into the eastern timber and red wolf gene pools. At the same time, because many isolated populations of the three wolf species in North America have also mixed with coyotes in the wild, it has been speculated by some biologists that some of the coywolf hybrids in the northeastern third of the continent may also have both coydogs and wolfdogs in their gene pool. Hybrids between dogs and <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves</b> discovered in the Ethiopian Highlands likely originated from past interactions between free-roaming feral dogs and <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves</b> living in isolated areas.|$|R
40|$|With rabies {{emerging}} as a particular threat to wild canids, we report on a rabies outbreak in a subpopulation of endangered <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves</b> in the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia, in 2003 and 2004.

25|$|It was {{estimated}} that the African golden wolf diverged from the wolf–coyote clade 1.0–1.7 million years ago, during the Pleistocene, and therefore its superficial similarity to the Eurasian golden jackal (particularly in East Africa, where African wolves are similar in size to golden jackals) would be a case of parallel evolution. Considering its phylogenetic position and the canid fossil record, {{it is likely that}} the African wolf evolved from larger ancestors that became progressively more jackal-like in size upon populating Africa on account of interspecific competition with both larger and smaller indigenous carnivores. Traces of golden wolf DNA were identified in golden jackals in Israel, which adjoins Egypt, thus indicating the presence of a hybrid zone. The study's findings were corroborated that same year by Spanish, Mexican and Moroccan scientists analysing the mtDNA of wolves in Morocco, who found that the specimens analysed were distinct from both Eurasian golden jackals and grey wolves but bore a closer relationship to the latter. Studies on RAD sequences found instances of African wolves hybridizing with both feral dogs and <b>Ethiopian</b> <b>wolves.</b>|$|R
