5|$|In December 2015, Liam Lotter found a grey {{piece of}} debris {{on a beach}} in {{southern}} Mozambique, but only after he read in March 2016 about Gibson's find (some 300 kilometres from his find) did his family alert authorities. It was flown to Australia for analysis. It carried a stencilled code 676EB, which identified it as part of a Boeing 777 flap track <b>fairing,</b> and the style in which the lettering was painted onto the <b>fairing</b> matched stencils used by Malaysia Airlines, making it almost certain that the part came from 9M-MRO.|$|E
5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped <b>fairing</b> above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped <b>fairing</b> {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile. Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile passed its state acceptance trials in 1952–53.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February, the CryoSat-2 {{spacecraft}} was fuelled for launch. Then on 10 February it {{was attached}} to the payload adaptor, and encapsulated in the payload <b>fairing,</b> to form a unit known as the Space Head Module. This was transported to the launch pad by means of a vehicle known as the crocodile, and installed atop the carrier rocket. Rollout occurred on 15 February, and the next day the satellite was activated in order to test its systems following integration onto the rocket.|$|E

5|$|The {{underwater}} {{search was}} beset by technical problems and eventually abandoned. Diagrams and notes {{included in the}} declassified documents make clear {{it was not possible}} to search the entire area where crash debris had spread. Four bomb reservoirs, one nearly intact secondary, and parts equaling two secondaries were recovered on the sea ice; parts equaling one secondary were not accounted for. The search also revealed a weapon cable <b>fairing,</b> polar cap, and a one-foot by three-foot section of a warhead's ballistic case.|$|E
5|$|The airflow {{through the}} main {{radiator}} was controlled by pneumatic exit flaps. In early marks of Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI) the single flap was operated manually using a lever {{to the left of}} the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator <b>fairing</b> housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} Soyuz TM-19, {{carrying}} the EO-16 crew, was delayed {{due to the}} unavailability of a payload <b>fairing</b> for the booster that was to carry it, but the spacecraft eventually left Earth on 1 July 1994 and docked two days later. They stayed only four months to allow the Soyuz schedule to line up with the planned space shuttle manifest, and so Polyakov greeted a second resident crew in October, prior to the undocking of Soyuz TM-19, when the EO-17 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-20.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} <b>fairs</b> a year: the village <b>fair</b> is on Ascension Thursday, <b>fair</b> of church, <b>fair</b> of The St. Ilia chapel, <b>fair</b> of monastery and the Hunters <b>Fair.</b>|$|R
50|$|In some countries, the <b>Fair</b> Trade Town {{became a}} status awarded by a {{recognized}} <b>Fair</b> Trade certification body (i.e. the Fairtrade Foundation in the United Kingdom, TransFair Canada in Canada etc.) describing an area which {{is committed to}} the promotion of <b>Fair</b> Trade certified goods. By extension, the organizations also award the statuses of <b>Fair</b> Trade City, <b>Fair</b> Trade Village, <b>Fair</b> Trade Zone, <b>Fair</b> Trade Borough, <b>Fair</b> Trade Island, <b>Fair</b> Trade Country and <b>Fair</b> Trade University.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the major tracks, wagering was also conducted on horse and dog races at agricultural <b>fairs</b> around the state, including the Northampton <b>Fair,</b> Marshfield <b>Fair,</b> Great Barrington <b>Fair,</b> Weymouth <b>Fair,</b> Berkshire County <b>Fair</b> (at Berkshire Downs), Brockton <b>Fair,</b> and Topsfield <b>Fair.</b> Race fixing was notoriously common at these meets. This <b>fair</b> circuit {{came to an end}} when the last remaining venue, Northampton, held its final racing meet in 2005.|$|R
5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure. At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from the front wheel to the rear wheel. Also, depending on {{the shape of the}} bike and the shape of any <b>fairing</b> that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} re-equipped with Mk. II's in May 1941 and Finucane {{was assigned}} serial P8038, formerly of No. 303 Squadron RAF, on 21 May. It {{was the first}} of four Spitfires to carry the Shamrock emblem as his personal insignia. Jimmy Firth, his airframe rigger and 'Speedy' Moore, a Canadian engine fitter, were attempting to put an outline of the design on. Poorly done, it attracted the attention of Maurice Pownhall a professional in Lithography. Using green dope he completed the emblem on the forward left part of the cockpit <b>fairing</b> panel. Finucane approved and the Shamrock stayed.|$|E
5|$|Two {{airframe}} configurations {{were tested}} during the prototype stage. The first configuration was tested {{on the first}} three prototype aircraft; PT-01, PT-02, and PT-03. The next three prototypes PT-04, PT-05, and PT-06 were of the second configuration, incorporating modifications such as DSI, wider LERX, extended ventral fins, and a taller, less swept vertical stabiliser with a rectangular <b>fairing</b> at the tip containing electronic warfare equipment and small blister fairings at the base containing Missile Approach Warning sensors. The PT-04 prototype was primarily used for avionics and weapon qualification tests. Prototype-01 first flew in August 2003; Prototype-03 followed in April 2004. On 10 May 2006, Prototype 04 made its maiden flight.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} <b>fairs</b> and festivals that are celebrated all over India, there are {{number of other}} <b>fairs</b> and festivals also {{that are at the}} high point of Himachal Pradesh. These festivals are the time for the Himachalis to adorn {{colourful}} dress and accessories and get mixed up with the rest of their kins. Some of these <b>fairs</b> and festivals in the upper regions are the Kullu Dussehra, Shivratri <b>Fair</b> (Mandi), Shoolini Mela (Solan), Minjar <b>Fair</b> (Chamba), Mani Mahesh Chhari Yatra (Chamba), Renuka <b>fair</b> (Sirmaur), Lavi Trade <b>Fair</b> (Rampur), Vrajeshwari <b>fair</b> (Kangra), Jwalamukhi <b>Fair</b> (Jwalamukhi), Holi <b>Fair</b> (Sujanpur Tira), and Naina Devi <b>Fair</b> (Bilaspur),Fulaich {Kinnaur valley}.

5|$|Visible {{changes from}} the XF-104 to {{production}} {{versions of the}} Starfighter include a longer fuselage (to accommodate the J79 engine and extra internal fuel) and a forward-retracting nose landing gear (except two-seat versions) to increase clearance for the downward-ejecting seat. A ventral fin for increased stability was added during the YF-104A test program. Inlet shock cones and a fuselage spine <b>fairing</b> between the canopy and fin that housed fuel piping were further added features. Production aircraft would also feature a redesigned fin structure using stainless steel spars to eliminate the flutter problem.|$|E
5|$|The JF-17 has a {{defensive}} aids system (DAS) composed of various integrated sub-systems. A radar warning receiver (RWR) provides data such as direction and proximity of enemy radars, and an electronic warfare (EW) suite {{housed in a}} <b>fairing</b> {{at the tip of}} the tail fin interferes with enemy radars. The EW suite is also linked to a Missile Approach Warning (MAW) system to defend against radar-guided missiles. The MAW system uses several optical sensors across the airframe to detect the rocket motors of missiles across a 360-degree coverage. Data from the MAW system, such as direction of inbound missiles and the time to impact, is shown on cockpit displays and the HUD. A countermeasures dispensing system releases decoy flares and chaff to help evade hostile radar and missiles. The DAS systems will also be enhanced by integration of a self-protection radar-jamming pod that will be carried externally on a hardpoint.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root <b>fairing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>fair</b> is {{typically}} well attended, although like most <b>fairs,</b> weather plays a factor. In 2004 {{the number of}} people to attend the <b>fair</b> was 65,173, and in 2005 75,176. These numbers are good relative to the population of the township (1,301), but they are lower than the Allentown <b>Fair,</b> Ephrata <b>Fair,</b> Crawford County <b>Fair,</b> and Bloomsburg <b>Fair.</b>|$|R

5|$|The design {{specifications}} were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let {{to build the}} components. Three different plants were used {{so that no one}} would have a copy of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail <b>fairing</b> and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan. The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July. The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the heavy cruiser , arriving on 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} carry up to 20 AGM-69 SRAM nuclear {{missiles}} was added to G and H models, starting in 1971. To further improve its offensive ability, air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) were fitted. After testing of both the Air Force-backed Boeing AGM-86 and the Navy-backed General Dynamics AGM-109 Tomahawk, the AGM-86B was selected for operation by the B-52 (and ultimately by the B-1 Lancer). A total of 194 B-52Gs and Hs were modified to carry AGM-86s, carrying 12 missiles on underwing pylons, with 82 B-52Hs further modified to carry another eight missiles on a rotary launcher fitted in the bomb-bay. To conform with SALT II Treaty requirements that cruise missile-capable aircraft be readily identifiable by reconnaissance satellites, the cruise missile armed B-52Gs were modified with a distinctive wing root <b>fairing.</b> As all B-52Hs were assumed modified, no visual modification of these aircraft was required. In 1990, the stealthy AGM-129 ACM cruise missile entered service; although intended to replace the AGM-86, a high cost and the Cold War's end led to only 450 being produced; unlike the AGM-86, no conventional (non-nuclear) version was built. The B-52 {{was to have been}} modified to utilize Northrop Grumman's AGM-137 TSSAM weapon; however, the missile was canceled due to development costs.|$|E
5|$|The plastic <b>fairing</b> {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{the nozzle}} {{protruded}} from the back, but this {{turned out to}} be aerodynamically disadvantageous. In June 2004, between flights 14P and 15P, a <b>fairing</b> was added, smoothly extending the fuselage shape to meet the flared end of the nozzle. On flight 15P the new <b>fairing</b> overheated, due to being black on the inside and facing a hot, black nozzle. The <b>fairing</b> softened, and the lower part crumpled inwards during boost. Following that flight the interior of the <b>fairing</b> was painted white, and some small stiffening ribs were added.|$|E
