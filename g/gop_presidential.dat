5|$|Much {{support has}} been {{achieved}} by talk radio personality Neal Boortz. Boortz's book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) entitled The FairTax Book, explains the proposal and spent time atop the New York Times Best Seller list. Boortz stated that he donates {{his share of the}} proceeds to charity to promote the book. In addition, Boortz and Linder have organized several FairTax rallies to publicize support for the plan. Other media personalities have also assisted in growing grassroots support including former radio and TV talk show host Larry Elder, radio host and former candidate for the 2012 <b>GOP</b> <b>Presidential</b> Nomination Herman Cain, Fox News and radio host Sean Hannity, and Fox Business Host John Stossel. The FairTax received additional visibility as one of the issues in the 2008 presidential election. At a debate on June 30, 2007, several Republican candidates were asked about their position on the FairTax and many responded that they would sign the bill into law if elected. The most vocal promoters of the FairTax during the 2008 primary elections were Republican candidate Mike Huckabee and Democratic candidate Mike Gravel. The Internet, blogosphere, and electronic mailing lists have contributed to promoting, organizing, and gaining support for the FairTax. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, and his ensuing Libertarian Party presidential run, former Governor of New Mexico and businessman Gary Johnson actively campaigned for the FairTax. Former CEO of Godfather's Pizza Herman Cain has been promoting the FairTax as a final step in a multiple-phase tax reform. Outside of the United States, the Christian Heritage Party of Canada adopted a FairTax proposal as part of their 2011 election platform but won no seats in that election.|$|E

25|$|On August 11, 2007, Brownback {{finished}} third in the Ames Straw Poll with 15.3 percent of all votes cast. Fundraising and visits to his website declined dramatically after this event, as many supporters had predicted Brownback would do much better, and speculation began that the candidate was considering withdrawing from the campaign. This sentiment increased after his lackluster performance in the <b>GOP</b> <b>presidential</b> debate of September 5, broadcast from New Hampshire by Fox News Channel. He dropped out of the race on October 18, 2007, citing a lack of funds. He formally announced his decision on October 19. He later endorsed John McCain for president.|$|E

500|$|Cleveland was {{the leader}} of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs, Free Silver, inflation, imperialism, and {{subsidies}} to business, farmers, or veterans on libertarian philosophical grounds. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era. Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism. He fought political corruption, patronage, and bossism.

Although the tweet fed the impression that Huntsman was a moderate and provoked some backlash among strong conservatives, a few populist conservative commentators such as Erick Erickson declined to oppose Huntsman's candidacy overall, with Erickson writing on December 27 that he [...] "continue to hope Perry surprises in Iowa and Huntsman surprises in New Hampshire" [...] and stating on January 10, 2012, that he would rather have Huntsman [...] "than Romney or Santorum".|$|E

50|$|Walter J. Kohler Jr. {{decided to}} move in {{politics}} in 1948 and he joined Team Stassen for the presidential elections. While this was unsuccessful, his networking and hard work in politics paid off when he became the 33rd Governor of Wisconsin in 1951. Walter had experienced politics first hand, being active in his father's reelection campaign in 1932. After returning from the war, he thought of running for the United States Senate. But that was also the driving ambition of Joseph R. McCarthy, an ex-Marine who had run for the Senate two years earlier. Walter {{had little choice but}} to step aside. In the late 1940s, Walter rose within the state G.O.P. by making friends, working for others, and winning the support of industrialist Tom Coleman, a dominant force within the Party. In 1948, Kohler was a delegate to the national convention and made it clear that he was a moderate Republican in the mold of the <b>GOP's</b> <b>presidential</b> candidate Thomas Dewey.|$|R

5000|$|Even {{when the}} African-American-dominated Black and Tan faction lost power after 1912 to the Lily-White Movement within the Republican Party, Cohen {{obtained}} {{the position of}} comptroller of customs by appointment from President Warren G.

Harding's successor, Calvin Coolidge, renewed Cohen's appointment. Though {{he had been a}} delegate to all Republican National Conventions between 1896 and 1924, Cohen was later ousted as secretary of the now 144-member Louisiana State Republican Central Committee and instead headed a dissenting group. In 1928, Cohen favored U.S. Senator Charles Curtis of Kansas for the Republican presidential nomination, but the party selection went nearly unanimously to Herbert Hoover, the outgoing secretary of commerce. Curtis then became the <b>GOP</b> vice <b>presidential</b> nominee. In 1928, Coolidge offered Cohen the position of minister to Liberia, but he declined the offer.|$|R

Vice President Joe Biden and Senators John McCain and Jim Webb made special appearances, as did former <b>GOP</b> Vice <b>Presidential</b> nominee Sarah Palin and former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W.

25|$|Despite {{the popular}} {{perception}} that conservatism {{is limited to}} Republicans, during the era of segregation before 1965 many Southern Democrats were also conservative, especially about social and racial issues. Southern Democrats were {{a key part of}} a Conservative Coalition that largely blocked liberal labor legislation in Congress from 1937 to 1963, though they tended to be liberal and vote {{with the rest of the}} Democratic Party on other economic issues. Southern Democrats fended off the more conservative Republican Party (GOP) by arguing that only they could defend segregation because the Republican Party nationally was committed to integration. That argument collapsed when Congress banned segregation in 1964. This provided an opportunity for Republicans to appeal to conservative Southerners on the basis that the GOP was the more conservative party on a wide range of social and economic issues, as well as being hawkish on foreign policy when the antiwar forces gained strength in the Democratic party. Southern white conservatives moved from the Democratic Party to the <b>GOP</b> at the <b>presidential</b> level in the 1960s, and at the state and local level after 1990.|$|R
5000|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{emphasize the}} role of racial backlash in the realignment of southern voters. The viewpoint that the electoral realignment of the Republican party due to a race-driven Southern Strategy {{is also known as}} the [...] "top-down" [...] viewpoint. [...] Most scholarship and analysts support this top-down viewpoint and claim that the political shift was due primarily to racial issues. The Southern Strategy is generally believed to be the primary force that transformed the [...] "Democratic South into a reliable <b>GOP</b> stronghold in <b>presidential</b> elections". Some historians believe that racial issues took a back seat to a grassroots narrative known as the [...] "suburban strategy". Matthew Lassiter, who along with Shafer and Johnston is a leading proponent of the [...] "suburban strategy" [...] viewpoint, recognizes that [...] "This analysis runs contrary to both the conventional wisdom and a popular strain in the scholarly literature". Glen Feldman, when speaking of the [...] "suburban strategy", states it is [...] "the dissenting - yet rapidly growing - narrative on the topic of southern partisan realignment".|$|R
2500|$|The {{growth of}} {{conservatism}} within the Republican Party attracted white conservative Southern Democrats in presidential elections. A few big names {{switched to the}} GOP, including South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond in 1964 and Texas Governor John Connally in 1973. Starting in 1968, in the South the <b>GOP</b> dominated most <b>presidential</b> elections (1976 was the lone exception), but not until the 1990s did the GOP become dominant {{in state and local}} politics in the region. Through the Southern strategy, Republicans built their strength among Southern Baptists and other religious Fundamentalists, white social conservatives, middle-class suburbs, migrants from the North, and Cubans in Florida. Meanwhile, starting in 1964, African American voters in the South began to show overwhelming support for the Democratic Party at both the presidential and local levels. They elected a number of congressmen and mayors. In 1990 there were still many moderate white Democrats holding office in the South, but when they retired they were typically replaced by much more conservative Republicans or by liberal blacks. In the 21st century, political scientists point to the strong base of social conservatism in the South. The evangelical Protestants, comprising the [...] "Religious Right", have since the 1980s strongly influenced the vote in Republican primaries, for [...] "it is primarily in the South where the evangelical core of the GOP is strongest." ...|$|R
