2500|$|Sam Strike plays Jackson, born Jedidiah Sawyer, {{as one of}} {{the four}} inmates that escape the mental institution, before {{ultimately}} becoming the eponymous Leatherface after enduring tragedies that destroy his cognitive stability. Leatherface is a mentally disabled serial killer seen throughout the TCM franchise, known for wearing masks made of human skin, and using a chainsaw and mallet as his signature weapons. Strike joined the film after reading the script, which he opined was, for a horror film, very character-driven. He felt that there needed to be a contrast between {{the two sides of the}} character, to show how a somewhat kind person can become such a killer: [...] "It could <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody.</b> He had it in him because of his mother, but was at the mercy of his environment." [...] Strike integrated aspects from the original film into his performance out of respect, but wanted to give his own interpretation instead of imitating what came before. To make the character's transformation more believable, Strike intentionally tried to gain physical body weight before filming: [...] "I was trying to eat as much as I could to just feel physically capable. Chainsaws, in reality, are very heavy, especially ones that are manufactured back in the '50s and '60s. Leatherface looks like he could take your head off with a slap; I wanted to be able to feel that way." [...] Strike believed that the character's bursts of rage throughout the film contributed to his final permanent state as a monster. He developed a [...] "battle cry" [...] for whenever Leatherface lost his temper. As someone who was taken from his biological family and put into foster care at an early age, Jedidiah Sawyer was written in the screenplay to have been adopted at one point by a family that wanted a little girl, forcing him to wear drag clothing as a child and foreshadowing his gender ambiguity in the 1974 Texas Chain Saw Massacre. This plot point was absent from the final cut of the film.|$|E

60|$|It is a natural, healthy book, {{written by}} a living person, about people of flesh and blood, {{who might have been}} our neighbors, and of events, which might <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody.</b> This is a great charm in a novel.

60|$|In the Waterloo period {{there was}} a general rough-and-tumble athleticism among average Englishmen. It cannot be re-created by cricket, or by conscription, or by any {{artificial}} means. It was a thing of the soul. It came out of laughter, religion, and the spirit of the place. But it was like the modern French duel in this--that it might <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody.</b> If I were a French journalist it might really happen that Monsieur Clemenceau might challenge me to meet him with pistols. But I do not think that it is at all likely that Mr. C. B. Fry will ever challenge me to meet him with cricket-bats.|$|E

60|$|All new-comers were {{presented}} to him. He was punctilious in the exaction of this ceremony. The wits would perform the office of introduction with overcharged pomp and politeness, {{but they could not}} easily overstep his sense of its gravity. He received them in his poor room (he disliked an introduction in the mere yard, as informal--a thing that might <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody),</b> with a kind of bowed-down beneficence. They were welcome to the Marshalsea, he would tell them. Yes, he was the Father of the place. So the world was kind enough to call him; and so he was, if more than twenty years of residence gave him a claim to the title. It looked small at first, but there was very good company there--among a mixture--necessarily a mixture--and very good air.|$|E
60|$|Betty liked Smith. His odd ways, his conversation, and his extreme solicitude for {{his clothes}} amused her. She found his {{outlook on life}} refreshing. Smith was an optimist. Whatever cataclysm might occur, he never doubted {{for a moment that}} he would be comfortably on the summit of the debris when all was over. He amazed Betty with his stories of his reportorial adventures. He told them for the most part as humorous stories at his own expense, but the fact {{remained}} that in a considerable proportion of them he had only escaped a sudden and violent death by adroitness or pure good luck. His conversation opened up a new world to Betty. She began to see that in America, and especially in New York, anything may <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody.</b> She looked on Smith with new eyes.|$|E
6000|$|For instance, the {{tradition}} of Turkish rule is simply a joke. All the stories about it are jokes, and often very good jokes. My own favourite incident is that which is still commemorated in the English cathedral by an enormous hole in the floor. The Turks dug up the pavement looking for concealed English artillery; {{because they had been}} told that the bishop had given his blessing to two canons. The bishop had indeed recently appointed two canons to the service of the Church, but he had not secreted them under the floor of the chancel. There was another agreeable incident when the Turkish authorities, by an impulsive movement of religious toleration, sent for a Greek priest to bury Greek soldiers, and told him to take his choice in a heap of corpses of all creeds and colours. But at once the most curious and the most common touch of comedy is the perpetual social introduction to solid and smiling citizens who have been nearly hanged by the Turks. The fortunate gentleman seems still to be regarding his escape with a broad grin. If you were introduced to a polite Frenchman who had come straight from the guillotine, or to an affable American who had only just vacated the electrical chair, you would feel a faint curiosity about the whole story. If a friend introduced somebody, saying, [...] "My friend Robinson; his sentence has been commuted to penal servitude," [...] or [...] "My Uncle William, just come from Dartmoor Prison," [...] your mind and perhaps your lips would faintly form the syllables [...] "What for?" [...] But evidently, under Turkish rule, being hanged was like being knocked down by a cab; it might <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody.</b> This is a parenthesis, since I am only dealing here with the superficial experience of the streets, especially in the snow. But it will be well to safeguard it by saying that this unpolitical carelessness and comprehensiveness of the indiscriminate Turk had its tragic as well as its comic side. It was by no means everybody that escaped hanging; and there was a tree growing outside the Jaffa Gate at which men might still shudder as they pass it in the sunlight. It was what a modern revolutionary poet has called bitterly the Tree of Man's Making; and what a medieval revolutionary poet called the fruit tree in the orchard of the king. It was the gibbet; and lives have dropped from it like leaves from a tree in autumn. Yet even on the sterner side, we can trace the truth about the Moslem fatalism which seems so alien to political actuality. There was a popular legend or proverb that this terrible tree was in some way bound up with the power of the Turk, and perhaps the Moslem over a great part of the earth. There is nothing more strange about that Moslem fatalism than a certain gloomy magnanimity which can invoke omens and oracles against itself. It is astonishing how often the Turks seem to have accepted a legend or prophecy about their own ultimate failure. De Quincey mentions one of them in the blow that half broke the Palladium of Byzantium. It is said that the Moslems themselves predict the entry of a Christian king of Jerusalem through the Golden Gate. Perhaps that is why they have blocked up the fatal gate; but in any case they dealt in that fashion with the fatal tree. They elaborately bound and riveted it with iron, as if accepting the popular prophecy which declared that so long as it stood the Turkish Empire would stand. It was as if the wicked man of Scripture had daily watered a green bay-tree, {{to make sure that it}} should flourish.|$|E

6000|$|It is a {{necessary}} result of Mr. Masson's method, that {{a great deal of}} space is devoted to what might have befallen his hero and what he might have seen. This leaves a broad margin indeed for the insertion of purely hypothetical incidents. Nay, so desperately addicted is he to what he deems the vivid style of writing, that he even goes {{out of his way to}} imagine what might have <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> living at the same time with Milton.

40|$|The {{reflection}} of the society in this world often comes as an inspiration towards modern writers. The novel Invisible Monsters has shown one work in which the author is trying to comment on problems occurring in this current world. Many of these problems {{may be caused by}} unhealthy human behaviors which include narcissism and self destruction. Both of these are later portrayed by one of Invisible Monster?s character named Shannon McFarland. Taking into account that these two terms seem to be in contradiction, they ignite my eagerness to find out the bridge that link them. Thus I will find out the causes of narcissism and especially how it leads to self destruction. For one thing, Shannon McFarland is a representation of human flaw and she also shows why besides the wreckage of society, there are still psychological problems to be regarded. Importing resources from the internet will provide scientific theories and any other important facts that are helpful in conducting the research. I will be using psychological approach in operating the analysis and also some theories on narcissism and self destruction. The novel itself serves as a valuable resource indicating that the two issues do exist and is possible to <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody.</b> In my analysis, I find out that narcissism can lead to self destruction and that they turn out to have a rather strong relationship which later on leads to self destruction solving narcissism. This finding is expected to increase society?s awareness of problems that might occur due to problematic child rearing...|$|E
6000|$|How few men, {{says the}} Oldest Member, possess the proper golfing temperament! How few indeed, {{judging by the}} sights I see here on Saturday afternoons, possess any {{qualification}} at all for golf except a pair of baggy knickerbockers and enough money {{to enable them to}} pay for the drinks {{at the end of the}} round. The ideal golfer never loses his temper. When I played, I never lost my temper. Sometimes, it is true, I may, after missing a shot, have broken my club across my knees; but I did it in a calm and judicial spirit, because the club was obviously no good and I was going to get another one anyway. To lose one's temper at golf is foolish. It gets you nothing, not even relief. Imitate the spirit of Marcus Aurelius. [...] "Whatever may befall thee," [...] says that great man in his [...] "Meditations", [...] "it was preordained for thee from everlasting. Nothing <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> which he is not fitted by nature to bear." [...] I like to think that this noble thought came to him after he had sliced a couple of new balls into the woods, and that he jotted it down on the back of his score-card. For there can be no doubt that the man was a golfer, and a bad golfer at that. Nobody who had not had a short putt stop on the edge of the hole could possibly have written the words: [...] "That which makes the man no worse than he was makes life no worse. It has no power to harm, without or within." [...] Yes, Marcus Aurelius undoubtedly played golf, and all the evidence seems to indicate that he rarely went round in under a hundred and twenty. The niblick was his club.|$|R
