5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E
5|$|Slippery {{surfaces}} or bumpy surfaces. Under <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> braking, {{the lower}} {{coefficient of friction}} may cause the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> to skid which often results {{in a loss of}} balance.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> of an open-wheeled F1 car {{generate}} aerodynamic drag. The thinking {{behind the}} Tyrrell P34 {{was that this}} drag effect could be reduced by using smaller diameter tyres at the front. At the time, conventional F1 <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> would measure around 16" [...] (40 cm) diameter but Tyrrell planned to use just 10" [...] (25 cm) diameter wheels. The corresponding loss of front-end grip was overcome by incorporating two <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> per side thus actually increasing grip as well as decreasing drag. The design incorporated a system whereby all four <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> could steer the car.|$|R
50|$|Automobiles {{usually have}} parking brakes {{on the rear}} wheels. If the rear axle is jacked off the ground with only the parking brake set, the vehicle may roll on the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> and fall. Chocking the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> {{prevents}} this mishap.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of tractor and truck pulling, the force to the pull the load is applied above the ground, and so it also acts to lift the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> and thus reduces the forward {{acceleration}} necessary to lift the <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> or flip the bike and rider over the <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b> A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> is known as trail braking.|$|E
5|$|The farther forward (closer to <b>front</b> <b>wheel)</b> {{the center}} of mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the rear wheel) {{the center of}} mass is located, the more <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Front-wheel drive (FWD) vehicles' engines {{drive the}} <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> Using the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> for {{delivery}} of power {{as well as}} steering allows the driving force {{to act in the}} same direction as the wheel is pointing. This layout is commonly used in modern passenger cars.|$|R
50|$|In some vehicles, manual locking hubs {{are used}} to engage the <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> This {{requires}} getting in/out of the vehicle to engage or disengage the <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> This {{may have to be}} done repeatedly if road conditions are irregular (shift from snow, then dry pavement, then snow again, repeatedly).|$|R
50|$|Solar cars {{usually have}} three wheels, but some have four. Three-wheelers usually have two <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> and one rear wheel: the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> steer and {{the rear wheel}} follows. Four-wheel {{vehicles}} are set up like normal cars or similarly to three-wheeled vehicles with the two rear wheels close together.|$|R
5|$|The {{role of the}} {{gyroscopic}} effect in most bike designs is to help steer the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> into {{the direction of a}} lean. This phenomenon is called precession and the rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin. The slower a <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> spins, the faster it will precess when the bike leans, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|The {{steering}} ratio is the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire {{behavior and the}} actual turning radius. Values less than one, where the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> side slip {{is greater than the}} rear wheel side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over-steering. Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} moving at 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> with a moment of inertia of 0.6kg·m2, turning the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E
5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure. At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> to the rear wheel. Also, depending on {{the shape of the}} bike and the shape of any fairing that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E

50|$|Also, a drift is {{not likely}} to occur if the camber of the rear wheels is set too negative. On the other hand, if the camber of the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> is set too positive, they will break {{traction}} in the same moment the rear ones do, so the car will slide uncontrollably rather than pivoting around the <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{measurement}} {{similar to}} trail, called either mechanical trail, normal trail, or true trail, is the perpendicular {{distance from the}} steering axis to the centroid of the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> contact patch.|$|E
5|$|American {{vehicles}} used Drum brakes {{until the}} 1962 Studebaker Avanti - the first American production model with <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> Disc brakes as standard equipment. These are {{less prone to}} fade and are the current standard of design.|$|E
5|$|Front flat tire. Braking a {{wheel with}} a flat tire can cause the tire {{to come off the}} rim which greatly reduces {{friction}} and, {{in the case of a}} <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> result in a loss of balance.|$|E
50|$|The Phantom VIII is {{the first}} Rolls-Royce to be fitted with four-wheel steering. The system turns the rear wheels in the {{opposite}} direction to the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> at speeds lower than 60 km/h to improve maneuverability. At speeds above this threshold the rear wheels turn {{in the same direction as}} the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> to increase high-speed stability.|$|R
50|$|The Piaggio MP3 is {{a modern}} tilting {{three-wheeled}} scooter. Unlike most motorcycle trikes, it is a reverse trike, with two <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> which steer, and a single driven rear <b>wheel.</b> The <b>front</b> suspension allows both <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> to tilt independently, so that all three wheels remain {{in contact with the}} ground as it leans when cornering.|$|R
5000|$|In 1965, noted American auto customizer Gene Winfield created The Reactor, a Citroën DS chassis, with a {{turbocharged}} [...] flat-six engine {{from the}} Corvair driving the <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> Since the DS {{already had the}} engine behind the <b>front</b> <b>wheels,</b> the longer engine meant only one row of seats. This was draped in a streamlined, low slung, aluminum body.|$|R
5|$|The {{rear wheel}} is {{prevented}} from precessing as the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> does by friction of the tires on the ground, and so continues to lean {{as though it}} were not spinning at all. Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.|$|E
5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E
5|$|Downhill it is {{much easier}} to topple over the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> because the incline moves the line of mg closer to f. To try to reduce this {{tendency}} the rider can stand back on the pedals to try to keep m as far back as possible.|$|E
