40|$|Gentlemen: The {{purpose of}} this letter is to advise you that the final report {{regarding}} {{the consequences of a}} potential core <b>flood</b> <b>tank</b> (CFT) line break with offsite power available will not be complete on 12 / 20 / 00 as reported in the Reference letter. The delay is primarily because more extensive plant-specific sensitivity studies than originally planned were needed for both the CFT line break and cold leg pump discharge (CLPD) break analyses. This additional analysis work, coupled with limited resources within FTI and emergent plant operational issues, has delayed the formal completion of the material that will be the basis of the final evaluation report. To date, all analyses have been completed and they are in different stages of the quality assurance (QA) process. The analysis files should be completed by mid-January and a draft report prepared for the B&W utilities to review by mid February. The final report will be sent to the NRC by April 1. The preliminary analysis results (which are preliminary because the QA has not completed) are summarized in the attached discussion. The analyses were performed with the approved ECCS Evaluation Model described in BAW- 10192 PA with a conservative lowe...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this letter is to advise you {{of the results of}} the {{evaluation}} of a potential safety concern (PSC 2 - 00) documented in Reference 1 and reported in Reference 2. The concern relates to the consequences of a potential core <b>flood</b> <b>tank</b> (CFT) line break with offsite power available. Historically, the CFT line break has been analyzed for the B&W designed plant with a loss-of-offsite power (LOOP) at the time of reactor trip. However, with offsite power available, the operators are required (per the emergency operating procedures) to trip the reactor coolant pumps (RCP's) immediately following the loss of subcooling margin (LSCM). The RCP trips have been credited within two minutes following loss of subcooling margin in previously approved analyses. Analyses performed with the approved ECCS Evaluation Model predicted peak cladding temperature increases for several of the B&W designed plants when the RC pumps are powered for the first two minutes following the loss of subcooling margin. FRA-ANP evaluated the SBLOCA Evaluation Model pump degradation model and concluded that it cannot be considered conservative for this two minute RCP trip analysis. Use of a lowe...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the ship added {{resistance}} in regular head waves and at different sea {{states in a}} certain frequency range at different forward speeds was calculated. Calculations were conducted using hydrodynamic software. Since after a maritime accident a damaged ship often has {{to be removed from}} the place where the accident occurred, the seakeeping characteristics of the damaged ship were also calculated. The response of the damaged ship was simulated using two models: damage simulated as an increase in the ship displacement mass and as a <b>flooded</b> <b>tank</b> within the midship area. Calculations are based on the linear potential flow theory and added resistance was determined by the wave drift force as the second order wave load. The quadratic transfer function QTF which describes low-frequency second order wave loads was approximated by its zeroth term only, i. e. by the drift load at incoming wave frequencies. The mean added resistance values of the intact and the damaged ship were compared. The calculation results show that added resistance in waves of the damaged ship with a <b>flooded</b> <b>tank</b> differs slightly from the added resistance in waves of the damaged ship with an increased displacement...|$|R
5000|$|To descend, a bathyscaphe <b>floods</b> air <b>tanks</b> {{with sea}} water, but unlike a {{submarine}} {{the water in}} the <b>flooded</b> <b>tanks</b> cannot be displaced with compressed air to ascend, because the water pressures at the depths for which the craft was designed to operate are too great.

Instead, ballast in the form of iron shot is released to ascend, the shot being lost to the ocean floor. The iron shot containers are in the form of one or more hoppers which are open at the bottom throughout the dive, the iron shot being held in place by an electromagnet at the neck. This is a fail-safe device as it requires no power to ascend; in fact, in the event of a power failure, shot runs out by gravity and ascent is automatic.|$|R

50|$|In general, main {{ballast tanks}} have the Kingston valve atop the tank. This Kingston valve, {{controllable}} both manually and hydraulically, is known {{by some as}} main vent operating gear. Main ballast tanks are in pairs, {{one on each side}} of the boat. One Kingston valve serves a pair, but each tank has a vent riser, with air connections and stop valves in the vent riser. The tank bottom is open to the sea through flood ports. The trapped air in the tank provides positive buoyancy while on the surface, although sea water sloshing in through the flood ports must be removed occasionally from the ballast tank(s) when cruising on the surface by means of low pressure air. The tank is capped by a vent riser, a pipe coming out of the top of the tank that terminates at a Kingston valve. In the vent riser is a valve that when shut, prevents <b>flooding</b> the <b>tank</b> when the submarine is rigged for surface. When the sub is rigged for dive, this valve is opened and <b>flooding</b> the <b>tank</b> becomes an option. Normally, the <b>tank</b> is <b>flooded</b> when the Kingston valve is opened, usually hydraulically from the control room. This Kingston valve then is left open until time to surface comes. This is because a slight leak of air from the air line provided to blow the tank into the vent riser could slowly make the boat more buoyant. When surfacing, the Kingston valve gets shut so the introduced air gets trapped in the tank and pushes the water out the tank's bottom through the flood port. The Kingston valve associated with each ballast tank can be operated manually. The vent riser valves get opened or shut manually during the rig for surface or rig for dive procedure.|$|R
40|$|Some {{storage tank}} {{terminals}} located in hurricane prone regions were heavily struck by hurricanes. An {{example is the}} storage tank terminal of Stolthaven Terminals (Stolt-Nielsen Limited) which is located in New-Orleans and was severely struck by Hurricane Katrina and Isaac. Damage to the terminal was caused by high wind pressures, but mainly due to flooding of the terminal caused by the overflowing levee. The storage tanks did not possess sufficient weight to counterbalance the buoyancy load generated by the flood. Due to this, storage tanks were lifted off their foundation and damage occurred to the bottom plate and the connections. Chemical liquid stored in the tank had now {{found its way into}} the environment. This disaster resulted in high costs and insurance claims from the contamination. The problem can be formulated as: "How can storage tank damage and chemical spill best be prevented during a flood?" Alternative solutions for a <b>flood</b> proof storage <b>tank</b> are presented which are applicable to the still-to-be-built new terminal next to the present terminal. Also a combination of the <b>flood</b> proof <b>tank</b> and management of tank operations is considered. 3 of the alternatives seem structurally feasible and are further elaborated in the report. These are: 1. The use of a steel-concrete-steel sandwich slab (SCS slab) inside the tank. This consists of 2 steel plates connected to a concrete core by means of shear studs. The slab should have sufficient weight to counteract the buoyancy load. [Tank alternative A] 2. Anchoring the area of the bottom plate of the tank to the concrete foundation by means of shear studs. [Tank alternative B] 3. Constructing a floating tank. This tank is provided with guiding piles, which allows the tank to go up and down, but keeps the tank at one location. [Tank alternative C] A simplified cost-benefit-analysis (CBA) is done to compare the alternatives to one of the basic solutions like the floodwall.

25|$|Andrea Doria was {{designed}} with her hull divided into 11 watertight compartments, separated by steel bulkheads which {{ran across the}} width of her hull, rising {{from the bottom of}} the ship's hull up to A Deck. The only openings in the bulkheads were on the bottom deck, where watertight doors were installed for use by the engine crew and could be easily closed in an emergency. Her design specified that if any two adjacent compartments out of any of her 11 watertight compartments were breached, she could remain afloat. In addition, following the rules and guidelines set by the International Conference for Safety of Life at Sea of 1948, Andrea Doria was also designed to take a list, even under the worst imaginable circumstances, no more than 15°. However, the combination of the five <b>flooded</b> <b>tanks</b> on one side and the five empty tanks on the other left Andrea Doria with a list which within a few minutes of the collision exceeded 20°. While the collision itself penetrated only one of Andrea Dorias watertight compartments, the severe list would gradually pull the tops of the bulkheads along the starboard side below the level of the water, allowing seawater to flow down corridors, down stairwells, and any other way it could find into the next compartment in line. In addition, the collision had also torn into an access tunnel which ran from the generator room, which was located in the compartment directly aft of where the collision had happened, to a small room at the forward end of the tank compartment which contained the controls for the pumps for the tanks. It was here that there was a fatal flaw in Andrea Dorias design, as at the point where the tunnel went through the bulkhead separating the two compartments, no watertight door was present. This allowed the generator room to flood rapidly, contributing to not only an increase in flooding, but also to a loss of electricity to the stricken liner.|$|R
40|$|The {{water has}} been used for {{transportation}} for ages. The barge started early {{to become one of the}} most effective methods to perform such an operation. Over the years the floating flat-bottomed structure has been developed until the one we use today which is characterised by its flat bottom and large deck area. An offshore transport can be divided into three phases, each having its own considerations. The first phase may be called on-loading and here the stability is important. The next phase is named the transport. Here the most important aspect is the motion responses of the barge to the physical environmental conditions. Especially the waves give the barge accelerations which may cause movement of the cargo. To prevent this movement seafastening has to be designed to withstand the forces created by the accelerations. The last phase is the off-loading. Here resonance is the main problem. This phenomenon may cause large motions and accelerations and thereby cause the whole operation to be postponed. The stability analysis is used to decide the intact stability and the damaged stability. The results are compared with criteria given in DNV(1996) and Noble Denton (2005). The requirements states whether the operation is secure according to the stability principle. The motion response analysis uses physical environmental conditions given by Noble Denton (2005) to find the accelerations due to the motions. The seafastening need to be designed according to these accelerations to have a secure transport. The case study included in this report is the analyses of stability and motion response of a barge loaded with 4 bridges and 2 towers. The barge is subjected to physical environmental conditions according to the Valhall field in the southern North Sea (Grant, 2005). A program package called SESAM, including the programs GeniE, HydroD and POSTRESP, is used to perform the analyses. The main results give a range of stability of 76, 8 degrees for intact stability and 61, 8 degrees for damaged stability with two adjacent <b>flooded</b> <b>tanks.</b> Both these are on the correct side of the requirements...|$|R

Parts of the RHR system also act to provide low pressure emergency core cooling and are reviewed as described in SRP Section 6. 3. Some parts of the RHR system also provide containment heat removal capability and are reviewed as described in SRP Section 6. 2. 2. The review by RSB is to ensure that the design of the RHR system is In conformance with General Design Criteria 2, 4, 5, 19, and 34. Both PWRs and BWRs have RHR systems which provide long-term cooling once the reactor coolant temperature has been decreased by the main condenser, RCIC, or auxiliary feedwater systems. In both types of plants, the RHR is typically a low pressure system which takes over the shutdown cooling function when the reactor coolant system (RCS) temperature is reduced to about 300 'F. Although the RHR system function is similar for the two types of plants, the system design are different. The RHR system in PWRs takes water from the RCS hot legs, cools it, and pumps it back to the cold legs or core <b>flooding</b> <b>tank</b> nozzles. The suction and discharge lines for the RHR pumps have appropriate valving to assure that the low pressure RHR system is always isolated from the RCS when the reactor coolant pressure is greater than the RHR system design pressure.
