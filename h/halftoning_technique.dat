40|$|Multiscale error {{diffusion}} (MED) digital <b>halftoning</b> <b>technique</b> outperforms classical {{conventional error}} diffusion techniques {{as it can}} produce a directional- hysteresis-free bi-level image. However, extremely large computation effort is required for its implementation. In this paper, a fast MED-based digital <b>halftoning</b> <b>technique</b> is proposed to produce a halftone image without directional hysteresis at a significantly reduced computational cost. The amount of reduction is monotonic increasing with the image size. For an image of size 512 × 512, the proposed algorithm can save 40 % of arithmetic operations as compared with MED. Moreover, since it supports parallel processing, processing time can further be squeezed.

40|$|A <b>halftoning</b> <b>technique</b> {{that uses}} a simple GA {{has proven to be}} very {{effective}} to generate high quality halftone images. Recently, the two major drawbacks of this conventional <b>halftoning</b> <b>technique</b> with GAs, i. e. it uses a substantial amount of computer memory and processing time, have been overcome by using an improved GA (GA-SRM) that applies genetic operators in parallel putting them in a cooperative/competitive stand with each other. The halftoning problem is a true multiobjective optimization problem. However, so far, the GA based halftoning techniques have treated the problem as a single objective optimization problem. In this work, the improved GA-SRM is extended to a multiobjective optimization GA to generate simultaneously halftone images with various combinations of gray level and spatial resolution.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to reconstruct high quality gray-level images from bilevel halftone images. We develop optimal inverse halftoning methods for several commonly used <b>halftone</b> <b>techniques,</b> which include dispersed-dot ordered dither, clustered-dot ordered dither, and error diffusion. At first, the least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive filtering algorithm is applied in the training of inverse halftone filters. The resultant optimal mask shapes are significantly different for various <b>halftone</b> <b>techniques,</b> and these mask shapes are also {{quite different from the}} square shape that was frequently used in the literature. In the next step, we further reduce the computational complexity by using lookup tables designed by the minimum mean square error (MMSE) method. The optimal masks obtained from the LMS method are used as the default filter masks. Finally, we propose the hybrid LMS-MMSE inverse halftone algorithm. It normally uses the MMSE table lookup method for its fast speed. When an empty cell is referred, the LMS method is used to reconstruct the gray-level value. Consequently, the hybrid method has the advantages of both excellent reconstructed quality and fast speed.

We will discuss a general problem of using codes with chosen statistical constrains, for example reproducing given grayscale picture using <b>halftone</b> <b>technique.</b> If both sender and receiver know these constrains, the optimal capacity can be easily approached by entropy coder. The problem is that this time only the sender knows them - we will refer to these scenarios as constrained coding. Kuznetsov and Tsybakov problem in which only the sender knows which bits are fixed {{can be seen as}} a special case, surprisingly approaching the same capacity as if both sides would know the constrains. We will analyze Correction Trees to approach analogous capacity in the general case - use weaker: statistical constrains, what allows to apply them to all bits. Finding satisfying coding is similar to finding the proper correction in error correction problem, but instead of single ensured possibility, there are now statistically expected some.

40|$|As {{the desktop}} {{printing}} market becomes more competitive, {{the demand for}} <b>halftoning</b> <b>techniques</b> that generate very high quality halftones is likely to increase. To achieve {{the highest level of}} print quality, a model based halftoning algorithm such as DBS must be used. This algorithm is an iterative method designed to minimize a metric of error between the grayscale original and halftone image. This metric incorporates a model for the human visual system (HVS) and the printer used to render the image. Unfortunately, this type of algorithm is required to employ an ad-hoc optimization strategy to solve this inherently nonlinear problem. As a result, these algorithms are extremely difficult to analyze. In addition, they are more computationally intensive than conventional <b>halftoning</b> <b>techniques,</b> and therefore less practical. ^ First, DBS is analyzed to show why the algorithm produces halftones which exhibit high quality textures. This analysis {{is referred to as the}} Dual interpretation of DBS. Here, we have been able to establish that all halftones generated by DBS are guaranteed to satisfy a set of perceptually based performance criteria. Then, this analysis is applied to the design of dispersed dot screen functions. We compare and contrast DBS and Void-and-Cluster, two popular approaches for designing dither arrays. Next, we focus our attention on reducing the computational complexity of DBS. This effort includes a technique for implementing DBS on platforms with limited computing resources. Lastly, a perceptually based technique for sharpening images is provided. This approach is a direct outgrowth of the use of visual models in our prior work. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{robustness}} {{of three}} digital <b>halftoning</b> <b>techniques</b> are simulated for a hypothetical electrophotographic laser printer subjected to dynamic environmental conditions over a copy run of one thousand images. Mathematical electrophotographic models have primarily concentrated on solid area reproductions under time-invariant conditions. The models {{used in this}} study predict the behavior of complex image distributions at various stages in the electrophotographic process. The system model is divided into seven subsystems: Halftoning, Laser Exposure, Photoconductor Discharge, Toner Development, Transfer, Fusing, and Image Display. Spread functions associated with laser spot intensity, charge migration, and toner transfer and fusing are used to predict the electrophotographic system response for continuous and halftone reproduction. Many digital <b>halftoning</b> <b>techniques</b> have been developed for converting from continuous-tone to binary (halftone) images. The general objective of halftoning is to approximate the intermediate gray levels of continuous tone images with a binary (black-and-white) imaging system. Three major <b>halftoning</b> <b>techniques</b> currently used are Ordered-Dither, Cluster-Dot, and Error Diffusion. These halftoning algorithms are included in the simulation model. Simulation in electrophotography can be used to better understand the relationship between electrophotographic parameters and image quality, and to observe the effects of time-variant degradation on electrophotographic parameters and materials. Simulation programs, written in FORTRAN and SLAM (Simulation Language Alternative Modeling), have been developed to investigate the effects of system degradation on halftone image quality. The programs have been designed for continuous simulation to characterize the behavior or condition of the electrophotographic system. The simulation language provides the necessary algorithms for obtaining values for the variables described by the time-variant equations, maintaining a history of values during the simulation run, and reporting statistical information on time-dependent variables. Electrophotographic variables associated with laser intensity, initial photoconductor surface voltage, and residual voltage are degraded over a simulated run of one thousand copies. These results are employed to predict the degraded electrophotographic system response and to investigate the behavior of the various <b>halftone</b> <b>techniques</b> under dynamic system conditions. Two techniques have been applied to characterize halftone image quality: Tone Reproduction Curves are used to characterize and record the tone reproduction capability of an electrophotographic system over a simulated copy run. Density measurements are collected and statistical inferences drawn using SLAM. Typically the sharpness of an image is characterized by a system modulation transfer function (MTF). The mathematical models used to describe the subsystem transforms of an electrophotographic system involve non-linear functions. One means for predicting this non-linear system response is to use a Chirp function as the input to the model and then to compare the reproduced modulation to that of the original. Since the imaging system is non-linear, the system response cannot be described by an MTF, but rather an Input Response Function. This function was used to characterize the robustness of halftone patterns at various frequencies. Simulated images were also generated throughout the simulation run and used to evaluate image sharpness and resolution. The data, generated from each of the electrophotographic simulation models, clearly indicates that image stability and image sharpness is not influenced by dot orientation, but rather by the type of halftoning operation used. Error-Diffusion is significantly more variable than Clustered-Dot and Dispersed-Dot at low to mid densities. However, Error-Diffusion is significantly less variable than the ordered dither patterns at high densities. Also, images generated from Error-Diffusion are sharper than those generated using Clustered-Dot and Dispersed-Dot techniques, but the resolution capability of each of the techniques remained the same and degraded equally for each simulation run...|$|R
