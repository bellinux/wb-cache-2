As soon as this happened, he cut Gruban out of the company, leaving him destitute, and eventually arranged for him to be interned. Gruban successfully appealed against the internment, and brought Booth to court.|$|E
5|$|Following the Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Drljević began {{cooperating with the}} Italian authorities occupying Montenegro. In July, he proclaimed the reestablishment of the Kingdom of Montenegro, but his attempt to establish an Axis-aligned puppet state triggered an immediate uprising. That September, Italian authorities sent him to an internment camp in Italy after the oubreak of an anti-fascist revolt. Drljević escaped the camp several months later and made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the German-held half of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). In the summer of 1944, he created the Montenegrin State Council in Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|Fulham {{completed}} the loan signing of Holtby on 31 January 2014, concluding the deal {{prior to the}} transfer window closing. Upon joining Fulham, Holtby told the club's official website that he was motivated to help them survive relegation and play <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Germany's 2014 FIFA World Cup squad. He made his debut the following day and played the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 defeat at home to Southampton.

5|$|When Cleomenes {{heard about}} the revolt at Argos, he sent his {{stepfather}} with 2,000 men to try and save the situation. Megistonous was killed while assaulting the city, however, and the relief force retreated, leaving the Spartans in the citadel to continue resistance. Cleomenes abandoned his much stronger position at the Isthmus {{for fear of being}} encircled and left Corinth to {{fall into the hands of}} Antigonus. Cleomenes advanced his troops upon Argos and forced <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the city, rescuing the men stuck in the citadel. He retreated to Mantinea when he saw Antigonus' army on the plain outside the city.|$|E

Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard's animatronic cigarette lighter, shoots the second from a basement up through a pipe drain when the latter leans over the sink and, ordered to finish quickly, blasts <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the third's office and escapes on an advertising balloon. Misako then appears at his door and offers him a nearly impossible contract to kill a foreigner, which he cannot refuse having just been told the plan.|$|E
5|$|After a {{slow start}} to the {{historic}} campaign, Loxton struck form midway through the English summer and forced <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the team {{for the last three}} Tests. He played a prominent role in the Fourth Test, scoring an aggressive and counterattacking 93 that helped Australia pry the initiative from England; the tourists eventually won the match. In 1949–50, Loxton cemented his position in the national team, playing in all five Tests in South Africa and scoring his only century at international level. He remained a regular member of the Test team until a form slump during the 1950–51 home season; he was dropped after three Tests against England and never played for Australia again. Loxton continued to play for Victoria in domestic competition until retiring {{at the end of the}} 1957–58 season.|$|E

5|$|After scoring 66 {{times in}} 113 {{appearances}} for Basingstoke Town, McAllister {{moved to the}} Conference National outfit Stevenage Borough on a bosman transfer in May 2004. He debuted after being introduced as a 33rd-minute substitute in a 1–0 victory at home to Crawley Town on 16 October 2004. McAllister struggled to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the first-team, and was loaned to fellow Conference National club Gravesend & Northfleet on 14 December, debuting four days later in a 1–0 defeat away to Hereford United. He went on to score his first goal for Gravesend & Northfleet after just two minutes in a 1–1 draw away to Crawley Town on 26 December, and this was followed up with a goal in the following match, a 2–2 draw at home to Accrington Stanley. McAllister completed the loan spell with two goals from five appearances, before rejoining his former club Eastleigh on loan {{until the end of}} 2004–05.|$|E
5|$|Bond boards Krest's {{ship the}} Wavekrest and foils Sanchez's latest drug shipment, {{stealing}} five {{million dollars in}} the process. He discovers that Sharkey has been killed by Sanchez's henchmen. Bond meets and teams up with Pam Bouvier, an ex-CIA agent and pilot, at a Bimini bar, and journeys {{with her to the}} Republic of Isthmus. He finds <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Sanchez's employment by posing as an assassin for hire. Two Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau officers foil Bond's attempt to assassinate Sanchez and take him to an abandoned warehouse. They are joined by Fallon, an MI6 agent who was sent by M to apprehend Bond. Sanchez's men rescue him and kill the officers, believing them to be the assassins. Later, with the aid of Bouvier, Q, and Sanchez's girlfriend Lupe Lamora, Bond frames Krest by planting the $5 million in the Wavekrest. Sanchez kills Krest via a decompression chamber and admits Bond into his inner circle.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{made his}} debut on 23 August, in a 2–1 defeat to Gillingham at The Darlington Arena. He scored his first goal for Darlington in a 2–1 win against Port Vale on 13 September. Manager Dave Penney praised Burgmeier {{for the start}} he made to the club, both as a goal scorer and creator, which also helped him to play <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the {{affections}} of the club's supporters. When Burgmeier won his 49thcap for Liechtenstein against Wales, it was his fourth in the two months since he joined Darlington. It took him past the club record three caps of Canadian Jason de Vos and New Zealander Adrian Webster, with a coach-load of Darlington fans there to see him play at the Millennium Stadium. His next cap clashed with Darlington's FA Cup first round replay with Conference North-side Droylsden, {{in which they were}} defeated.|$|E

5|$|Feit did {{not feel}} {{comfortable}} with the monastic lifestyle at Assumption Abbey. He was sent to Jemez Springs, New Mexico, to a treatment retreat for troubled priests run by the Servants of the Paraclete. Feit joined the order as a staff member and worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> a supervisory role at the center. Father James Porter came to the center after {{he was known to}} have begun molesting children in the 1960s, and Feit cleared him for placement in another parish. Porter was later defrocked and imprisoned after abusing as many as 100 children. Feit left the priesthood in the 1970s. He got married, moved to the Phoenix area, and had three children. He worked at the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul as a food charity volunteer for 17 years.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus' {{divisions}} met {{up to the}} north, and ravaged {{the countryside}} between the Ems and the Lippe, and penetrated to the Teutoburg Forest, a mountain forest in Western Germany situated between these two rivers. There, Germanicus {{and some of his}} men visited the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, and began burying the remains of the Roman soldiers that had been left in the open. After half a day of the work, he called off the burial of bones so that they could continue their war against the Germans. He made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the heartland of the Cherusci. At a location Tacitus calls the pontes longi ("long causeways"), in boggy lowlands somewhere near the Ems, Arminius' troops attacked the Romans. Arminius initially caught Germanicus' cavalry in a trap, inflicting minor casualties, but the Roman infantry reinforced the rout and checked them. The fighting lasted for two days, with neither side achieving a decisive victory. Germanicus' forces withdrew and returned to the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|He {{kept his}} place, but in November, an injury {{sustained}} against Mallorca {{was diagnosed as}} a bruised kidney and fractured vertebrae, which kept him out for some weeks, during which time Zé Castro forced <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> consideration as a starter. In January 2007, Pablo marked his 100th game for the club with a rare goal to earn a draw with Racing Santander, and completed the season with 24 league games. He helped the club qualify for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup via the Intertoto Cup, and retained a regular spot in the starting eleven as Atlético finished fourth {{in the league and}} qualified for the Champions League, but mistakes in the Madrid derby in January 2008 led to both Real's goals and rekindled the fans' hostility.|$|E
