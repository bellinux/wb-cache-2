The ship was designed to meet precise deepening requirements around the dockyard and port installations and in riverine or other places where deepening is needed. The ship which can hold upto 300 cubic metres or 500 tons of dredged material, has a set of 8 openable hopper bottom doors for disposal of dredged material out at sea. The main equipment of the ship is a 320-HP Cummins-855-powered forward-mounted crane supplied by Titagarth Wagons. The crane’s 15.2-meter boom has a working radius of 12 meters and <b>hoisting</b> <b>capacity</b> of 10.5 metric tons at a 46-degree boom angle.

50|$|The south quay of {{the dock}} was entirely {{equipped}} for coal export, with seven coal <b>hoists,</b> with <b>capacity</b> of 400 tons per hour. Extensive sidings were built mainly to the south {{of the dock}}, with inbound storage available for 8,000 (loaded) coal wagons, and outbound storage for 3500 wagons. The northwestern arm was initially built as a timber pond, with adjacent rail sidings. Coal hoists were hydraulically powered, supplied by gravity sidings carried across sidings by ferro-concrete bridges built by the Yorkshire Hennebique Contracting Company (Leeds). Six of the hoists were supplied by W.G. Armstrong Whitworth and Company; the seventh, a movable hoist was supplied by Tannet, Walker and Company (Leeds). The north quay of the southwestern arm was used for pig iron handling, and was equipped with ten movable cranes from Armstrong Whitworth of lifting capacity of 5 or 3 tons, and a fixed crane with lifting capacity of up to 50 tons. Further cranes from Cowans, Sheldon and Company (Carlisle) were supplied for the transit sheds.|$|R

40|$|Counterfeit {{equipment}} {{is becoming a}} major threat to nuclear safety globally. The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) in India housing two VVER- 1000 reactors, imported from Russia is being delayed because of counterfiet, substandard and obsolete equitpment. The polar crane, the limb of the reactor, is defective as its <b>hoisting</b> <b>capacity</b> is less than 80 % of its nameplate capacity. The crane is used for installing the equipment inside the reactor building and also for removing spent fuel. The contract said {{that there will be no}} weld in the beltline of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). The received vessels have two circumferential welds on the beltline. RPV, the heart of the reactor is irreplaceable and hence determines the life of the reactor. RPV and polar crane are safety grade equipment. The core-damage frequency (CDF) of the reactor in the contract was 10 − 7 reactor-years, while the supplied reactor has a CDF of 10 − 5 reactor-years. Two units of generator transformers were received as damaged and these were dismantled and reassembled at the site.

40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} multipurpose engineering machine on the wheeled chassis was presented in the paper. The machine meets a series of specific requirements such as: off-road prowess, ability of movement with high speed on hard-surface roads, limited weight and dimensions at the maintaining of great <b>hoisting</b> <b>capacity.</b> These requirements were adjusted to the present character of warfare {{and that is why}} the machine construction deviates from classic working machines being used in the civil sector. The meeting of defined requirements required the development of innovative methods. The solution aiming at the increasing the stability of the machine by the application of using a sliding drive unit was described. As a result of that, the increased capacity and efficiency of mined materials were obtained. Additionally, the system of two telescopic arms was applied, so that the efficiency was improved by the shortening of machine working cycles and it is possible to change the length of arms as well as both telescopic arms were placed on the rotating body achieving in such a manner the big workspace for arms. The 3 D model of a multipurpose engineering machine and model with rear mounted drive unit and raised and extended arms are presented in the pape...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} the {{developments}} of the offshore wind industry in terms of water depth and turbine size, {{the objective of the}} research presented in this paper is to gain insight in the applicability limits of the monopile support structure for large offshore wind turbines. This is done by demonstrating how the mass of the rotor nacelle assembly (RNA) of a turbine influences the design of monopile support structures. A fictitious 5 MW class wind turbine with 126 m rotor diameter is used as reference case. The typical RNA mass of existing turbines in this class is around 400 tons. Here, the RNA mass is varied between 100 and 750 tons. For each variation, a design of the monopile is created with a first natural frequency of 0. 29 Hz. The results are given in terms of mass, pile diameter and soil penetration depth for water depths of 30 m and 50 m. These are projected against the current industry limits for the production of monopiles and <b>hoisting</b> <b>capacity</b> on installation vessels. Furthermore, it is shown above which prestress of the RNA mass the size of the support structure is significantly influenced. The combined results substantiate that the monopile will remain the choice support structure type in coming years and that RNA mass reduction leads to significant economic gain for wind farm developers. Additionally, a solution which offers further perspective to the application of the monopile is briefly discussed. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
