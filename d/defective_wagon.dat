25|$|D 5146 was hauling {{a freight}} train that was derailed near Weedon, Northamptonshire on 1 April 1963. The {{accident}} was due to a <b>defective</b> <b>wagon.</b> An express passenger train collided with the derailed wagons.|$|E
50|$|A cottage {{was built}} on the {{opposite}} side of the line near to the road crossing and the box. Consequently, the signal box had to be high enough to give a view over it. There were two sidings on the up side behind the station building, with a loading dock and goods shed, and, in the opposite direction, beside the up line there were two long sidings. On the other side of the road crossing towards Stamford a further siding catered for a dairy. A milk train would arrive from Rugby at about 3.30 in the morning, returning empty at 5.00 a.m. Welford also proved handy for parking <b>defective</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
