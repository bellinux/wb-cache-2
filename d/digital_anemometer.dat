40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to know the relationship among environmental factors and the behavior of Hedypathes betulinus (Klug, 1825) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in erva-mate, being the observations accomplished in the municipal districts of Ilópolis(RS) and Catanduvas (SC). The eight year old sampled crops were homogeneous, spacing of 1. 5 m x 2. 0 m and area of 15 and 20 ha, respectively. It was accomplished six days of observations in Ilópolis (RS), in February, 2001, and three days in Catanduvas (SC) in March, 2001, made in hour by hour, along the day. The observed environmental factors were: temperature (°C), air relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s) and light intensity (Klux), through a thermohigraph and <b>digital</b> <b>anemometer,</b> and a luximeter. With relationship to the behavioral aspects, they were observed: mating (C), oviposition (P), feeding act (A), male keeping the female (MGF), alone insect (PS) and insect in movement (EM). The results were interpreted through the pathy analysis, where the air relative humidity, followed by {{the speed of the}} wind speed, light intensity and temperature, in decreasing order, they interacted with the several behavior aspects of Hedypathes betulinus. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Sound {{attenuation}} {{is done by}} active {{sound attenuator}} or by passive sound attenuator. In case of active sound attenuation the anti-noise source is used to reduce the intensity of noise however, in passive sound attenuation various types of sound absorbing porous materials are used to absorb sound energy. In passive sound attenuators the {{substantial portion of the}} mechanical pressure wave penetrates to the pores before encountering to the solid surface. Large number of interactions takes place and the energy is transferred to the solid structure through the frictional losses and the sound intensity is reduced. Passive sound attenuator is used in Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) duct to reduce the sound produced by the blower. Two porous materials of different sound absorbing coefficients are used in the attenuator. This passive attenuator is specifically designed to study the effect at low sound frequency. Frequency of sound is measured with the help of Lab VIEW software. Intensity of sound is measured using digital decibel (dB) meter. To measure the pressure drop <b>digital</b> <b>anemometer</b> is used. Along with the combination of porous materials the effect of thickness of porous absorber and the angle of porous absorbers with the direction of air stream is studied...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{wind energy}} {{is an effort}} to comply the {{electricity}} needs. Therefore, the conversion system of wind into electrical energy is very important to support it. This research discusses the system of horizontal axis wind turbine with various blades number (3, 4 and 5) referring to NACA 4415. This experiment has been performed in Pandansimo beach, Yogyakarta. The research was started by assembling all components of wind turbines such as tower, yaw drive, steering head and turbine blades. Blade components were made by iron plate with a thickness of 2 mm and diameter of 2. 85 m. Data was collected by measured tool such as <b>anemometer,</b> <b>digital</b> tachometer and data logger. The anemometer was installed at the same height of wind turbine. Performance of wind turbine with-and-without load was investigated by measuring current, voltage, and power. The results show that, the wind speed affects the rotation of wind turbines. The higher wind speed the higher round wind turbines. Investigation of wind turbine without load generates the highest level of power when using 3 blades configuration. Whilst, the highest level of power for wind turbine with load can be achieved using 5 blades configuration. Besides, the construction of wind turbines with 5 blades also produces the highest power coefficient up to twice that of two other blade variations...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} need {{to study}} insect flight behaviour in the natural environment {{has led to the}} development of a relatively inex- pensive remote sensing instrument (IRADIT). Flying insects dfferentay iumjmted, under a light cmations, in a intense ba of pulsed near infra-red radiation and detected using a gated image intensifier - CIV system at a rate of 5 OHz. This thesis details the methods employed for extracting insect oo-ordinates from the' CI video signals, 'using low~oost electronic circuits ad micro computer (Apple II+), and for the immediate analysis and display of two-dimensional insect flight trajectories, whilst rejecting environmental and system noise. Flight trajectories are often dominated by the immediate local wind. A new low-cost sensitive three dimensional <b>digital</b> <b>anemometer</b> system hs be developed for use with the IRADIT system, providing the data required to allow the vector wind to b immediately subtracted and interesting aspects of flight behaviour to b revealed. The IRADIT - Anemometer system ws tested i the field, on insects above wheat. _ Small insects with membzßanous wing areas as small as 5 mm 2 were readily detected and tracked over distances of the order of l at ranges up t 15 m against a mid-day sky background. Subse- quent computer analysis of stored insect track and wind data oonfirmed that the effects of immediate local wind cn b smdied or canoelled out. Examples of insect flight behaviour are described.

40|$|In {{this study}} a flat plate solar air heater with a shallow duct is {{analyzed}} experimentally. The collector {{consists of a}} 4. 5 m long air duct with a (20 × 5) cm cross-sectional area. The air duct consists of four channels so that the collector becomes more compact. The collector is studied under the weather conditions of Hilla city – Iraq with latitude and longitude equal 32. 3 ° N and 44. 25 ° E respectively and it is tilted by 45 ° with the horizontal plane. The effect of the {{air mass flow rate}} on the collector performance is also studied. The performance of the collector is analyzed with and without porous media stuffing. The measured parameters are the air and absorber temperatures, air speed and pressure drop. The temperatures are measured by means of type (K) thermocouples as this type covers the temperature range of the studied system. The values of the temperature are displayed by temperature data logger devices. The air speed and pressure drop are measured by <b>digital</b> <b>anemometer</b> and manometer devices respectively. The results of the studied system show that as the air mass flow rate increases, the temperature of both the flowing air and the absorber decrease, whilst the efficiency of the collector increases. The results also show that the addition of the steel wool porous material inside the air duct increases the temperature of both the flowing air and the absorber, and by that increases the efficiency of the collector. The porous media also caused an increase in the pressure drop between the outlet air and the atmosphere. This pressure drop increased with the increase in the air mass flow rat...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{experimentally}} {{the effects}} of hydrogen addition in the intake manifold of a diesel generator operating with a 7 % biodiesel-diesel oil blend (B 7). An experimental apparatus setup was used to conduct performance and emissions tests in a single cylinder, air cooled diesel engine. This setup consisted of a generator set connected to a wirewound resistor load bank {{that was used to}} vary engine load. In addition, a flowmeter was used to determine hydrogen volumetric flowrate and a <b>digital</b> <b>anemometer</b> coupled with an air box to measure air flowrate. Furthermore, a digital precision electronic scale was used to measure engine fuel consumption and a gas analyzer was used to determine exhaust gas composition and exhaust gas temperature. A thermopar was installed near the exhaust collection to measure cylinder temperature. In-cylinder pressure was measured using an AVL Indumicro data acquisition system with a piezoelectric pressure sensor. An AVL optical encoder was installed in the crankshaft and synchronized with in-cylinder pressure in real time. The experimental procedure consisted of injecting hydrogen into the engine intake manifold at different mass concentrations of 2, 6, 8 and 10 % of total fuel mass (B 7 + hydrogen), which represented energy fractions of 5, 15, 20 and 24 % of total fuel energy respectively. Due to hydrogen addition, the total amount of fuel energy introduced increased and the generators fuel injection governor prevented any increases of engine speed. Several conclusions can be stated from the test results. A reduction in specific fuel consumption as a function of hydrogen concentration increase was noted. Likewise, carbon dioxide emissions (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) decreased as hydrogen concentration increased. On the other hand, nitrogen oxides emissions (NOx) increased due to average temperatures inside the cylinder being higher. There was also an increase in peak cylinder pressure and heat release rate inside the cylinder, since the fuel ignition delay was smaller due to hydrogen content increase. All this indicates that hydrogen promotes faster combustion and higher heat release rates and can be an important additive to all kind of fuels used in diesel generators...|$|E
