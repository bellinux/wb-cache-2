500|$|Since 1996, when MLS {{teams were}} first {{included}} in the tournament, the home team had won nine times and lost only twice in the final match. Commenting on what his team brings to the game, Sounders FC coach Sigi Schmid stated, [...] "We bring a clean slate. We haven't had any negative experiences in championship games, {{so we want to}} just build up a positive legacy for our team and we <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance to make some history for our team. Every player knows that and that's something we want to try and do." [...] D.C. United had previously won the U.S. Open Cup twice in 1996 and 2008 and this was their fourth appearance ever in the tournament final. D.C. United president Kevin Payne simply stated, [...] "We want to win anything we enter." ...|$|E
500|$|Byrne {{has written}} for Wired, {{outlining}} {{the relative merits of}} different distribution models with this one reflecting his [...] "self-distributionmodel" [...] in which [...] "the artist stands to receive the largest percentage of income from sales per unit—sales of anything. A larger percentage of fewer sales, most likely, but not always. Artists doing it for themselves can actually make more money than the massive popstar, even though the sales numbers may seem minuscule by comparison." [...] The motivation for creating and marketing this album directly came in part from the very article Byrne wrote as well as Eno's belief that music fans want more than just the music on an album and prefer collectible deluxe editions as well as the live performances that promote them. A month after releasing the album, Byrne was skeptical of market saturation claiming [...] "I sense {{that a lot of people}} don't <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> record out" [...] and hoped to counterbalance that ignorance with his tour. He also described the digital music market as [...] "so infinite [...] it's easy for music to get lost out there" [...] and has noted that this business model would not work for performers who are not already established.|$|E
500|$|Feige {{stated that}} Steve Rogers would be paired with other {{characters}} from The Avengers like Black Widow and Nick Fury, because unlike Tony Stark and Thor, who {{could return to}} their own supporting casts, Rogers had nowhere else to go, [...] "and it just made sense {{that he was the}} one that stayed with what remains of the Avengers at the end of the film." [...] The writers considered including Hawkeye, but [...] "he didn't have enough to do and suddenly it seemed like we were giving him short shrift", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow, and Joe Russo added that Jeremy Renner's schedule could not be worked out for him to appear. As to why the Red Skull from The First Avenger did not appear in The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo explained, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> guy in a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for Cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Certainly Hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something interesting about the fact that his legacy outlived the skull. And they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him." ...|$|E

60|$|For I cannot {{approve of}} their way of refining, who corrupt our English idiom by mixing it too much with French: That is a sophistication of {{language}} not an improvement of it; a turning English into French, rather than a refining of English by French. We meet daily with those fops, who value themselves on their travelling, and pretend they cannot express their meaning in English, because they would put off to us some French phrase of the last edition; without considering, that, for aught they <b>know,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better of our own. But {{these are not the}} men who are to refine us; their talent is to prescribe fashions, not words: at best, they are only serviceable to a writer, so as Ennius was to Virgil.

They've probably never seen any heavenly body at all except the blazing sun. How are they to know there is another world? What does it matter to them if they do? Well, even if they have had a glimpse of a few stars, or even of the earth crescent, what of that? Why should people living inside a planet trouble to observe that sort of thing?

5000|$|However, the {{relationship}} with EOne ended {{by the end of}} 2012, due to 'lack of commitment' from the label, according to Weeks, who stated in November 2013: [...] "The last album <b>we</b> <b>had,</b> our label didn't even promote it.

6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Mrs. Carnegie, the mother, {{from the}} head of the table, [...] "you've no idea how curiously their two lives have always resembled one other. When they were babies, they were so much alike that we had to tie red and blue ribbons round their necks to {{distinguish}} them. Ernest was red and Harold blue--no, Ernest was blue and Harold red: at least, I'm not quite certain which way it was, but I <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> note of it in the family Bible, for Mr. Carnegie made it at the time for fear we should get confused between them when we were bathing them. So we put the ribbons on the moment they were christened, and never took them both off together for a second, even to bathe them, so as to prevent accidents. Well, do you know, dear, from the time they were babies, they were always alike in everything; but Ernest was always a fortnight before Harold. He said [...] "Mamma" [...] one day, and just a fortnight later Harold said the very same word. Then Ernest said [...] "sugar," [...] and so did Harold in another fortnight. Ernest began to toddle a fortnight the earliest. They took the whooping cough and the measles in the same order; and they cut all their teeth so, too, the same teeth first on each side, and just at a fortnight's distance from one another. It's really quite an extraordinary coincidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{had been}} {{six years in}} America, which he adored, because, he said, he had got work and earned his living there the very day he landed. That was in Boston, where he turned his hand first to one thing and then another, and came away at last through some call home, honoring and loving the Americans as the kindest, the noblest, the friendliest people in the world. I tried, politely, to persuade him {{that we were not}} all of us all he thought us, but he would not yield, and at one place he generously claimed a pre-eminence in wickedness for his fellow-Neapolitans. That was when we came to a vast, sorrowful prison, from which an iron cage {{projected}} into the street. Around this cage wretched women and children and old men clustered till the prisoners dear to them were let into it from the jail and allowed to speak with them. The scene was as public as all of life and death is in Naples, and the publicity seemed to give it peculiar sadness, which I noted to our guide. He owned its pathos; [...] "but," [...] he said, [...] "you <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> terrible class of people here in Naples." [...] I protested that there were terrible classes of people everywhere, even in America. He would not consent entirely, but in partly convincing each other we became better friends. He had a large black mustache and gentle black eyes, and he spoke very fair English, which, when he wished to be most impressive, he dropped and used a very literary Italian instead. He showed us where he lived, on a hill-top back of our gardened quay, and said that he paid twelve dollars a month for a tenement of five rooms there. Schooling is compulsory in Naples, but he sends his boy willingly, and has him especially study English as the best provision he can make for him--as heir of his own calling of cicerone, perhaps. He has a little farm at Bavello, which he tills when it is past the season for cultivating foreigners in Naples; he expects to spend his old age there; and I thought it not a bad lookout. He was perfectly well-mannered, and at a hotel where we stopped for tea he took his coffee at our table unbidden, like any American fellow-man. He and the landlord had their joke together, the landlord warning me against him in English as [...] "very bad man," [...] and clapping him affectionately on the shoulder to emphasize the irony. We did not demand too much social information of him; all the more we valued the gratuitous fact that the Neapolitan nobles were now rather poor, because they preferred a life of pleasure to a life of business. I could have told him that the American nobles were increasingly like them in their love of pleasure, but I would not have known how to explain that they were not poor also. He was himself a moderate in politics, but he told us, {{what seems to be the}} fact everywhere in Italy, that singly the largest party in Naples is the Socialist party.|$|E
