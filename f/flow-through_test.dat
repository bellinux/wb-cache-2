40|$|Bioconcentration factor testing {{serves as}} the most {{valuable}} surrogate {{for the assessment of}} bioaccumulation. The assessment of potentially harmful chemicals is crucial to not only the health of aquatic environments, but to humans as well. Chemicals that possess the ability to persist in the environment or that have the potential to bioaccumulate, pose a greater risk to organisms that are exposed to these chemicals. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Guideline 305 outlines specific protocols to run an accurate and reliable aquatic <b>flow-through</b> <b>test.</b> However, since its adoption in 1996, very few changes have been made to accommodate the endeavor to lowering the amount of test species to run one of these said tests. Running an aquatic <b>flow-through</b> <b>test,</b> according to 305, takes much time and money as well as numerous amounts of fish.

In 2012, the dietary fish test {{has been added}} to the OECD TG 305 to provide a bioaccumulation test for substances that cannot be tested by aqueous exposure. For highly hydrophobic substances the dietary test is recommended, provided that the test is consistent with the relevant regulatory framework and risk assessment needs [4]. The dietary approach yields both a biomagnification factor (BMF) and an elimination rate constant for the chemical in focus. However, defined regulatory cut-off criteria for the biomagnification potential of chemical compounds are still missing and question the benefit of the BMF approach for the regulatory application. Being able to estimate a BCF from the data generated in the dietary study would meet the regulatory need and justify the use of animals. However, apart from the available depuration rate constant, the calculation of kinetic BCF also requires a corresponding uptake rate constant, which cannot be estimated in dietary bioaccumulation studies. The uptake rate constant derived in a <b>flow-through</b> <b>test</b> refers to the uptake via the gills whereas the elimination rate constant is considered to be the same in both test system, irrespectively of the exposure route (dietary or aqueous).

In brief, the use of the standard BCF test following OECD TG 305 has been demonstrated to generate reliable results with aquatic exposure for the majority of neutral, lipophilic organic substances. In addition, using column generated concentrations and keeping the total organic carbon in the test system as low as possible, <b>flow-through</b> <b>tests</b> can be also carried out with highly lipophilic test items (HOCs)SPME measurements used for the extraction of freely dissolved concentrations can provide important insights into the presence of molecules bound to organic matter and thus the bioavailability of HOCs in <b>flow-through</b> <b>tests.</b> Consequently the recommendation of SPME for measuring aqueous HOC concentrations has been included in the revised OECD TG 305. The elimination half-life (EL 0.5) might be considered as a potential metric which could harmonise the different bioaccumulation metrics. The prediction of bioaccumulation by in vitro approaches such as fish S 9 liver fractions and primary hepatocytes shows high potential to reduce the need for animal testing. Alternatively, bioconcentration studies with the freshwater invertebrate H. azteca may support animal welfare considerations using a non-vertebrate species. Physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) models can improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms bioaccumulation processes and reduce uncertainty of regulatory decision in the future. Organism–water and tissue–water partitioning coefficients for many neutral chemicals can be accurately predicted by combination of compositional information and PP-LFER models. In contrast, sorption of ions is complex and still not well understood. The use of the model COSMOmic in combination with optimised membrane dipole potentials is recommended for charged compounds. The use of new screening criteria for non-lipid accumulating substances may help to identify such compounds which pose a risk for bioaccumulation. The acquisition of information on bioaccumulation/biomagnification potential and the mechanisms involved as well as the potential to reduce the need for vertebrate testing should be explored further at all levels, and incorporated into a comprehensive testing and assessment strategy that goes beyond a mere bioconcentration factor. Concluding, we strongly recommend that the proposed amendments will be considered for implementation into the current and future guidance documents.|$|R

This method simulates the leaching process of the S/S hazardous waste disposed under a particular landfill condition when the S/S waste is more permeable than its surrounding materials or when the deterioration of the solidified waste form has reached a state that ground water can flow-through the waste via the porosity system of the S/S waste matrix. This paper describes a study on the long-term performance of the cement-based S/S heavy metal wastes using a <b>flow-through</b> leaching <b>test</b> method. Two series of leaching tests with different synthetic heavy metal waste samples were carried out. The S/S samples were made from five types of heavy metals with two kinds of binders. The metals were Pb 2 +, Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Ni 2 + (positive ions as nitrates), and Cr 6 + (a negative ion as potassium dichromate), and the binders were type I ordinary portland cement (OPC) and pulverised fuel ash (PFA). The model developed by Godbee and Joy for simulating the leaching behavior was modified to estimate the diffusivity parameter in this study.

Previous results were reported in Bourcier (1999). Two types of tests are in progress: (1) tests of baseline pyrochlore-based multiphase ceramics; and (2) tests of single-phase pyrochlore, zirconolite, and brannerite (the three phases that will contain most of the actinides). Tests of the multi-phase material are all being run at 25 C. The single-phase tests are being run at 25, 50, and 75 C. All tests are being performed at ambient pressure. The as-made bulk compositions of the ceramics are given in Table 1. The single pass <b>flow-through</b> <b>test</b> procedure [Knauss, 1986 No. 140] allows the powdered ceramic to react with pH buffer solutions traveling upward vertically through the powder. Gentle rocking {{during the course of}} the experiment keeps the powder suspended and avoids clumping, and allows the system to behave as a continuously stirred reactor. For each test, a cell is loaded with approximately one gram of the appropriate size fraction of powdered ceramic and reacted with a buffer solution of the desired pH.

40|$|Novel active {{pharmaceutical}} {{ingredients are}} often poorly water-soluble. Such compounds may only partially dissolve or may precipitate during intestinal passage, potentially leading to incomplete drug absorption. Despite {{the importance of}} the process, the underlying in vivo as well as in vitro drug-precipitation mechanisms remain poorly understood. Several formulation principles, including lipid-based formulations, have been introduced to prevent drug precipitation in the gastro-intestinal tract. However, in vitro performance testing of these formulations is a topic of ongoing scientific discussions. Reliable in vitro tests as well as suitable monitoring tools to better analyze in vitro solubilization, precipitation, as well as lipolysis processes in the gastro-intestinal tract are required. In the present thesis, dispersion, dissolution, precipitation, and lipolysis processes are discussed. We compared the results obtained with a paddle apparatus with those from a physiologically motivated flow-through cell taking lipolysis into consideration, using lipid-based formulations of a weakly acidic drug (Biopharmaceutics Classification System Class II). We tested pure indomethacin and the drug-containing self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) using pure aqueous buffers and biorelevant media. The results of these dispersion/precipitation tests showed generally increased solubility of indomethacin in the SMEDDS compared with the solubility of the pure drug. One of the SMEDDS was superior compared to the others regarding the solubilizing capacity. This was demonstrated only in the <b>flow-through</b> <b>test</b> and dispersion in hydrochloric acid (0. 1 ?N?HCl). However, these results must be interpreted {{in the light of the}} lipolysis test showing that the observed differences in solubilization were not based on lipolysis. We concluded that suitable characterization of SMEDDS involving an acidic drug should include a physiologically motivated <b>flow-through</b> <b>test</b> or dispersion/precipitation test in acidic environment, together with a lipolysis test. We studied the effects of polysorbate? 80 (PS 80) on fenofibrate precipitation in the simulated intestinal medium using focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM). We dissolved three different quantities of fenofibrate in six different mixtures of PS 80 and ethanol (EtOH). After adding these formulations to biorelevant media, we evaluated the effects of micelles in the simulated medium in combination with PS 80 on fenofibrate solubility and precipitation. Endogenous micelles in combination with PS 80 micelles enhanced drug solubility and therefore reduced supersaturation. Compared to pure water, micelles of biorelevant media accelerated drug-precipitation kinetics. Addition of increasing amounts of PS 80 to the biorelevant media prolonged nucleation time slightly and reduced the number of particles. We successfully introduced FBRM as a monitoring tool in biorelevant media. In another drug precipitation test, we simulated the transfer from the stomach to the intestine using simulated gastric and intestinal media. We used online dynamic image analysis and inline Raman spectroscopy. Further, we analyzed concentration profiles of the model drug dipyridamole in the simulated intestine by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and we developed a kinetic nucleation and growth model that was fitted to the experimental data. Dynamic image analysis revealed a complex structure of the precipitated dipyridamole particles. These precipitated upon transfer to the intestinal medium and were described as star-like crystals or aggregates of elongated primary particles. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy allowed the monitoring of precipitation over time. By fitting the model to the data, nucleation and growth exponents were obtained. These were consistent with data published in the literature and provided perfect agreement between the model and data. The last part of the work described in this thesis focused on in vitro lipolysis of lipid-based drug delivery systems. Dispersion and digestion processes mainly govern the fate of such systems. We studied concentration effects of six poorly water-soluble drugs on in vitro lipolysis rate of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), and we compared the results with drug effects on oil viscosity and surface tension. First, we characterized the drugs by molecular modeling and determined an apparent in vitro lipolysis rate in biorelevant medium by potentiometric titration. The different drugs exhibited varying effects on oil viscosity and surface tension. However, all drugs significantly lowered the apparent lipolysis rate of the oil. This effect was very similar among the different compounds and did not correlate with the effects on oil viscosity and surface tension. Orlistat was the exception in that it practically blocked lipolysis by direct inhibition. The other drugs affected lipolysis kinetics most likely by different mechanism(s). In the light of the obtained results, drug effect on oil viscosity or surface tension appeared to play a minor role in reducing lipolysis rate. The lipolysis kinetics were not affected by the drug load, which was deemed advantageous from a pharmaceutical viewpoint. Different dose strengths are therefore not assumed to alter lipolysis kinetics, which is beneficial for limiting the variability of in vivo drug release. Moreover, we studied the digestibility of 10 excipients often used in lipid-based drug delivery systems. We introduced a mathematical model to describe in vitro lipolysis kinetics, and we defined the relative half-lipolysis time that was independent of the set-up of the lipolysis test using Miglyol? 812 as the reference excipient. The results indicated two classes of excipients. Some additives were partially hydrolyzed, while others displayed complete lipolysis. For the latter class, we used the lipolysis extent X as a function of time in a simplified mathematical model that provided a good first approximation of initial lipolysis kinetics. The relative half-lipolysis time was obtained from the model with Miglyol? 812 as the reference and seemed to be a promising tool for comparing results of in vitro tests employing different experimental conditions. In conclusion, the analytical tools and mathematical models provided new insights into in vitro solubilization, precipitation, as well as lipolysis in the gastro-intestinal tract. A more complete understanding already at an early stage of drug development allows the formation of new, much more efficient lipid-based drug delivery systems that minimize drug precipitation. ...|$|E

In particular, concerns about en-docrine disrupting compounds in WWTP effluents give rise {{to the implementation of}} advanced treatment steps for the elimination of trace organic contaminants. The present study investigated ozonation (O 3) and activated carbon treatment (AC) at two WWTPs. For an ecotoxicological assessment at WWTP Regensdorf, conventionally treated wastewater, wastewater after ozonation, and ozonated wastewater after sand filtration were evaluated in parallel via the fish early life stage toxicity test (FELST) using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Additionally, a comparative toxicity evalu-ation of ozonated and activated carbon treated effluents was performed at the pilot scale treatment plant in Neuss (WWTP Neuss). For this purpose, four invertebrate tests and one higher plant toxicity test were selected to assess potential biological effects on or-ganisms [Lemna minor growth inhibition test, chironomid toxicity test with Chironomus riparius, Lumbriculus variegatus toxicity test, comet assay with haemolymph of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), reproduction test with Potamopyrgus antipo-darum]. All in vivo assays were performed on site at the {{treatment plants}} in <b>flow-through</b> <b>test</b> systems. Furthermore, the present study investigated the effects of ozona-tion and activated carbon treatment on endocrine activities [estrogenicity, anti-estrogenicity, androgenicity, anti-androgenicity, aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonistic activity] with yeast based bioassays using solid phase extracted water samples. To evaluate the removal of in vitro non-specific toxicity, a cytotoxicity assay using a rat cell line was applied. The FELST at WWTP Regensdorf revealed a considerable developmental retardation of test organisms exposed to ozonated WW. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in body weight and length compared to reference water, to the conventionally treated WW, and to the ozonated water after sand filtration. Hence sand filtration obvi-ously prevents from adverse ecotoxicological effects of ozonation. An additional test – starting with yolk-sac larvae – resulted in a significant reduction of vitellogenin levels in fish exposed to ozonated wastewater compared to fish reared in conventionally treat-ed wastewater. This demonstrates the effective removal of estrogenic activity by ozonation. At WWTP Neuss, the reproduction test with the mudsnail P. antipodarum exhibited a decreased reproductive output after advanced treatment compared to conventional treatment. This indicates an effective estrogenicity removal by ozonation and activated carbon treatment and is confirmed by results of the yeast estrogen screen with a reduc-tion of in vitro estrogenic activity by > 75 %. The L. variegatus test revealed a signifi-cantly enhanced toxicity after ozonation compared to conventional treatment, whereas this effect was reduced following subsequent sand filtration. When ozonation was applied, a significantly increased genotoxicity was observed, detected with the comet assay using haemolymph of the zebra mussel. Again, this effect was removed by subsequent sand filtration to the level of conventional treatment. Activated carbon treatment even resulted in a significant reduction of genotoxicity. At both treatment plants, adverse effects after ozonation may have been a result of the formation of toxic oxidation by-products. However, sand filtration reduced toxication effects, indicating that these oxidation by-products are readily degradable or adsorbable. The results point out that, in any case, ozonation should not be applied without subsequent biologically active post treatment appropriate for oxidation by-products removal (e. g. sand filtration). However, only activated carbon achieved a toxicity reduction compared to the conventional treated wastewater. Thus, it cannot be excluded that po-tential beneficial effects due to ozonation might be masked by residual toxic oxidation by-products passing the sand filter or ozonation is not as effective in toxicity removal as PAC treatment. The yeast based assays with solid phase extracted samples revealed an effective endo-crine activity removal during ozonation and activated carbon filtration (estrogenicity: 77 – 99 %, anti-androgenicity: 63 – 96 %, AhR agonistic activity: 79 – 82 %). The cyto-toxicity assay exhibited a 32 % removal of non-specific toxicity after ozonation com-pared to conventional treatment. Ozonation in combination with sand filtration reduced cytotoxic effects by 49 %, indicating that sand filtration contributes to the removal of toxicants. Activated carbon treatment was the most effective technology for cytotoxici-ty removal (61 %). Sample evaporation reduced cytotoxic effects by 52 % (after activated carbon treatment) to 73 % (after ozonation), demonstrating that volatile substances contribute considerably to toxic effects, particularly after ozone treatment. These results confirm an effective removal or transformation of toxicants with receptor mediated mode of action and non-specific toxicants during both investigated treatment steps. However, due to the limited extractability, polar ozonation by-products were neglected for toxicity analysis, and hence non-specific toxicity after O 3 is underestimated. In the long run, only on-site comparisons at WW receiving water bodies (e. g. communi-ty analysis of fish, macroinvertebrates, plants, microorganisms) – before and after up-grading WWTPs – allow drawing environmentally relevant conclusions regarding bene-fits and risks of advanced WW treatment methods. Conclusively, the benefits and possible negative impacts have to be carefully evaluated to prove that not more environmental impact will be induced than removed by advanced treatment technologies as each additional treatment requires considerable amounts of energy, resources, and infrastructure facilities. Accordingly, comprehensive sustainable approaches for pollution prevention and wastewater treatment (e. g. source control and source separation) are preferable compared to end-of-pipe treatment systems. Die Belastung von Oberflächengewässern mit Makroverunreinigungen (Salze, Nährstoffe, natürliches organisches Material in &# 956;g/L- bis mg/L-Konzentrationen) stellt, dank qualitativ hochwertiger Abwasseraufbereitung, in vielen Regionen – vor allem Westeuropas – kein vorrangiges Problem mehr dar. Die Folge ist eine weit reichende Verbesse-rung der Wasserqualität in den letzten Jahrzehnten und damit einhergehend eine Erho-lung der Flora und Fauna in den Gewässern. Dennoch sind kommunale und industrielle Abwässer – insbesondere in dicht besiedelten Gebieten – weiterhin Haupteintragspfade für Schadstoffe. Vor allem so genannte Mikroverunreinigungen oder Spurenschadstoffe (organische Schadstoffe in ng/L-Konzentrationen oder darunter) erlangen zunehmende Aufmerksamkeit aufgrund ihres negativen Einflusses auf aquatische Ökosysteme. Tausende verschiedener Chemikalien werden in Spurenkonzentrationen in die Gewässer eingebracht, aber nur wenige sind bereits umfassend ökotoxikologisch charakterisiert. Darunter weisen insbesondere Arzneimittelwirkstoffe und Körperpflegeprodukte häufig eine hohe biologische Aktivität auf und einige Substanzen überdies eine hohe Persistenz oder Pseudopersistenz sowie ein beträchtliches Bioakkumulationsvermögen. Die Folge ist ein realistisches Gefährdungspotential für Nichtziel-Organismen in der Umwelt. Oxidative oder adsorptive Verfahren können – als so genannte end-of-pipe Techniken im Anschluss an die konventionelle Reinigung – eine wichtige Rolle spielen, um relativ kurzfristig die Schadstoffbelastung effektiv zu reduzieren. Aktuell gelten die Ozonierung sowie die Abwasserbehandlung mit Aktivkohle als favorisierte Lösungen, um die Gewässerbelastung mit Mikroverunreinigungen zu verringern. Beide Techniken sind bezüglich der Reduktion eines sehr breiten Spektrums von Substanzen viel versprechend. Jedoch fokussiert die chemische Analytik häufig ausschließlich bekannte Substanzen, während Transformationsprodukte oftmals unbekannt sind und daher bisher kaum berücksichtigt werden. Folglich sind ökotoxikologische Testverfahren unerlässlich für eine qualitative Beurteilung von erweiterten Abwasseraufbereitungsmethoden. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden verschiedene erweiterte Abwasseraufbereitungsmethoden hinsichtlich ihres Potentials zur Reduktion der Abwassertoxizität untersucht. An der Kläranlage Regensdorf (Schweiz) wurde der fish early life stage toxicity test (FELST) mit der Regenbogenforelle eingesetzt, um die allgemeine Toxizität bzw. vertebratenspezifische Toxizität konventionell und erweitert aufbereiteter Abwässer zu untersuchen. Die Kläranlage Regensdorf war mit einer Vollstrom-Ozonierungsanlage im Anschluss an das Nachklärbecken nach konventioneller Reinigung mittels Belebtschlammsystem ausgestattet. Im Anschluss an den Ozonierungsreaktor befand sich außerdem eine Sandfiltrationsstufe. Die Fischeier wurden direkt nach Befruchtung insgesamt 65 Tage gegenüber Abwässern nach dem Nachklärbecken, nach der Ozonierung und nach dem Sandfilter in einem Durchflusssystem vor Ort an der Kläranlage exponiert. Bei diesem Versuch wurde eine deutliche und nach Testende signifikant verzögerte Entwicklung der Forellen nach der Ozonierung beobachtet (verzögertes Aufschwimmverhalten der Fische). Außerdem waren die Biomasse sowie die Länge der Fische im Vergleich zur konventionellen Reinigung signifikant reduziert. Nach dem Sandfilter wurden keine signifikanten Effekte beobachtet. Auf Basis dieser Befunde wird angenommen, dass toxische Oxidationsprodukte infolge der Ozonierung entstehen, die die Entwicklung der Fische beinträchtigen. Die Reduktion negativer Effekte durch den Sandfilter auf das Ausgangsniveau nach der konventionellen Reinigung bestätigt eine effektive Reduktion toxischer Nebenprodukte. Eine Vielzahl solcher Oxidationsprodukte gilt als reaktiv und relativ schnell abbaubar (u. a. Aldehyde, Ketone, Alkane, Carboxysäuren, etc.). Daher wird ein bioaktiver Nachbehandlungsschritt (z. B. Sandfiltration) für Ozonierungsanlagen empfohlen. Allerdings wurden keine positiven Effekte auf die Allgemeintoxizität im Vergleich zum Abwasser des Nachklärbeckens beobachtet, weshalb nicht auszuschließen ist, dass toxische Oxidationsprodukte den Sandfilter passieren und positive Effekte infolge der Schadstoffoxidation maskieren. Eine ebenfalls durchgeführte Vitellogeninbestimmung als Marker für die östrogene Aktivität der Abwässer ergab einen erhöhten Vitellogenin-Gehalt in den Fischen, die gegenüber konventionell gereinigtem Abwasser exponiert wurden. Infolge der Ozonierung wurde der Vitellogeningehalt auf Kontrollniveau reduziert, was eine deutlich reduzierte östrogene Aktivität der Abwässer in Folge der Ozonierung bestätigt. An der halbtechnischen Kläranlage (HTK) Neuss wurden verschiedene Invertebraten-tests eingesetzt, um Ozonierung und Aktivkohlereinigung vergleichend zu untersuchen. Die HTK behandelt einen Teilabwasserstrom der Kläranlage Neuss Süd zu Forschungs-zwecken nach dem konventionellen Belebtschlammsystem. Ein Teil des gereinigten Abwasserstroms wurde anschließend ozoniert und darauf folgend sandgefiltert. Ein paralleler Teilstrom des Abwassers wurde mit Pulveraktivkohle behandelt (20 mg/L) und anschließend ebenfalls sandgefiltert. Folgende Testsysteme wurden im Durchflusssystem eingesetzt: Lemna minor-Wachstumshemmtest, Lumbriculus variegatus-Toxizitätstest, Chironomus riparius-Toxizitätstest, Reproduktionstest mit der Zwergde-ckelschnecke Potamopyrgus antipodarum und der Comet-Assay mit Hämolymphe von 70 Tage exponierten Zebramuscheln (Dreissena polymorpha). Die Tests mit L. minor und C. riparius ergaben keine signifikanten Unterschiede zwischen den Behandlungsgruppen. L. variegatus zeigte hingegen eine signifikant verringerte Reproduktion und Gesamtbiomasse nach dem Ozonreaktor, wohingegen diese Effekte nach dem Sandfilter wieder auf das Ausgangsniveau nach konventioneller Reinigung zurückgeführt wurden. Nach Aktivkohlebehandlung wurden bei Lumbriculus keine signifikanten Effekte beobachtet. Beim Reproduktionstest mit P. antipodarum sanken die Embryonenzahlen nach Ozonierung und Aktivkohlebehandlung im Vergleich zur konventionellen Reinigung, was auf eine verringerte östrogene Aktivität der Abwässer hindeutet. Dies wurde außerdem mit dem yeast estrogen screen mit nativen Abwasserproben bestätigt, wobei die östrogene Aktivität im Schnitt zwischen 75 % (Aktivkohle) bis 91 % (Ozonierung nach Sandfilter) abnahm. Der Comet-Assay ergab eine signifikant erhöhte Gentoxizität nach der Ozonierung, während dieser Effekt durch den Sandfilter wieder auf das Ausgangs-niveau zurückgeführt werden konnte. Lediglich die Aktivkohlereinigung erbrachte eine signifikant verringerte Gentoxizität im Vergleich zur konventionellen Reinigung. Insgesamt wurde an der HTK Neuss, ebenso wie an der Kläranlage Regensdorf, eine erhöhte Allgemeintoxizität nach der Ozonierung festgestellt. Insbesondere die erhöhte Gentoxizität ist vermutlich ein Resultat der Bildung von reaktiven Oxidationsnebenprodukten. Der Sandfilter konnte die erhöhte Toxizität erneut auf das Ausgangsniveau zurückfüh-ren, womit eine effektive Entgiftung von toxischen Oxidationsnebenprodukten bestätigt wird. Allerdings wurde nur mit Aktivkohlereinigung eine verringerte unspezifische Toxizität erreicht, was vermuten lässt, dass die bioaktive Sandfiltration Oxidationsprodukte nicht vollständig entfernt bzw. entgiftet. Die verringerten Embryonenzahlen im Re-produktionstest sowie der yeast estrogen screen bestätigten abermals die verringerte östrogene Aktivität der Abwässer sowohl nach Ozonierung als auch nach Aktivkoh-lereinigung. In Regensdorf und an der HTK Neuss wurden zudem Abwasserproben entnommen und festphasenextrahiert. Anschließend wurde die endokrine Aktivität der Extrakte bestimmt, um das Entgiftungspotential von Ozonierung und Aktivkohlebehandlung abzuschätzen. Mittels rekombinanter Hefetests wurden die Östrogenität und Androgenität sowie die entsprechend antagonistischen Wirkungen bestimmt. Außerdem wurde die agonistische Aktivität am Aryl-Hydrocarbon-Rezeptor (AhR) als Marker für die Belastung mit dioxionartigen Stoffen sowie polycyklischen aromatischen Kohlenwasserstoffen ermittelt. Zur Abschätzung der unspezifischen Toxizität wurde außerdem ein Test auf Zytotoxizität mit Rattenzellen etabliert und eingesetzt. Die Östrogenität wurde während der konventionellen Reinigung um 78 – 91 % reduziert. Nach Aktivkohlebehandlung und Ozonierung sank die östrogene Aktivität weiterhin um 77 – 95 % im Vergleich zur konventionellen Reinigung. Bei der Anti-Östrogenität wurden keine eindeutigen Effekte festgestellt. Die Androgenität wurde während der konventionellen Reinigung bereits von ca. 200 – 400 ng/L Testosteronäquivalenten im Abwasserzulauf um mehr als 99 % reduziert. Nach der erweiterten Abwasserreinigung ergaben sich keine eindeutigen Effekte. Eine anti-androgene Aktivität war im ungereinigten Abwasser vermutlich aufgrund von Maskierungseffekten durch die Androgenität nicht feststellbar. Nach konventioneller Reinigung lag die Anti-Androgenität bei durchschnittlichen 302 – 614 &# 956;g/L Flutamidäquivalenten. Nach Ozonierung und Aktivkohlereinigung sank diese um 63 – 90 %, wobei Aktivkohle etwas weniger effektiv war als die Ozonierung. Die AhR agonistische Aktivität konnte mittels erweiterter Aufbereitung um ca. 80 % reduziert werden. Der Zytotoxizitätstest ergab, ebenso wie der Comet-Assay, dass Aktivkohle die unspezifische Toxizität am effektivsten reduziert. Außerdem ist ein Großteil der Zytotoxizität – insbesondere nach der Ozonierung – auf volatile Substanzen zurückzuführen. Insgesamt wurde bei diesen In-vitro-Versuchen gezeigt, dass beide Aufbereitungsmethoden die rezeptorvermittelte Toxizität sehr effektiv verringern können. Ozonierung und Aktivkohlebehandlung ermöglichen eine effektive Reduktion der Schadstoffbelastung von Abwässern. Beide Techniken erreichen außerdem eine deutlich reduzierte Toxizität im Vergleich zur konventionellen Abwasserreinigung, wobei die Ozonierung bislang als kosteneffektiveres Verfahren gilt. Unmittelbar nach der Ozonierung auftretende adverse Effekte sind vermutlich auf schnell abbaubare, toxische Oxidationsprodukte zurückzuführen. Ein nachgeschalteter biologisch aktiver Sandfilter entgiftet bzw. entfernt die ursächlichen Substanzen effektiv, wobei hier weiterer Forschungsbedarf besteht, um eventuelle Risiken für aquatische Organismen auszuschließen. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist vor allem zu berücksichtigen, dass ein Großteil (> 50 %) der bei der Ozonierung entstehenden assimilierbaren organischen Kohlenstoffe bisher noch nicht identifiziert sind. Des Weiteren wird die Bildung von Oxidationsprodukten – neben Ozondosis und Kontaktzeit – im Wesentlichen von der Ausgangszusammensetzung des Abwassers bestimmt. So führen beispielsweise hohe Bromid-Konzentrationen während der Ozonierung zu hohen Konzentrationen des karzinogenen Bromats, und ähnlich kann die Bildung des mutagenen N-Nitrosodimethylamins (NDMA) durch die ausgangskonzentration chemischer Vorstufen beeinflusst werden. Deshalb und aufgrund der Unsicherheiten bezüglich unbekannter Oxidationsprodukte sind toxikologische Routineuntersuchungen notwendig, um mögliche Risiken zu erfassen und zu bewerten. Für eine abschließende Beurteilung der erweiterten Aufbereitung ist allerdings eine Langzeitbeobachtung vor Ort an abwasserreichen Fließgewässern unumgänglich. Populationsbeobachtungen von sensitiven Arten verschiedener taxonomischer Gruppen (z. B. Makrozoobenthos, Fische, Wasserpflanzen, Mikroorganismen) im Freiland vor und nach der Etablierung erweiterter Abwasserbehandlungsschritte sowie Biomarkeruntersuchungen und die Einbeziehung histopathologischer Endpunkte würden helfen, eine tatsächlich umweltrelevante ökotoxikologische Bewertung solcher Techniken zu erreichen. Dadurch ließe sich feststellen, ob sich Arten, die negativ durch Abwasserschadstoffe beeinflusst werden, nach der Installation einer erweiterten Aufbereitung erholen und ob Biomarkerantworten (beispielsweise für östrogene Aktivität oder Gentoxizität) sowie das Auftreten von Intersex (Verweiblichung männlicher Fische oder anderer Organismen) reduziert werden. Außerdem könnten potentiell negative Auswirkungen durch toxische Oxidationsprodukte untersucht werden. Zu berücksichtigen bleibt allerdings, dass jeder erweiterte Reinigungsschritt durch einen erhöhten Ressourceneinsatz sowie Schadstoffemissionen an anderer Stelle (durch Infrastrukturmaßnahmen, Material- und Energieproduktion, thermische Beseitigung belasteten Materials) negative Umwelteinflüsse zur Folge hat. Die Abwägung solcher Umweltkosten gegenüber möglichen Vorteilen der erweiterten Aufbereitung ist daher zwingend erforderlich, um zusätzliche Maßnahmen unter ökonomischen und ökologischen Gesichtspunkten zu rechtfertigen. Aufgrund dessen sind auf lange Sicht source control Strategien zur nachhaltigen, res-sourcenschonenden und kosteneffektiven Abwasserreinigung gegenüber end-of-pipe Techniken zu bevorzugen, um den Eintrag von Schadstoffen bereits an der Quelle zu minimieren...|$|E

30|$|For highly HOCs, an {{alternative}} fish dietary bioaccumulation approach will be recommended {{in the future}} by OECD TG 305. The dietary approach yields a biomagnification factor (BMF) rather than a BCF.

Therefore, the estimation of BCFK values from data generated in the dietary studies is currently under investigation to keep the results of bioconcentration and biomagnification studies comparable [29]. However, this approach seems to be very complicated and might be even impossible due to the clear differences in the biomagnification and bioconcentration processes. In addition, defined regulatory cutoff criteria for the biomagnification potential of chemical compounds are still missing. Under such circumstances, the estimation of BCFs for highly HOCs in <b>flow-through</b> fish <b>tests</b> might remain essential in the future.

Thus, the reliability of test results and the quality of BCF values for (highly) HOCs can be improved.|$|R
40|$|Frequent {{toxicant}} {{analyses are}} essential for good quality data in long-term continuous-flow tests. Due to the time consuming and costly chemical analyses, exposure levels are measured at best on a daily basis. These infrequent determinations may not detect variability in toxicant concentrations {{that could result in}} test failures. To minimize repetitive testing and improve data quality, a dye tracer method was evaluated. Rhodamine WT was selected as a toxicant tracer because of easy detectability, low toxicity to aquatic organisms, and negligible transformation in the aquatic environment. Results over a 24 h period showed that rhodamine reliably predicted the toxicant (diquat) concentrations with an r value of 0. 99. Based upon these data, two replicate long-term tests with and without tracer were carried out exposing fathead minnows Pimephales promelas to diquat (1 : 1 '-ethylene- 2 : 2 '-dipiridium dibromide). The test results indicated that the added rhodamine WT did not alter the diquat toxicity to fathead minnows using LC 50 and EC 50 values for comparisons. From these findings it is concluded that dye tracers are suitable toxicant surrogates. Their use in <b>flow-through</b> <b>tests</b> allow more frequent analyses which result in better data and minimizes experimental failure...|$|R

To improve our understanding of the complex coupling between circulating fluids and the development of crack damage, we performed <b>flow-through</b> <b>tests</b> on samples of Etna basalt and Westerly granite that were cyclically loaded by deviatoric stresses. The basalt was naturally microfractured, while the relatively crack-free Westerly granite was thermally pretreated to 500 °C and 800 °C to generate microcrack damage. Samples were repeatedly loaded and then unloaded under deviatoric stress paths and ultimately to failure. Permeability and water volume content were measured throughout the loading history together with the differential stress. Permeability decreases at low differential stresses and increases at intermediate differential stresses up to a steady value at failure. We use water volume content as a proxy for fluid storage and show that both permeability and storage evolve with damage and evolution of crack density. We use crack models to represent the evolution of permeability as a function of loading state and are able to independently link it to the observed evolution of deformability, used as an independent measure of crack density.
