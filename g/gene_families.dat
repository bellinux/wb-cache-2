5|$|Mutations {{can involve}} large {{sections}} of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome. Extra copies of genes are {{a major source of}} the raw material needed for new genes to evolve. This is important because most new genes evolve within <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.|$|E

Rats have 9 distinct Mup genes and a further 13 pseudogenes clustered together across 1.1 megabases of DNA on chromosome 5. Like in mice, the cluster formed by multiple duplications. However, this occurred independently of the duplications in mice, meaning that both rodent species expanded their Mup <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> separately, but in parallel.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of ctenophores {{to the rest}} of Metazoa is very important {{to our understanding of the}} early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animals. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera and Placozoa) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal taxon instead. As such, the Ctenophora appear to be a basal diploblast clade. In agreement with the latter point, the analysis of a very large sequence alignment at the metazoan taxonomic scale (1,719 proteins totalizing ca. 400,000 amino acid positions) showed that ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals. Another study strongly rejects the hypothesis that sponges are the sister group to all other extant animals and establishes the placement of Ctenophora as the sister group to all other animals, and disagreement with the last-mentioned paper is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work.|$|E

25|$|Recently, {{there had}} been {{discussion}} connecting copy number variations to <b>gene</b> <b>families.</b> <b>Gene</b> <b>families</b> are defined {{as a set of}} related genes that serve similar functions but have minor temporal or spatial differences and these genes likely derived from one ancestral gene. The main reason copy number variations are connected to <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> {{is that there is a}} possibility that genes in a family may have derived from one ancestral gene which got duplicated into different copies. Mutations accumulate through time in the genes and with natural selection acting on the genes, some mutations lead to environmental advantages allowing those genes to be inherited and eventually clear <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> are separated out. An example of a gene family that may have been created due to copy number variations is the globin gene family. The globin gene family is an elaborate network of genes consisting of alpha and beta globin genes including genes that are expressed in both embryos and adults as well as pseudogenes. These globin genes in the globin family are all well conserved and only differ by a small portion of the gene, indicating that they were derived from a common ancestral gene, perhaps due to duplication of the initial globin gene.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background PHB (Prohibitin) <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> is {{involved}} in a variety of functions important for different biological processes. PHB genes are ubiquitously present in divergent species from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Human PHB genes {{have been found to be}} associated with various diseases. Recent studies by our group and others have shown diverse function of PHB genes in plants for development, senescence, defence, and others. Despite the importance of the PHB <b>gene</b> <b>family,</b> no comprehensive <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> analysis has been carried to evaluate the relatedness of PHB genes across different species. In order to better guide the gene function analysis and understand the evolution of the PHB <b>gene</b> <b>family,</b> we therefore carried out the comparative genome analysis of the PHB genes across different kingdoms. Results The relatedness, motif distribution, and intron/exon distribution all indicated that PHB genes is a relatively conserved <b>gene</b> <b>family.</b> The PHB <b>genes</b> can be classified into 5 classes and each class have a very deep evolutionary origin. The PHB genes within the class maintained the same motif patterns during the evolution. With Arabidopsis as the model species, we found that PHB gene intron/exon structure and domains are also conserved during the evolution. Despite being a conserved <b>gene</b> <b>family,</b> various <b>gene</b> duplication events led to the expansion of the PHB genes. Both segmental and tandem gene duplication were involved in Arabidopsis PHB <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> expansion. However, segmental duplication is predominant in Arabidopsis. Moreover, most of the duplicated genes experienced neofunctionalization. The results highlighted that PHB genes might be involved in important functions so that the duplicated genes are under the evolutionary pressure to derive new function. Conclusion PHB <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> is a conserved <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> and accounts for diverse but important biological functions based on the similar molecular mechanisms. The highly diverse biological function indicated that more research needs to be carried out to dissect the PHB gene function.

PLD genes constitute an important <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> in higher plants. However, until now our knowledge concerning the PLD <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> members and their evolutionary relationship in woody plants such as Poplar and Grape has been limited. Results: In this study, we have provided a genome-wide analysis of the PLD <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> in Poplar and Grape. Eighteen and eleven members of the PLD <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> were identified in Poplar and Grape respectively. Phylogenetic and gene structure analyses showed that the PLD <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> can be divided into 6 subgroups: Î±, Î²/Î³, Î´, Îµ, Î¶, and Ï, and that the 6 PLD subgroups originated from 4 original ancestors through a series of gene duplications. Interestingly, the majority of the PLD genes from both Poplar (76. 5 %, 13 / 17) and Grape (90. 9 %, 10 / 11) clustered closely together in the phylogenetic tree to the extent that their evolutionary relationship appears more tightly linked to each other, at least in terms of the PLD <b>gene</b> <b>family,</b> than it does to either Arabidopsis or rice.

Twenty-eight chromosomal segments of EIL/EIN 3 <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> were found in four Rosaceae species, and these segments could form seven orthologous or paralogous groups based on interspecies or intraspecies gene colinearity (microsynteny) analysis.

25|$|Mutational {{analysis}} of entire <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> revealed that genes {{of the same}} family have similar functions, as predicted by similar coding sequences and protein domains. Two such classes are the kinase family, involved in adding phosphate groups to proteins and the phosphatase family, involved with removing phosphate groups from proteins. These families were first examined because of their apparent role in transducing cellular signals of cell growth or death. In particular, more than 50% of colorectal cancers carry a mutation in a kinase or phosphatase gene. Phosphatidylinositold 3-kinases (PIK3CA) gene encodes for lipid kinases that commonly contain mutations in colorectal, breast, gastric, lung and various other cancers. Drug therapies can inhibit PIK3CA. Another example is the BRAF gene, {{one of the first}} to be implicated in melanomas. BRAF encodes a serine/threonine kinase that is involved in the RAS-RAF-MAPK growth signaling pathway. Mutations in BRAF cause constitutive phosphorylation and activity in 59% of melanomas.

25|$|Standard {{tools to}} {{simulate}} sequence evolution along trees such as INDELible or PhyloSim {{can be adapted}} to simulate HGT. HGT events cause the relevant gene trees to conflict with the species tree. Such HGT events can be simulated through subtree pruning and regrafting rearrangements of the species tree. However, it is important to simulate data that are realistic enough to be representative of the challenge provided by real datasets, and simulation under complex models are thus preferable. A model was developed to simulate gene trees with heterogeneous substitution processes in addition to the occurrence of transfer, and accounting for the fact that transfer can come from now extinct donor lineages. Alternatively, the genome evolution simulator ALF directly generates <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> subject to HGT, by accounting for a whole range of evolutionary forces at the base level, but {{in the context of a}} complete genome.

25|$|In 1977, Schmidtke {{and colleagues}} showed that isozyme {{complexity}} {{is similar in}} amphioxus and tunicates, contradicting a prediction of Ohno's hypothesis that genome duplication occurred in the common ancestor of amphioxus and vertebrates. However, this analysis did not examine vertebrates, so could say nothing about later duplication events. (Furthermore, much later molecular phylogenetics has shown that vertebrates are {{more closely related to}} tunicates than to amphioxus, thus negating the logic of this analysis.) The 2R hypothesis saw a resurgence of interest in the 1990s for two reasons. First, gene mapping data in humans and mice revealed extensive paralogy regions - sets of genes on one chromosome related to sets of genes on another chromosome in the same species, indicative of duplication events in evolution. Paralogy regions were generally in sets of four. Second, cloning of Hox genes in amphioxus revealed presence of a single Hox gene cluster, in contrast to the four clusters in humans and mice. Data from additional <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> revealed a common one-to-many rule when amphioxus and vertebrate genes were compared.
