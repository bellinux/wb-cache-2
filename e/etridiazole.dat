50|$|<b>Etridiazole</b> is a {{fungicide}} and pesticide {{used for}} prevention of pythium ultimum on cotton plants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etridiazole</b> {{is stable}} under normal conditions, but degrades upon {{continuous}} exposure to sunlight, and is hydrolysed by alkalis. When heated to decomposition, it emits toxic fumes of hydrogen chloride, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides.|$|E
50|$|Trichloroacetonitrile is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula CCl3CN. It is a colourless liquid, although commercial samples often are brownish. It is used commercially as {{a precursor to}} the fungicide <b>etridiazole.</b> It is prepared by dehydration of trichloroacetamide.|$|E
50|$|Pythium and Rhizoctonia {{are both}} {{seedling}} {{diseases of the}} cotton plant. They can be devastating to cotton plants because they develop when seedlings are unable to overcome the damage being caused by the invading fungus. The diseases often kill seeds before they grow. However, if the seeds do manage to sprout they demonstrate symptoms almost immediately. The stalks of the cotton plant will be weak, brown sunken lesions {{will appear on the}} stem, and the plant will often die before producing or will have very poor yields. Growers who plant early are especially susceptible because cooler temperatures and damper weather are conducive to these diseases. Therefore, growers who plant early are advised to use in-furrow fungicides for control: PNCB and iprodione for Rhizoctonia and <b>etridiazole</b> and mefenoxam for pythium. Recently, azoxystrobin has proven effective in controlling both rhizoctonia and pythium.|$|E
5000|$|Infections {{of seeds}} and roots are {{initiated}} {{by both the}} mycelia and spores of Py. ultimum. Two spore types are made, depending on the strain. Py. ultimum is a species complex that includes var. ultimum and var. sporangiiferum. [...] The major distinguishing feature is that sporangia and zoospores (swimming spores) are produced only rarely by Py. ultimum var. ultimum. Both species make oospores, which are thick-walled structures produced by sexual recombination. Both species are self-fertile (homothallic), which means that a single strain can mate with itself. In addition to oospores, Py. ultimum var. ultimum also makes hyphal swellings which germinate in a manner resembling sporangia to form plant-infecting hyphae. One important ecological difference between {{the different types of}} spores is that sporangia and zoospores are short-lived, while the thick-walled oospores can persist for years within soil, surviving even winter freezes. Mycelia and oospores in soil can infect seeds or roots. This leads to wilting, reduced yield, and ultimately plant death. Common signs of a Pythium infection include stunting of the plants, brown coloration of root-tips, and wilting of the plant during the warm part of the day. Management of disease is challenging but focuses on sanitation, fungicides, and biological control. Fungicides include mefenoxam, thiadiazole, <b>etridiazole,</b> propamocarb, dimethomorph, and phosphonates. Biological control agents include the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces griseoviridis, and the fungi Candida oleophila, Gliocladium catenulatum, Trichoderma harziamum, and Trichoderma virens. [...] Effective resistance in the plant host is generally not available. Sanitation is very important since the pathogen can be easily introduced into pasteurized soil or even soil-free potting mixes on dirty tools or pots. Especially in greenhouses, fungus gnats may also help move the pathogen from place to place.|$|E
5000|$|Pythium irregulare {{requires}} {{very specific}} environmental conditions to produce disease, so control of environment is the first step. Because the zoospores require water {{to be able to}} move around, preventing standing water will decrease the chance of disease occurrence. Additionally, excess water can lead to an increase in insects that feed on roots, making it easier for the pathogen to spread, as it can make its way into the plant through wounds. Water levels can be controlled by avoiding planting in areas that have poor drainage and controlling irrigation as to not overwater plants. Because P. irregulare has oospores that survive under harsh conditions, sanitation is very important to limit the spread. Contaminated irrigation systems, tools, and seeds can spread the disease, so disinfection with heat or chemicals are necessary to prevent further spread, as well as purchasing certified clean seed. Additionally, in greenhouses scenarios it is important to sanitize soil, work benches, and tools with heat or chemicals as well. It is also important to avoid over-fertilizing plants, as fertilizers can suppress plant defenses and damage roots, making it easier for P. irregulare to infect. Finally, if you have had previous problems with Pythium irregulare, you can take preventative measures by mixing fungicides into the soil, although this is more easily achieved in a greenhouse scenario. It is important to create a fungicide plan with different rotations of fungicides if you choose to prevent disease this way in order to prevent the pathogen from becoming resistant to the fungicide. Some fungicides used to prevent P. irregulare include mefenoxam, fosetyl-Al, and <b>etridiazole.</b> Additionally, certain biological agents such as Trichoderma harzianum and Gliocladium virens can be used as biological control measures to prevent infection; however, this is also a more plausible control method in a greenhouse, again because it needs to be mixed into the soil. Crop rotation is not necessarily a good option for P. irregulare control because many crops are viable hosts, oospores can survive in the soil for many years, and the pathogen can survive on organic matter; however, rotation with a non-host crop may be able to reduce the pathogen load, thus decreasing infection in subsequent years ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Etridiazole,</b> 5 -ethoxy- 3 -trichloromethyl- 1, 2, 4 -thiadiazole, was orally {{administered}} to rats and human volunteers. Two metabolites of <b>etridiazole</b> were synthesized: 5 -ethoxy- 1, 2, 4 -thiadiazole- 3 -carboxylic acid (ET-CA) and N-acetyl-S-(5 -ethoxy- 1, 2, 4 -thiadiazol- 3 -yl-methyl) -L-cysteine (ET-MA). Selective and sensitive analytical procedures to determine <b>etridiazole,</b> the carboxylic acid ET-CA and the mercapturic acid ET-MA in urine were developed. The detection limit of <b>etridiazole,</b> applying GC with nitrogen selective detection (GC-NPD), was 36 micrograms/l urine (CV = 15. 4 %, n = 3). The detection limit of ET-CA, applying GC with sulphur selective detection (GC-FPD), was 100 micrograms/l urine (CV = 9. 8 %, n = 3). In urine of rats orally treated with <b>etridiazole,</b> ET-CA and ET-MA {{were identified as}} metabolites of <b>etridiazole,</b> whereas in urine of humans given oral <b>etridiazole,</b> only ET-CA was identified.

40|$|Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), one of {{the most}} widely grown {{vegetables}} worldwide, is susceptible to root rot caused by Phytophthora capsici. Many biocides have recently been banned in Europe because of human health and environmental concerns. Integrated pest management is a European priority, where biological control together with other agronomic practices should replace pesticide management of plant diseases in the future. Application of different concentrations of the fungus Trichoderma asperellum strain T 34 (the in T 34 Biocontrol®) on incidence of disease caused by P. capsici in pepper was studied. Different methods of application of the microbial control agent and inoculation of the pathogen were examined. T 34 and <b>etridiazole</b> (Terrazole®) were compared for their ability to suppress P. capsici. T 34 reduced disease in most of the assayed situations (up to 71 % disease reduction), while <b>etridiazole</b> was effective only when applied at the same time as the pathogen. The results obtained are discussed on the basis of the different modes of action of T 34 and <b>etridiazole.</b> T 34 is a useful biological alternative to chemicals for the control of P. capsici in peppe...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen field {{experiments}} were conducted (1977 - 1981) {{to evaluate the}} effects of the nitrification inhibitor (NI), <b>etridiazole,</b> on the grain yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell), oats (Avena sativa L.), corn (Zea mays L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Rates of <b>etridiazole,</b> rates of nitrogen and three forms of nitrogen (urea, urea-ammonium nitrate solutions, anhydrous ammonia) were varied to determine the treatment combinations which produced the most efficient use of applied nitrogen and the maximum yield. ^ Fourteen of the {{experiments were}} conducted at the University of Nebraska Field Laboratory at Mead, NE on Sharpsburg silty clay laom (Typic Argiudoll) soil. Five of these experiments measured residual effects. One of these experiments was conducted at Grand Island, NE on a Cass fine sand (coarse loamy mixed mesic Fluventic Haplastol). ^ Soil test results showed increase in soil nitrogen in treatments with applied nitrogen three years out of the four experiments where appropriate soil analyses were made. In three years total nitrate nitrogen (NO(, 3) -N) increased over the non-treated controls. In one year ammonium (NH(, 4) -N) increased over the non-treated controls. In none of the years was there an increase in soil nitrogen level due to the use of <b>etridiazole.</b> ^ Yields were increased by nitrogen application fertilizer in four of the 10 first year experiments. Corn was the only crop that showed positive yield response to applied nitrogen. In four of the six first-year corn experiments, nitrogen additions increased yield above the control. In two of these experiments there was no increase in yield after the first increment of nitrogen. In one experiment the nitrogen applications decreased yields below the control. Percent nitrogen in the grain and stover showed the effects of nitrogen additions more than did the grain yields. ^ The application of NI did not increase grain yield or stover weight in a consistent manner. There were increases in one experiment when the chemical was combined with anhydrous ammonia. When <b>etridiazole</b> was compared to nitrapyrin no differences due to chemical was detected in the effects on yield. ...|$|E
40|$|Of 240 {{pesticides}} {{screened for}} carcinogenicity by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Pesticide Programs, at least 24 (10 %) produce thyroid follicular cell tumors in rodents. Thirteen of the thyroid carcinogens also induce liver tumors, mainly in mice, and 9 chemicals produce tumors at other sites. Some mutagenic {{data are available}} on all 24 pesticides producing thyroid tumors. Mutagenicity {{does not seem to}} be a major determinant in thyroid carcinogenicity, except for possibly acetochlor; evidence is less convincing for ethylene thiourea and <b>etridiazole.</b> Studies on thyroid-pituitary functioning, including indications of thyroid cell growth and/or changes in thyroxine, triiodothyronine, or thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, are available on 19 pesticides. No such antithyroid information is available for <b>etridiazole,</b> N-octyl bicycloheptene dicarboximide, terbutryn, triadimefon, and trifluralin. Of the studied chemicals, only bromacil lacks antithyroid activity under study conditions. Intrathyroidal and extrathyroidal sites of action are found: amitrole, ethylene thiourea, and mancozeb are thyroid peroxidase inhibitors; and acetochlor, clofentezine, fenbuconazole, fipronil, pendimethalin, pentachloronitrobenzene, prodiamine, pyrimethanil, and thiazopyr seem to enhance the hepatic metabolism and excretion of thyroid hormone. Thus, with 12 pesticides that mode of action judgments can be made, 11 disrupt thyroid-pituitary homeostasis only; no chemical is mutagenic only; and acetochlor may have both antithyroid and some mutagenic activity. More information is needed to identify other potential antithyroid modes of thyroid carcinogenic action...|$|E
40|$|Local and {{regional}} atmospheric transport of current-use pesticides {{is an important}} source of these compounds to nontarget plants and ecosystems. Current-use pesticides were measured at urban, rural, and suburban sites in eastern Iowa during 2000 - 2002.

40|$|Several {{disinfectant}} {{products for}} bean seeds (visually {{with and without}} desease symptoms) of Phaseolus vulgaris L. were evaluated {{in order to obtain}} healthy bean seeds to be used for sowing. the products tested as fungicides were general disinfectants (bleach, oxygenated water) and specific fungicides (captan, thiram, [...] .) and as antibacterials (kasugamycin-copper, estreptomycin and copac E). the efficacy assays were carried out in the laboratory and then contrasted with field work. The disinfectant efficacy was evaluated {{in terms of the number}} and type of species and c. f. u. number of the different species of fungi recovered from the treated bean seeds and the detection of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola by an ELISA-DAS test; as well as by the phytotoxicity of the treatment (germination power of the treated seeds vs. the control). The most relevant findings were: i) two products, the quintozene and <b>etridiazole</b> mixture and the bleach were highly phytotoxic, ii) the most efficient fungicide was thiram, followed by benomyl, iii) the presence of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola in seeds treated with kasugaycin-copper or streptomycin was much lower than with copac and the control; iv) results from the fungicides led us to propose the treatment with thiram (1, 5 g/K of seed) as an efficient disnfectant treatment but results from the antibacterials do not enable us to make a choice for treatment; and v) results from this work led us to propose the selection of healthy seed by procedures of patogen-exclusion as an alternative to chemical antibacterial treatment...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{importance}} of urea fertilizer in world agriculture has stimulated extensive research to find compounds that will retard hydrolysis of urea by soil urease and thereby reduce gaseous loss of NH[subscript] 3 {{and other problems}} resulting from the normally rapid hydrolysis of urea fertilizer. Numerous compounds have been proposed for inhibition of soil urease, but the only compounds that have shown promise are phosphoroamides such as N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) and thiophosphoryl triamide (T·PTA). Studies to evaluate these two compounds as soil urease inhibitors showed that they are poor inhibitors of plant or microbial urease and that their ability to inhibit urea hydrolysis by soil urease is due to their decomposition in soil with formation of compounds that are potent urease inhibitors. Studies using [superscript] 31 P-NMR and FT-IR to identify these decomposition products showed that NBPT decomposes with formation of N-(n-butyl) phosphoryl triamide and that TPTA decomposes with formation of phosphoryl triamide. Enzyme kinetic studies of inhibition of plant and microbial ureases by phosphoroamides showed that these compounds are slow-binding or slow, tight-binding inhibitors of urease;Most of the fertilizer N applied to soils {{is in the form}} of ammonium or ammonium-producing compounds such as urea. The nitrate formed through nitrification of this fertilizer N by soil microorganisms is susceptible to loss by leaching and denitrification. The adverse effects of oxidation of ammonium to nitrate by the nitrifying microorganisms in soil have stimulated research to find compounds that can be used as fertilizer amendments to retard nitrification of fertilizer N. Studies to evaluate compounds showing the most promise as soil nitrification inhibitors demonstrated that their effectiveness decreased in the order: 2 -ethynylpyridine 3 ̆e <b>etridiazole</b> (Dwell) 3 ̆e nitrapyrin (N-Serve) or 3 -methylpyrazole- 1 -carboxamide (MPC);Studies of the relationships between the structures of heterocyclic N compounds and their effectiveness of inhibition of nitrification in soil showed that unsubstituted heterocyclic N compounds containing two adjacent ring N atoms inhibit nitrification in soil and that two of these compounds, pyrazole and 1, 2, 4 -triazole, are potent inhibitors. They also showed that several substituted pyrazoles and thiadiazoles are effective soil nitrification inhibitors. (Abstract shortened with permission of author. ...|$|E

The urease and nitrification inhibitors tested included those {{considered to be the}} most effective compounds currently available for retardation of urea hydrolysis and nitrification in soil. The pesticides tested included 20 herbicides, 7 insecticides and 6 fungicides;Only two urease inhibitors (2, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone and 2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone) and one nitrification inhibitor (potassium azide) inhibited denitrification when applied at the rate of 50 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil. Two other urease inhibitors (catechol and sodium- 4 -chloromercuribenzoate) and six other nitrification inhibitors (sulfathiazole, potassium ethylxanthate, sodium isopropylxanthate, 4 -nitrobenzotrichloride, sodium thiocarbonate and phenylmercuric acetate) retarded denitrification when applied at the rate of 50 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil to soils amended with mannitol. The other urease and nitrification inhibitors studied either had no significant effect on denitrification, or enhanced denitrification, when applied at rates up to 100 (mu) g g(2 ̆ 7 - 1) soil.
