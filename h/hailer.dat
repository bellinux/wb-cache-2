500|$|Brothers Franz and Carl <b>Hailer</b> and {{the other}} two men in their party were from a German {{reconnaissance}} unit, Flieger-Abteilung A292. Franz <b>Hailer</b> noted, [...] "It was leaving a cloud of black smoke... caused by oil leaking into the cylinders." [...] The engine had to be inverted for this to happen. The Hispano engine was known to flood its inlet manifold with fuel when upside down and then stop running. Franz <b>Hailer</b> and his three companions hurried to the crash site. [...] Ball was already dead when they arrived. [...] The four German airmen agreed that the crashed craft had suffered no battle damage. [...] No bullet wounds were found on Ball's body, even though <b>Hailer</b> went through Ball's clothing to find identification. <b>Hailer</b> also took Ball to a field hospital. A German doctor subsequently described a broken back and a crushed chest, along with fractured limbs, as the cause of death.|$|E

5000|$|There was {{a serious}} {{hit-and-run}} case at the beach at about 4:30 pm on Sunday, 10 July 1983. A red speedboat entered the restricted swimming zone and ran down three young swimmers. The boat did not stop, and sped {{off in the direction}} of Deep Water Bay before police arrived. The crime went unsolved. One of the injured swimmers, 24-year-old Alun Chan Hon-wah, had to have his foot and part of his lower leg amputated. The police classified the case as [...] "endangering life at sea", and the marine police and Marine Department increased patrols around beaches in an effort to protect swimmers' safety. The Urban Council installed new alarm systems and loud <b>hailers</b> at beaches.|$|R
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 7 May 1917, near Douai, 11 British {{aircraft}} from No.56 Squadron led by Ball in an S.E.5 encountered German fighters from Jasta11. A running dogfight in deteriorating visibility resulted, and the aircraft became scattered. [...] Cecil Arthur Lewis, a participant in this fight, described it in his memoir Sagittarius Rising. Ball was last seen by fellow pilots pursuing the red Albatros D.III of the Red Baron's younger brother, Lothar von Richthofen, who eventually landed near Annœullin with a punctured fuel tank. Cyril Crowe observed Ball flying into a dark thundercloud. A German pilot officer on the ground, Lieutenant <b>Hailer,</b> then saw Ball's plane falling upside-down {{from the bottom of}} the cloud, at an altitude of , with a dead prop.|$|E

50|$|In April 1986 the LTTE banned rival militant {{organisation}} Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) and {{set about}} killing its leader Sri Sabaratnam. Sabaratnam went on the run, fleeing from TELO's main base in Kalviyankadu to Neervely, then to Kopay and finally to Kondavil. The LTTE {{found out that he}} was in Kondavil and they, led by Kittu, cordoned off the area and started a house-to-house search, using loud <b>hailers</b> to warn local residents not to shelter Sabaratnam. On 6 May 1986 the LTTE discovered Sabaratnam in a tobacco field and Kittu shot him in the leg to prevent him escaping. Sabaratnam pleaded with Kittu for his life but Kittu shot him using a machine gun. Sabaratnam's bullet ridden body was displayed at Kondavil bus stand before being handed over to his family.|$|R
5000|$|After {{an imaginative}} {{application}} of the theory to how taxi drivers in dangerous cities decide whether to take on board <b>hailers</b> and callers {{on the basis of}} little information, Gambetta’s recent major work, “Codes of the Underworld. How Criminals Communicate” (published by Princeton University Press in 2009), applies signalling theory to analyse how credibility of communication is established in a world where trust is under multiple threats. Thomas Schelling, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, among the first and few to write on the economics of organised crime, wrote that the book [...] "illuminates a vast field of strategic communication where trust cannot be taken for granted. There is nothing comparable in print, and the book's interpretations will carry well beyond the field of conventional crime." [...] The book, listed by New Scientist as one of The best books of 2009, has been described by one reviewer as the product of a “brilliant economic naturalist.” ...|$|R
30|$|The intent {{behind the}} design of AI {{also needs to be}} considered, because some devices can be {{programmed}} to perform in unethical ways. For example, Uber’s algorithm tool ‘Greyball’ was designed to predict which ride <b>hailers</b> might be undercover law-enforcement officers, thereby allowing the company to identify and circumvent local laws [25]. Also, Volkswagen’s algorithm allowed vehicles to pass emissions tests by reducing their nitrogen oxide emissions when they were being tested [25]. Analogously, private-sector designers who create AI algorithms for clinical use could be subject to similar temptations, programming AI systems to guide users toward clinical actions that would generate increased profits for their purchasers (such as by recommending drugs, tests, or medical devices in which they hold a stake or by altering referral patterns) but not necessarily reflect better care [25]. These examples show the urgency for serious regulations and policy initiatives about the use of AI, especially in complicated care practices in which the correct diagnosis of a disease and the best management of a patient can be controversial.|$|R
2500|$|HMS Windsor arrived after dark, and {{was able}} to {{continue}} the embarkation. On clearing the harbour, the captain signalled that there were still British troops requiring evacuation and Vimiera was sent back, arriving in Boulogne at [...] The quayside was deserted but the captain called out using a loud <b>hailer</b> and found {{that a large number of}} men were hiding, who were packed into every available space. When Vimiera arrived at Dover at [...] disembarked. About [...] Guards were left behind, having been wrongly informed that the evacuation had ended, who then attempted a break-out to the north-east. Lanquetot had established his headquarters within the medieval walls of the Haute Ville (Old Town, the Citadel), awaiting the arrival of elements of the 21st Division. When he discovered that disaster had befallen his division, he organised the forces to defend the town as best he could. By the time that Brigadier Fox-Pitt had received orders to evacuate, there were no means of communication with Lanquetot.|$|E

50|$|Soon {{after midnight}} police cars {{equipped}} with loud <b>hailers</b> {{were to be}} sent out to announce an immediate curfew in Colombo city limits. The Central Telegraph Office, Colombo and other city telephone exchanges were to be put out of operation. Newspaper office buildings, Police Headquarters, the CID office and other key points were to be taken over. Armoured cars were to be stationed at certain points to ensure {{the success of the}} operation. Troops from the Panagoda Cantonment were to be prevented from reaching Colombo that night at any cost. Armoured cars and army vehicles fitted with radio equipment, were to be stationed at the two Kelani bridges, the Kirillapone Bridge and other places. Signals Corps Despatch riders, fully armed on motorcycles, were standing by from about 11pm at Torrington (Independence) Square to storm Radio Ceylon once the password 'Holdfast' was given. A special direct telephone line had been laid the previous day, from Army Headquarters at Lower Lake Road to the Echelon Barracks, for use by army personnel. Once the corp was complete the leaders would meet at the Queen's House where they would get the Governor General Sir Oliver Goonetilleke to dissolve parliament and take direct control of the state.|$|R
5000|$|The {{debris from}} the {{destroyed}} Ark fleet now forms an artificial [...] "Ark belt" [...] in Earth orbit, which periodically rains down in small-scale [...] "Arkfalls", which present a hazard for survivors on the surface, but also provide valuable opportunities to salvage advanced technology aboard the Arks. More frequently, most of the debris breaks up on re-entry into shards of metal shrapnel, a dangerous phenomenon known as [...] "razor rain". Electromagnetic distortion created by the malfunctioning Votanformers have rendered most long-distance communication and air transit impossible, isolating far-flung regions much {{as they would have}} been isolated in the 19th century. Low-flying aircraft such as helicopters are still safe to fly, and will still function, but high-altitude long-distance flights are too dangerous; neither the humans nor the Votans are capable of launching vehicles into Earth's orbit anymore, as it is not only dangerous, but prohibitively expensive for societies that only just managed to pull themselves back from complete collapse. Fifteen years after the armistice, a new proposed maglev train line is being built with the goal of re-establishing regular transit between the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America. Short-range radio stations will still function within the localized area of a town, as will personal smartphone-like devices known as <b>hailers,</b> but otherwise, the disruption of long-range telecommunications means that information must be sent between different regions by courier. At best, an unreliable method known as [...] "text relay" [...] can be used, in which local radio-stations rebroadcast a message received from a neighboring station to reach other regions of the continent, but this can take days or weeks.|$|R
60|$|Saxon and Billy {{were gone}} {{weeks on the}} trip south, {{but in the end}} they came back to Carmel. They had stopped with Hafler, the poets in the Marble House, which he had built with his own hands. This queer {{dwelling}} was all in one room, built almost entirely of white marble. <b>Hailer</b> cooked, as over a campfire, in the huge marble fireplace, which he used in all ways as a kitchen. There were divers shelves of books, and the massive furniture he had made from redwood, as he had made the shakes for the roof. A blanket, stretched across a corner, gave Saxon privacy. The poet {{was on the verge of}} departing for San Francisco and New York, but remained a day over with them to explain the country and run over the government land with Billy. Saxon had wanted to go along that morning, but Hafler scornfully rejected her, telling her that her legs were too short. That night, when the men returned, Billy was played out to exhaustion. He frankly acknowledged that Hafler had walked him into the ground, and that his tongue had been hanging out from the first hour. Hafler estimated that they had covered fifty-five miles.|$|E
