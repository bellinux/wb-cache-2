40|$|Abstract—In this paper, an {{adaptive}} MIMO {{neural network model}} is used for simultaneously modeling and identifying the forward <b>kinematics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 3 -DOF robot manipulator. The nonlinear features of the robot manipulator kinematics system are modeled by {{an adaptive}} MIMO neural network model based on differential evolution algorithm. A differential evolution algorithm is used to optimally generate the appropriate neural weights so as to perfectly characterize the nonlinear features <b>of</b> the forward <b>kinematics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 3 -DOF robot manipulator. This paper supports {{the performance of the}} proposed differential evolution algorithm in comparison with the conventional back-propagation algorithm. The results show that the proposed adaptive MIMO neural network model trained by the differential evolution algorithm for identifying the forward <b>kinematics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 3 -DOF robot manipulator is successfully modeled and performed well.

40|$|The forward <b>kinematics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{parallel}} manipulator is {{so difficult}} that the analytical solutions <b>of</b> only <b>a</b> few parallel manipulators have been found. The forward <b>kinematics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> three-degree-of-freedom planar parallel manipulator, where the base and the mobile platforms are two similar triangles, is studied in this paper and its analytical solution is provided. The final solution is two independent univariate quadratic equations. As well, the forward kinematics solution is simplified to the parallel manipulator where the two triangles are equilateral and a numerical example is presented.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{temporal}} <b>kinematics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stroke, spino-pelvic <b>kinematics,</b> trunk and quadriceps muscle activation in prolonged rgometer rowing between males and female rowers. Twelve adolescent rowers performed a 20 minute rowing ergometer trial at a high self perceived rate <b>of</b> exertion. Spino-pelvic <b>kinematics,</b> muscle activity and temporal kinematics data were compared in the 1 st, 10 th and 20 th minute. The results from this study indicate there is a difference in temporal <b>kinematics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rowing stroke between adolescent males and females.
