25|$|Lectors {{were well}} {{respected}} and often highly educated. Most {{could look at}} text written in English or Italian and read <b>it</b> <b>aloud</b> in Spanish, {{the language of the}} factories. The lectors were hired and fired by the tabaqueros, not the factory owners. Their salary was paid directly by the workers through a small deduction from everyone’s weekly earnings. Despite the cost, the tabaqueros enthusiastically sustained the lector tradition.|$|E
25|$|Vestiges was {{initially}} well received by polite Victorian society {{and became an}} international bestseller, but its unorthodox themes contradicted the natural theology fashionable {{at the time and}} were reviled by clergymen – and subsequently by scientists who readily found fault with its amateurish deficiencies. The ideas in the book were favoured by Radicals, but its presentation remained popular with a much wider public. Prince Albert read <b>it</b> <b>aloud</b> to Queen Victoria in 1845. Vestiges caused a shift in popular opinion which – Charles Darwin believed – prepared the public mind for the scientific theories of evolution by natural selection which followed from the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859.|$|E

25|$|King Louis XVI {{used his}} veto power to prevent decrees against émigrés and the non-juring clergy. Madame Roland {{therefore}} {{wrote a letter}} addressing the royal refusal to sanction the decrees {{and the role of}} the king in the state, which her husband addressed and sent to the king. When it remained unanswered, Roland read <b>it</b> <b>aloud</b> in full council and in the king's presence. Judged inconsistent with a minister's position and disrespectful in tone, the incident led to Roland's dismissal. However, he then read the letter to the Assembly, which ordered it printed and circulated. It became a manifesto of dissatisfaction, and the Assembly's subsequent demand that Roland and other dismissed ministers be reinstated eventually led to the king's dethronement.|$|E
25|$|Her father, {{as well as}} his {{elder brother}} Timothy, and, still more, a son of the latter, had been {{accustomed}} to write in measured rhyme, their poems sometimes appearing in the local papers; and perhaps it was not strange that Harriett should, as soon as she could hold a pen, make crude attempts in the same direction. She was furnished with a copy book in which she wrote slowly and laboriously; and she soon turned surreptitiously {{to the back of the}} book and werote loose rhymes that were jingling in her brain. On one occasion, the teacher passed by her desk when she was just finishing a rhymed account of some event which had occurred in the school room. Something must have attracted the teacher's attention; for he noticed her book, grabbed it, and, after running it through by himself, with a laugh, he proceeded to read <b>it</b> <b>aloud</b> to the school. When class was over, she scurried home. Thought her father soothed her ruffled mood, her copy-book confidences were discontinued.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 1861, Chase and an aide, Captain Ebenezer Farrand, {{formerly}} {{second in}} command at the Pensacola Navy Yard, appeared at Fort Pickens to demand the surrender of the fort and garrison. Slemmer and his {{second in command}}, Second Lieutenant J. H. Gilman, met Chase outside the fort. Slemmer refused to allow Chase and Farrand in the fort, even though Chase said he had built the fort and would learn nothing from entering it. Slemmer replied that Chase {{did not know what}} preparations he had made and Chase proceeded to state his business. Lieutenant Gilman reported that Chase said he wanted to avoid bloodshed and that he had written his demand in proper form and would read it. Lieutenant Gilman reported that Chase's voice shook and his eyes filled with tears as he began his demand that the U.S. Army surrender Fort Pickens, a structure that he had designed and built as a captain with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Chase handed the paper to Farrand to read but Farrand could not see it well at night without his glasses so Gilman had to read <b>it</b> <b>aloud.</b>|$|E

500|$|During this period, Congress was debating a Puerto Rico Tariff Act {{that would}} have been unconstitutional had the first {{definition}} been kept. This was a largely partisan issue at the time—the Republicans were in favor of this Act, but it was strongly denounced by Democrats. During the ensuing debate, the existence of the original report was discovered by the Democrats, who requested that the War Department release the earlier report to them so they could be compared [...] "side by side". The request was refused, but a copy of the report was leaked, allowing Minority Leader James D. Richardson to read <b>it</b> <b>aloud</b> on the Senate floor, prior to the vote. These efforts failed; the vote remained along party lines and the measure was passed.|$|E
500|$|On {{the way to}} a library, Cassie finds {{a mysterious}} Halloween store in an alley and goes inside. The store owner (Tobin Bell) insists on selling her an old book titled The Evil Thing, which {{contains}} a warning not to read <b>it</b> <b>aloud</b> or think about its monster called [...] "The Evil Thing", a two-headed creature that sucks blood while the other head eats meat. That night, Cassie ignores the warning in the book and reads it to Max as revenge for him unplugging her computer {{in the middle of a}} report she was writing. Priscilla Wright (Brittany Curran), a school bully who stole The Evil Thing from Cassie's bag in school, films her jumping in fear, after using a CD player to play monster sounds outside in order to make the monster appear to have come to life.|$|E
500|$|The introduction, with {{instructions}} that the Dungeon Master read <b>it</b> <b>aloud</b> to the players, outlines {{that there is}} a treasure in the Yatil Mountains south of the Greyhawk realm of Perrenland. [...] The player characters must investigate rumors of a lost treasure that scores of adventurers have perished attempting to find. [...] The treasure is a remnant of the wealth amassed by the archmage Iggwilv, former ruler of Perrenland, prior to her presumed death {{at the hands of the}} demon Graz'zt, whom she had [...] "imprisoned and forced into servitude." [...] The players must first traverse a wilderness area with 20 numbered encounters before arriving at the caverns. [...] The encounters have names such as [...] "Border Patrol" [...] (encounter 1) and [...] "Hill Giants" [...] (encounter 10). [...] After the wilderness are two lettered encounters: the [...] "Gnome Vale", which includes a map for their lair, and [...] "The Craggy Dells", where humans and orcs are capturing hippogriffs to sell.|$|E

500|$|Lucky Lara from Manila Standard Today {{listed the}} Sondheim songs as {{highlights}} from the album, commenting how they fit Madonna's [...] "nasal voice as a glove", and their addition to Madonna's catalogue of songs {{would give her}} [...] "the edge in future career moves". According to Lara, with [...] "Sooner or Later", Madonna [...] "shows off a side to her singing that audiences haven't heard yet, and what a side it is. She proves to her critics that she isn't just the glitter and trash of the dance club scene, and that she can belt it out nearly {{as well as the}} best of them". According to Ray Boren from Deseret News [...] "is very much a period piece, with an intimate club feel". Another positive review came from Mark Coleman from Rolling Stone, who described the song as Madonna's [...] "breathy emotionality", observing that Madonna did not whisper the line [...] "I always get my man", rather sang <b>it</b> <b>aloud,</b> bringing [...] "conviction to a somewhat generic line". According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, songs including [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] are [...] "typical Sondheim, with agile wordplay and devious chromatic harmonies".|$|E
500|$|In late 1905, Roosevelt {{received}} {{a copy of}} Long's book Northern Trails from the publisher. Based upon the author's travels in Canada, {{most of the stories}} involved a noble, white wolf named Wayeeses. As in other works, Long asserted that [...] "every incident in this wolf's life, from his grasshopper hunting to the cunning caribou chase, and from the den in the rocks to the meeting of wolf and children on the storm-swept barrens, is minutely true in fact, and is based squarely upon my own observations and that of my Indians." [...] While Roosevelt reportedly enjoyed a majority of the book—he even read <b>it</b> <b>aloud</b> to his children—he found fault with Long's dramatic description of how a wolf killed caribou by piercing the animal's heart with its teeth. [...] "A terrific rush," [...] Long wrote in Northern Trails, [...] "a quick snap under the stag's chest just behind the fore legs, where the heart lay". Drawing upon his own extensive hunting experience, Roosevelt wrote confidentially to the book's publisher about Long's description being [...] "sheer nonsense", concluding that it [...] "is so very unusual" [...] and anatomically impossible that it could not be true. In his letter, of which he also sent a copy to Burroughs, Roosevelt pointed out the physical difficulty a wolf would have if attempting to kill its prey in such a manner, while also commenting upon the unlikeliness of other wolf stories written by Long.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Caligari is told abstractly, like a fairy tale, and {{includes}} little description about or attention toward the psychological motivations of the characters, {{which is more}} heavily emphasized in the film's visual style. The original script shows few traces of the Expressionist influence prevalent in the film's sets and costumes. Through film director Fritz Lang, Janowitz and Mayer met with Erich Pommer, head of production at the Decla-Bioscop film studio, on 19 April 1919, to discuss selling the script. According to Pommer, he attempted {{to get rid of}} them, but they persisted until he agreed to meet with them. Pommer reportedly asked the writers to leave the script with him, but they refused, and instead Mayer read <b>it</b> <b>aloud</b> to him. Pommer and his assistant, Julius Sternheim, were so impressed that he refused to let them leave until a contract was signed, and he purchased the script from them that night. The writers had originally sought no fewer than 10,000 marks, but were given 3,500, with the promise of another 2,000 once the film went into production and 500 if it was sold for foreign release, which the producers considered unlikely. The contract, today preserved at Berlin's Bundesfilmarchiv, gave Pommer the right to make any changes to the script deemed appropriate. Pommer said he was drawn to the script because he believed it could be filmed inexpensively, and it bore similarities to films inspired by the macabre horror shows of the Grand Guignol theatre in Paris, which were popular at the time. Pommer later said: [...] "They saw in the script an 'experiment'. I saw a relatively cheap film".|$|E

2500|$|The Goons made a {{considerable}} {{impact on the}} humour of The Beatles, and especially on John Lennon. On 30 September 1973, Lennon reviewed the book The Goon Show Scripts for The New York Times. He wrote: [...] "I was 12 when The Goon Show first hit me, 16 when they finished with me. Their humour was the only proof {{that the world was}} insane. One of my earlier efforts at writing was a 'newspaper' called The Daily Howl. I would write it at night, then take it into school and read <b>it</b> <b>aloud</b> to my friends. Looking at it now, it seems strangely similar to The Goon Show." [...] Lennon also noted that George Martin, the Beatles' long-time producer, had previously made records with both Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers.|$|E
2500|$|The book {{quickly became}} a best-seller, and a {{sensation}} which was eagerly read in royal circles. Every afternoon for a period early in 1845, Prince Albert read <b>it</b> <b>aloud</b> to Queen Victoria as a suitable popular science book explaining the latest ideas from the continent. Abraham Lincoln {{is reported to have}} read the book and been [...] "deeply impressed with the notion of the so-called 'universal law' – evolution." [...] It was well received by middle class readers and unorthodox clergymen, particularly of Nonconformist church groups such as Unitarians. At first scientists ignored the book and it took time before hostile reviews were published, but the book was then publicly denounced by scientists, preachers, and statesmen. Notably, Sir David Brewster, wrote a very critical review of the work in the North British Review, where he stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|Scholar Jean-Paul Himka has {{characterized}} the Galician clergy as having [...] "an Orthodox face, Roman Catholic citizenship and an enlightened Austrian soul." [...] This Austrianism manifested itself {{not only in}} loyalty to the Habsburg dynasty but also in following the role ascribed {{to them by the}} Austrian emperor as Enlighteners and educators of the Ukrainian community. Priests were heavily involved in spreading literacy in western Ukraine. [...] The first West Ukrainian grammar of the Ukrainian language was published by a priest who also translated Goethe and Schiller into Ukrainian. Two thirds of the participants of a Congress of scholars called in 1848 to standardize the Ukrainian language and introduce educational reforms were members of the clergy. Priests actively supported the first Ukrainian newspaper, Zorya Halytska ("Galician Star"), either reading <b>it</b> <b>aloud</b> to illiterate peasants or having their cantors do so. Between 1842 and 1856 approximately 1,000 parish schools were established in the Lviv eparchy. Of 43 Ukrainian-language books published in Galicia between 1837 and 1850, 40 were written by members of the clergy.|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} during {{the days of the}} Temple, seven days before Yom Kippur, they would move the High Priest from his house to the cell of the counselors and prepare another priest to take his place in case {{anything}} impure happened to him to make him unfit to perform the service. Rabbi Judah said that they prepared another wife for him, in case his wife should die, as [...] says that [...] "he shall make atonement for himself and for his house" [...] and [...] "his house" [...] means [...] "his wife." [...] But they told Rabbi Judah that if they would do so, then there would be no end to the matter, as they would have to prepare a third wife in case the second died, and so on. The rest of the year, the High Priest would offer sacrifices only if he wanted to, but during the seven days before Yom Kippur, he would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifices, burn the incense, trim the lamps, and offer the head and the hind leg of the sacrifices. They brought sages from the court to the High Priest, and throughout the seven days they read to him about the order of the service. They asked the High Priest to read <b>it</b> <b>aloud,</b> in case he had forgotten or never learned.|$|E

On the day of the vote, Democrats were still working to ensure they had the votes needed to pass the bill. [...] Republicans tried to pull back their proposed amendments, realizing they were giving the Democrats more time to corral votes, however, they were unable to pull their proposed amendments off the floor.

[...] He voiced opposition to the practice of changing bills in the middle of the night before the vote, and concern that the Manager's amendment made substantial changes to the bill. [...] He did not want the House to vote on the bill before the members could learn what was in the amendment, so he read much of <b>it</b> <b>aloud.</b> [...] Manager's amendments are supposed to be for clerical changes only, not substantive ones.
