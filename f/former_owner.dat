5|$|Her {{journeys}} {{into the}} land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she {{used a variety of}} subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a <b>former</b> <b>owner</b> in Dorchester County, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E

5|$|By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was manumitted {{from slavery}} {{at the age}} of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's will, though his actual age was closer to 55. He {{continued}} working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family, who had held him as a slave. Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status. The lawyer discovered that a <b>former</b> <b>owner</b> had issued instructions that Rit, like her husband, would be manumitted {{at the age of}} 45. The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families had ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves. Challenging it legally was an impossible task for Tubman.|$|E

5|$|In Evansville, Indiana, Mission Broadcasting {{acquired}} then-independent station WTVW (now a CW affiliate) in 2011 {{with its}} <b>former</b> <b>owner</b> Nexstar Broadcasting retaining operational duties under an SSA. WTVW consolidated news operations with ABC affiliate WEHT, for which Nexstar traded WTVW to Mission {{in exchange for}} acquiring WEHT from Gilmore Broadcasting Corporation, and had its newscast output reduced through the reductions of its weekday morning newscast from four hours to two and its 6:00p.m. newscast – except on Sundays, where it remained one hour – from one hour to 30 minutes (leaving only a two-hour morning newscast, half-hour noon and 6:30p.m. newscasts and an hour-long newscast at 9:00p.m.).

According to the series' canon, Dogmeat was adopted by the Vault Dweller on 30 December 2161, and killed by a force field barrier during the Vault Dweller's assault on the Master's Military Base on 20 April 2162. Dogmeat was supposed to appear in the canceled film adaptation of the game as well.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a local {{businessman}} named Louis Edwards began accruing {{shares in}} Manchester United and was eventually made chairman on Hardman's death in 1965. His son, Martin Edwards, purchased {{a percentage of}} shares from Alan Gibson – son of <b>former</b> <b>owner</b> James Gibson – and became the majority shareholder and chairman when Louis Edwards died in 1980. During Martin Edwards' time as chairman, Manchester United {{was the subject of}} several takeover bids; the first came from media tycoon Robert Maxwell, who bid £10million in February 1984, but the sale fell through before any serious talks could take place. In 1989, property magnate Michael Knighton {{was on the verge of}} completing a £20million takeover, but his financial backers pulled out at the last minute and he had to be content with merely a seat on the board.|$|E

5|$|Olaf and Thorgerd lived happily {{together}} at Hoskuldstead for some time. Around 962 Olaf's foster father Thord died, leaving Olaf his property and goðorð Olaf bought land {{and built a}} new homestead at Hjardarholt, which, according to the saga, he had to cleanse of the draugr of its <b>former</b> <b>owner,</b> Killer-Hrapp. As time went on people began to settle near Olaf's hall and regarded him as their goði. Olaf's ever-increasing wealth caused jealousy from Hoskuld's wife Jorunn. Around the same time Olaf and Thorgerd had a daughter, Thurid. Hjardarholt was renowned for its rich decorations; some two decades later, the skald Úlfr Uggason composed the famous poem Húsdrápa, about certain mythological scenes illustrated {{on the walls of}} Olaf's hall.|$|E
5|$|One of these, The Talk of the Town, was {{the first}} three-time World Grand Champion. Midnight Sun was also great-grandsire of I Am Jose, the second three-time winner. Most of the leading Tennessee Walker sires {{in recent years have}} {{themselves}} been descendants of Midnight Sun. Midnight Sun sired approximately 2,600 foals in his lifetime, and during his stud career earned his owners close to $100,000 a year, mostly through the then-new use of artificial insemination (AI). Through his offspring, he has also influenced the Racking Horse and Spotted Saddle Horse breeds. For many years, a life-size statue of Midnight Sun, commissioned after his death by his <b>former</b> <b>owner</b> Geraldine Livingston, stood at the TWHBEA headquarters in Lewisburg, Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, NBN {{was granted}} a licence to operate a {{translator}} in the Upper Hunter from Rossgole Lookout near Aberdeen, on VHF channel 10. Concurrently in April 1972, NBN expanded its nightly news service to one hour, becoming the first television station in Australia to have a one-hour news bulletin. As a part of earlier preparations for colour production, between 1972 and 1973, orders were placed with Rank Cintel and the EMI Group in the United Kingdom and Ampex in the United States for new colour equipment, in time for colour transmission tests on 7 October 1974. On 1 March 1975, the station began regular colour transmissions, whilst transmission was expanded to Banderra Downs, Merriwa, Mount Helen, and Murrurundi {{at a cost of}} A$180,000. In 1978, the Newcastle Broadcasting and Television Corporation made a bid for local station (and <b>former</b> <b>owner)</b> 2HD, however was disallowed by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Also during the same year more extensions were added to the studios, which included a new car park, and was officially opened on 17 November 1978.|$|E
5|$|Kosmos {{was bought}} by the Skaugen Group in 1988, and on 21 October, Kosmos' Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Bjørn Bettum and Chairman Otto Grieg Tidemand were fired. The Skaugen Group decided to {{integrate}} Kosmos' shipping and oil-related activities into their group. All other investments, including Norsk Air, were to be sold or closed. At the time, Norsk Air had 140 employees. Norsk Air's CEO, Mr. Røsjodet, made contact with Bård Mikkelsen, who was CEO of Widerøe, {{to try to convince}} them to purchase Norsk Air. Widerøe was a that time solely occupied with flying on the subsidized regional routes. The company was interested in having some non-subsidized routes to better benchmark its operations. The two largest owners, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Braathens SAFE, did not want to purchase Norsk Air, but the third-largest owner, Fred. Olsen & Co. liked the idea, and bought SAS' and Braathens SAFE's 62.3 percent stake in Widerøe to make the deal possible. Other possible purchasers who had negotiated with Norsk Air were Sterling Airlines, Partnair and Jan Einar Johansen, <b>former</b> <b>owner</b> of Scandi Line.|$|E
