According to our algorithm ⌊n/ 2 ⌋+ 2 partial products are derived.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} area-power {{efficient}} modulo 2 n + 1 multiplier is proposed. The result and one operand {{for the new}} modulo multipliers use weighted representation, while the other uses the diminished- 1. By using the radix- 4 Booth recoding, the new multipliers {{reduce the number of}} the partial products to n/ 2 for even and (n+ 1) / 2 for odd except for one correction term. According to our algorithm, the resulting partial products are added through inverted <b>end</b> <b>around</b> <b>carry</b> save adder into two operands, which are finally adder by a 2 -stage n-bit adder containing 2 : 1 multiplexer. By using the purposed adder, the new multipliers reduce the area and power. The analytical and experimental result indicates that the new modulo 2 n + 1 multipliers, offer reduced power and more compact area among all the existing structures...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cryptographic {{algorithms}} such as International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) {{have found}} various applications in secure {{transmission of the}} data in networked instrumentation and distributed measurement systems. Modulo 2 n + 1 multiplier and squarer play {{a pivotal role in}} the implementation of such crypto-algorithms. In this work, an efficient hardware design of the IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) using novel modulo 2 n + 1 multiplier and squarer as the basic modules is proposed for faster, smaller and low-power IDEA hardware circuits. Novel hardware implementation of the modulo 2 n + 1 multiplier is shown by using the efficient compressors and sparse tree based inverted <b>end</b> <b>around</b> <b>carry</b> adders is given. The novel modules are applied on IDEA algorithm and the resulting implementation is compared both qualitatively and quantitatively with the IDEA implementation using the existing multiplier/squarer implementations. Experimental measurement results show that the proposed design is faster and smaller and also consume less power than similar hardware implementations making it a viable option for efficient hardware designs.
