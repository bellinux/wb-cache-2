5|$|Many actin-related {{molecules}} {{create a}} free barbed end for polymerization by uncapping or severing pre-existing filaments and using these as actin nucleation cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates actin polymerization {{by creating a}} new nucleation core. Actin nucleation is an initial step {{in the formation of}} an actin filament. The nucleation core activity of Arp2/3 is activated by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a nucleation core. However, de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre-existing filaments. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to pre-existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent <b>depolymerization</b> and thus conserve the actin filament.|$|E
25|$|Thermal <b>depolymerization</b> (TDP) is a <b>depolymerization</b> process using hydrous {{pyrolysis}} for {{the reduction}} of complex organic materials (usually waste products of various sorts, often biomass and plastic) into light crude oil. It mimics the natural geological processes thought {{to be involved in}} the production of fossil fuels. Under pressure and heat, long chain polymers of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon decompose into short-chain petroleum hydrocarbons with a maximum length of around 18 carbons.|$|E
25|$|A {{small amount}} of {{acrylate}} comonomers are routinely used in PMMA grades destined for heat processing, since this stabilizes the polymer to <b>depolymerization</b> ("unzipping") during processing.|$|E
25|$|Phalloidin, is a toxin {{that has}} been {{isolated}} from the death cap mushroom Amanita phalloides. It binds to the interface between adjacent actin monomers in the F-actin polymer, preventing its <b>depolymerization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The cancer-fighting taxane {{class of}} drugs (paclitaxel (taxol) and docetaxel) block dynamic {{instability}} by stabilizing GDP-bound tubulin in the microtubule. Thus, even when hydrolysis of GTP reaches {{the tip of}} the microtubule, there is no <b>depolymerization</b> and the microtubule does not shrink back.|$|E
25|$|Many {{agricultural}} and animal wastes could be processed, {{but many of}} these are already used as fertilizer, animal feed, and, in some cases, as feedstocks for paper mills or as boiler fuel. Energy crops constitute another potentially large feedstock for thermal <b>depolymerization.</b>|$|E
25|$|Microtubule {{polymers}} {{are extremely}} sensitive to various environmental effects. Very {{low levels of}} free calcium can destabilize microtubules and this prevented early researchers from studying the polymer in vitro. Cold temperatures also cause rapid <b>depolymerization</b> of microtubules. In contrast, heavy water promotes microtubule polymer stability.|$|E
25|$|Little {{attention}} is paid to actin isoforms, however {{it has been shown that}} different isoforms of actin are present in the cell nucleus. Actin isoforms, despite of their high sequence similarity, have different biochemical properties such as polymerization and <b>depolymerization</b> kinetic. They also shows different localization and functions.|$|E
25|$|Thermal <b>depolymerization</b> {{is similar}} to the {{geological}} processes that produced the fossil fuels used today, except that the technological process occurs in a timeframe measured in hours. Until recently, the human-designed processes were not efficient enough to serve as a practical source of fuelmore energy was required than was produced.|$|E
25|$|MTs {{associated}} to kinetochores present special features: compared to free MTs, kMTs {{are much more}} resistant to cold-induced <b>depolymerization,</b> high hydrostatic pressures or calcium exposure. Furthermore, kMTs are recycled much more slowly than astral MTs and spindle MTs with free (+) ends, and if kMTs are released from kinetochores using a laser beam, they rapidly depolymerize.|$|E
25|$|Superheated {{water can}} be used to {{chemically}} convert organic material into fuel products. This is known by several terms, including direct hydrothermal liquefaction, and hydrous pyrolysis. A few commercial scale applications exist. Thermal <b>depolymerization</b> or thermal conversion (TCC) uses superheated water at about 250°C to convert turkey waste into a light fuel oil and is said to process 200 tons of low grade waste into fuel oil a day.|$|E
25|$|By comparison, {{the current}} {{processes}} {{used to produce}} ethanol and biodiesel from agricultural sources have EROEI in the 4.2 range, when the energy used to produce the feedstocks is accounted for (in this case, usually sugar cane, corn, soybeans and the like). These EROEI values are not directly comparable, because these EROEI calculations include the energy cost to produce the feedstock, whereas the above EROEI calculation for thermal <b>depolymerization</b> process (TDP) does not.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, the cytosolic protein p26, a pyrophosphatase, is {{inhibited}} by phosphorylation, possibly {{resulting in}} arrest of synthesis of molecular building blocks, required for tube elongation. There is <b>depolymerization</b> and reorganization of actin filaments, within the pollen cytoskeleton. Within 10 {{minutes from the}} placement on the stigma, the pollen is committed to a process which ends in its death. At 3–4 hours past pollination, fragmentation of pollen DNA begins, and finally (at 10–14 hours), the cell dies apoptotically.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{floaters}} is shrinkage of the vitreous humour. This gel-like substance consists of 99% water and 1% solid elements. The solid portion consists of a network of collagen and hyaluronic acid, with the latter retaining water molecules. <b>Depolymerization</b> of this network makes the hyaluronic acid release its trapped water, thereby liquefying the gel. The collagen breaks down into fibrils, which ultimately are the floaters that plague the patient. Floaters caused in this way tend to be few in number and of a linear form.|$|E
25|$|Algae {{is under}} {{development}} {{for use in}} biofuels. Researchers in Singapore were working on GM jatropha for biofuel production. Syngenta has USDA approval to market a maize trademarked Enogen that has been genetically modified to convert its starch to sugar for ethanol. In 2013, the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology was investigating poplar trees genetically engineered to contain less lignin to ease conversion into ethanol. Lignin is the critical limiting factor when using wood to make bio-ethanol because lignin limits the accessibility of cellulose microfibrils to <b>depolymerization</b> by enzymes.|$|E
25|$|The actin {{cytoskeleton}} in vivo is {{not exclusively}} composed of actin, other proteins {{are required for}} its formation, continuance and function. These proteins are called actin-binding proteins (ABP) and {{they are involved in}} actin’s polymerization, <b>depolymerization,</b> stability, organisation in bundles or networks, fragmentation and destruction. The diversity of these proteins is such that actin is thought to be the protein that takes part in the greatest number of protein-protein interactions. For example, G-actin sequestering elements exist that impede its incorporation into microfilaments. There are also proteins that stimulate its polymerization or that give complexity to the synthesizing networks.|$|E
25|$|Another process {{involves}} {{conversion of}} assorted polymers into petroleum by {{a much less}} precise thermal <b>depolymerization</b> process. Such a process {{would be able to}} accept almost any polymer or mix of polymers, including thermoset materials such as vulcanized rubber tires and the biopolymers in feathers and other agricultural waste. Like natural petroleum, the chemicals produced can be used as fuels or as feedstock. A RESEM Technology plant of this type in Carthage, Missouri, USA, uses turkey waste as input material. Gasification is a similar process but is not technically recycling since polymers are not likely to become the result.|$|E
25|$|Pathogenic C. difficile strains produce {{multiple}} toxins. The most well-characterized are enterotoxin (Clostridium difficile toxin A) and cytotoxin (Clostridium difficile toxin B), both {{of which}} may produce diarrhea and inflammation in infected patients, although their relative contributions have been debated. Toxins A and B are glucosyltransferases that target and inactivate the Rho family of GTPases. Toxin B (cytotoxin) induces actin <b>depolymerization</b> by a mechanism correlated with {{a decrease in the}} ADP-ribosylation of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins. Another toxin, binary toxin, also has been described, but its role in disease is not fully understood.|$|E
25|$|The {{cellular}} cytoskeleton is {{a dynamic}} system that functions on many different levels: In addition to giving the cell a particular form and supporting the transport of vesicles and organelles, it can also influence gene expression. However, the signal transduction mechanisms involved in this communication are little understood. Notwithstanding this, {{the relationship between the}} drug-mediated <b>depolymerization</b> of microtubules and the specific expression of transcription factors has been described, which has provided information on the differential expression of the genes depending on the presence of these factors. This communication between the cytoskeleton and the regulation of the cellular response is also related to the action of growth factors: for example, this relation exists for connective tissue growth factor.|$|E
25|$|Prions, the {{infectious}} agent of CJD, {{may not be}} inactivated by means of routine surgical instrument sterilization procedures. The World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that instrumentation used in such cases be immediately destroyed after use; short of destruction, {{it is recommended that}} heat and chemical decontamination be used in combination to process instruments that come in contact with high-infectivity tissues. No cases of iatrogenic transmission of CJD have been reported subsequent to the adoption of current sterilization procedures, or since 1976. Copper-hydrogen peroxide has been suggested {{as an alternative to the}} current recommendation of sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite. Thermal <b>depolymerization</b> also destroys prions in infected organic and inorganic matter, since the process chemically attacks protein at the molecular level, although more effective and practical methods involve destruction by combinations of detergents and enzymes similar to biological washing powders.|$|E
25|$|Glutaraldehyde and {{formaldehyde}} solutions (also used as fixatives) {{are accepted}} liquid sterilizing agents, {{provided that the}} immersion time is sufficiently long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid {{can take up to}} 22 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde. The presence of solid particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective. Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time required for the fixative to penetrate. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are volatile, and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf life (<2 weeks), and is expensive. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf life if some methanol is added to inhibit polymerization to paraformaldehyde, but is much more volatile. Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site by <b>depolymerization</b> of solid paraformaldehyde. Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} MTs {{attached}} to one kinetochore is variable: in Saccharomyces cerevisiae only one MT binds each kinetochore, whereas in mammals {{there can be}} among 15-35 MTs bound to each kinetochore. However, not all the MTs in the spindle attach to one kinetochore. There are MTs that extend from one centrosome to the other (and {{they are responsible for}} spindle length) and some shorter ones are interdigitated between the long MTs. Professor B. Nicklas (Duke University), showed that, if one breaks down the MT-kinetochore attachment using a laser beam, chromatids can no longer move, leading to an abnormal chromosome distribution. These experiments also showed that kinetochores have polarity, and that kinetochore attachment to MTs emanating from one or the other centrosome will depend on its orientation. This specificity guarantees that only one chromatid will move to each spindle side, thus ensuring the correct distribution of the genetic material. Thus, one of the basic functions of the kinetochore is the MT attachment to the spindle, which is essential to correctly segregate sister chromatids. If anchoring is incorrect, errors may ensue, generating aneuploidy, with catastrophic consequences for the cell. To prevent this from happening, there are mechanisms of error detection and correction (as the spindle assembly checkpoint), whose components reside also on the kinetochores.The movement of one chromatid towards the centrosome is produced primarily by MT <b>depolymerization</b> in the binding site with the kinetochore. These movements require also force generation, involving molecular motors likewise located on the kinetochores.|$|E

2500|$|Entropy is {{the measure}} of {{randomness}} or chaos. [...] A system has a lower entropy when there are few objects {{in the system and}} has a higher entropy when there are many objects in the system. [...] Because the process of <b>depolymerization</b> involves a polymer being broken down into its monomers, <b>depolymerization</b> increases entropy. [...] In the Gibbs free energy equation, the entropy term is negative. [...] Enthalpy drives polymerizations. [...] At low temperatures, the enthalpy term is greater than the [...] term, which allows polymerization to occur. [...] At the ceiling temperature, the enthalpy term and the entropy term are equal. [...] Above the ceiling temperature, the rate of <b>depolymerization</b> is greater than the rate of polymerization, which inhibits the formation of the given polymer. [...] The ceiling temperature can be defined by ...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{chromosome}} {{movements in}} relation to spindle poles are associated to lengthening and shortening of kMTs. One {{of the most interesting}} features of kinetochores is their capacity to modify the state of their associated kMTs (around 20) from a <b>depolymerization</b> state at their (+) end to polymerization state. This allows the kinetochores from cells at prometaphase to show [...] "directional instability", changing between persistent phases of movement towards the pole (poleward) or inversed (anti-poleward), which are coupled with alternating states of kMTs <b>depolymerization</b> and polymerization, respectively. This kinetochore bi-stability seem {{to be part of a}} mechanism to align the chromosomes at the equator of the spindle without losing the mechanic connection between kinetochores and spindle poles. It is thought that kinetochore bi-stability is based upon the dynamic instability of the kMTs (+) end, and it is partially controlled by the tension present at the kinetochore. In mammalian cultured cells, a low tension at kinetochores promotes change towards kMTs <b>depolymerization,</b> and high tension promotes change towards kMTs polymerization.|$|E
2500|$|Actin forms {{filaments}} ('F-actin' or microfilaments) {{that are}} essential elements of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, able to undergo very fast polymerization and <b>depolymerization</b> dynamics.

2500|$|KinI kinesins {{are named}} [...] "I" [...] because they present an {{internal}} motor domain, which uses ATP to promote <b>depolymerization</b> of tubulin polymer, the microtubule.

The technology was finally developed for commercial use in 1996 by Changing World Technologies (CWT). Brian S. Appel (CEO of CWT) took the technology in 2001 and expanded and changed it into what is now referred to as TCP (Thermal Conversion Process), and has applied for and obtained several patents (see, for example, published patent , issued August 23, 2011). A Thermal <b>Depolymerization</b> demonstration plant was completed in 1999 in Philadelphia by Thermal <b>Depolymerization,</b> LLC, and the first full-scale commercial plant was constructed in Carthage, Missouri, about [...] from ConAgra Foods' massive Butterball turkey plant, where {{it is expected to}} process about 200 tons of turkey waste into [...] of oil per day.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the ceiling}} temperature, {{there will always}} be excess {{monomers}} in the polymer due to the equilibrium between polymerization and <b>depolymerization.</b> [...] Polymers derived from simple vinyl monomers have such high ceiling temperatures that only a [...] amount of monomers remain in the polymer at ordinary temperatures. [...] The situation for α-methylstyrene, PhC(Me)=CH2, is an exception to this trend. [...] Its ceiling temperature is around 66 °C. Steric hindrance is significant in polymers derived from α-methylstyrene because the phenyl and methyl groups are bonded to the same carbon. [...] These steric effects in combination with stability of the tertiary benzylic α-methylstyryl radical give α-methylstyrene its relatively low ceiling temperature. [...] When a polymer has a very high ceiling temperature, it degrades via bond cleavage reactions instead of <b>depolymerization.</b> A similar effect explains the relatively low ceiling temperature for poly(isobutylene).|$|E

[...] For example, +TIPs have been observed to participate in the interactions of microtubules with chromosomes during mitosis. [...] The first MAP to be identified as a +TIP was CLIP170 (cytoplasmic linker protein), which has been shown to play a role in microtubule <b>depolymerization</b> rescue events. Additional examples of +TIPs include EB1, EB2, EB3, p150Glued, Dynamitin, Lis1, CLIP115, CLASP1, and CLASP2.|$|E

2500|$|Dynamic {{instability}} {{refers to}} the coexistence of assembly and disassembly {{at the ends of}} a microtubule. The microtubule can dynamically switch between growing and shrinking phases in this region. Tubulin dimers can bind two molecules of GTP, one of which can be hydrolyzed subsequent to assembly. [...] During polymerization, the tubulin dimers are in the GTP-bound state. [...] The GTP bound to α-tubulin is stable and it plays a structural function in this bound state. However, the GTP bound to β-tubulin may be hydrolyzed to GDP shortly after assembly. The assembly properties of GDP-tubulin are different from those of GTP-tubulin, as GDP-tubulin is more prone to <b>depolymerization.</b> A GDP-bound tubulin subunit at the tip of a microtubule will tend to fall off, although a GDP-bound tubulin {{in the middle of a}} microtubule cannot spontaneously pop out of the polymer. [...] Since tubulin adds onto the end of the microtubule in the GTP-bound state, a cap of GTP-bound tubulin is proposed to exist at the tip of the microtubule, protecting it from disassembly. [...] When hydrolysis catches up to the tip of the microtubule, it begins a rapid <b>depolymerization</b> and shrinkage. This switch from growth to shrinking is called a catastrophe. [...] GTP-bound tubulin can begin adding to the tip of the microtubule again, providing a new cap and protecting the microtubule from shrinking. This is referred to as [...] "rescue".|$|E
2500|$|Yeasts contain {{three main}} {{elements}} {{that are associated with}} actin: patches, cables and rings that, despite being present for long, are subject to a dynamic equilibrium due to continual polymerization and <b>depolymerization.</b> [...] They possess a number of accessory proteins including ADF/cofilin, which has a molecular weight of 16kDa and is coded for by a single gene, called COF1; Aip1, a cofilin cofactor that promotes the disassembly of microfilaments; Srv2/CAP, a process regulator related to adenylate cyclase proteins; a profilin with a molecular weight of approximately 14 kDa that is associated with actin monomers; and twinfilin, a 40 kDa protein involved in the organization of patches.|$|E
2500|$|MAPs {{have been}} shown to {{play a crucial role in}} the {{regulation}} of microtubule dynamics in-vivo. The rates of microtubule polymerization, <b>depolymerization,</b> and catastrophe vary depending on which microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are present. The originally identified MAPs from brain tissue can be classified into two groups based on their molecular weight. This first class comprises MAPs with a molecular weight below 55-62 kDa, and are called τ (tau) proteins. In-vitro, tau proteins {{have been shown}} to directly bind microtubules, promote nucleation and prevent disassembly, and to induce the formation of parallel arrays. [...] Additionally, tau proteins have also been shown to stabilize microtubules in axons and have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease. [...] The second class is composed of MAPs with a molecular weight of 200-1000 kDa, of which there are four known types: MAP-1, MAP-2, MAP-3 and MAP-4. MAP-1 proteins consists of a set of three different proteins: A, B and C. The C protein plays an important role in the retrograde transport of vesicles and is also known as cytoplasmic dynein. [...] MAP-2 proteins are located in the dendrites and in the body of neurons, where they bind with other cytoskeletal filaments. [...] The MAP-4 proteins are found in the majority of cells and stabilize microtubules. [...] In addition to MAPs that have a stabilizing effect on microtubule structure, other MAPs can have a destabilizing effect either by cleaving or by inducing <b>depolymerization</b> of microtubules. [...] Three proteins called katanin, spastin, and fidgetin have been observed to regulate the number and length of microtubules via their destabilizing activities. Furthermore, KIAA1211L is predicted to be localized to the microtubules.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{proteins}} that bind to actin regulate {{the length of}} the microfilaments by cutting them, which gives rise to new active ends for polymerization. For example, if a microfilament with two ends is cut twice, there will be three new microfilaments with six ends. This new situation favors the dynamics of assembly and disassembly. [...] The most notable of these proteins are gelsolin and cofilin. These proteins first achieve a cut by binding to an actin monomer located in the polymer they then change the actin monomer’s conformation while remaining bound to the newly generated (+) end. This has the effect of impeding the addition or exchange of new G-actin subunits. <b>Depolymerization</b> is encouraged as the (-) ends are not linked to any other molecule.|$|E
