5|$|The {{domestic}} political environment was <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> {{by the death}} of Paul Eyschen, who had been Prime Minister for 27 years. With his death came a string of short-lived governments, culminating in rebellion, and constitutional turmoil after the withdrawal of German soldiers.|$|E
5|$|By 14:00 the 4th Parachute Brigade was {{no further}} forward. With {{casualties}} mounting, Brigadier Hackett asked General Urquhart's permission to withdraw {{south of the}} railway line. His intention was to move through Wolfheze and into Oosterbeek where the division's support units waited. The change of direction was <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> {{by the lack of}} vehicle crossings along the railway line—there were only two, one at Wolfheze and the other at Oosterbeek.|$|E
5|$|Emmendingen {{lies in the}} Elz valley, which {{winds through}} the Black Forest. The Elz creates a series of hanging valleys which {{challenge}} the passage of large bodies of troops; the rainy weather <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> the passage through the Elz valley. The area around Riegel am Kaiserstuhl is noted for its loess and narrow transition points, which greatly influenced the battle.|$|E

25|$|To <b>further</b> <b>complicate</b> matters, {{international}} agreements on {{the regulation of}} such a program {{would need to be}} established.|$|R
50|$|John 20:9 <b>further</b> <b>complicates</b> {{this debate}} {{by stating that}} they {{remained}} ignorant, without clearly explaining who they are.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Debra's {{development}} {{near the}} coast was unusual, complicating forecasting {{in addition to}} its rapid intensification and abnormal direction. The lack of ship reports and incorrect information received from those that were received <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> Debra's forecasts. However, due to its formation close to the coast, Debra had inadequate time to cause a greater storm surge. Debra's floods accounted for most of the month's rainfall.|$|E
5|$|The UK Film Council {{awarded the}} {{production}} £1million in June 2009. Filming began in December 2009, and lasted 39 days. Most {{was shot in}} the three weeks before Christmas because Rush would be performing in a play in January. The schedule was <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> by Bonham Carter's availability: she worked on Harry Potter during the week, so her scenes had to be filmed during the weekend.|$|E
5|$|The {{logistical}} {{demands of}} the surrender were formidable. After Japan's capitulation, more than 5,400,000 Japanese soldiers and 1,800,000 Japanese sailors were taken prisoner by the Allies. The damage done to Japan's infrastructure, combined with a severe famine in 1946, <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> the Allied efforts to feed the Japanese POWs and civilians.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, Lymantriidae {{was moved}} from Noctuidae to Erebidae, <b>further</b> <b>complicating</b> the taxonomy. The newly created {{family has been}} {{reflected}} in some sources.|$|R
5|$|Adding to Tony's {{complicated}} life is {{his relationship}} with his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), which is strained by his constant infidelity and her struggle to reconcile the reality of Tony's business (which she is often in denial of), with the affluent lifestyle and higher social status it brings her. Both have up-and-down relationships with their two children: the intelligent-but-rebellious Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), and underachiever A.J. (i.e., Anthony, Jr.) (Robert Iler), whose everyday teenage issues are <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> by their eventual knowledge of their father's criminal activities and reputation.|$|E
5|$|Affairs became <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> when, on 2February 1583, {{also known}} as Candlemas, Gebhard married Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben in a private house in Rosenthal, outside of Bonn. After the ceremony, the couple {{processed}} to the Elector's palace in Bonn, and held a great feast. Unbeknownst to them, while they celebrated their marriage, Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg (1554–1586), {{who was also a}} member of the Cathedral Chapter, and his soldiers approached the fortified Kaiserswerth, across the river, and took the castle after a brief fight. When the citizens of Cologne heard the news, there was a great public exultation.|$|E
5|$|At least 30% of TBI are not {{discovered}} at first; this number {{may be as}} high as 50%. In about 10% of cases, TBI has no specific signs either clinically or on chest radiography, and its detection may be <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> by concurrent injuries, since TBI tends to occur after high-energy accidents. Weeks or months may go by before the injury is diagnosed, even though the injury is better known {{than it was in the}} past.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to the Silver Crystal renders all of Crystal Tokyo's {{inhabitants}} functionally immortal, and her frequent time traveling <b>further</b> <b>complicates</b> {{approximation of}} her age.|$|R
50|$|<b>Further</b> <b>complicating</b> the development, in September 2002 an {{earthquake}} fault was detected {{on the northeast}} portion of the plot. The project was again temporarily suspended.|$|R
50|$|War between Soviet Russia and Poland raged in {{the summer}} of 1920 and wrecked {{locomotives}} and derailed freight cars lined the tracks, <b>further</b> <b>complicating</b> the transportation situation.|$|R
5|$|Historians {{have to make}} {{considerable}} assumptions {{trying to}} reconstruct the full family tree because of extremely scarce written sources about {{the early history of}} Lithuania. The matter is <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> by the 16–17th century genealogies, most famously the Bychowiec Chronicle, that mixed legends and facts into one. The legends about Palemonids, a noble family from the Roman Empire who settled in Lithuania and gave rise to the Duchy, are quite popular and widespread in these genealogies. The real historical data comes from the Russian and Livonian chronicles, most important of these being the Hypatian Codex.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 the {{situation}} was <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> when MGM/UA was sold to Qintex, which wanted to then merge with Pathé Communications; the Bond back catalogue was leased to Pathé at a lower-than-market value, without consulting Danjaq – who sued MGM/UA Communications, which was itself {{the target of a}} failed takeover bid by Pathé. In August 1990 Albert Broccoli appointed his daughter Barbara Broccoli alongside Michael G. Wilson as producers at Eon, while he concentrated on matters at Danjaq. The dispute between Danjaq and MGM/UA was protracted and delayed production of Bond 17, but was finally settled in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for the Sovetskaya Rossiya, but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. A prototype boiler {{was supposed to have}} been built ashore for evaluation, but it was not completed until early 1941, which <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> the production plan.|$|E
50|$|The data {{determining}} Arrow-Debreu equilibria include initial endowments {{of capital}} goods. If production and trade occur out of equilibrium, these endowments {{will be changed}} <b>further</b> <b>complicating</b> the picture.|$|R
50|$|The {{peaceful}} {{planet of}} Aritani becomes {{the center of}} a Romulan plot to gain power. A Romulan double agent and a severely injured Spock <b>further</b> <b>complicate</b> the situation.|$|R
50|$|To <b>further</b> <b>complicate</b> matters, {{the skin}} and eyes may be other colors if {{influenced}} by other factors such as white markings, certain white spotting patterns or dilution genes.|$|R
5|$|The TRC {{concluded}} {{that it may be}} impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, {{in part because of the}} habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.|$|E
5|$|The Uprising and its {{repression}} caused {{trauma that}} continues to manifest in the Malagasy population. Many Malagasy nationals fought each other and struggle to reconcile themselves to the remorse and guilt. Healing {{at the national level}} is <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> {{by the fact that the}} same leaders who proclaimed Madagascar's independence in 1960 were those who had been major players in the PADESM political party, which had been favored by the colonial administration after the crushing of the revolt.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the community, with only 1,600 {{people living in the}} two Russian settlements. The population in the communities do not speak Norwegian, and do not have a road connection to Longyearbyen. This made it difficult for the Governor to give accurate and detailed information. Issues were <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> by erroneous reports in Russian media that there were five survivors. The Governor's cabin in Barentsburg was manned during the aftermath, and bulletins were distributed with updated information in Russian. The accident was one of the triggers causing Arktikugol to abandon Pyramiden in 1998.|$|E
50|$|It was {{expected}} Formiga {{would be brought}} back for a year-end title rematch with Kojima. However, Kojima vacated the Shooto Bantamweight Championship, <b>further</b> <b>complicating</b> Jussier's future with the organization.|$|R
50|$|<b>Further</b> <b>complicating</b> land {{development}} projects, groupings of huts or shanties on illegal land can stall projects {{until there is}} a plan and action taken to remove or relocate the squatters.|$|R
5000|$|... "Trapper Keeper": The {{kindergarten}} class {{votes for}} Class President; satire on the 2000 U.S. presidential {{election and the}} inclusion of many famous figures (especially Rosie O'Donnell) only <b>further</b> <b>complicating</b> issues.|$|R
5|$|The storylines {{follow the}} three couples {{as they try}} to stay {{faithful}} to each other. They are held back by issues such as impotence, infidelity, and unplanned pregnancy. Their lives are <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> by their jobs, money troubles, and moving in together. Bullen embellished the scripts with events from his own personal life. The directors and producers made additional contributions, with the intent to keep the fiction in the programme as true to life as possible. The series was filmed in Greater Manchester {{in the first half of}} 1998, using Granada Television's studios, and exterior locations.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{development}} is commonly divided {{into the following}} stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth {{development is}} an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth. This determination is <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} states, {{there are no}} formal rules prohibiting the usage of the same route number under {{different}} systems. Motorists using Michigan's highways may encounter I-75 and M-75, as well as both US8 and M-8. Many of the state's US Highways were assigned numbers duplicating those of state trunklines when the US Highway System was created in 1926. The introduction of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> the situation, as each mainline Interstate designation has an unrelated M-n trunkline counterpart elsewhere in the state.|$|E
