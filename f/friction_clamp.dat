40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} development of a friction-based coupling device for a fiber-optic monitoring system capable of measuring pressure, strain, and temperature that can be deployed on existing subsea structures. A summary is provided of the design concept, prototype development, prototype performance testing, and subsequent design refinements of the device. The results of laboratory testing of the first prototype performed at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) are also included. Limitations of the initial concept were identified during testing and future design improvements were proposed and later implemented. These new features enhance the coupling of the sensor device and improve the monitoring system measurement capabilities. A major challenge of a post-installed instrumentation monitoring system is to ensure adequate coupling between the instruments {{and the structure of}} interest for reliable measurements. Friction-based devices have the potential to overcome coupling limitations caused by marine growth and soil contamination on flowlines, risers, and other subsea structures. The work described in this paper investigates the design and test of a friction-based coupling device (herein referred to as a <b>friction</b> <b>clamp)</b> which is suitable for pipelines and structures that are suspended in the water column as well as for those that are resting on the seabed. The monitoring elements consist of fiberoptic sensors that are bonded to a stainless steel clamshell assembly with a high-friction surface coating. The <b>friction</b> <b>clamp</b> incorporates a single hinge design to facilitate installation of the clamp and dual rows of opposing fasteners to distribute the clamping force along the structure. The <b>friction</b> <b>clamp</b> can be modified to be installed by commercial divers in shallow depths or by remotely operated vehicles in deep-water applications. NASA-JSC was involved in the selection and testing of the friction coating, and in the design and testing of the prototype clamp device. Four-inch diameter and eight-inch diameter sub-scale <b>friction</b> <b>clamp</b> prototypes were built and tested to evaluate the strain measuring capabilities of the design under different loading scenarios. The testing revealed some limitations of the initial design concept, and subsequent refinements were explored to improve the measurement performance of the system. This study was part of a collaboration between NASA-JSC and Astro Technology Inc. within a study called Clear Gulf. The primary objective of the Clear Gulf study is to develop advanced instrumentation technologies that will improve operational safety and reduce the risk of hydrocarbon spillage. NASA provided unique insights, expansive test facilities, and technical expertise to advance technologies that will benefit the environment, the public, and commercial industries...|$|E
40|$|Polycarbonate (PC) is a tough, {{transparent}} engineering thermoplastic. Its {{impact strength}} and ability undergo large plastic deformations without shatter make PC an ideal protective material for impact-resilient eyewear, aircraft windows and transparent armor. A {{good understanding of}} the response of this material to large deformations at high strain rates is critical for its utilization in these applications. To this end, a striker-less Kolsky bar device is employed in this work for the needed material characterization. The apparatus allow impulsive torsion and/or compression loadings with pulse durations sufficiently long for the plastic flow behavior to develop fully. Three new testing techniques based on the device are developed and applied to measure the response of PC to large plastic deformations of various modes at various strain rates and under various temperatures. The first new technique is a modified torsional Kolsky bar method that loads the PC sample in high rate of simple shear. In addition to measuring the shear stress as the conventional method, the new technique also measures the axial stress induced by shear deformation. The measurements show that the material expands as it undergoes elastic shear and contracts as the shear becomes increasingly plastic. The results for the elastic response confirm the prediction by a non-linear elastic model for PC. The second new technique applies a static axial compression to the sample before dynamic shear loading. The experiments with this technique seek to determine if {{and to what extent}} the deviatoric yield and flow stresses of PC are affected by the volumetric stress. For the stress states examined, both the deviatoric yield and flow stresses show linear dependence on the compressive volumetric stress. The final Kolsky bar technique developed uses a <b>friction</b> <b>clamp</b> to store and release a compressive pulse. This new technique allows for loading pulses that are much longer than the achievable pulses in the traditional split Hopkinson bar tests. They are sufficient for the material flow behavior to develop fully in the compressive strain rate range of mid hundreds to lower thousands per second. Tests with the technique are performed on PC over an array of temperatures and strain rates. The temperature and strain rate dependences of the yield and flow stresses under dynamic compression are studied. The volumetric stresses are considerably more intense for the compression tests than for the torsion tests and combined compression-torsion tests. The data from the three types of tests together indicates consistent pressure-dependent increases in the deviatoric yield and flow stresses of PC subjected to high-rate large deformations.

40|$|Part I This {{section is}} {{concerned}} with the propagation of stress waves in metals such that the material is at some stage in the plastic state. An account is given of previous work on the subject of plastic wave propagation whence two distinct theories emerge, the so-called strain-rate dependent and independent theories. The greatest difference between the two theories is in their prediction of the propagation speed of an incremental stress superimposed on an already plastic stress field. From criticisms of earlier attempts to decide which is the more applicable theory it is deduced that the most convincing way of answering that question is to apply torsional increments to thin-walled tubes already plastically strained in torsion. A brief outline of the two theories as they apply to the torsion of thin-walled tubes is provided in Chapter 3, during which the values of the predicted incremental wave speed are derived. Some of the problems encountered in designing apparatus to carry out the required experiments are discussed in Chapter 4, which includes a full description of the final design. This consists of a standard torsion machine in which is placed the specimen, fixed between two long bars. The relative strengths and sizes of the specimens and bars are such that the latter remain elastic even at large plastic strain in the specimen. A <b>friction</b> <b>clamp</b> fits round the input bar and is pressed on to it by tensioning a length of high tensile steel wire. By rotating the end of the input bar, the specimen can be prestrained whilst a clip at the clamp builds up a small friction torque. The friction torque is rapidly released by breaking the tensioning wire and the resulting stress waves in the system are detected by means of strain gauges on the input and output bars. THe time travel of an incremental stress through the specimen can then be calculated. The rise time if the stress wave is approximately 30 Î¼sec. Following the description of the apparatus, details of the specimen are given. These were made from mild steel and commercially pure aluminium and copper, all in the annealed state. Four different sizes were made, three for use in the wave propagation tests, the forth was used in the same machine but to provide an indication of the strain rate sensitivity of copper and aluminium. The results of the tests on all the above types of specimen are laid out in Chapter 6. Prestrains of up to 25 % were used in the wave propagation work and in all cases {{it was found that the}} propagation speed was equal to the torsional elastic wave speed as predicted by the strain-rate dependent theory. Also shown in this chapter are the variations in transmitted pulse shape between the various materials and prestrains. Part II The second part of the thesis {{is concerned with}} the process of punching or blanking and opens with an account of previous work on the subject. The following chapter describes the apparatus which enables the punch speed to be varied from 10 - 5 to 10 3 in/sec. and allows the punch load to be measured at each instant of the deformation process. Three different machines are described, a standard Instron testing machine which provides the low punch speeds, a special hydraulic machine giving higher punch speeds and a drop-weight impact testing machine from which the highest speeds are obtained. Load-displacement curves were obtained over this range of punch speeds for six materials, mild steel, copper, aluminium (all annealed), soft and hard brass, and a high tensile steel. The load-displacement curves of the first three materials, which had very similar compositions to those materials used in Part I, were converted into sheer stress - shear form, and using a gauge length estimated from microhardness traverses of the sectioned specimens. In Chapter II the strain rate sensitivities obtained from the punch test are used to discuss the observed pulse magnitudes of the wave propagation tests, in conjunction with the predictions of the strain-rate dependent theory. It is shown that the predictions agree qualitatively with the observed trends. The second part of this chapter examines the effects of increasing the punch velocity in the blanking process on the quality of product and energy absorbed by the process. It is shown that the high speed punching process is most advantageous when using brittle materials. </p...|$|E

Furthermore, the friction decreases with increasing strain. The system used is graphene placed over a nanoscale SiO 2 grating, causing strain and local strain variations. We use a combination of atomic force microscopy and Raman scattering to determine the friction coefficient, after accounting for compression and accidental charge doping, and model the local strain variation within the laser spot size.

50|$|The {{scaffolding}} {{contract was}} awarded to a company called Universal Builders Supply (UBS) Inc. on December 14, 1983. The contract stipulated that the freestanding exterior scaffold was to be completely assembled by April 27, 1984. The 240 ft high scaffolding was designed specifically for the statue, and required ingenuity from its designers, as {{it could only be}} attached to the granite pedestal and not the statue and had to accommodate the intricate contours of the statue as well. Furthermore, the exterior scaffolding had to maintain a distance of at least 18 inches from any exposed section of the copper sheathing. The 6,000 or so separate components of the scaffold, made of a high load capacity aluminum (alloy 6061 T6), were unloaded onto Liberty Island on January 23, 1984. To prevent possible rust stains from affecting the exterior patina of the statue, the pretext was adopted of using aluminum. Screw jacks were used to brace the aluminum against the granite pedestal of the statue. More easily an interior scaffolding was developed made of interlocking pipes held together with <b>friction</b> <b>clamps</b> and anchored to the central pylon of the statue for structural support. The twenty UBS workers often resorted to assembling the interior scaffolding when the severe winds and dreadful winter weather conditions prevented them from continuing their work outside.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{identifying}} hard material pairs with low roughness, high coefficient of static friction, high wear resistance and high modulus of elasticity, suitable for sliding in dry friction conditions under a normal load. A {{wide range of}} materials including various steels, various coatings on tool steels deposited by various deposition techniques and different ceramics were examined and considered for tribological testing. Procedures and sequences were developed for conducting tribology tests on the material pairs. High endurance - low cycle tests were conducted {{and based on the}} performance of material pairs with respect to friction, wear and surface roughness a small set of material pairs and coatings was selected for further testing. High endurance - high cycle tests were performed on an additional seventeen pairs of material pairs selected for long term sliding. Material pairs were selected for low endurance tests based on high corrosion resistance along with all the above specified design parameters. Low endurance tests were conducted to identify material pairs sliding for a short distance in humid environments. Results are tabulated and pictures of the material pairs after wear tests are presented.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} what palliative eflects can {{be achieved}} for fretting fatigue by modifying the contact conditions. A previous literature survey of palliatives by the authors is briefly reviewed to demonstrate the contrary nature {{of much of the}} evidence. Two simple geometries (sphere and cylinder on plane) are then considered, and the tensile stresses generated {{in the wake of the}} sliding contact derived. It is contended that fretting fatigue is the result of such tensile stresses contributing to the crack initiation process. The eflect on these tensile stresses of modifying the contact conditions of the <b>friction</b> coeficient and <b>clamping</b> force is examined, so that successful palliatives can be identified. The analysis shows that conditions exist where increasing or decreasing either the <b>friction</b> coefficient or <b>clamping</b> force can be of benejit, and there is no panacea. The correct action depends on geometry, slip regime and the controlling factor for relative displacement. The analysis therefore provides an explanation of the apparent contradictions in the literature.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} fatigue problem on riveted {{structures}} and the correlated experimental tests. The term âfatigueâ denotes the cracking of metals under repeated loading. The technique of riveting structures is obsolete {{due to the}} low level of standardization in the construction process. Knowledge concerning riveted structureâs ability to withstand fatigue has not been investigated to the same extent as for modern structures assembled by welding. Nevertheless, many riveted structures are still in service after over 100 years. Clamping force originates when the hot rivet is placed into the hole of the plates and the rivet shorten in length due to cooling. In Europe, a large number of railway bridges are riveted. Moreover, all over the world, the rivet assembly technique has been largely used for different types of buildings. The riveted structures are subjected, evidently, to fatigue degradation as all the other steel structures. The riveted joint complexity and the non-uniform realization lead to a structure-specific consideration. In Europe, current regulations recognise only one fatigue class for riveted structures neglecting the clamping force effect. This approach is characterized by an elevated standard deviation for the assessed results. This research aims to improve the riveted structures fatigue comprehension and to propose appropriate tests. Some elements have been extracted from a dismantled railway bridge located near San Stino di Livenza (Venice). An innovative clamping test (TCT) has been conceived: applying a torsional moment to the rivets and evaluating the sliding <b>friction,</b> the <b>clamping</b> force has been estimated. Contrary to traditional clamping tests, this setup, at an affordable price, provides good precision. Moreover, the test is in-site and does not provoke damages to the examined structure. Fem models of rail bearer have been realized taking into account rivets, holes and multilayer plates section inertia. A specific laboratory set up has been designed with the intention to calibrate the fem models. <b>Frictions</b> and <b>clamping</b> force have been taken into account in the rail bearer models. There is a close correspondence between the non-linear models and the experimental tests. The clamping assumptions, derived from the TCT, have been verified. A full scale fatigue test has been prepared and the first cycles have been monitored. Full scale fatigue tests are sophisticated and involve many parameters. For this test, a specific metallic frame has been designed and realized using advanced fatigue models. An advanced analysis (hot spot method) has been carried out, for the frame, in order to evaluate the stress into the welds.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with stress analysis and strengthprediction in composite laminates containing bolt holes andopen holes. It covers both two- and three-dimensional analyses,and experiments {{have been carried out}} to determine criteriaparameters and to validate the analysis methods. The objective of the work on two-dimensional analysismethods has been to develop accurate and cost-efficient stressanalysis and failure prediction methods valid for complexloading conditions. Both the finite element method and a methodbased on Lekhnitskii 9 Ì 2 s complex stress functions have beenused to determine the stress distribution around the hole. Inthe case of bolted laminates, the frictionless contact betweenthe bolt and the hole has been taken into account. Differentfailure criteria, including the Point Stress Criterion (PSC) and the Damage Zone Criterion (DZC) have been used to predictthe strength of test specimens subjected to complex loadingconditions. In the case of bolted laminates, simple failurecriteria for preliminary design are proposed. The validity ofthese criteria is demonstrated on multi-fastener tension- andshear-loaded test specimens. A comprehensive test programme wascarried out to establish criteria parameters and to generatedata to validate the stress analysis and strength predictionunder complex loading conditions. A special test fixture wasdesigned for this purpose. Good agreement was found betweenpredicted and measured results. The objective of the work on three-dimensional methodshas been to develop tools for three- dimensional stress andfailure analyses and to study the effect of various factors onthe strength of single-lap joints. An experimental programmewas conducted to characterize the failure mechanisms and tomeasure deformation, strain, and bending effects. Athree-dimensional finite element model of a bolted single-lapjoint has been developed to determine the non-uniform stressdistribution through the thickness of the laminate in thevicinity of the hole. The model was validated against measuredstrains and displacements from the experimental programme. Theagreement between predicted and experimental results wasgenerally good. In the failure characterisation part of theexperimental programme, {{it was found that the}} failure of thejoints was dominated by kinking. A failure analysis procedurefor the prediction of bearing failure dominated by kinking hasbeen developed. In this procedure, failure is predicted using aquadratic failure criterion evaluating fibre stress andtransverse shear stress at a characteristic distance from theedge of the bolt hole. Experimental results were used tovalidate the analysis procedure and good agreement was foundbetween predicted and experimental failure loads. The analysisprocedure were then used study the effect of eight differentparameters which affect the strength of bolted compositelaminates. The parameters studied were: laminate thickness,lay-up, bolt diameter, bolt configuration (countersunk orprotruding head), <b>friction,</b> <b>clamping</b> force, clearance andlateral support. The parametric study was organised as areduced two-level factorial test. The results from theparametric study show that laminate thickness, friction,clamping force and bolt configuration are the parameters whichhave the strongest influence on the strength of the joints.

The key question for this project is if it is possible to implement walking motion in MEMS, and what can be the performance of linear micromotors employing walking motion. From their potential application in data storage guiding specifications are derived: An output acceleration of a mg load larger than 100 m / s 2, 10 nm resolution, reach larger than 10 mm, a driving voltage below 30 V and a maximum linear size smaller than 1 mm. The linear micromotors to made in the project, are based on variable capacitance electrostatic actuation and surface micromachining fabrication technology.

This paper seeks an explanation for this macroscopic behaviour by means of microscale finite-element simulations. The analyses show that the experimental results can be explained by assuming that: (a) however great the clamping pressure, a thin film of adhesive remains trapped between the crests of the mating surfaces; (b) under the high local pressure the shear strength of this film becomes greater than the regular adhesive at no pressure; (c) the stronger adhesives entail a higher increase than the weaker adhesives...|$|R

50|$|A {{clamp force}} sensor is a {{relatively}} expensive component in an EMB caliper. The cost is derived from its high unit value from a supplier, as well as marked production expenses because of its inclusion. The later emanates from the complex assembly procedures dealing with small tolerances, as well as on-line calibration for performance variability from one clamp force sensor to another. The successful use of a clamp force sensor in an EMB system poses a challenging engineering task. If a clamp forcesensor is placed close to a brake pad, {{then it will be}} subjected to severe temperature conditions reaching up to 800 Celsius that will challenge its mechanical integrity. Also temperature drifts must be compensated for. This situation can be avoided by embedding a clamp force sensor deep within the caliper. However, embedding this sensor leads to hysteresis that is influenced by <b>friction</b> between the <b>clamp</b> force sensor and the point of contact of an inner pad with the rotor. This hysteresis prevents a true clamp force to be measured. Due to the cost issues and engineering challenges involved with including the clamp force sensor, it might be desirable to eliminate this component from the EMB system. A potential opportunity to achieve this presents itself in accurate estimation of the clamp force based on alternative EMB system sensory measurements leading to the omission of a clamp force sensor.|$|R
40|$|When {{multifunctional}} pipeline repair machinery (MPRM) {{is used in}} {{the deep}} sea area, it is difficult to grip the pipeline and ensure concentricity between the cutter heads and the pipeline during its operation. In view of this, a new system of two-arm holding self-centering pipeline clamping device was proposed. The system is composed of two groups of parallelogram double-rocker mechanism and cranking block mechanism which are symmetrically distributed on the frame. The geometric parameter solutions of the clamping device were analyzed with motion and transmission as the constraints. A mechanical model was established to associate the <b>friction</b> torque of <b>clamping</b> points with the driving force. Clamping device and machinery were designed and manufactured for the Ã 304. 8 â 457. 2 Â mm pipelines used in this test. ADAMS simulation experiments were conducted underwater, and the cutting and beveling tests were carried out onshore. The following results are achieved. First, the smaller the pipe diameter, the smaller the transmission angle of the oscillating slider mechanism; the longer the hydraulic cylinder stroke, the greater the transmission angle of the double rocker mechanism. Second, the driving force of the clamping device increases with the increase of the pipe diameter. When the diameter reaches 457. 2 Â mm, the hydraulic cylinder driving force of the clamping device should be greater than 10219 Â N. Third, the feed rate of the cutters increases suddenly due to the slight shaking of the machinery which occurs {{at the beginning of the}} pipe cutting, so it is necessary to adopt a small feed rate. And fourth, onshore experiment results agree well with the theoretical design and simulation results, proving the rationality of the system.
