5000|$|Float {{shifting}} or <b>floating</b> <b>gears,</b> {{also called}} [...] "slip shifting" [...] or [...] "dead sticking", {{is the process}} of changing gears, typically in a non-synchronous transmission, without depressing the clutch.|$|R
50|$|Float {{shifting}} or <b>floating</b> <b>gears</b> {{is changing}} gears without depressing the clutch, usually on a non-synchronized transmission. Since the clutch is not used, {{it is easy}} to mismatch speeds of gears, and the driver can quickly cause major (and expensive) damage to the gears and the transmission. Float shifting is often done on large trucks with standard (non-synchronized) gearboxes.|$|R

50|$|The FU-1s were {{delivered}} to VF-2B based in San Diego, California. With their <b>float</b> <b>gear</b> mounted, one {{was assigned to}} each of the battleships of the Pacific Fleet, where they were launched from catapults. They spent eight months in this role, but as the squadron went to aircraft carrier operations, the further-aft cockpit proved to have a visibility problem when maneuvering around a carrier deck. In response, the forward cockpit was re-opened, the resulting aircraft being designated FU-2.|$|E
50|$|The scout was a {{conventional}} geared aircraft {{that was also}} tested on ski and <b>float</b> <b>gear.</b> The unique fuselage tapered sharply behind the pilot similar to a helicopter fuselage, with a high mounted boom supporting the tail surfaces. The original design included a single vertical stabilizer, but two small downward mounted stabilizers were used on production models. Spoiler-ailerons were used for roll control, and full length flaps were mounted on {{the trailing edge of}} the wings. The rear fuselage was all-window, and the tandem co-pilot could swivel the chair rearward.|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} landing impact is briefly stated and the {{applicability}} of a previously suggested formula is extended. Theoretical considerations regarding impact measurements on models and actual seaplanes are followed by {{a brief description of}} the instruments used in actual flight tests. The report contains a description of the strength conditions and deals exhaustively with force measurements on the <b>float</b> <b>gear</b> of an "HE 9 a" with flat-bottom and with V-bottom floats. The experimental data are given and compared with the theoretical results...|$|E
50|$|Although double {{clutching}} is {{a testing}} requirement when obtaining a commercial driver's license, most experienced truckers learn to shift gears without using the clutch. This {{is known as}} <b>floating</b> <b>gears</b> or <b>float</b> shifting, which thus eliminates the clutch except during starting and stopping. Skip shifting is when a gear is left out, usually on an upshift, for example shifting 2-4-6 while accelerating {{with the help of}} gravity down a hill. This technique saves unnecessary shifting work and saves fuel.|$|R
50|$|The normal {{production}} variant has skid landing gear. The Mariner version — {{which is}} no longer manufactured — provided <b>floats.</b> Wheeled <b>gear</b> is not available.|$|R

40|$|For floats and hulls having V bottoms {{the impact}} force does not {{necessarily}} increase with increasing width. Therefore, {{the weight of the}} <b>float</b> landing <b>gear,</b> side walls, and other parts, and of the fuselage construction need not be increased with increasing bottom width, but the weight of the bottom construction itself, on the other hand, does not increase with increase in bottom width and is largely determined by the type of construction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a differential-drive {{actuator}} with dual-input actuation for robotic manipulation. This work is focused on mechanism design and actuation control. Based on an epicyclic gear train, the actuator uses a <b>floating</b> ring <b>gear</b> to realize two inputs and single output. Based on differential velocity control, the actuator can realize stepless speed regulation and flexible transformation. Finally, we fabricate an actuator prototype, which shows the feasibility of robotic differential-drive, but needs further experiments and tests...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effect of}} gear geometrical errors in wind turbine planetary gearboxes with a <b>floating</b> sun <b>gear.</b> Numerical simulations and experiments are employed throughout the study. A National Renewable Energy Laboratory 750 kW gearbox is modelled in a multibody environment and verified using the experimental data obtained from a dynamometer test. The gear geometrical errors, which are both assembly dependent and assembly independent, are described, and planet-pin misalignment and eccentricity are selected as the two most influential and key errors for case studies. Various load cases involving errors in the floating and non-floating sun gear designs are simulated, and the planet-bearing reactions, gear vibrations, gear mesh loads and bearing fatigue lives are compared. All tests and simulations are performed at the rated wind speed. For errorless gears, the non-floating sun gear design performs better in terms of gear load variation, whereas the upwind planet bearing has more damage. In the <b>floating</b> sun <b>gear</b> scenario, the planet misalignment is neutralized by changing the sun motion pattern and the planet gear's elastic deformation. The effects of gear profile modifications are also evaluated, revealing that profile modifications such as crowning improve the effects of misalignment...|$|R
5000|$|Its {{engine was}} a [...] six {{cylinder}} inline, water cooled BMW IV, mounted with its cylinder heads exposed, which drove a two blade propeller. The fuselage was flat sided and accommodated the two crew {{in a continuous}} open, tandem cockpit. The tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and the vertical tail was tall and rounded, the rudder extending below the keel. The V 60 had twin <b>float</b> landing <b>gear</b> attached to the wing and lower fuselage on a number of V-struts and laterally cross braced.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{featured a}} strut-braced high-wing, a {{six to eight}} seat enclosed cabin and optional fixed tricycle landing gear, conventional landing <b>gear,</b> <b>floats</b> or skis and a single engine in tractor configuration.

5000|$|They first {{investigated}} and confirmed the <b>floating</b> escape <b>gear</b> & then approached the sub, having strict instructions {{not to go}} along side. Standing off they made contact. The sub was Russian - unbelievable! - They’d had a fire, 9 dead, three injured. The dead were on the casing aft of the fin. Men, smouldering from the heat were appearing from the aft hatch wearing breathing apparatus to be splashed down with sea water by their comrades. The lifeboat asked {{to speak to the}} captain. There was some confusion and then one stepped forward.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s the United States Navy became {{interested}} in a thick airfoil section, cantilever wing, United States military observation aircraft, developed by the Dutch company Fokker. The Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics designed a three-seat observation monoplane to use a similar wing. Production of the aircraft, designated the MO-1, was contracted to the Glenn L. Martin Company with an order for 36 aircraft. The MO-1 was a shoulder-wing cantilever monoplane with a slab-sided fuselage and a fixed tailwheel landing gear. It had an all-metal structure with a fabric covering, and was powered by a Curtiss D-12 engine. In 1924 one aircraft was fitted with <b>float</b> landing <b>gear</b> for evaluation.|$|R
50|$|Forks is {{well known}} for its winter steelhead fishing with the Quillayute river system - the Hoh, Sol Duc, Bogachiel and Calawah rivers. Other nearby Clallam, Sekiu and Hoko rivers are also good for king salmon fishing and steelheading as well. Local guides are {{available}} for both native and hatchery runs and for <b>float</b> trips. Fishing <b>gear</b> and clothing is available at local stores.|$|R
2500|$|Building on {{the success}} of the Goose and Widgeon, Grumman Aircraft {{developed}} [...] larger G-73 Mallard for commercial use. Retaining many of the features of the smaller aircraft, such as twin radial engines, high wings with underwing <b>floats,</b> retractable landing <b>gear</b> and a large straight tail, the company built 59 Mallards between 1946 and 1951. Unlike the smaller aircraft, the Mallard featured tricycle gear, stressed skin, a two-step hull and wingtip fuel tanks.|$|R
50|$|Ciona intestinalis is {{considered}} to be an invasive species and grows in dense aggregations on any floating or submerged substrate, particularly artificial structures like pilings, aquaculture <b>gear,</b> <b>floats</b> and boat hulls, in the lower intertidal to sub-tidal zones. It often grows with or on other fouling organisms. It is thought to spread to new areas mainly through hull fouling. Since its larvae can live for up to 10 days, this species may also be transferred through the release of bilge or ballast water.|$|R
40|$|An {{iterative}} method {{has been developed}} for analyzing dynamic loads in a light weight basic planetary gear system. The effects of fixed, semi-floating, and fully-floating sun gear conditions have been emphasized. The load dependent variable gear mesh stiffness were incorporated into a practical torsional dynamic model of a planetary gear system. The dynamic model consists of input and output units, shafts, and a planetary train. In this model, the sun gear has three degrees of freedom; two transverse and one rotational. The planets, ring gear, and the input and output units have one degree of freedom, (rotation) thus giving a total of nine degrees of freedoms for the basic system. The ring gear has a continuous radial support. The {{results indicate that the}} fixed sun gear arrangement with accurate or errorless gearing offers in general better performance than the <b>floating</b> sun <b>gear</b> system...|$|R
5000|$|In 1925, the Soviet Air Force {{approached}} TsAGI with {{a requirement}} for a heavy bomber with total engine output of 2,000 PS (1,970 hp) and either wheeled or <b>float</b> landing <b>gear.</b> Tupolev OKB started design work in 1926 with the government operational requirements finalized in 1929. The Tupolev TB-1 was taken {{as the basis for}} the design and the aircraft was initially powered by Curtiss V-1570 [...] "Conqueror" [...] engines generating 600 PS (590 hp) each, with the intent of switching to Mikulin M-17s (modified BMW VIs) in production. The mock-up was approved on 21 March 1930 and the first prototype was completed on 31 October 1930. The aircraft flew on 22 December 1930 with Mikhail Gromov at the controls and with ski landing gear. Despite almost crashing owing to vibration causing the throttles to close, the test flight was a success. On 20 February 1931, the Soviet Air Force approved mass production of the ANT-6 with M-17 engines.|$|R
50|$|At 23:00 {{hours on}} 10 February 1945, Bering Strait {{made contact with}} a homeward-bound Boeing B-29 Superfortress, first by radar and then visually. The ship {{switched}} on her lights and stood by for a landing, illuminating the sea and then indicating the wind direction with searchlights. The B-29, named Deacons Delight, accomplished “an almost perfect ditching,” and Bering Straits motor whaleboat took the entire 12-man crew on board and {{brought them to the}} ship. Then, after collecting <b>floating</b> debris and <b>gear,</b> and riddling the Superfortress with gunfire in a vain effort to sink it, Bering Strait rammed and sank the hardy bomber.|$|R
40|$|The {{multiple}} mesh/single stage dynamics {{program is}} a gear tooth analysis program which determines detailed geometry, dynamic loads, stresses, and surface damage factors. The program can analyze a variety of both epicyclic and single mesh systems with spur or helical gear teeth including internal, external, and buttress tooth forms. The modifications refine the options for the flexible carrier and flexible ring gear rim and adds three options: a <b>floating</b> Sun <b>gear</b> option; a natural frequency option; and a finite element compliance formulation for helical gear teeth. The option for a floating Sun incorporates two additional degrees of freedom at the Sun center. The natural frequency option evaluates the frequencies of planetary, star, or differential systems {{as well as the}} effect of additional springs at the Sun center and those due to a flexible carrier and/or ring gear rim. The helical tooth pair finite element calculated compliance is obtained from an automated element breakup of the helical teeth and then is used with the basic gear dynamic solution and stress postprocessing routines. The flexible carrier or ring gear rim option for planetary and star spur gear systems allows the output torque per carrier and ring gear rim segment to vary based on the dynamic response of the entire system, while the total output torque remains constant...|$|R
