The products are sold under the brand name of Siegling and are used {{in a wide range}} of areas in industrial, trade and services companies, for example as process belts in the food industry, as treadmill belts in fitness studios or as <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> in mail distribution systems.|$|E
5000|$|Because <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> tend {{to climb}} towards the higher {{side of the}} pulley, pulleys were made with a {{slightly}} convex or [...] "crowned" [...] surface (rather than flat) to allow the belt to self-center as it runs. <b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> also tend to slip on the pulley face when heavy loads are applied, and many proprietary belt dressings were available that {{could be applied to}} the belts to increase friction, and so power transmission.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> {{were widely}} used in the 19th and early 20th centuries in line {{shafting}} to transmit power in factories. They were also used in countless farming, mining, and logging applications, such as bucksaws, sawmills, threshers, silo blowers, conveyors for filling corn cribs or haylofts, balers, water pumps (for wells, mines, or swampy farm fields), and electrical generators. <b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> are still used today, although {{not nearly as much}} as in the line-shaft era. The flat belt is a simple system of power transmission that was well suited for its day. It can deliver high power at high speeds (500 hp at 10,000 ft/min, or 373 kW at 51 m/s), in cases of wide belts and large pulleys. But these wide-belt-large-pulley drives are bulky, consuming lots of space while requiring high tension, leading to high loads, and are poorly suited to close-centers applications, so V-belts have mainly replaced <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> for short-distance power transmission; and longer-distance power transmission is typically no longer done with belts at all. For example, factory machines now tend to have individual electric motors.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{typically}} belted to the device being {{powered by a}} wide <b>flat</b> <b>belt,</b> typically from 2 - 6 inches (5 - 15 cm) wide. The <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> is driven by a pulley on the engine that attached either to a flywheel or to the crankshaft. The pulley is specially made in that its circumference is slightly tapered from the middle to each edge (like an over-inflated car tyre) so that {{the middle of the}} pulley is a slightly larger diameter. This design keeps the <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> in the centre of the pulley.|$|R

5000|$|V belts (also style V-belts, vee belts, or, less commonly, wedge rope) {{solved the}} {{slippage}} and alignment problem. It {{is now the}} basic belt for power transmission. They provide the best combination of traction, speed of movement, load of the bearings, and long service life. They are generally endless, and their general cross-section shape is roughly trapezoidal (hence the name [...] "V"). The [...] "V" [...] shape of the belt tracks in a mating groove in the pulley (or sheave), {{with the result that}} the belt cannot slip off. The belt also tends to wedge into the groove as the load increases—the greater the load, the greater the wedging action—improving torque transmission and making the V-belt an effective solution, needing less width and tension than <b>flat</b> <b>belts.</b> V-belts trump <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> with their small center distances and high reduction ratios. The preferred center distance is larger than the largest pulley diameter, but less than three times the sum of both pulleys. Optimal speed range is [...] V-belts need larger pulleys for their thicker cross-section than <b>flat</b> <b>belts.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1919 Ernst Siegling {{founded a}} drive belt factory {{under his own}} name. Soon {{afterwards}} he started producing traditional, leather <b>flat</b> <b>belts.</b> Early in the 1920s chrome leather upright belts were being made and consisted of many riveted leather belts placed upright.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> were {{traditionally}} made {{of leather}} or fabric. Today most {{are made of}} rubber or synthetic polymers. Grip of leather belts is often better if they are assembled with the hair side (outer side) of the leather against the pulley, although some belts are instead given a half-twist before joining the ends (forming a Möbius strip), so that wear can be evenly distributed {{on both sides of}} the belt. Belts ends are joined by lacing the ends together with leather thonging (the oldest of the methods), steel comb fasteners and/or lacing, or by gluing or welding (in the case of polyurethane or polyester). <b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> were traditionally jointed, and still usually are, but they can also be made with endless construction.|$|E
50|$|For {{the same}} power transmission, a V-belt {{requires}} less tension than a <b>flat</b> <b>belt,</b> increasing bearing life.|$|R
40|$|A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) was studied, using a novel <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> pulley arrangement which couples the high speed output shaft of an energy storage flywheel to the drive train of an electric vehicle. A specific CVT arrangement was recommended and its components were selected and sized, based on the design requirements of a 1700 KG vehicle. A design layout was prepared and engineering calculations made of component efficiencies and operating life. The transmission efficiency was calculated to be significantly over 90 % with the expected vehicle operation. A design consistent with automotive practice for low future production costs was considered, together with maintainability. The technology advancements required to develop the <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> CVT were identified and an estimate was made of how {{the size of the}} <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> CVT scales to larger and smaller design output torques. The suitability of the <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> CVT for alternate application to an electric vehicle powered by an electric motor without flywheel and to a hybrid electric vehicle powered by an electric motor with an internal combustion engine was studied...|$|R

All of this equipment {{was designed to}} be steam driven via <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> and pulleys. The original transmission system continued to be used when the shed was first electrified: a large electric motor was simply connected to the main transmission shaft. Later, the transmission system was rendered redundant when the single large electric motor was replaced by smaller electric motors mounted directly onto each saw. As part of this upgrade, the original <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> and pulley wheels on the saws were replaced by [...] "V" [...] belts and pulleys which transmitted drive directly from the saw mounted motors.|$|E

50|$|Though often grouped with <b>flat</b> <b>belts,</b> {{they are}} {{actually}} a different kind. They consist of a very thin belt (0.5-15 millimeters or 100-4000 micrometres) strip of plastic and occasionally rubber. They are generally intended for low-power (less than 10 watts), high-speed uses, allowing high efficiency (up to 98%) and long life. These are seen in business machines, printers, tape recorders, and other light-duty operations.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of a drum-style pulley, without a groove or flanges, the pulley often is {{slightly}} convex to keep the <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> centred. It is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley. Though once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners, in belt sanders and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a belt pulley for a <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> (which is what Belt Pulley magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.|$|R
50|$|By the 1950s, Vermeer {{introduced}} two new products, {{a portable}} PTO-powered hammermill designed to eliminate <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> and pulleys and a self-propelled irrigation system that distributes water in large circles over crops.

50|$|The {{property}} {{includes a}} machine shop with multiple antique machine tools that are powered with <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> from an overhead line shaft. This system, which allowed all the machinery {{to be powered}} by one steam engine, rather than individual electric motors on the machines, was common in machine shops a century ago. The shop is fully intact from when it was in use, and looks as though the machinist just stepped out for a moment.|$|E
50|$|While the vaults {{were under}} {{construction}} Bentham was ordering woodworking machinery {{of his own}} design, mostly up-and-down saws and circular saws. These were fitted-up in both ranges, the power to drive them being transmitted from the engines to the north range by underdrives through the upper layer of vaults, and then by vertical shafts to the upper floors of the buildings. The final drives to the machines was by <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> running on pulleys.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1940s, a patent was registered under the Extremultus brand for a multi-layer <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> made of nylon and chrome leather. The over 98% energy efficiency offered was a vast increase compared with traditional belt and chain drives.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of manure separation by {{a conveyor belt}} under a partially slatted floor for fattening pigs was determined for two types of <b>belts,</b> a <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> with an incline of up to 6 ° transversely and a concave belt with an incline of up to 1 ° longitudinally. A 31. 20 % and 23. 75 % dry matter content of the solid fraction was obtained for the <b>flat</b> and concave <b>belt,</b> respectively. The <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> was more efficient at 6 ° than other slope angles. The residence time of the manure on the two belt types influenced the separation efficiency from a live weight of 63. 00 kg upwards. The quantity of residue produced with this system was reduced to 25 – 40 % {{with respect to a}} pit system under slat. This could mean a remarkable reduction in costs of storage, transport and application of manure...|$|R
5000|$|Hopper-cooled {{engines are}} usually single cylinder, and usually petrol engines rather than diesel. These are the engines that {{appeared}} in great numbers between the wars, driving a range of farm machinery by <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> drives. These engines were used intermittently, and usually with an operator in attendance.|$|R
5000|$|In general, as with <b>flat</b> <b>belts,</b> {{rope drives}} {{were used for}} {{connections}} from stationary engines to the jack shafts and line shafts of mills, and sometimes from line shafts to driven machinery. Unlike leather belts, however, rope drives were sometimes used to transmit power over relatively long distances. Over long distances, intermediate sheaves were used to support the [...] "flying rope", and in the late 19th century, this was considered quite efficient.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pitch line}} is {{the line between the}} inner and outer {{surfaces}} that is neither subject to tension (like the outer surface) nor compression (like the inner). It is midway through the surfaces in film and <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> and dependent on cross-sectional shape and size in timing and V-belts. Calculating pitch diameter is an engineering task and {{is beyond the scope of}} this article. The angular speed is inversely proportional to size, so the larger the one wheel, the less angular velocity, and vice versa. Actual pulley speeds tend to be 0.5-1% less than generally calculated because of belt slip and stretch. In timing belts, the inverse ratio teeth of the belt contributes to the exact measurement.The speed of the belt is: ...|$|E
50|$|In the {{earliest}} applications power was transmitted between pulleys using loops of rope on grooved pulleys. This method is extremely rare today, dating {{mostly from the}} 18th century. <b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> on flat pulleys or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or cotton duck impregnated with rubber. Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton duck belts usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning {{to keep them in}} good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{generators}} [...] {{were installed}} in the beam engine house after the beam engines were removed and these were driven by the Pollit and Wigzell engine.

50|$|These hammers {{tended to}} be smaller and were {{operated}} by a single man both holding the workpiece and operating the machine. The majority of these mechanical linkage machines were powered by line shaft <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> systems or later electric motors that rotated a crank on the machine that drove the ram.|$|R
50|$|The Anderheggen was a Dutch automobile; the {{short-lived}} light 4hp four-seater vis-à-vis, {{powered by a}} water-cooled Abeille engine, was manufactured in Amsterdam from 1899 to 1902. Its transmission was a <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> from the engine {{to a system of}} fast and loose pulleys giving two speeds. Total production was fewer than 10 cars.|$|R
50|$|Various power {{transmission}} methods were available before power takeoffs became common, {{but there were}} applications left wanting {{for some of the}} attributes that PTOs would provide. <b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> generally lent themselves only to applications where the engine was , such as factory steam engines, portable stationary engines, or traction engines {{parked in front of the}} work. For moving vehicles such as a traction engine or early tractor towing a farm implement, the implement could receive rotary power by taking it from one of its own wheels (whose turning was imparted by the towing) and distributing it via roller chains (to a sickle bar's crank, for example), but such a transmission ceases if the vehicle stops traveling; and the workload's resistance tends to make the wheel skid rather than turn, even if cleated. The concept of a shaft drive with easily connected and disconnected couplings, and flexibility for driving at changing angles (such as when an articulated tractor-and-trailer combination turns), was a goal to pursue.|$|E
50|$|Flat {{belt drive}} systems became {{popular in the}} UK from the 1870s, with the firms of J & E Wood and W & J Galloway & Sons {{prominent}} in their introduction. Both of these firms manufactured stationary steam engines and the continuing demand for more power and reliability could be met not merely by improved engine technology but also improved methods of transferring power from the engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service. The use of <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> was already common in the US but rare in Britain until this time. The advantages included less noise and less wasted energy in the friction losses inherent in the previously common drive shafts and their associated gearing. Also, maintenance was simpler and cheaper, {{and it was a}} more convenient method for the arrangement of power drives such that if one part were to fail then it would not cause loss of power to all sections of a factory or mill. These systems were in turn superseded in popularity by rope drive methods.|$|E
