5|$|Following their {{retirement}} from flying service, many Jaguars {{continue to serve}} as ground instructional airframes, most notably at RAF Cosford, used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> of RAF fitters.|$|E
5|$|A {{major change}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> {{programme}} occurred in 1943. From {{that point on}} training concentrated more on the assault infantry role and less on raiding operations. Training now included how to call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire, and how to obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Army's {{modernization}} {{effort in}} the 1980s corps units introduced new organizations and equipment including the M1 Abrams tank, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, AH-64 Apache helicopter, Multiple Launch Rocket System, and Mobile Subscriber Equipment. In 1987, III Corps also conducted the largest deployment of forces to Germany since the Second World War, Exercise Reforger '87. During this time, the corps began assisting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> and support of active and reserve component units. This support involves training guidance, resources, {{and the maintenance of}} relationships that extend to wartime affiliations.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> wear power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> {{model was}} greater than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> single car model, but <b>the</b> {{distribution}} characteristics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two models were nearly the same.

5000|$|... the {{existence}} of vacuum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> pipe can cause debris to be sucked in. An accident took place near Ilford <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, due to inadequate braking effort <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> A rolled newspaper was discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> pipe, effectively isolating the rear part of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> from <b>the</b> driver's control. The blockage should have been detected if a proper brake continuity test had been carried out before <b>the</b> <b>train</b> started its journey.|$|R
30|$|Because of the {{additional}} lateral force from the coupler compression and rotation, the wheel-rail lateral force and derailment coefficient <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> model were 7.1  % and 7.8  % greater than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> single car model. Because of {{the additional}} yawing constraint from the brake shoe pressure, the wheel-rail lateral force and derailment coefficient <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> braking model with a pressure reduction of 140  kPa were 4.3  % and 4.5  % greater than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> idling model.|$|R
5|$|During the 19th century, changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> {{of naval}} {{officers}} {{in both the}} Royal Navy and the United States Navy led to the replacement of apprenticeship aboard ships with formal schooling in a naval college. Midshipman began to mean an officer cadet at a naval college. Trainees now spent around four years in a college and two years at sea prior to promotion to commissioned officer rank. Between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries, time at sea declined to {{less than a year}} as the entry age was increased from 12 to 18.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1901, {{the keel}} for Sankt Georg was laid {{down at the}} Pola Arsenal. She was {{launched}} on 8 December 1903, and completed on 21 July 1905. Starting from her commissioning, Sankt Georg frequently served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> squadron, along with the three s, though she alternated in the squadron with the armored cruiser Kaiser Karl VI. Once the summer training schedule was completed each year, the ships of the training squadron were demobilized in the reserve squadron, which was held {{in a state of}} partial readiness.|$|E
5|$|On October 1, 1927, McClelland began a {{four-year}} stint <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Training</b> and Operations Division, Office of the Chief of the USAAC, at Washington, D.C. He then was given {{command of the}} 19th Bombardment Group, which he organized in 1931 and commanded until 1934.|$|E

5|$|Recreational divers {{are trained}} in the theory and {{practice}} of decompression {{to the extent that the}} certifying agency specifies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> standard for each certification. This may vary from a rudimentary overview sufficient to allow the diver to avoid decompression obligation for entry level divers, to competence in the use of several decompression algorithms by way of personal dive computers, decompression software, and tables for advanced technical divers. The detailed understanding of decompression theory is not generally required of either commercial or recreational divers.|$|E
5|$|The 29th Infantry Division {{completed}} a two-week warfighter exercise at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in late July 2003. Nearly 1,200 {{soldiers of the}} division participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training,</b> which was overseen by First United States Army. Also engaged in the simulation war were about 150 soldiers of the New York Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division.

5|$|The {{production}} team {{was responsible for}} casting, but Microsoft maintained a final say. The decision to use Alex Puccinelli instead of Steve Downes, the previous voice artist of Master Chief, was approved by Microsoft. The actors playing the cadets attended a boot camp before shooting to raise their fitness and accustom them to assault courses and rifle drills in their armour costumes. Cast members drove themselves to overexertion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training,</b> causing some to vomit, which they saw as a bonding experience.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from his injury, Serevi was {{named in the}} Fiji sevens squad in January 2004.

He then missed selection for the team to play in Hong Kong {{for the second year}} in a row. Pauliasi Tabulutu replaced Laulau as Fiji's coach and recalled Serevi to play in the Bordeaux Sevens. Serevi then played in the London leg of the Sevens Series – his last leg of the year.|$|E

5|$|After three years, on 15 November 1761, Schmitt {{received}} a commission a Fähnrich (ensign) in Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 15 Pallavicini. During his assignment with this regiment, he saw {{service in the}} last years of the Seven Years' War (1765–1763) in the Bohemian theatre. The lack of accurate maps had hampered the conduct of the Seven Years' War and, in 1764, Schmitt was assigned to a project to improve the map-making capacity of the military. The idea of the scientific soldier, or a soldier educated in the specifics of military operations, led to an investment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> and education of officers. The development of map making, and Carlos Pallavicini was at the forefront of this movement. On 1 February 1769, after proving himself capable in this assignment, he was promoted to Oberleutnant (Lieutenant) and transferred to the reorganized General-Quartermaster staff.|$|E
5|$|Although Heber's episcopate {{had been}} brief {{he had made}} a {{considerable}} impression, and news of his death brought many tributes from around India. Sir Charles Grey, an old Oxford friend who was serving as Calcutta's Chief Justice, spoke of Heber's cheerfulness, his lack of self-importance, his good humour, patience and kindness. Flags were flown at half-mast in Madras and Calcutta, and the Governor-General ordered a salute of 42 guns—one for each completed year of the bishop's life. In several cities public subscriptions were opened to raise funds for monuments. In St John's church in Trichinopoly, initially a simple plaque above the grave recorded the date and place of Heber's death; this was in due course made much more elaborate. In St George's church, Madras, a large sculpture by Francis Chantrey was erected, depicting Heber ministering to members of his flock. Reflecting Heber's interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> of local ordinands, further funds were raised to provide Heber scholarships at Bishop's College; in Trichinopoly a school founded by the German missionary Christian Friedrich Schwarz became the Heber Memorial School.|$|E
5|$|Back in 1959 a Laotian Lieutenant Colonel of the {{minority}} Hmong tribe had been taken under the wing of the CIA effort in Laos. The highland Hmong were more aggressive than the lowland Lao and Vang Pao was quickly elevated to their leadership in hopes of creating a paramilitary force that would counter the Pathet Lao in the northeast. During 1961, the first weapons were delivered to the Hmong and their training was begun. Nine CIA specialists, nine U.S. Army Special Forces personnel, and 99 Thai members of the Police Aerial Reconnaissance Unit (PARU) participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> and equipping of {{what became known as}} the Armée Clandestine or the secret army.|$|E

5|$|Both Wacht and Jagd {{served with}} the German fleet in home waters; Wacht in the Maneuver Squadron from 1889 and Jagd <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Training</b> Squadron from 1891. Wacht {{and the rest of}} the Maneuver Squadron went on a major cruise in the Mediterranean Sea in 188990. In 1893, Jagd joined Wacht in the Maneuver Squadron, and both ships served there, {{alternating}} between the I and II Divisions for the rest of the decade. Their activities consisted of periodic divisional and squadron training maneuvers, which culminated in the annual autumn fleet maneuvers in late August and early September.|$|E
5|$|During {{the annual}} fleet {{maneuvers}} in SeptemberOctober 1907, Lepanto was present to carry {{observers of the}} exercises, though she did not directly take part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training.</b> At {{the start of the}} Italo-Turkish War of 191112, Lepanto was assigned to the 5th Division of the Italian fleet, along with her sister Italia and the ironclad Enrico Dandolo. In December 1911, Lepanto and Italia were sent to Tripoli, replacing the three s, to support the Italian garrison that had captured the city. The two Italias were sent in large part because the Italian Navy had a large stockpile of 17-inch shells. Lepanto was stricken on 26 May 1912, but was reinstated on 13 January 1913 as a first-class auxiliary ship. She was stricken a second time on 15 January 1914, sold for scrap on 27 March 1915, and subsequently broken up.|$|E
5|$|España was {{the only}} member of the class {{completed}} by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, though she did not see action, as Spain remained neutral for the duration of the war. In August 1914, she participated in the opening ceremonies for the Panama Canal. Alfonso XIII joined her in August 1915 in the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. In late 1921, Jaime I was finally completed. Throughout the early 1920s, the three ships served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Training</b> Squadron. During this period, Spain became involved in the Rif War in Morocco; all three ships saw action during the conflict, primarily by providing artillery support to Spanish ground forces engaging the Rif rebels. In August 1923, while bombarding Rif positions, España ran aground off Cape Tres Forcas. A lengthy salvage operation failed to free the ship, and in November 1924, the stress of repeated tidal battering broke the wreck in half.|$|E
