5|$|After the {{foundation}} and success of the American School for the <b>Deaf,</b> many other institutions for the <b>deaf</b> were founded throughout the country. Since schools, particularly in the South, were segregated, many Southern states created separate schools or departments for Black <b>deaf</b> children. The first school established for Black <b>deaf</b> children below the Mason–Dixon line opened in the District of Columbia in 1857; it remained segregated until 1958. The last Southern state to create an institution for Black <b>deaf</b> children was Louisiana in 1938. Black <b>deaf</b> children became a language community isolated from White <b>deaf</b> children, with different means of language socialization, allowing for different dialects to develop. Because the education of White children was privileged over that of Black children, oralism—the prominent pedagogical method of the time—was not as strictly applied to the Black <b>deaf</b> students. Oralist methods often forbade the use of sign language, so Black <b>deaf</b> students had more opportunities to use ASL than did their White peers. Despite the decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, integration was slow to come. Schools for the <b>deaf</b> were no exception: the last desegregated in 1978, 24 years after the decision.|$|E
5|$|Black American Sign Language (BASL) or Black Sign Variation (BSV) is a dialect of American Sign Language (ASL) {{used most}} {{commonly}} by <b>deaf</b> African Americans in the United States. The divergence from ASL was influenced {{largely by the}} segregation of schools in the American South. Like other schools at the time, schools for the <b>deaf</b> were segregated based upon race, creating two language communities among <b>deaf</b> signers: White <b>deaf</b> signers at White schools and Black <b>deaf</b> signers at Black schools. Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally desegregated since 1954.|$|E
5|$|More {{schools for}} the <b>deaf</b> were founded after ASD, and {{knowledge}} of ASL spread to these schools. In addition, the rise of <b>Deaf</b> community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL. Societies such as the National Association of the <b>Deaf</b> and the National Fraternal Society of the <b>Deaf</b> held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country. This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{graduating from}} Trinity College, Covell {{accepted}} a teaching {{position in the}} <b>Deaf</b> Department of the Virginia School for the <b>Deaf</b> and the Blind in Staunton, Virginia and relocated there in September 1847. Covell continued teaching until 1852 when he was made a vice-principal of the institution and given charge of the entire <b>Deaf</b> Mute Department.|$|E
5|$|ASL {{is thought}} to have {{originated}} in the American School for the <b>Deaf</b> (ASD), founded in Hartford, Connecticut in 1817. Originally known as The American Asylum, At Hartford, For The Education And Instruction Of The <b>Deaf</b> And Dumb, the school was founded by the Yale graduate and divinity student Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet, inspired by his success in demonstrating the learning abilities of a young <b>deaf</b> girl Alice Cogswell, traveled to Europe in order to learn <b>deaf</b> pedagogy from European institutions. Ultimately, Gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the French Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, and convinced Laurent Clerc, an assistant to the school's founder Charles-Michel de l'Épée, to accompany him back to the United States. Upon his return, Gallaudet founded the ASD on April 15, 1817.|$|E
5|$|ASL is used {{throughout}} Anglo-America. This contrasts with Europe, where {{a variety of}} sign languages are used within the same continent. The unique situation of ASL {{seems to have been}} caused by the proliferation of ASL through schools influenced by the American School for the <b>Deaf,</b> wherein ASL originated, and the rise of community organizations for the <b>Deaf.</b>|$|E
5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the <b>Deaf</b> (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the <b>deaf</b> and <b>Deaf</b> community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of <b>deaf</b> adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.|$|E
5|$|From 1876 to 1888, Gilkeson {{served as}} a member and {{secretary}} of the fourth, fifth, and sixth Board of Regents of the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> and Blind, a position that enabled him {{to become familiar with}} the school's efforts to educate its <b>deaf</b> and blind students.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 1870, the institute, {{which was}} later {{known as the}} West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> and Blind, opened its doors in the old Romney Classical Institute {{building}} with 25 <b>deaf</b> and five blind students. Following its disestablishment in 1916, the adjacent Potomac Academy (formerly Potomac Seminary) grounds were also incorporated into {{the campus of the}} Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> and Blind.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{problems}} with joint attention are associated with developmental processes. Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. Autism spectrum disorders). A core deficit noted in autism is eye gaze. Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object. This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention. <b>Deaf</b> infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in <b>deaf</b> infants born to hearing parents. Hearing parents of <b>deaf</b> infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their <b>deaf</b> infants' initiative and communicative acts. <b>Deaf</b> infants of <b>deaf</b> parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention. Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital. Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of social competence. Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age. In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.|$|E
5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study {{on the effect of}} the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the <b>Deaf</b> community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the <b>deaf</b> by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that <b>deaf</b> children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and <b>deaf</b> people.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1888, Gilkeson was {{delegated}} by the Board to Regents to attend the Conference of Superintendents and Principals of American Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> in New York City and select the most fitting candidate present at the conference or recommended someone to replace him as principal of the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> and Blind. Gilkeson tendered an offer to C.H. Hill, then an instructor at the Maryland School for the <b>Deaf,</b> and upon Gilkeson's return to Romney he recommended Hill and resigned from his post as principal. Hill was subsequently appointed by the Board to fill the position. While the Board of Regents was pleased with Gilkeson's performance as principal and wished for him to stay on in the position, but he preferred {{to return to his}} professional law and political career in the end.|$|E
5|$|Incorrect {{figures are}} {{sometimes}} cited {{for the population}} of ASL speakers in the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics. Demographics of the <b>deaf</b> population have been confused with those of ASL use, since adults who become <b>deaf</b> late in life rarely use ASL in the home. This accounts for currently cited estimations which are greater than 500,000; such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15,000,000. A 100,000-person lower bound has been cited for ASL users; {{the source of this}} figure is unclear, but it may be an estimate of prelingual deafness, which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing.|$|E
5|$|John Collins Covell (December 19, 1823 – June 4, 1887) was a 19th-century American {{educator}} and school administrator specializing in <b>deaf</b> {{education in the}} U.S. states of Virginia and West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|One of {{her more}} {{pioneering}} and innovative charitable causes was the oral instruction of what were {{then called the}} <b>deaf</b> and dumb.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog carries {{recessive}} piebald alleles {{that produce}} {{white in the}} coat and skin and are linked to congenital hereditary deafness, though {{it is possible that}} there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes. Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be <b>deaf</b> in both ears and 14.5% were <b>deaf</b> in at least one ear.|$|E
5|$|The Paralympic Games are {{organized}} {{in parallel with}} the Olympic Games, while the IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games include athletes with intellectual disabilities, and the Deaflympics include <b>deaf</b> athletes.|$|E
5|$|The {{institute}} {{and the society}} experienced a hiatus {{during the course of}} the war. The school held sessions under Reverend Nelson, and subsequently William C. Clayton in 1866. Clayton later served in the West Virginia Senate. The Romney Literary Society was revived in 1869, and following the passage of a bill which established the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> and Blind in March 1870, the society offered the institute's building and grounds to the state of West Virginia for the new school. The institute's property was transferred to the state and the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> and Blind opened for its first term on September 29, 1870. Following the schools' subsequent expansions, the institute's former building became the center portion of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> and Blind, in which capacity it serves at the present day. In addition to Jacob and Clayton, Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia, was also an alumnus of the institute.|$|E
5|$|ASL {{emerged as}} a {{language}} in the American School for the <b>Deaf</b> (ASD), founded in 1817. This school brought together Old French Sign Language, various village sign languages, and home sign systems; ASL was created in this situation of language contact. ASL was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a <b>deaf</b> mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the <b>deaf</b> mute man was opened, the believer should be open to admire God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E
5|$|Gil's mother, Betty, {{who became}} <b>deaf</b> {{as a result}} of the genetic {{disorder}} Otosclerosis, was responsible for his love of books. As a result of his mother's deafness, Gil became fluent in American Sign Language in order to be able to communicate with her.|$|E
5|$|Howard Hille Johnson (February 19, 1846– February 8, 1913) was a blind American {{educator}} and {{writer in the}} states of Virginia and West Virginia. Johnson {{was instrumental in the}} establishment of the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> and Blind in 1870, after which he taught blind students at the institution's School for the Blind for 43 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his career as an academic and educator, Johnson was a prolific writer of prose and verse. He {{was elected to the}} Romney Literary Society, which donated its buildings and the grounds of the Romney Classical Institute to the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> and Blind after its establishment in 1870.|$|E
5|$|In early 1869, Johnson {{identified}} {{the need for}} a school for the blind in the new state of West Virginia; with statehood, <b>deaf</b> and blind West Virginia children attended schools for the <b>deaf</b> and blind in neighboring states (with West Virginia paying their tuition). Johnson began corresponding with West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson, canvassing across the state to arouse public sentiment in support of a school for the blind. Despite rebukes from prominent West Virginian politicians, Johnson became the leading advocate for a state institution for the blind. He and other educated blind people staged an exhibition in the legislative chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates, which was praised by the legislators.|$|E

5|$|On May 15, 1869, nine {{members of}} the Romney Literary Society, {{including}} White, commenced an effort to revive the society's activities and reconstitute its library, which had been destroyed during the war. When the state of West Virginia first founded an institution for <b>deaf</b> and blind students, White helped to pass the legislative act that established the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> and Blind. On April 20, 1870, during {{a meeting of the}} schools' Board of Regents, in Wheeling, White and Andrew Wodrow Kercheval were sent by the Romney Literary Society to make a formal offer of the Romney Classical Institute buildings and grounds to the board. Through White's efforts, the school was established on the former campus of the Romney Classical Institute in Romney, where it remains as of 2015.|$|E
5|$|Romney Academy trustee John Baker White was a {{clerk of}} both the circuit and county courts of Hampshire County and {{was the father of}} Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia from 1877 until 1881. Robert White {{successfully}} lobbied the West Virginia Legislature to pass an act establishing the Institution for the <b>Deaf,</b> Dumb, and Blind of West Virginia (later named the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> and Blind), which utilized the former campus of the Romney Classical Institute, a successor educational institution to Romney Academy. Another trustee, Angus William McDonald, was the father of Marshall McDonald, who served as commissioner of the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries from 1888 until 1895.|$|E

25|$|<b>Deaf</b> culture {{revolves}} around such institutions as residential schools for <b>deaf</b> students, universities for <b>deaf</b> students (including Gallaudet University, South West Collegiate Institute for the <b>Deaf,</b> and the National Technical Institute for the <b>Deaf),</b> <b>deaf</b> clubs, <b>deaf</b> athletic leagues, communal homes (such as The Home for Aged and Infirm Deaf-Mutes in New York City), <b>deaf</b> social organizations (such as the <b>Deaf</b> Professional Happy Hour), <b>deaf</b> religious groups, <b>deaf</b> theaters, {{and an array}} of conferences and festivals, such as the <b>Deaf</b> Way II Conference and Festival and the World Federation of the <b>Deaf</b> conferences.|$|E
25|$|Historically, <b>Deaf</b> {{culture has}} often been {{acquired}} within schools for <b>Deaf</b> students and within <b>Deaf</b> social clubs, both of which unite <b>deaf</b> people into communities with which they can identify. Becoming <b>Deaf</b> culturally can occur at different times for different people, depending on the circumstances of one's life. A small proportion of <b>deaf</b> individuals acquire sign language and <b>Deaf</b> culture in infancy from <b>Deaf</b> parents, others acquire it through attendance at schools, and yet others may not be exposed to sign language and <b>Deaf</b> culture until college or a time after that.|$|E
