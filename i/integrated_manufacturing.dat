40|$|Abstract—Sources of the {{information}} manufacturing system can be integrated with the data storage system in different degrees. Lowly <b>integrated</b> information <b>manufacturing</b> system uses multiple data storage system for storing data in {{the information}} manufacturing system. As a result, lowly <b>integrated</b> information <b>manufacturing</b> system {{was the cause of}} some data quality problems. Therefore, highly <b>integrated</b> information <b>manufacturing</b> system is installed in the organizations. Highly <b>integrated</b> information <b>manufacturing</b> system store data in one single data storage system. Refreshment and query function are to execute in the data storage system of information manufacturing system for making data available and for information support respectively. The tasks of the refreshment function (data loading, indexing) execute sequentially in the single data storage system oriented information manufacturing system. Further, a highly <b>integrated</b> information <b>manufacturing</b> system is developed for executing the tasks of refreshment and query function simultaneously in data storage system. This highly <b>integrated</b> information <b>manufacturing</b> system is the 3 - data storage system oriented information manufacturing system. These highly <b>integrated</b> information <b>manufacturing</b> system could also cause the data quality problems regarding the completeness, accuracy and timeliness data quality dimensions. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to show a comparative data quality scenario of both of these highly <b>integrated</b> information <b>manufacturing</b> system. As a result, simulated highly integrated single and 3 -data storage system oriented information manufacturing system is developed for assessing the data quality of these two information manufacturing system.
