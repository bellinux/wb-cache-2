They live without running water, electricity, sometimes even schools. Their heat their homes, cook their food, do everything needed with burning wood.

Our <b>guest</b> <b>today,</b> with 2 other adventurers were only the third group of white people ever seen in this village of farmers.

In this thesis, we investigate the possibilities for thin hypervisor-based security on embedded platforms. In addition to significant background study, we present implementation of a low-footprint, thin hypervisor capable of providing security protections to a single FreeRTOS guest kernel on ARM. Backed by performance test results, our hypervisor provides security to a formerly unsecured kernel with minimal performance overhead, and represents {{a first step in}} a greater research effort into the security advantages and possibilities of embedded thin hypervisors. Our results show that thin hypervisors are both possible and beneficial even on limited embedded systems, and sets the stage for more advanced investigations, implementations, and security applications in the future.
