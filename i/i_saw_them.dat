Tzipora held Mother's hand. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> {{disappear}} into the distance; my mother was stroking my sister's fair hair...and I did not know that in that place, at that moment, I was parting from my mother and Tzipora forever.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E

It was thocht for lang that Mrs. Gourlay would die, and she {{was never the same}} womman after. Atweel aye, sirs. Gorlay has that morning's work to blame for the poor wife he has now.|$|E

500|$|H.F Sills was an AT RR {{engineer}} {{who had just}} arrived in town and knew none of the parties involved. He testified that he saw [...] "the marshal go up and speak to this other party. <b>I</b> ... <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> pull out their revolvers immediately. The marshal had a cane {{in his right hand}} at the time. He throwed up his hand and spoke. I did not hear the words though. By that time Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp had fired their guns off." [...] Grilled by the prosecution, he corroborated virtually all of the defense's testimony.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain was {{reluctant}} to seek a military alliance with the Soviet Union; he distrusted Joseph Stalin ideologically and {{felt that there was}} little to gain, given the recent massive purges in the Red Army. However, much of his Cabinet favoured such an alliance, and when Poland withdrew her objection to an Anglo–Soviet alliance Chamberlain {{had little choice but to}} proceed. The talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, to which Britain sent only a low-level delegation, dragged on over several months and eventually foundered on 14 August 1939 when Poland and Romania refused to allow Soviet troops to be stationed on their territories. A week after the failure of these talks the Soviet Union and Germany signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact which committed the countries to non-aggression toward each other. A secret agreement divided up Poland in the event of war. Chamberlain had disregarded rumours of a Soviet-German [...] "rapprochement", and was dismissive of the publicly announced pact, stating that it in no way affected British obligations toward Poland. Nevertheless, on 23 August 1939, Chamberlain had Henderson deliver a letter to Hitler telling him that Britain was fully prepared to comply with its obligations to Poland. Hitler instructed his generals to prepare for an invasion of Poland, telling them, [...] "Our enemies are small worms. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> at Munich." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{producers}} {{launched a}} nationwide talent hunt to discover new faces for the film, initially refusing to employ established actors. However, the actors {{who came to}} audition were not promising enough for the roles, and the idea was scrapped. Mahesh Bhatt said, [...] "It was a disastrous talent hunt. We discovered that people lacked the courage to audition. Those who are amateurs went for audition ...and people with certain talent were like why should we risk public rejection." [...] When Suri saw some pictures of Aditya Roy Kapur and met him, he found Kapur perfect for the role and cast him to play the male lead. In June 2012, Shraddha Kapoor was signed to play the female lead. Bhatt said, [...] "Yes, Shraddha Kapoor is playing the lead with the two boys Aditya Roy Kapur and Shaad Randhawa. We found her to be very talented. All three actors have extremely challenging dramatic roles." [...] When asked about replacing new actors with known ones, Suri said [...] "People said I couldn't make a film with new actors and expect an audience to come in. But I was pretty sure I wanted Aditya and Shraddha to play my protagonists. My writer Shagufta Rafique and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> as the protagonists. See, Aditya and Shraddha may have had unsuccessful films before. But that never took away from their talent." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{severity}} of the destructive acts by Union troops was significantly greater in South Carolina than in Georgia or North Carolina. This {{appears to have been}} a consequence of the animosity among both Union soldiers and officers to the state that they regarded as the [...] "cockpit of secession". One of the most serious accusations against Sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn the city of Columbia. In 1867, Gen. O. O. Howard, commander of Sherman's 15th Corps, reportedly said, [...] "It is useless to deny that our troops burnt Columbia, for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> in the act." [...] However, Sherman himself stated that [...] "f I had made up my mind to burn Columbia I would have burnt it with no more feeling than I would a common prairie dog village; but I did not do it ..." [...] Sherman's official report on the burning placed the blame on Confederate Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton III, who Sherman said had ordered the burning of cotton in the streets. In his memoirs, Sherman said, [...] "In my official report of this conflagration I distinctly charged it to General Wade Hampton, and confess I did so pointedly to shake the faith of his people in him, for he was in my opinion a braggart and professed to be the special champion of South Carolina."

2500|$|By August 1939 Hitler was {{convinced}} that the democratic nations would never put up any effective opposition to him.

I was bummed out when they parted ways , but they're doing shows again, which is awesome. As far as influence, the way that I sing, I definitely was inspired by Mike Patton, but lyrically, I approach my songs very differently than Mike Patton does.
