40|$|Flax <b>dew-retting</b> {{is a key}} step in the {{industrial}} extraction of fibers from flax stems and is dependent upon {{the production of a}} battery of hydrolytic enzymes produced by micro-organisms during this process. To explore the diversity and dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities involved in this process we applied a high-throughput sequencing (HTS) DNA metabarcoding approach (16 S rRNA/ITS region, Illumina Miseq) on plant and soil samples obtained over a period of 7 weeks in July and August 2014. Twenty-three bacterial and six fungal phyla were identified in soil samples and 11 bacterial and four fungal phyla in plant samples. Dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes (bacteria) and Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota (fungi) all of which have been previously associated with flax <b>dew-retting</b> except for Bacteroidetes and Basidiomycota that were identified for the first time. Rare phyla also identified {{for the first time in}} this process included Acidobacteria, CKC 4, Chlorobi, Fibrobacteres, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae and TM 6 (bacteria), and Chytridiomycota (fungi). No differences in microbial communities and colonization dynamics were observed between early and standard flax harvests. In contrast, the common agricultural practice of swath turning affects both bacterial and fungal community membership and structure in straw samples and may contribute to a more uniform retting. Prediction of community function using PICRUSt indicated the presence of a large collection of potential bacterial enzymes capable of hydrolyzing backbones and side-chains of cell wall polysaccharides. Assignment of functional guild (functional group) using FUNGuild software highlighted a change from parasitic to saprophytic trophic modes in fungi during retting. This work provides the first exhaustive description of the microbial communities involved in flax <b>dew-retting</b> and will provide a valuable benchmark in future studies aiming to evaluate the effects of other parameters (e. g., year-to year and site variability etc.) on this complex process...|$|E
40|$|Non-wood plant fibres become {{important}} raw materials {{not only for}} textiles, but for other industrial sectors too, as they offer several advantages including low density, short growing cycles, biodegradability, and quite high cellulose content. Technology performance of ligno-cellulose fibres {{in a range of}} applications highly depends on relative content of constituents, mechanical and physical properties of fibres. Content of non-cellulose components and their transition during <b>dew-retting,</b> and main physical and mechanical characteristics of fibres of two flax lines grown in Latvia at 2010 are evaluated and compared with the corresponding properties of ES flax varieties grown in Poland at 2011...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMany works {{deal with}} the {{mechanical}} properties of flaxfibers cultivated for textile applications and today used for the reinforcement of polymers. Nevertheless, quantities of oleaginousflaxfiber are obtained each year and not promoted. The aim of this work is to study the mechanical properties of single linseed flaxfiber {{as a function of}} variety, culture year, <b>dew-retting</b> degree and agronomic factors. Five varieties of oleaginousflax have been characterized by tensile tests on elementary fibers and compared to four varieties of textile flax. These tensile experiments have been carried out on with the same equipment, experimental protocol and environmental conditions. The results show that interesting mechanical properties were obtained with the oleaginous variety and are close of those of textile varieties, such as Agatha or Electra. Considering the diameters and specific properties of these oleaginousfibers, we evidenced that they are good candidates for the substitution of glass fibers in composite materials. To increase the development of flaxfibers, {{it is important to have}} a better control of the spread of their mechanical properties. This point could be observed with the Everest variety cultivated for 4 years and no conclusion could be made. We have evidenced that the retting degree has no influence on the diameters and mechanical properties of the fibers; the same conclusion is obtained with agronomic factors such as seeding rate and plant height...|$|E

Disintegration of hemp fibres separated from non-retted, <b>dew-retted</b> and dried stems of hemp (‘Purini’) by alkali treatment and steam explosion (SE) were investigated. An average intensive SE in combination with the hydro-thermal and alkali after-treatment allows decreasing the diameter of hemp fibres and reduce the concentration of non-celluloses components, among them hemicelluloses, lignin, pectin, waxes and water...|$|R
40|$|The Research {{aim is to}} {{find the}} most time and energy {{economic}} treatment of natural fibres to obtain micro and nanofibres. Alkaline treatment, steam explosion autohydrolysis and ultrasonic treatment effect on hemp fibres and shives dimensions were examined. Fibres length, diameter, form factor and sifting amount were analyzed. The results of the analysis show that an increase in treatment intensity gives a higher amount of fibres being noticeably shorter and thinner than the untreated <b>dew-retted</b> fibres. Fine content of fibres and shives increases, when treatment intensity increases...|$|R
50|$|This is {{a common}} method in areas with limited water resources. It is most {{effective}} in climates with heavy night time dews and warm daytime temperatures. The harvested plant stalks are spread evenly in grassy fields, where the combined action of bacteria, sun, air, and dew produces fermentation, dissolving much of the stem material surrounding the fibre bundles. Within two to three weeks, depending upon climatic conditions, the fibre can be separated. <b>Dew-retted</b> fibre is generally darker in color and of poorer quality than water-retted fibre.|$|R
40|$|Flax and hemp produce phloem fibres {{towards the}} {{periphery}} of their stems; individual fibre cells are cemented into discrete bundles around the xylem core by a complex matrix of pectins, hemi-celluloses and lignin. Extraction of undamaged fibres from this structure is critical in successful fibre production. Typically, the cut stems are laid {{on the ground in}} swaths for several weeks, where aerobic fungi colonize the senescing stem and hydrolytic enzymes digest the fibre-bundle matrix (<b>dew-retting).</b> More recently, flax stems have been chemically desiccated and the fibre-bundle matrix digested in the standing crop, prior to cutting (stand-retting). Dew-retted hemp stems were clamped horizontally into the jaws of a tensile testing machine and the work required to remove a strip of fibre-containing peel from the xylem core was measured. A similar investigation was carried out on desiccated flax stems, but samples were clamped vertically due to their finer diameters. Results show an initial increase in the work to peel associated with the dehydration of the stems, from 185 – 210 J m- 2 in dew-retted hemp and 210 – 540 J m- 2 in desiccated flax. In both cases this initial increase was followed by a 45 % reduction in the work to peel during the following 3 – 4 weeks, despite relatively constant stem moisture content. This is thought to be a result of the retting process. The peel test can be used to monitor changes at the interface between the fibres and the xylem core during retting, allowing the process to be quantified and compared under different production conditions...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} development of hemp fibers non-woven materials for insulation applications in building industry, obtained with two different technologies – thermal bonding and needle punching. Two types of <b>dew-retted</b> hemp fibres harvested in year 2010 – a local dioecious variety “Purini” and an EU registered monoecious industrial hemp variety “Bialobrzeskie” grown in Latvia, were used and their end-product properties compared. The resulting thermal bonded and needle punched hemp nonwoven materials {{with a different}} structures and thicknesses are characterized to determine their physical properties such as thickness, weight per unit area, water vapour transition, porosity, thermal resistance and thermal conductivity to evaluate their suitability as alternative insulation materials. The samples properties between both used technologies were compared. The influence of hemp variety on fabric properties was also estimated.

40|$|Hemp (Cannabis sativa) {{produces}} phloem fibres, {{which are}} formed in bundles towards {{the periphery of}} the stem. This study investigated one aspect of the retting process, the dissociation of these fibres from the core of the stem, which is influenced by the action of micro-organisms. Peel tests were used to investigate the work required to remove a tissue peel, rich in fibres, from the core of the stem. Two separate experiments studied (1) the effects of tissue dehydration as stems were dried out in the oven; and (2) the progress of retting in stems that were <b>dew-retted</b> in the field. A comparison between two different types of peel tests, where the stems were clamped either vertically or horizontally in the jaws of a tensile testing machine and the load applied vertically, showed that the work required to peel stems in the vertical position was over 20...|$|R
40|$|Microfibers and nanofibers {{from natural}} {{products}} have high mechanical properties. For this reason researchers {{pay particular attention}} to the natural fibers and to the method how they are obtained. In the research samples with different treatments (alkaline pretreatment, steam explosion and water extraction) were investigated to evaluate treatment influence on fiber diameters. Fractionation does not provide actual results of fibers diameter as thinner fibers agglomerate to each other and around thicker fibers and cannot be sieved. Fiber diameter measurement with an optical microscope shows that pretreatment and treatment reduced the thickest fiber percentage and increase the number of fine particles. <b>Dew-retted</b> hemp gives 16 % of thicker fibers and only 39 % fibers with a diameters less than 63 µm. 50 % of alkaline pretreated and steam explosion treated fibers diameters are less than 63 µm and only 8 % of diameters fall in range 160 - 630 µm...|$|R
40|$|Hemp {{as natural}} plant is {{essentially}} a composite in which rigid cellulose micro-fibrils are embedded in a soft matrix composed of lignin and hemicellulose. Hemicelluloses and, to some extent, pectin are the primary components of the binding substance of the elementary bast and shive fibres, while lignin plays the part of stabilizer and screen for other fibrogenous substances. Practically all the production of hemp-based chemical pulps are still using the sulphite and sulphate processes not very friendly to environment. Specifics of the physical and chemical structure of hemp plant components are discussed in details in the introduction part of the paper. Experimental investigation of the environmentally friendly steam explosion method applied to disperse the hemp fibres into smaller bundles and individual elementary fibres is carried out, analysis of residuals after every stage of the process, effect of the pressure, and distinction between non-retted and <b>dew-retted</b> fibres are qualified. The effects {{of the content of}} hemp fibres on linear low-density polyethylene matrix composites are illustrated...|$|R
40|$|Two {{kinds of}} retted Canadian linseed flax fibers, <b>dew-retted</b> (F 1) and enzyme-retted flax fibers (F 2) were {{characterized}} in detail for their applications in composites, such as retting degree, thermal stability, tensile strength, and interfacial behavior in polypropylene (PP) matrix. It's clear from Scanning Electron Micrograph that the aspect ratio of F 2 was {{much higher than}} that of F 1 in the light of their separated elementary fibers in most cases. Instead, the elementary fibers of F 1 remained tightly bundled into technical fiber wrapping with more non-cellulose portions. This reflected its lower retting degree and resulted in its lower thermal stability. Single fiber tensile test and single fiber pull-out test were used to evaluate the fiber tensile properties and fiber/PP interfacial shear strength, respectively. Better retting degree and fewer damages on F 2 endowed F 2 better tensile property. Consequently, higher aspect ratio, retting degree, and tensile strength proved F 2 {{to be a kind of}} better reinforcing material than F 1 for composites.

40|$|Seven {{strains of}} {{filamentous}} fungi and one yeast were isolated from flax that was dew retted in the United States. These filamentous fungi were subcultured to purity and identified, and six appear {{not to have}} been reported earlier as isolates from <b>dew-retted</b> flax. Five of the purified U. S. strains, two fungi isolated from flax that was dew retted in Europe, and a laboratory culture of Aspergillus sojae were tested for their ability to ret flax stems. The monocultures were evaluated for the degree of retting, fiber strength, dry weight loss, and tactile response (i. e., feel of softness) as reflected in the retted fiber. Structural modifications of representative samples of the retted flax were assessed by scanning electron microscopy. All of the filamentous fungi were able to carry out some retting, whereas the isolated yeast could not. All organisms produced pectinases when they were cultivated in shake flasks on ball-milled flax as the sole carbon source. Some fungi also produced cellulases, mannanases, and xylanases. Rhizomucor pusillus and Fusarium lateritium were noteworthy as retting organisms by their high level of pectinase activity, ability to attack noncellulosic cell types without attacking cellulose, capacity to penetrate the cuticular surface of the stem, and efficient fiber release from the core. The results indicated that these organisms deserve further study as potential organisms for retting of bast fibers in industrial applications...|$|R
