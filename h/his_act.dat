5|$|Barbette began {{performing}} as an aerialist at around {{the age of}} 14 as one-half of a circus act called The Alfaretta Sisters. After {{a few years of}} circus work, Barbette went solo and adopted his exotic-sounding pseudonym. He performed in full drag, revealing himself as male only at the end of <b>his</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1788, Tarrare {{moved to}} Paris {{to work as}} a street performer. He appears to have been {{successful}} in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the crowd carried him to the HÃ´tel-Dieu hospital, where he was treated with powerful laxatives. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate <b>his</b> <b>act</b> by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.|$|E
50|$|Hardie Boys J {{stated that}} one of the key hurdles in this area of law was {{establishing}} that a director owed a personal duty of care because <b>his</b> <b>acts</b> were <b>his</b> <b>acts</b> as the agent of the company and not of the company itself.|$|R
50|$|The {{court held}} further that, on this approach, the {{emphasis}} {{shifted from the}} precise nature of Van der Westhuizen's intention and the link between <b>his</b> <b>acts</b> and police work, to the dominant {{question of whether or}} not <b>his</b> <b>acts</b> fell within the risks created by the State. The court found that <b>his</b> <b>acts</b> did indeed fall within the purview of the risks created by the State in appointing him as a member of the Force, it being evident that his appointment was conducive to the wrong he committed.|$|R

5|$|In December 2006, Aulie's {{father was}} using a tractor to clear snow off a frozen dugout in {{anticipation}} of an outdoor shinny game on New Year's Day. The ice could not support {{the weight of the}} tractor, and he fell through. Aulie was able to pull his father {{out of the water and}} get him to safety.

5|$|Sometime later, Flik has {{improved}} his inventions {{and the quality}} of life for Ant Island, and Atta professes her love for him, and they give Hopper's younger brother Molt, and a few ants to P.T.

The ants congratulate Flik as a hero and bid a fond farewell to the circus troupe, who promise to return in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} short was a magician who incorporated a rabbit into <b>his</b> <b>act</b> who suffered from stage fright. This {{was considered to be}} too long and complicated, and the idea was reworked. To design the theater featured in Presto, the filmmakers visited several opera houses and theaters for set design ideas. Problems arose when trying to animate the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons; this was deemed too expensive, and was solved by showing the back of the audience.|$|E

25|$|Even though {{negligence}} in {{the treatment}} of the victim was the immediate cause of his death, the jury should not regard it as excluding the responsibility of the accused unless the negligent treatment was so independent of <b>his</b> <b>acts,</b> and in itself so potent in causing death, that they regard the contribution made by <b>his</b> <b>acts</b> as insignificant.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{scenario for}} the short involved a magician who incorporates an autograph seeking rabbit into <b>his</b> <b>act</b> after his previous rabbit leaves him. Complications arise as the new rabbit suffers from stage fright. Sweetland compared it to the plot of A Star Is Born. The idea was reworked due to being too long and complicated, taking an estimated three minutes longer to tell.|$|E
5|$|The {{peace with}} Britain {{proved to be}} uneasy and controversial. Britain did not {{evacuate}} Malta as promised and protested against Bonaparte's annexation of Piedmont and <b>his</b> <b>Act</b> of Mediation, which established a new Swiss Confederation. Neither of these territories were covered by Amiens, but they inflamed tensions significantly. The dispute culminated in {{a declaration of war}} by Britain in May 1803; Napoleon responded by reassembling the invasion camp at Boulogne.|$|E
5|$|A descendent of John de Charlton, {{the first}} Sir Thomas de Charlton, died in 1448 whereupon Swakeleys passed to his son, also named Sir Thomas, who became Speaker of the House of Commons and Member of Parliament for Middlesex. He died in 1465, {{at which point}} his son Sir Richard became owner of the manor. Sir Richard was killed {{fighting}} {{on the side of}} Richard III during the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. The victor of the battle, Henry VII, named him in <b>his</b> <b>Act</b> of Attainder, though he granted Sir Richard's wife Elizabeth a life interest in the manor. However, Sir Thomas Bourchier was subsequently granted the manor of Swakeleys and Covelhall (Cowley). Upon Sir Thomas' death in 1510, the manor passed to Sir John Peeche as his executor. Sir John had no children, so Swakeleys passed to the Earl of Devon, Henry Courteney in 1521. The Earl granted a licence to control Swakeleys to Sir William Fitzwilliam in 1531, who was acting as trustee for Ralph Pexall.|$|E

5|$|Although never gaining wide fame, Ali had a {{dedicated}} following on the vaudeville circuit in the United States. He performed for {{heads of state}} including Tsar NicholasII of Russia. Judy Garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and David Blaine identified Ali as his favorite magician. Portions of <b>his</b> <b>act</b> were captured in the short film Strange as It Seems (1930) and in Politiquerias (1931), the Spanish-language version of Laurel and Hardy's Chickens Come Home. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias: 1977's Gizmo!, and 1999's Vaudeville. Ali's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the Rockefeller Institute had offered a large sum of money to obtain his stomach post-mortem. After he died in England, his body was offered to Johns Hopkins University for study, though the offer was declined.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Homer goes on {{tour with}} the festival and hangs out with The Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill, and Sonic Youth. Homer {{suddenly}} finds himself living the high life: partying with big name rock stars and becoming respected among American youth, including Bart. As the tour approaches {{a stop in}} Springfield, Homer's stomach begins to hurt and he is sent to a veterinarian. The veterinarian advises Homer that if he performs <b>his</b> <b>act</b> one more time, he will die. At first he decides to do his job, {{but at the last}} second he dodges the cannonball. Consequently, he is released from the festival and, despite a warm sendoff from the rock stars, goes back to not being respected by his children.|$|E
5|$|Aware {{of demand}} for <b>his</b> <b>act</b> in Australia, Robey {{conducted}} a second tour of {{the country at the}} start of 1939. While he was appearing at the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney, war broke out with Germany. Robey returned to England and concentrated his efforts on entertaining {{to raise money for the}} war effort. He signed up with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) for whom he appeared in a wide range of shows and also in his own one-man engagements. He would sometimes turn up unannounced to perform at hospitals, munition factories, airfields, anti-aircraft posts and other venues where there was an audience of just a few people.|$|E

5|$|Bart and his catchphrase {{continue}} to be popular, while Krusty creates {{a wide array of}} merchandise featuring Bart's likeness. Bart becomes sick of his fame and begins to fear that the fad will wear off, so he tries to expand <b>his</b> <b>act</b> and personality during an interview on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show, to no avail. Bart decides to stop performing, but Marge convinces him that he should continue because he makes people happy. Bart arrives at Krusty's show and enthusiastically delivers his line, but the audience is bored with the line and does not react. With fans no longer interested in Bart, Krusty ditches him.|$|E
5|$|Born in Wigan, Lancashire, {{he was the}} son of George Formby Sr, {{from whom}} he later took his stage name. After an early career as a stable boy and jockey, Formby took to the music hall stage after the early death of his father in 1921. His early {{performances}} were taken exclusively from his father's act, including the same songs, jokes and characters. In 1923 he made two career-changing decisions â he purchased a ukulele, and married Beryl Ingham, a fellow performer who became his manager and transformed <b>his</b> <b>act.</b> She insisted that he appear on stage formally dressed, and introduced the ukulele to his performance. He started his recording career in 1926 and, from 1934, he increasingly worked in film to develop into a major star by the late 1930s and 1940s, and became the UK's most popular entertainer during those decades. The media historian Brian McFarlane writes that on film, Formby portrayed gormless Lancastrian innocents who would win through against some form of villainy, gaining the affection of an attractive middle-class girl in the process.|$|E
5|$|Criss Angel {{was born}} on December 19, 1967, at Hempstead General Hospital in Hempstead, on Long Island, New York. He is of Greek descent. Angel was raised in Elmont until fourth grade, when {{his family moved to}} East Meadow, New York. His father, John Sarantakos, owned a {{restaurant}} and doughnut shop. He developed an interest in magic at age seven and performed his first show at the age of twelve, for which he was paid $10. His main early influence was Harry Houdini. By fourteen, Angel was performing throughout high school at restaurants in East Meadow, including the Wine Gallery. Angel's first major illusion was making his mother float in their family den. Early in his career he was helped by animal breeder and reality-television host Marc Morrone, who helped Angel find and train a set of doves for <b>his</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{appeal was}} dismissed. The {{court held that}} the fact that Saunders was free to breathe the {{poisonous}} gas or not as she pleased did not free the accused from criminal responsibility for <b>his</b> <b>acts.</b> The accused had contemplated and expected that, as a consequence of <b>his</b> <b>acts,</b> Saunders would die; he therefore intended to kill her, however little he may have desired her death.|$|R
50|$|The {{evidence}} {{showed that}} the accused had the intention to kill. He actually set about encompassing the death of Saunders; <b>his</b> <b>acts</b> went beyond mere preparation. In English law, attempted suicide was a misdemeanour according to Rex v Doody, but according to Rex v Mann, it was a felony. A change of mind after <b>his</b> <b>acts</b> had amounted to an attempt could not avail him.|$|R

5|$|Despite many {{attendees}} at the festival, {{there were}} relatively few witnesses, and the incident {{did not cause}} any delay in the main proceedings. Journalists and others knew {{that they would not}} be able to publish any photographs or movies, so those aware of the incident did not bother recording it other than by accident, nor did any try to investigate it afterward. Most of the few photographs of the incidents have been destroyed or forgotten and lost. Siwiec was censored out of official photographs of the Central Photographic Agency (Centralna Agencja Fotograficzna), which had a monopoly on issuing photos for the press in the era of communist Poland. <b>His</b> <b>act</b> was captured in a 7-second film by a motion picture camera of the Polish Film Chronicle, but the official newsreels of the festival omitted any mention of the incident. This footage however survived, mislabeled either by accident or purpose, until it was rediscovered over twenty years later.|$|E
5|$|Dexter captures Jaworski, {{who admits}} his guilt and {{explains}} {{that he has no}} remorse for <b>his</b> <b>act.</b> After killing Jaworski, Dexter drives to see Rita, but is sidetracked when he sees a refrigerated truck. Dexter follows the truck, and the driver throws a severed head at Dexter's car. When the police squad arrives, LaGuerta confirms that Doakes' case was indeed a crime of passion. Dexter arrives at Rita's apartment, where she expresses interest in taking their relationship to a more intimate level, under the impression that this is what Dexter wants. Dexter feels uncomfortable and is saved when Rita's son, Cody, gets sick next door and needs his mother to pick him up. When Dexter arrives home, he finds a doll's head on his refrigerator door. Inside the freezer, he finds the other parts of the doll, severed just like the bloodless bodies of the dead women. Dexter views the doll as an invitation to play, which he accepts gladly.|$|E
5|$|Due to Maxine's father's illness, Jennings had to shuttle between Arizona and Texas. While {{his family}} lived back in Littlefield, Jennings {{found a job}} briefly at KOYL in Odessa, Texas. He moved {{with his family to}} Coolidge, Arizona, where his wife's sister lived. He found a job {{performing}} at the Galloping Goose bar, where he was heard by Earl Perrin, who offered him a spot on KCKY. Jennings also played during the intermission at drive-in theaters and in bars. After a successful performance at the Cross Keys Club in Phoenix, he was approached by contractors who were building a club for Jimmy D. Musiel, called JD's. Musiel employed Jennings as his main artist and designed the club around <b>his</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E
