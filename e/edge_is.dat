The northern <b>edge</b> <b>is</b> formed by Little Mountain, Locust Mountain, and Mahanoy Mountain. The drainage system of the watershed is a trellis pattern, a dentritic pattern, or an angular drainage pattern.|$|E
5|$|Mirror's <b>Edge</b> <b>is</b> a first-person action-adventure {{platformer}} {{developed by}} EA DICE {{and published by}} Electronic Arts. The game was announced on July 10, 2007, and was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in November 2008. A Microsoft Windows version was released on January 13, 2009. Mirror's <b>Edge</b> <b>is</b> powered by the Unreal Engine 3, {{with the addition of}} a new lighting solution, developed by Illuminate Labs in association with DICE.|$|E

5|$|A {{connected}} component of an undirected graph is the subgraph {{consisting of the}} vertices and edges that {{can be reached by}} following edges from a single given starting vertex. A graph is connected if every vertex or <b>edge</b> <b>is</b> reachable from every other vertex or edge. A cycle in an undirected graph is a connected subgraph in which each vertex is incident to exactly two edges, or is a loop.|$|E

25|$|The graph {{with only}} one vertex and no <b>edges</b> <b>is</b> called the trivial graph. A graph with only {{vertices}} and no <b>edges</b> <b>is</b> known as an edgeless graph.

5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the spine within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each <b>edge</b> <b>is</b> drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page such that the intervals defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E
5|$|Cortinarius iodes {{produces}} a rusty-brown spore print. Spores are elliptical, with a finely roughened surface, measuring 8–10 by 5–6.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 28–39.5 by 9.3–14μm. Both cheliocystidia and pleurocystidia are {{absent from the}} hymenium; the gill <b>edge</b> <b>is</b> populated by basidia and their undeveloped equivalents, basidioles. The cap cuticle comprises a distinctive layer of 3–8μm-wide hyphae that form a layer usually 110–125μm thick; this layer is less distinct or thinner in old or poorly preserved specimens. Clamp connections are present in hyphae throughout the fruit body.|$|E

5|$|Every 3-colorable graph G that {{contains}} a triangle (that is, has the complete graph K3 as a subgraph) is homomorphically equivalent to K3. This is because, on one hand, a 3-coloring of G {{is the same as}} a homomorphism G → K3, as explained below. On the other hand, every subgraph of G trivially admits a homomorphism into G, implying K3 → G. This also means that K3 is the core of any such graph G. Similarly, every bipartite graph that has at least one <b>edge</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to K2.|$|E
5|$|One tourism {{activity}} {{unique to the}} Arctic North is iceberg watching. During the summer season of April to July, {{it is possible to}} watch icebergs moving down rivers while the ice around them melts. In addition, watching the floe <b>edge</b> <b>is</b> also a popular activity due to wildlife movement during this time. Whales can often be seen swimming metres from the ice, polar bears can be observed swimming briefly in the icy water and amphibious animals often bring themselves up onto dry land or onto the ice to sunbathe.|$|E
5|$|Striding <b>Edge</b> <b>is</b> {{a notorious}} {{accident}} spot among hikers and scramblers. In winter conditions the climb from Striding Edge {{up to the}} summit plateau can involve crossing steep icy ground and a snow cornice, and {{can be the most}} dangerous part of the walk. Without an ice axe or crampons this presents a serious obstacle. In January 2008 two walkers died after falling from the ridge in separate incidents. Another walker died after falling from Striding Edge in May 2008.|$|E
50|$|The 24 <b>edges</b> cannot <b>be</b> flipped, {{because the}} {{internal}} {{shape of the}} pieces <b>is</b> asymmetrical. Corresponding <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> distinguishable, since they are mirror images of each other.

5|$|The {{outer edge}} of the vulcanoid zone is {{approximately}} 0.21AU from the Sun. More distant objects are unstable due to the gravitational influence of Mercury and would be perturbed into Mercury-crossing orbits on timescales of the order of 100 million years. The inner <b>edge</b> <b>is</b> not sharply defined: objects closer than 0.06AU are highly susceptible to Poynting–Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect, and even out to 0.09AU vulcanoids would have temperatures of 1,000K or more, which is hot enough for evaporation of rocks to be the limiting factor in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The writing {{field is}} {{surrounded}} by a narrow gold trim decorated with blue and white acanthus leaves. The top <b>edge</b> <b>is</b> decorated with animals and vegetation, along with medallions containing half-figures, such as Jesus flanked by Mary and John the Baptist with four Evangelists. Between the medallions at the top are six pairs of animals. It was the first marriage document to be illuminated.|$|E
50|$|If {{the input}} graph is not already a {{directed}} acyclic graph, {{a set of}} <b>edges</b> <b>is</b> identified the reversal of which will make it acyclic. Finding the smallest possible set of <b>edges</b> <b>is</b> the NP-complete feedback arc set problem, so often greedy heuristics are used here in place of exact optimization algorithms. The exact {{solution to this problem}} can be formulated using integer programming. Alternatively, if the number of reversed <b>edges</b> <b>is</b> very small, these <b>edges</b> can <b>be</b> found by a fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm.|$|R

30|$|The {{results show}} that {{removing}} the detected outlier edges clearly increases the GCC and ALCC values, while random edge removal slightly decreases the values. This confirms the enhancement of the clustering property after outlier <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> removed. The diameter, ED and MSP values all increase when the detected outlier <b>edges</b> <b>were</b> removed. This increase is much more significant than when random <b>edges</b> <b>were</b> removed. This also confirms the theoretical prediction.|$|R
5|$|The ε ring {{is known}} to have {{interior}} and exterior shepherd moons—Cordelia and Ophelia, respectively. The inner edge of the ring is in 24:25 resonance with Cordelia, and the outer <b>edge</b> <b>is</b> in 14:13 resonance with Ophelia. The masses of the moons need to be at least three times the mass of the ring to confine it effectively. The mass of the ε ring is estimated to be about 1016kg.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of the}} first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such <b>edge</b> <b>is</b> labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E
5|$|Dynamical {{friction}} from {{a massive}} belt of planetesimals could also enable Planet Nine's capture {{in a stable}} orbit. Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass disk of planetesimals could have formed via streaming instabilities following the photoevaporation of the outer parts of the gas disk. If the disk had a distant inner edge, 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% chance of being captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine. The observed clustering is more likely if the inner <b>edge</b> <b>is</b> at 200 AU. Unlike the gas nebula the planetesimal disk {{is likely to be}} long lived, potentially allowing a later capture.|$|E
