25|$|Precursors for the {{depiction}} of anthropomorphic animals were the works of Grandville who portrayed individuals for example in Les Métamorphoses <b>du</b> <b>jour</b> (1828–29) with the bodies of men and faces of animals. The caricatures of Charles Philipon {{can also be considered}} as a role model for the illustrators of Punch and other English satirical magazines. The cyclical depiction of Darwin's evolutionary theory might have been modelled on the wood engravings of the illustrator Charles H. Bennett which show transformations of humans into immobile objects and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Already an {{established}} writer (The Vagabond had received three {{votes for the}} prestigious Prix Goncourt), the decades of the 1920s and 1930s were Colette's most productive and innovative period. Set mostly in Burgundy or Paris during the Belle Époque, her work treated married life, sexuality, and the problems of a woman's struggle for independence. It was frequently quasi-autobiographical: Chéri (1920) and Le Blé en herbe (1923) both deal with love between an aging woman and a very young man, a situation reflecting her relationship with Bertrand de Jouvenel and even Goudeket, who was sixteen years her junior. La Naissance <b>du</b> <b>Jour</b> (1928) is her explicit criticism of the conventional lives of women, expressed in a meditation on age and the renunciation of love through the character of her mother, Sido.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} Mexico and the Aztec people changed {{every aspect of}} the native population's lives. The Spanish {{attempted}} to modernize and develop Mexico, focusing much of their attention on what would become Mexico City. This conquest and the accompanying technology provided many of the local inhabitants with new types of work and leisure activity. Buildings erected with modern construction methods and other infrastructure brought immigrants to the city. Along with industrial development and modernization, the Spanish also brought Catholicism. With Catholicism came many festivals and celebrations in which pulque was the drink <b>du</b> <b>jour.</b> Unlike the Aztec reverence for the sacred drink, the Spanish conquistadors did not prohibit excess consumption. Common people were allowed to drink as much pulque as they wished, and with the increase in urban jobs as well as money and leisure time, the consumption and sale of pulque began to rise. By the 1530s, commoners were selling pulque in the streets, and at least twelve pulque stands operated regularly in the city.|$|E

500|$|Hogarth {{took his}} {{inspiration}} for the series from the classical satires of Horace and Juvenal, via their Augustan counterparts, particularly John Gay's [...] "Trivia" [...] and Jonathan Swift's [...] "A Description of a City Shower" [...] and [...] "A Description of the Morning". He took his artistic models from other series of the [...] "Times of Day", [...] "The Seasons" [...] and [...] "Ages of Man", such as those by Nicolas Poussin and Nicholas Lancret, and from pastoral scenes, but executed them with a twist by transferring them to the city. He also drew on the Flemish [...] "Times of Day" [...] style known as points <b>du</b> <b>jour,</b> in which the gods floated above pastoral scenes of idealised shepherds and shepherdesses, but in Hogarth's works the gods were recast as his central characters: the churchgoing lady, a frosty Aurora in Morning; the pie-girl, a pretty London Venus in Noon; the pregnant woman, a sweaty Diana in Evening; and the freemason, a drunken Pluto in Night.|$|E
500|$|After {{seven years}} as {{director}} of the Royal Ballet, MacMillan resigned in 1977, wishing to concentrate on choreography. He was succeeded as artistic director by Norman Morrice, whose background was the more avant garde Ballet Rambert. MacMillan took up the post of principal choreographer. His fourth full-length ballet, Mayerling (1978), was a dark work, portraying the suicides of the Austrian Crown Prince Rudolf and his young mistress. Parry comments that some scenarios for his new one-act ballets featured similarly dark themes: [...] "a disturbed family in My Brother, My Sisters, a lunatic asylum in Playground; Valley of Shadows ... included scenes in a Nazi concentration camp." [...] Different Drummer (1984) was a balletic version of Georg Büchner's Woyzeck, familiar to Covent Garden audiences from Berg's 1925 opera Wozzeck: all three depict the brutal fate of the downtrodden. Even the lighter of MacMillan's ballets could have their serious side: La fin <b>du</b> <b>jour</b> (1979), to Ravel's Piano Concerto in G, depicts a way of life of the 1930s soon to be shattered by the Second World War, and is described by Crisp as [...] "a requiem for the douceur de vivre of an era".|$|E

Sal Cinquenmani of Slant Magazine {{wrote that the}} [...] "most immediately striking thing" [...] about the compilation is [...] "just how many hits [...] has racked up over the years". [...] "So many, in fact, that there's a hefty handful of singles missing from the standard edition of the album", using her number-one single [...] "All I Have" [...] {{as an example of}} this. He stated that Lopez's [...] "output has been nothing if not on trend", and that Dance Again... The Hits plays not only as a chronicle of her music career, but of [...] "pop music as a whole since just {{before the turn of the}} century", with genres spanning Latin pop, dance, and R. According to Cinquenmani, the album also serves as a [...] "historical record" [...] of who the rappers <b>du</b> <b>jour</b> were [...] "over the last dozen years or so", from Big Pun, Fat Joe, Ja Rule, and Lil Wayne. He concluded by stating that if the compilation [...] "proves anything" [...] it's that Lopez is, [...] "if not the queen, then at least the duchess of reinvention and should never be counted out".|$|E

500|$|Various music journalists, {{critical}} theorists, {{and authors}} have deemed Madonna {{the most influential}} female recording artist of all time. She topped VH1's [...] "100 Greatest Women in Music" [...] list and The Daily Telegraphs [...] "20 Greatest Female Artists" [...] list. Author Carol Clerk wrote that [...] "during her career, Madonna has transcended the term 'pop star' to become a global cultural icon." [...] Rolling Stone of Spain wrote that [...] "She became the first viral Master of Pop in history, years before the Internet was massively used. Madonna was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, 'radio formulas', magazine covers and even in bookshops. A pop dialectic, never seen since The Beatles's reign, which allowed her to keep {{on the edge of}} tendency and commerciality." [...] Laura Barcella and Jessica Valenti in the book Madonna and Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop (2012) wrote that [...] "really, Madonna changed everything the musical landscape, the '80s look <b>du</b> <b>jour,</b> and most significantly, what a mainstream female pop star could (and couldn't) say, do, or accomplish in the public eye." [...] William Langley from The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Madonna has changed the world's social history, has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to." [...] Alan McGee from The Guardian felt that Madonna is a post-modern art, the likes of which we will never see again. He further asserted that Madonna and Michael Jackson invented the terms Queen and King of Pop.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, the {{movement}} appealed to reformers, who fortuitously {{found that the}} spirits favored such causes <b>du</b> <b>jour</b> as abolition of slavery, and equal rights for women.

[...] In 1854 the utopian socialist Robert Owen was converted to spiritualism after [...] "sittings" [...] with the American medium Maria B.

The writer of a satirical manifesto entitled Manifeste de l'école amorphiste, published in Les Hommes <b>du</b> <b>Jour</b> (3 May 1913), may have had Metzinger's vision in mind when the author justified amorphism's blank canvases by claiming 'light is enough for us'. With perspective, writes art historian Jeffery S. Weiss, [...] "Vers Amorphisme may be gibberish, {{but it was also}} enough of a foundational language to anticipate the extreme reductivist implications of non-objectivity".|$|E
