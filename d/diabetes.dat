5|$|At least 50% {{of people}} with {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinoma have <b>diabetes</b> {{at the time of}} diagnosis. While long-standing <b>diabetes</b> is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer (see Risk factors), the cancer can itself cause <b>diabetes,</b> in which case recent onset of <b>diabetes</b> could be considered an early sign of the disease. People over 50 who develop <b>diabetes</b> have eight times the usual risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma within three years, after which the relative risk declines.|$|E

5|$|<b>Diabetes</b> {{mellitus}} is a {{risk factor}} for pancreatic cancer and (as noted in the Signs and symptoms section) new-onset <b>diabetes</b> may also be an early sign of the disease. People who have been diagnosed with Type2 <b>diabetes</b> for longer than ten years may have a 50% increased risk, as compared with non-diabetics.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} {{occurs in}} 4.6–8.0 per 1000 people with <b>diabetes</b> annually. Rates {{among those with}} type 1 <b>diabetes</b> are higher with about 4% in United Kingdom developing DKA a year while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually {{as a result of}} DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion or a quarter to a half the total cost of caring for people with type 1 <b>diabetes.</b> There has been a documented increasing trend to hospital admissions. The risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin. About 30% of children with type 1 <b>diabetes</b> receive their diagnosis after an episode of DKA.|$|E
5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 <b>diabetes,</b> {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may be because they were being used in people with type 1 <b>diabetes,</b> but in those with type 2 <b>diabetes</b> it may be {{as a result of an}} increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} {{suspected}} ketosis-prone type 2 <b>diabetes,</b> determination of antibodies against {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} and islet cells may aid in the decision whether to continue insulin administration long-term (if antibodies are detected), or whether to withdraw insulin and attempt treatment with oral medication as in type 2 <b>diabetes.</b> Generally speaking, routine measurement of C-peptide {{as a measure of}} insulin production is not recommended unless there is genuine doubt as to whether someone has type 1 or type 2 <b>diabetes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Keto{{acidosis}} is {{not always}} the result of <b>diabetes.</b> It may also result from alcohol excess and from starvation; in both states the glucose level is normal or low. Metabolic acidosis may occur in people with <b>diabetes</b> for other reasons, such as poisoning with ethylene glycol or paraldehyde.|$|E
5|$|Metformin, marketed {{under the}} trade name Glucophage among others, is the {{first-line}} medication {{for the treatment}} of type 2 <b>diabetes,</b> After ten years, the incidence of <b>diabetes</b> was 34% lower in the group of participants given diet and exercise and 18% lower in those given metformin. It is unclear whether metformin slowed down the progression of prediabetes to <b>diabetes</b> (true preventive effect), or the decrease of <b>diabetes</b> in the treated population was simply due to its glucose-lowering action (treatment effect).|$|E

25|$|Other {{forms of}} <b>diabetes</b> {{mellitus}} include congenital <b>diabetes,</b> which {{is due to}} genetic defects of insulin secretion, cystic fibrosis-related <b>diabetes,</b> steroid <b>diabetes</b> induced by high doses of glucocorticoids, and several forms of monogenic <b>diabetes.</b>|$|E
25|$|All {{people with}} <b>diabetes</b> {{mellitus}} are at riskthose with Type I <b>diabetes</b> {{and those with}} Type II <b>diabetes.</b> The longer a person has <b>diabetes,</b> the higher their risk of developing some ocular problem. Between 40 and 45 percent of Americans diagnosed with <b>diabetes</b> have some stage of diabetic retinopathy. After 20 years of <b>diabetes,</b> nearly all patients with Type I <b>diabetes</b> and >60% of patients with Type II <b>diabetes</b> have some degree of retinopathy; however, these statistics were published in 2002 using data from four years earlier, limiting {{the usefulness of the}} research. The subjects would have been diagnosed with <b>diabetes</b> in the late 1970s, before modern fast acting insulin and home glucose testing.|$|E

25|$|Approximately 27 million Americans, {{or nearly}} 11% of the population, have <b>diabetes,</b> {{according}} to the American <b>Diabetes</b> Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Approximately 1.9 million new cases of <b>diabetes</b> are diagnosed each year. The disease was the seventh leading cause of death in 2007, directly claiming more than 71,000 lives and contributing to approximately 160,000 additional deaths. Patients with <b>diabetes</b> are two to four times more likely than those without it to die from cardiovascular disease, and <b>diabetes</b> is an important cause of blindness, kidney disease, and lower-extremity amputations.|$|E

25|$|<b>Diabetes</b> is {{the most}} common nonpulmonary {{complication}} of CF. It mixes features of type 1 and type 2 <b>diabetes,</b> and is recognized as a distinct entity, cystic fibrosis-related <b>diabetes.</b> While oral antidiabetic drugs are sometimes used, the recommended treatment is the use of insulin injections or an insulin pump, and, unlike in type 1 and 2 <b>diabetes,</b> dietary restrictions are not recommended.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diabetes</b> {{mellitus}} and pregnancy {{deals with}} the interactions of <b>diabetes</b> mellitus (not restricted to gestational <b>diabetes)</b> and pregnancy.

25|$|In a way, prediabetes is {{a misnomer}} {{since it is}} {{an early stage of}} <b>diabetes.</b> It now is known that the health {{complications}} associated with type 2 <b>diabetes</b> often occur before the medical diagnosis of <b>diabetes</b> is made.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{may also}} be {{involved}} in not just type I <b>diabetes,</b> but also type II <b>diabetes.</b> Specifically, sulfatide is capable of inhibiting TNF-α secretion. When there are low serum levels of sulfatide, as well as elevated production of TNF-α in patients that have type II <b>diabetes,</b> it is commonly associated with insulin resistance. However, sulfatide may mediate suppression of type II <b>diabetes</b> through the activation of potassium protein channels.|$|E
25|$|Gestational <b>diabetes</b> is a {{condition}} in which a woman without <b>diabetes</b> develops high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. Gestational <b>diabetes</b> generally results in few symptoms; however, it does increase the risk of pre-eclampsia, depression, and requiring a Caesarean section. Babies born to mothers with poorly treated gestational <b>diabetes</b> are at increased risk of being too large, having low blood sugar after birth, and jaundice. If untreated, it can also result in a stillbirth. Long term, children are at higher risk of being overweight and developing type 2 <b>diabetes.</b>|$|E

25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimates}} that <b>diabetes</b> mellitus resulted in 1.5 million deaths in 2012, {{making it the}} 8th leading cause of death. However another 2.2 million deaths worldwide were attributable to high blood glucose and the increased risks of cardiovascular disease and other associated complications (e.g. kidney failure), which often lead to premature death and are often listed as the underlying cause on death certificates rather than <b>diabetes.</b> For example, in 2014, the International <b>Diabetes</b> Federation (IDF) estimated that <b>diabetes</b> resulted in 4.9 million deaths worldwide, using modeling to estimate {{the total number of}} deaths that could be directly or indirectly attributed to <b>diabetes.</b>|$|E
