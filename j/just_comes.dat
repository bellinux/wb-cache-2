25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> right together again.|$|E
500|$|Morrison has {{described}} his songwriting method by remarking that: [...] "I write {{from a different}} place. I do not {{even know what it}} is called or if it has a name. It <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> and I sculpt it, {{but it is also a}} lot of hard work doing the sculpting." ...|$|E

Frank Spotnitz said [...] "Redux II is one of my {{favorite}} episodes. I think the story has a crystal purity and clarity, and it <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> to a perfect point for me". Anderson said [...] "I thought it was a terrific episode, especially the scenes in the hearing room, and the whole progression of Scully praying. How it was written and shot and how it was edited. Fabulous".|$|E

[...] But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that'. In 'Miles Away' I'm tapping into the global consciousness of people who have intimacy problems.|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{an awesome}} producer. He {{really helped me}} get the plan and have {{confidence}} in the decisions that we made. For me, I have a lot of ideas and sometimes it <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> down to [...] "OK, everything that I'm doing I have two options!" [...] He's awesome, because as I'm doing these things I'm asking him from the vocal booth or the piano room or whatever, [...] "Which one of these should I do?" [...] He's good at helping me make a quick decision. I really trust his opinion because he makes great records.|$|E
500|$|Colin Jacobson for DVD Movie Guide {{was also}} positive, saying, [...] "'Unbonding' marks a {{demonstrable}} {{improvement over the}} pilot. No one will mistake the episode {{for one of the}} series' greats, but at least the characters start to resemble the ones we'd come to know later. In addition, it tosses out just enough humor to make it enjoyable." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying, [...] "It's a pretty funny episode– my main criticism is just that at this point, Kramer isn't integrated at all into the stories, rather he <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> by and dispenses weird dialog for a couple minutes." ...|$|E

Series' writer Joan Rater commented on this: [...] "Izzie getting the clean scan back gives Alex the freedom to leave. Because {{he never would have}} left her when she was sick, he's a good guy. And I'm not saying that Alex ever consciously thought, I can’t leave her while she's sick, but now that she's not, now that she seems like she's going to get better, it <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> to him. He deserves more. He's a good guy and he deserves more. But loving Izzie showed him that he can be good, is good. So it was a little gift. And when he tells Izzie he's done, he's not bitter or angry, he's just done." [...] The writing of the two-part season six finale, caused struggle to Rhimes. She elaborated on this: ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the shoot}} {{of the music}} video for [...] "First" [...] (2005), Lohan {{revealed}} {{in an interview with}} MTV that she was preparing her sophomore studio album. [...] "When you get into the studio, everything <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> out," [...] she said. [...] "All your creative juices are there. I don't [...] leave. I'll still be in there until all hours, and it's {{nice to be able to}} do that." [...] Lohan began writing lyrics for the album in June 2005, after the last single from her previous album had been released. [...] "I've been writing a lot, almost every night," [...] she said. [...] "There's been a lot going on , and I think people can find that escape in hobbies that they do. I don't do yoga or anything, but some people use that. Everyone has their own thing, and I use writing." [...] Initially titled There's Only One Angel In Heaven, the pop rock album features a darker theme when compared to Lohan's previous album, Speak (2004).|$|E
500|$|Cole Waterman of PopMatters {{awarded the}} album {{a score of}} eight out of ten, finding the record to be the group's [...] "most {{accessible}} by far". Waterman described the album's composition as [...] "catchy", finding {{it to be an}} appropriate response to the band's previous album Anonymous; he also highlighted the [...] "absurdist" [...] tone of the record's lyrics—pointing out [...] "South Paw" [...] and [...] "Waratorium" [...] as particular examples of this. Pitchfork Media's Paul Thompson scored Oddfellows 6.8 out of ten, considering it [...] "Tomahawk's most straightforward, stripped-down release to date". Thompson considered the group's main dynamic to consist of Denison's compositions and Patton's vocals, finding that bass player Dunn [...] "hangs back here, ably holding down the low end without overasserting himself". Thompson also debated the effect that the album's short germination period had on its overall composition, believing that the brief recording time lent the record [...] "a feeling that, whenever you get these guys in the same room, this music [...] <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> tearing out".|$|E

500|$|Gem Wheeler of Den of Geek {{gave the}} series {{five out of}} five stars, {{particularly}} praising Smith's Doctor. Wheeler noted that Amy [...] "seemed a little underwritten at first, but the series finale helped {{to fill in the}} apparent gaps in her personality" [...] and also praised Darvill. Slice of SciFi reviewer Michael Hickerson praised Moffat's [...] "fascinating" [...] story arc which made the series seem more consistent, as it gave the audience answers as it went along and also explored its impact on the characters. He called it [...] "the best season of the new series" [...] though [...] "there has yet to be a perfect season of the show. This one <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> closer than a lot of others". However, Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph, while optimistic that it would [...] "go from strength to strength next year", called the series [...] "something of a curate's egg, and perhaps not quite as strong as previous years overall". Radio Times Patrick Mulkern praised Moffat for [...] " [...] the series with an ambitious game-plan, a delightful fairy-tale vibe adults can enjoy too, and [...] stars in Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill". However, while he praised Moffat's other episodes, he considered [...] "The Beast Below" [...] a [...] "turkey".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Rhimes said she tried {{to talk him out}} of quitting, explaining: [...] "I looked in his face and he was really sure. It felt like the right thing for him." [...] However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: [...] "My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [...]" [...] Knight was [...] "at peace" [...] with his departure, saying: [...] "There <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> a time when it's so clear that moving on is the best decision." [...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like to be in my position. But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E
500|$|With Interview magazine, Madonna {{explained}} her inspirations {{behind the}} songs and the music of Hard Candy. She said that [...] "probably in many respects most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an unconscious way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. It <b>just</b> <b>comes.</b> And {{then a lot of}} times, six months later, eight months later, I go, 'Oh, that's what I wrote that song about.' But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that.'" [...] "Candy Shop" [...] is the opening track of the album. Produced by Williams, the song uses the word candy as a metaphor for sex. Williams said, [...] "We were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, give me some hot shit.' I was looking at her like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we just worked and made it." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "4 Minutes", was initially known as [...] "4 Minutes to Save the World". The song's development was motivated by a sense of urgency to save the planet from destruction, and how people can enjoy themselves in the process. According to Madonna, the song inspired her to produce the documentary I Am Because We Are. The song features vocals by Timberlake and Timbaland. An uptempo dance song with an urban, hip hop style, it also incorporates Timbaland's bhangra beats. The instrumentation used in the song includes brass, foghorns and cow bells. The song's lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed.|$|E

500|$|... "Soldier" [...] {{was written}} by Badu {{immediately}} after receiving Riggins' beat for the song. He said Badu wanted it to have a sound similar to J Dilla and his Detroit hip hop scene, which Riggins was inspired by: [...] "A lot of producers from Detroit have a certain sound, and I think it <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> from being in the city." [...] Its sociopolitical lyrics have Badu expressing sympathy and solidarity for those facing oppression, with references to police corruption, black-on-black crime, and Hurricane Katrina. [...] "The Cell" [...] was produced by Husayn and features a lively, choral style and hard bop feel. Titled {{as a metaphor for}} both heredity and confinement, the song is a tableau of crime, drugs, and desperation in urban decay, streamlined by a stark story about Brenda, a character who falls victim to her environment. Cited by Chavarria as the album's most effects-heavy track, [...] "Twinkle" [...] features a futuristic sound, a convoluted beat, and abstract aural elements such as white noise bursts, high-pitched voices, abrasive instruments, and layers of twinkling keyboard bass. The lyrics lament the plight of the Black community and the cyclical effects on African Americans by the various failures of American social institutions such as the health care, education, and prison systems. Badu raps in the song's verse, [...] "Children of the matrix be hittin’ them car switches / Seen some virgin Virgos hanging out with Venus bitches", followed by her singing, [...] "They don’t know their language, they don’t know their God". Over humming keyboards, the closing minutes of the song feature a speech in the ancient African language of Mdw Ntchr, followed by a speaker's rant inspired by actor Peter Finch's own rant in the 1976 film Network. The speaker angrily laments the state {{of the world and the}} complacency of people. Philadelphia Weeklys Craig D. Linsey likened [...] "Twinkle" [...] to a denser version of Marvin Gaye's 1971 song [...] "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)".|$|E
2500|$|On October 3, 2006, Strait {{marked his}} 30th {{year in the}} music {{industry}} with the release of a new album titled It <b>Just</b> <b>Comes</b> Natural. The album was recorded in Key West, Fla. in Jimmy Buffett's Shrimp Boat Sound Studio (said to be a better recording location due to lack of allergy flare ups during recording process), which was also the recording location of [...] "Troubadour". [...] It featured fifteen new songs. Strait's long-time friend and songwriter, Dean Dillon co-wrote two of the songs on the album. It received generally positive reviews from critics. People, in their four-star review, remarked that [...] "If ever there was a natural in country music, it's Strait," [...] while USA Today raved that [...] "he continues to make such consistent quality look easy". The first single from the album, [...] "Give It Away" [...] reached No.1, making one of its co-writers, country legend [...] "Whispering Bill" [...] Anderson, the first songwriter to have a #1 hit in five different decades.

2500|$|Considered {{to be more}} {{emotional}} than the lead single, [...] "Still Breathing" [...] is characterized as a [...] "serious" [...] track.
