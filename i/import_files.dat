50|$|BackTrack 5 - This latest {{release from}} Offensive Security {{is based on}} Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Linux. Three {{graphical}} desktop environments can be chosen from: Gnome, KDE, and Fluxbox. Over 300 application programs are included for penetration testing, such as network monitors and password crackers, but also Metasploit 3.7.0, an exploit framework. BackTrack 5 is a live distribution, {{but there is also}} an ARM version available for the Android operating system, allowing tablets and smartphones to be used for mobile penetration testing of Wi-Fi networks. BackTrack can be installed on hard disk, both alone and in dual boot configuration, on a USB flash drive, and in VMware. Metasploit's effectiveness is caused by the large number of exploits that are updated continually. In August 2011, there were 716 exploits for all usual operating systems together. Armitage is the GUI for Metasploit within BackTrack 5. This GUI can <b>import</b> <b>files</b> in XML format, and it supports Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit-Express.|$|E

40|$|Ad hoc File System (AFS) is {{middleware}} for peers {{wishing to}} share and access data in ad hoc fashion. AFS permits processes to export local files and <b>import</b> <b>files</b> shared by other processes. Communication between hosts is facilitated by the M 2 MI Framework, a novel paradigm for building collaborative systems. The API provided by AFS allows for data to be exported to the middleware, which become accessible to hosts running AFS. Interested peers can import exported data to their local system, allowing uniform access to local and remote files. Peers can also unexport and unimport data undoing effects of export and import operations. To illustrate functionalities of Ad hoc File System, two user applications have been developed. The first is a character based console application similar to shells, such as the K shell, {{and the second is}} a visual application that demonstrates how the file system in AFS changes due to different operations...|$|E

The goal of this project is to enhance the VisCTM model, which was created last summer with additional flexibilities such as reading from NetCDF files. Also, the ability to process multiple time steps for multiple species at the same time. VisCMAQ {{would be able to}} read, and visualize different types of data that is written in C Language. These enhancements will allow the new VisCMAQ to accept an incorporation of data sets for various spatial domains and sets of chemical species. At this process the Visualization of the output from Multi scale Air Quality (VisCMAQ) model will be created. This VisMAQ project will link VisCTM tools with the Environmental Protection Agency’s Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model system; which will utilize VisCTM <b>import</b> <b>files</b> written by the IOAPI library that is built upon the NetCDF file format...|$|E
40|$|Spock is an {{open source}} tool for the easy {{deployment}} of time-aligned corpora. It is fully web-based, and has very limited server-side requirements. It allows the end-user to search the corpus in a text-driven manner, obtaining both the transcription and the corresponding sound fragment in the result page. Spock has an administration environment to help manage the sound files and their respective tran-scription files, and also provides statistical data about the files at hand. Spock uses a proprietary file format for storing the alignment data but the integrated admin environment allows you to <b>import</b> <b>files</b> {{from a number of}} common file formats. Spock is not intended as a transcriber program: it is not meant as an alternative to programs such as ELAN, Wavesurfer, or Transcriber, but rather to make corpora created with these tools easily available on line. For the end user, Spock provides a very easy way of accessing spoken corpora, without the need of installing any special software, which might make time-aligned corpora corpora accessible to a large group of users who might otherwise never look at them. 1...|$|E

40|$|While we {{wait for}} {{intraoral}} scanners to gain more acceptance, impressions and models {{can be sent to}} laboratories right now for these new processes. Laborator-ies are equipped with devices that look something like a small oven. A model is mounted inside and then, using lasers, cameras, or “touch devices, ” the models are moved in a pattern that allows the scan-ners to digitally copy the forms. The dig-ital file is then sent to a computer, which creates the virtual model. Those readers who have used Invisalign ® (Align Tech-nology, Inc, Santa Clara, CA) are already familiar with this process. In the labora-tory world, Procera ® (Nobel Biocare, Yor-ba Linda, CA) (Figure 1 and Figure 2) {{was one of the first}} to use this technology. The scanner used is a probe that “feels ” around the preparation to develop the digital mo-del. In choosing a system for a laborato-ry, two things to consider are the detail and accuracy of the scanner. This of course will have a great impact on the final re-sult, much like the intraoral impression’s impact on the fit of a restoration. SOFTWARE The ideal situation is software that is “open,” in that it can <b>import</b> <b>files</b> from other sys-tems using standardized formats. For the technically oriented, these are ASCII, STL, and IGES. The software can be used to de-sign and construct crowns, bridges, in-lays, and implant restorations. In addition, there are modules to calculate the articu-lation as well as a system to create tele-scopic copings. The latter is intriguing as it is not always possible for the dentist to create a full arch of precisely parallel pre-parations. The computer can calculate, de-sign, and build the copings, which can be cemented to yield a well-seating bridge. Any laboratory technician who has had to wax up multiple telescopic copings with a hand-adjustable surveyor would wel-come this feature.

40|$|About this release :information_source: Note {{that the}} links in this note will be live {{after a short}} delay, during which they {{percolate}} through the various indexing services which harvest ENVO. Eponyms for this release meteor The terms for the omics community in our envoEmpo. owl subset This release features {{a wide range of}} new classes and improved axiomatisation across ENVO; however, it is primarily driven by requests from the Earth Microbiome Project to axiomatise and integrate the project's EMPO vocabulary into ENVO and other ontologies. Several lake-releated classes are being created to support the AquaDiva project and foundational semantics for extending atmospheric semantics have been developed. The continuation of work with CESAB and the generation of this synthesis centre's subset In addition, more upper-level classes from BFO have been imported to begin the restructuring of ENVO's branches for improved axiomatisation, interoperation with other OBO resources, and clarity. Users should prepare for the environmental feature branch to be markedly restructured (most individual PURLs will not be affected, only their positioning and axioms). :warning: Dead Simple Design Patterns were used to generate classes not mentioned in this note.
