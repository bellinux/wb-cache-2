[...] Lee Bacchus of The Province wrote that [...] "This little book by the voice of Bart Simpson reads as if it were written by a 10-year-old boy. Not that that's all bad. Cartwright, who voices Bart along with Ralph Wiggum and a few others on The Simpsons, gives a very unchallenging tour behind the scenes of the phenomenally successful series.

500|$|Mega Man Battle Network was {{developed}} by Capcom Production Studio 2 amidst the success of Nintendo's portable RPG franchise Pokémon. Rather than extend upon the traditional action-platform formula for the Mega Man series as they had done with the 3D Mega Man Legends, Capcom followed Nintendo's example on the latter's then-newest handheld console, the GBA. While creating Battle Network, director Masahiro Yasuma found difficulty in blending action attributes with [...] "the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> you get from a Pokémon game" [...] {{in order to make}} it enjoyable, new, and fresh. Yasuma recalled that production was further challenged because no effective precursor of its type had been made before. Producer Keiji Inafune stated that the development team wanted to add a [...] "real world" [...] feel to the Mega Man series by placing the protagonist of Battle Network in a location where the internet is prevalent. With the release of the portable GBA, the team felt that they should target modern gamers, specifically children, as an audience for the new series. The developers thought such a theme would be both successful and relevant because these younger gamers grew up with and utilized such technology on a daily basis. To ensure the game's popularity, Capcom marketed Battle Network alongside an afternoon anime adaptation, emphasized head-to-head matches between players, and provided fans with exclusive content via special events.|$|E

Pryce's dinner does not go smoothly; the Jaguar representative appears to have no regrets in his life, and Lane is forced to plan another lunch to try again at confirming the new business. Upon hearing of this failure, Pete tactfully tells Lane to maintain a friendly relationship with the target, and to let Accounts take the business from there. Roger compliments Pete's letting Lane down softly and taking the task off his hands, forming a renewed alliance with Pete. At the dinner meeting, Edwin, the Jaguar representative, assures Don, Roger, and Pete they have his business, {{but he wants to}} have some fun. The executives quickly learn what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> Edwin has in mind and they visit a local brothel, where Edwin, Roger, and Pete all cheat on their wives, leaving Don at the bar. Don later shares a cab with Pete on the way home in which the latter, drunk, criticizes Don as hypocritical for judging Pete's adulterous actions. Don explains he is not judging; he merely didn't know Pete was miserable. Pete replies sarcastically that he has everything, and Don warns him not to throw it away.|$|E
500|$|Eager {{to explore}} the music video medium, Stipe secured funding for a short film that would {{accompany}} music from {{the first half of}} Reckoning. Stipe's concept was to film the project at folk artist R.A. Miller's Whirlgig Farm, and he recruited Athens filmmaker James Herbert to direct it. In March 1984 R.E.M. filmed Left of Reckoning at the Whirlgig Farm in Rabbittown, Georgia. The short film draws its title {{from the fact that it}} is soundtracked by five songs that appear on the [...] "L" [...] side of the vinyl version of Reckoning: [...] "Harborcoat", [...] "7 Chinese Bros.", [...] "So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)", [...] "Pretty Persuasion", [...] "Time After Time (AnnElise)", in addition to [...] "Second Guessing" [...] from the R side. In contrast to standard music video imagery, the film consists primarily of footage of the band members wandering around the farm, while Herbert utilizes close-ups, silhouettes, and slow motion footage. Herbert utilized rephotography during the editing process, which involved taking photographs of film frames at random, while also closing in or pulling back from the image with no regard to narrative. According to Buck, [...] "It was really inexpensive to make and <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun.</b> We just asked [...] to edit something to four minutes' length, but he's used to making 20-minute films, that's the length he works in. He just made this film that goes along with the first side of the record."

Saltz praised Mamoru Hosoda's direction, and says it [...] "matches the clean, classically composed images of his [...] outer story."

In his review for Variety critic Peter Debruge stated that Hosoda's direction [...] "appeals to the hard-to-please teen crowd by taking mind-bending ideas and planting them within a relatable contempo context." [...] He also praised the CG animation in the OZ sequences. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Hosoda's style and said that it [...] "adds enough dimensions to his characters and kinetic battles that the serene real world seems like a dream state."

[...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. He stated that [...] "Summer Wars is most appealing in its hushed moments" [...] and also praised Satoko Okudera's writing, stating that it [...] "stakes a claim for the non-virtual world of history and of family ties that stretch back to Japan’s medieval era." [...] He also praised the OZ animation sequences as [...] "visually ravishing explorations of white-on-white cyberspace, but the hectic gaming action sequences feel curiously passé." [...] Burr notes that in the film, [...] "it's what's old that's made to seem refreshingly new." [...] In his review for the New York Post V.A. Musetto gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and called the film [...] "great despite its structural problems". Musetto also complained about the storyline, stating that the [...] "sci-fi elements seem silly rather than suspenseful."

500|$|The film's entire {{recording}} process took {{approximately three}} years to complete, during which Kelly's sessions were held in both the United States and Canada, while her co-stars Broderick and Jeremy Irons, voice of Scar, were recording in the United States and England, respectively. Each main cast member recorded their dialogue separately, which took Kelly some time {{to get used to}} because she had grown accustomed to working with several other actors at a time on the sets of live-action films. For The Lion King, a director would often take the place of another actor for Kelly to act opposite of. Vocally, Kelly decided to approach the role as though she were reading to a child, explaining, [...] "it's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> to play with different voices and try to color the lines for the child so they can imagine it more fully", which she admitted is different than how the actress would approach a live-action role. Because Nala is a [...] "very straight character", determining what kind of voice she would use for her was not a particularly challenging task. Additionally, the filmmakers would also film Kelly's performances in order to incorporate her own facial expressions into her character's design, the process of which impressed the actress. In her film debut, actress Niketa Calame voices young Nala. According to Calame's official website, Nala remains the actress' [...] "biggest role to date". A classically trained pianist and chorister, Laura Williams provides the singing voice of young Nala, which can be heard in the song [...] "I Just Can't Wait to Be King"; the singer was 15 years old at the time. Meanwhile, singer-songwriter Sally Dworsky provides the singing voice of adult Nala, which is heard during the song [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight". The film's love theme, [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight"'s lyrics were re-written approximately 15 times, according to lyricist Tim Rice, who wrote the song alongside composer Elton John. At one point, the producers wanted the song to be a comical duet performed by supporting characters Timon and Pumbaa, despite the fact that John had originally composed the song with Nala and Simba in mind. However, John lobbied in favor of [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" [...] being a love song performed as a duet by Nala and Simba, with which the filmmakers ultimately agreed.|$|E
