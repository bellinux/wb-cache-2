40|$|Operational Amplifier Speed and Accuracy Improvement {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} {{for the design}} of analog integrated circuits. The usefulness of this methodology is demonstrated through the design of an operational amplifier. This methodology consists of the following iterative steps: description of the circuit functionality at a high level of abstraction using signal flow graphs; equivalent transformations and modifications of the graph to the form where all important parameters are controlled by dedicated feedback loops; and implementation of the structure using a library of elementary cells. Operational Amplifier Speed and Accuracy Improvement shows how to choose structures and design circuits which improve an operational amplifier's important parameters such as speed to power ratio, open loop gain, common-mode voltage rejection ratio, and power supply rejection ratio. The same approach is used to design clamps and limiting circuits which improve the performance of the amplifier outside of its linear operating region, such as slew rate enhancement, output short circuit current limitation, and <b>input</b> <b>overload</b> recovery.

If the signal is strong enough, it can cause clipping at the analog-to-digital converter, even after filtering.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{persistent}} {{series of}} issues and problems in training, simulation and education are those associated with the efficient and effective collection of information. These issues become exacerbated as the data being generated increasingly outstrips the human capacity to sense, remember and analyze {{the results of the}} effort. These shortcomings can occur in several dimensions, including volume of information (data glut), speed of transmission to the analyst (<b>input</b> <b>overload),</b> and geographical dispersion of the data (distributed data). The authors have been wrestling with these issues {{for more than a decade}} and present both a theoretical overview and a practical set of lessons learned based on those experiences. A review of the problems and a survey of various approaches to their solution will be presented. One of the issues most problematic is the need to reliably collect all of the germane information that is required or desired by the user or analyst without negatively impacting the training, simulation or education that is the primary focus of the activity. Acknowledging theoretical limits to non-intrusive observation, the goal is held to be: maximize the data and minimize the disruption. The authors lay out with specificity their development of the JLogger system to collect needed information out of the Joint Forces Command’s experimentation that typically uses Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF) simulations for analysis and evaluation.

40|$|A {{good deal}} of {{research}} has recently been directed at analyzing the relationship between population density {{and the perception of}} crowding. This research was reviewed by outlining the variables that have been shown to increase (<b>input</b> <b>overload,</b> behavioral interference, and personal space violations) and decrease (activity and termination control) the perception of crowding. It was then proposed that affective variables, as well as cognitive and behavioral variables, have a significant influence on the perception of crowding. In order to test for the effects of affective and cognitive variables on the perception of crowding, a short-term high density laboratory experiment was conducted. In this experiment, individuals in all-male, all-female, or mixed-sex groups, were exposed to a positive, neutral or negative mood-inducing film. In addition, half of the participants were given perceived control over the experience, while the remainder were given no such information. It was predicted that a positive mood-inducer would decrease perception of crowding and a negative mood-inducer would increase the perception of crowding for individuals in a high density setting. The results only partially support this prediction. Positive mood decreased perception of crowding, but only for individuals in mixed-sex groups. Mood variations had no other reliable effects on the perception of crowding. It was also predicted that individuals with perceived control would report feeling less crowded than individuals without control. This prediction was supported in only the most limited conditions. Individuals in all-women groups, sitting in middle seats, and with perceived control reported feeling less crowded than did comparable individuals without perceived control. It was also predicted that mood and perceived control would interact to affect the perception of crowding. The results failed to support this prediction. A variety of theoretical and methodological explanations for these results were examined. It was concluded that mood variations, heretofore ignored in the literature, can influence the perception of crowding, especially when stemming directly from the high density experience. Conclusions about the effect of perceived control on the perception of crowding (commonly accepted in the current literature) should be re-examined before general acceptance...|$|E
40|$|Web-specific {{usability}} {{deficiencies of}} websites have multiple implications: End users {{have been shown}} to suffer from disorientation and information <b>input</b> <b>overload</b> when interacting with large information systems, resulting in frustration, computer �rage�, and user abandonment. Such symptoms quickly turn into monetary losses for the sponsoring organization. Thus, an organization employing 1000 knowledge workers has been shown to lose up to US 2. 5 million per year, due to its employees� inability to retrieve information on its intranet websites (Feldman & Sherman, 2001). These deficiencies {{can be traced back to}} root causes which operate and thus have to be resolved at the level of the underlying website development and maintenance processes. Current Information Architecture (IA) processes, while in fact concerned to some extent with all of these root causes, currently fail to address them methodically. Thus, to improve both business and end user goal achievement in web-based information systems, the objective of this research was to develop a novel and unified IA Process Model describing the development of a website�s IA system (= the elements of an information system which together define the organization of and the access to its information). The results-driven approach for developing the process model involved a thorough initial analysis of IA system components, their dependencies, as well as their deficiencies for both end users and content providers. The impact of IA system deficiencies on end user goal achievement was determined through re-analysis of raw data from usability tests performed on intranet websites of the Siemens AG. For the first time, however, IA system deficiencies were also analyzed in terms of their effect on the performance of content providers (authors, editors, content managers) by conducting focused field interviews with 25 content providers. For the six components of the thereby developed IA System Model, more than 80 generic IA system deficiencies were identified that impede end users� or content providers� goal achievement. In addition, through focused interviews with domain experts and literature reviews, more than 50 internal (i. e., within IA system components) and 25 external (i. e., from IA-extrinsic entities) dependencies of IA system component were discovered. Combining this IA System Model with results from literature reviews on current IA processes, process deficiencies, and applied methods, the optimized IA Process Model was developed. It was evaluated by carrying out IA expert focus groups both in Germany and the US, and by executing a real-life IA project according to the model. Unlike any available website development process, this model for the first time: 1. Explicitly integrates standard IA processes with Database Design processes, thereby ensuring technical feasibility, minimizing design changes due to technical constraints, and allowing for deliberate trade-off decisions. 2. Actively involves content providers as a second major user group of an IA system (next to end users), which ensures feasibility and usability of the IA system for them, and thus high-quality content. As such, it integrates IA and Content Management processes. The IA Process Model comprises an accessible description of the overall process flow, detailed specifications of individual process steps, and additional practical tools, which ensure scalability of the model to given project conditions, effective use of individual methods, and efficient interdisciplinary collaboration in web teams. It has been successfully applied in a validation project covering the redesign of a Siemens internet website. Results of the project, as well as from the expert focus groups, confirmed the IA Process Model to deliver effective and efficient IA process instances in variable conditions. It has been shown to be capable of accounting for and resolving present deficiencies of web-based information systems and their root causes, and thus provides a unique and powerful instrument to handle future challenges posed on developing web-based information systems...|$|E

50|$|The prime {{purpose of}} foldback current {{limiting}} in linear power supplies {{is to keep}} the output transistor within its safe power dissipation limit.With a linear voltage regulator, the output voltage Vout and output current Iout are maintained by simply dissipating away the surplus of <b>input</b> voltage Vin:Under <b>overload</b> conditions the output voltage falls and so the difference Vin - Vout becomes larger, tending to increasing dissipation. For a simple current limit, safely handling the worst-case scenario (a short circuit) would therefore require a much larger heatsink and output transistor than would be required under normal operating conditions. Foldback partially solves this, helping to keep the normal-rated output transistor within its safe operating area under fault and overload conditions. Foldback also significantly reduces the power dissipation in the load in fault conditions, which can reduce the risks of fire and heat damage.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{discusses the}} theoretical investigation, simulation and hardware {{implementation of the}} ElectroMechanical Multi-stAge noise SHaping (EM-MASH) sigma delta modulator (??M). The potential advantages of an EM-??M MASH compared to single-loop high-order ??Ms applied to inertial MEMS sensors are its inherent stability and high <b>overload</b> <b>input</b> level due {{to the use of}} lower order ??Ms in its individual stages. Furthermore, MASH has the advantages of high dynamic range and high noise shaping performance because of its overall high-order ??M architecture. So far, the EM-MASH has not been sufficiently explored. This study is expected to serve as solid basis for the application of EM-MASH. In this research, various EM-MASH architectures (MASH 21, MASH 22, MASH 211, MASH 221 and MASH 222) were theoretically studied, and the results were validated with simulations. A fourth order EM-MASH 22 -??M was theoretically examined and successfully implemented with a capacitive MEMS accelerometer, which includes a second order EM-??M loop cascaded with a purely electronic second order ??M. The quantization noise from the first loop is digitised by the second loop and then cancelled by digital filters, whereas the quantization noise from the second loop is shaped by the second loop filter and a digital filter, which together provide fourth order noise shaping. The performance of EM-MASH 22 was compared with that of a single-loop fourth order EM-??M (SD 4). Both architectures were investigated by system level modelling and hardware implementation using surface-mount PCB technology. The results show that (a) both architectures achieve the same noise floor level of 19 ?g/?Hz; (b) MASH 22 is unconditionally stable, whereas SD 4 is only conditionally stable; and (c) MASH 22 achieves a higher <b>overload</b> <b>input</b> level and a higher dynamic range than does SD 4. Furthermore, the research presents a novel EM-MASH-??M that employs a dual quantization technique and adopts a 2 - 0 structure (EM-MASH 20). With a simpler and configurable composition, MASH 20 is aimed at exhibiting a performance higher than that achieved with the MASH 22 structure. The MASH 20 does not require a second-stage ??M, which reduces the complexity of the digital filters compared to those required for the MASH 22; thus, the digital filter matching is more easily achievable. The study shows that the MASH 20, like the MASH 22, has an inherent stability, high <b>overload</b> <b>input</b> level, and high dynamic range compared to single-loop ??M. However, the MASH 20, with its simpler implementation, achieved a higher dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio than the MASH 22 and the SD 4. A capacitive MEMS accelerometer was designed and employed with MASH 20. Within a bandwidth of 1 kHz, the sensor achieves a noise floor level of 15 ?g/?Hz, a full-scale acceleration of ± 20 g and a bias instability of 20 ?g for a period of three hours. The EM-MASH-??M is sensitive to the variation of the sensing element parameters and other analogue parameters, both of which are subject to manufacturing tolerance and imperfections. This causes a leakage of the quantization noise in the final output and degrades the modulator performance. The research explored a calibration method to solve this problem by utilizing the digital domain capabilities. The method is based on the optimization algorithm which was investigated using MATLAB. The research confirms the concept of the EM-MASH structure and proves that it is applicable as a closed-loop interface for high-performance capacitive MEMS inertial sensors...|$|R

Furthermore, it is assumed that the language processor is an automatic device that main-tains only the best of the set of all compatible representations for an input string.

40|$|Hearing-aid users often {{continue}} to have problems with poor speech understanding in difficult acoustical conditions. Another generally accounted problem is that certain sounds become too loud whereas other sounds are still not audible. Dynamic range compression is a signal processing technique {{that may be used}} in hearing aids to compensate for these remaining disabilities. Its main function is to provide sufficient amplification at low <b>input</b> levels without <b>overloading</b> the auditory system at high input levels. The time constants define the time needed by the compressor to realize a change in amplification. When using relatively large time constants, the compressor only reduces differences in overall level. This type of compression is known as Automatic Gain Control (AGC) or Automatic Volume Control (AVC). With short time constants the compressor also reduces the dynamic range of a fast-fluctuating signal like speech. This last type of system is therefore often called a syllabic or a phoneme compressor. The main goal of using phoneme compression is to optimize speech intelligibility by improving the detection of weak speech cues. We developed a phoneme compression system to improve the perception of high-frequency speech cues in hearing impaired listeners. The basic mechanism is a continuously changing balancing between low- and high-frequency amplification, steered by the input level of each speech part. As a consequence, the system should provide a relatively high amount of amplification to weak high-frequency speech cues. A specific configuration was developed to additionally reduce the negative effect of low-frequency amplification on the detection of high-frequency cues. This type of configuration is called anti-USOM processing as it is meant to compensate for “Upward-Spread-Of-Masking” (USOM) of high-frequency information by low-frequency signal parts. The main goal of the present thesis was to evaluate the effect of the different compression configurations on speech intelligibility in a group of hearing-impaired listeners with moderate-to-severe perceptive high-frequency losses (chapters 4 to 7). Additionally, we have investigated the effect of various types of compression on amplitude-modulated signals and speech(-like) signals (chapters 2 and 3). The acoustical measurements in chapters 2 and 3 provided a good insight in the effect of compression on modulating signals like speech. Speech can be considered as a stream of sounds with a continuously varying spectrum. These spectral differences lead to fluctuations of the envelope of the signal within individual frequency bands. The modulation depth is a measure for the amount of fluctuations. Phoneme compression will normally reduce the amount of fluctuations, resulting in a smaller modulation depth. By comparing the modulation depth in a signal before and after compression, the effective amount of compression can be obtained. This method was applied using an amplitude-modulated signal (chapter 2) and using speech(-like) signals (chapter 3). Another method compared the average level distributions of speech with and without compression (chapter 2). The results show that relatively short time constants were needed to affect the range of modulations that are relevant to speech intelligibility. Furthermore, an effective reduction of intensity differences within separate frequency channels was only possible if the compression was applied within independent frequency channels as well. Interestingly, the results were not only influenced by the compressor settings but also by the acoustical properties of the test signal. Intensity differences were reduced more effectively for speech in a stationary background noise compared to speech only. Chapters 4 and 6 describe the effects of different types of phoneme compression on speech intelligibility in hearing-impaired listeners. Phoneme scores were obtained in conditions with and without background noise. We evaluated the difference in performance between phoneme compression and a linear reference condition near comfortable presentation levels. This implies that the results could not be influenced by differences in overall level between the various conditions. The results described in chapter 4 show that hearing-impaired listeners may benefit from our type of phoneme compression in conditions without background noise. Consonant perception was improved by phoneme compression whereas the anti-USOM processing had an additional positive effect on vowel perception. Unfortunately, no such positive effects were found in conditions with background noise. Even substantially negative effects were found with the anti-USOM configuration that gave the best performance in quiet. The use of a more moderate type of anti-USOM in chapter 6 also resulted in a negative effect on phoneme recognition in background noise. No benefit was found for other types of phoneme compression in background noise. The use of a compression ratio of 4 resulted even in negative effects (chapter 4). This means that the performance in background noise gets poorer with an increasing amount of phoneme compression. The temporal behaviour of the background noise did not influence the results (chapter 6). We hoped to find positive effects from phoneme compression in a fluctuating background noise, but no such improvement was found. The results of chapter 5 can be used to understand the measured effects of compression on speech intelligibility. Two methods were used to analyse the perceptual confusions of chapter 4. INDSCAL was used to identify and visualise the most relevant differences in phoneme perception. However the interpretation of these differences was not always easy because the perceptual dimensions could be related to several perceptual features. Therefore, SINFA was used as a second method. The advantage of using this method was that the various effects could be separated for the different predefined articulatory features. In quiet, positive effects were found on the perception of features containing mainly high-frequency information. This is according to our original goal to improve the identification of high-frequency cues by phoneme compression. However, the perception of high-frequency cues appeared to be highly deteriorated at critical background noise conditions. As a consequence, the features containing low-frequency information had become of major importance. The use of anti-USOM processing removed low-frequency information that appeared to be relevant for the perception of low-frequency cues. Additionally, we evaluated three phoneme compression conditions in a small field study using an experimental body-worn hearing aid (chapter 7). The phoneme compression configurations were embedded in a slow-acting non-linear system to compensate for differences in overall level. The listeners used the system for a period of six weeks next to the own hearing aids. The performance with the various compression programs was measured every week. The main question was if the performance could be influenced by a frequent use of the system. In general, the results were similar to that in previous experiments. The performance in background noise tended to be poorer than the performance in quiet. Interestingly, the overall recognition score with phoneme compression improved over time. However, a large part of this improvement was also found for the reference condition. The tendency for a small additional improvement with phoneme compression may be attributed to acclimatization to the speech processing. The experiences of the hearing-impaired listeners with the phoneme compression programs differed between listeners and depended of the difference in performance with the own hearing aids. Generally they had no problems with the sound of the new programs. Hoortoesteldragers houden vaak problemen met het verstaan van spraak in lastige akoestische omstandigheden. Een ander bekend probleem is dat door de versterking van het hoortoestel bepaalde geluiden als te hard ervaren worden, terwijl andere belangrijke geluiden nog steeds niet worden gehoord. Ter compensatie van deze beperkingen kan dynamiekcompressie worden toegepast in het hoortoestel. Dit is een vorm van signaalbewerking die voor voldoende versterking zorgt bij lage niveaus, zonder het gehoor te overbelasten bij hoge signaalniveaus. Een compressiesysteem heeft tijd nodig om een verandering in versterking te realiseren. Deze is instelbaar via de zogenaamde tijdsconstanten. Bij hoge waarden van de tijdsconstanten reduceert de compressor alleen globale verschillen in signaalniveau. Deze vorm van compressie wordt Automatische Volume Controle (AVC) of Automatic Gain Control (AGC) genoemd. Indien de tijdsconstanten kort gehouden worden reduceert de compressor ook intensiteitsverschillen tussen opeenvolgende spraakklanken. Deze vorm van dynamiekcompressie wordt daarom vaak aangeduid met syllabische compressie of foneemcompressie. Het doel hiervan is het optimaliseren van spraakverstaan door een verbeterde detectie van zwakkere spraakklanken. In dit proefschrift wordt een vorm van foneemcompressie onderzocht die bedoeld is om de perceptie van hoogfrequente spraakklanken te verbeteren bij slechthorenden. Het systeem verandert continu de verhouding tussen laag- en hoogfrequente versterking, afhankelijk van de niveaus van de afzonderlijke spraakklanken. Dit leidt tot extra versterking van de zwakke klanken. Verder is een aparte configuratie ontwikkeld om de negatieve invloed van laagfrequente versterking te verminderen op de perceptie van hoogfrequente spraak (“anti-upward-spread-of-masking” of “anti-USOM” genoemd). Ons hoofddoel is om de effecten van deze vormen van foneemcompressie te evalueren op spraakverstaan bij slechthorenden (hoofdstukken 4 t/m 7). Tevens is onderzocht hoe het spraaksignaal beïnvloed wordt door verschillende vormen van compressie (hoofdstukken 2 en 3). De akoestische metingen in hoofdstukken 2 en 3|$|R
