Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks {{can be part of}} the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.|$|E
2500|$|Rav Huna and Rav Chisda {{reconciled}} {{the prohibition}} of kindling fire on the Sabbath in [...] with the priests' sacrificial duties. The Mishnah taught that the priests could lower the Passover sacrifice <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> just before nightfall (and leave it to roast on the Sabbath), and the priests could light the fire with chips in the pile in the Temple chamber of the hearth (just before nightfall). Interpreting this Mishnah, Rav Huna cited {{the prohibition of}} [...] "You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations." [...] Rav Huna argued that since [...] says only [...] "throughout your habitations," [...] the priests could kindle the pile in the Temple chamber of the hearth (even on the Sabbath). Rav Chisda demurred from Rav Huna's argument, as it would allow kindling even on the Sabbath. Rather, Rav Chisda taught that [...] permits only the burning of the limbs and the fat (of animals sacrificed on Friday before nightfall). Rav Chisda explained that this burning was allowed because the priests were very particular (in their observance of the Sabbath and would not stoke the fire after nightfall).|$|E
2500|$|According to legend, Hanina {{was very}} poor. Indeed, it became proverbial that, while {{the whole world}} was {{provided}} for through Hanina's great merits, he himself sustained life from one Sabbath eve to another on a basket of carob beans. For some time the outside world had been kept in ignorance of his privations; his wife did all that was possible to maintain an appearance of comfort, and though she had no flour with which to make dough, she would put fuel <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> every Friday and cause columns of smoke to rise, thus making her neighbors believe that, like them, she was baking the Sabbath meals. In time, however, one woman's suspicion was aroused, and she determined to surprise Hanina's wife and discover the truth. But, according to the legend, a miracle prevented exposure. When the woman appeared at Hanina's house and looked into the smoking oven it was full of loaves. In spite of the miracle, Hanina's wife induced him to collect from heaven an advance portion of his future lot. Hanina complied with her request, and, in answer to his prayer, a golden table-leg was miraculously sent him. Husband and wife were happy; but that night the wife had a vision of heaven in which she saw the saints feasting at three-legged tables while her husband's table had only two legs. She awoke full of regret at the importunity which had deprived his table of a leg, and insisted that he pray for the withdrawal of the treasure. This he did, and the golden leg disappeared. Of this supposed miracle the Talmud says: [...] "It was greater than the former, since heaven gives, but never takes" [...] (Ta'anit, 24b et seq.).|$|E

50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1943, the Yankee was {{captured}} along with his young sidekick Sparky.
