I wanted to make a movie {{for a new generation of}} audience that hadn't seen those movies in the cinema—hadn't seen them at all maybe—and to give them the same thrill that I got from watching them. But kind of contemporise it, pump up the action and the blood and guts." [...] Cinematic influences on Doomsday include: ...|$|E

After The Cotton Club, Lane {{dropped out of the}} movie business and lived with her mother in Georgia. According to the actress, [...] "I hadn't been close to my mom for a long time, so {{we had a lot of}} homework to do.

500|$|Hochuli {{was born}} on December 25, 1950, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and lived there until age eight before {{his family moved to}} Tucson, Arizona. He was the second child of six. He {{attended}} and later graduated from Canyon del Oro High School in the Tucson suburb of Oro Valley, Arizona in 1969. During his high school years, he participated in football (earning all-state honors twice), basketball, wrestling, and track. He attributes his competitive nature to having an older brother, Chip Hochuli. Ed Hochuli told Referee in a 2004 interview, [...] "I was somebody who wanted to be good and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>my</b> brother to be proud of me, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>my</b> parents to be proud of me." [...] Following high school, he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree with honors from UTEP in 1972. [...] While at UTEP, Hochuli played linebacker on the school's football team from 1969 to 1972. As a football player, he earned All-Western Athletic Conference academic honors in 1972. His father, Walter Hochuli, was involved with law as a wills and estate planner, which influenced Ed Hochuli to pursue a career in law. [...] He earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Arizona Law School in 1976. [...] While in law school, Hochuli served as a law clerk for two years under United States District Judge Carl Muecke. Upon completion of his education, Hochuli was admitted to the State Bar of Arizona.|$|E

Schwarzenegger, however, won the election with 48.58% of the votes and was unavailable to participate in Alien vs. Predator. Actress Sigourney Weaver, who starred as Ellen Ripley in the Alien series, said she was happy not to be in the film, as a possible crossover was [...] "the reason <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>my</b> character to die in the first place", and thought the concept [...] "sounded awful".|$|E
500|$|In October 1986, Slayer {{embarked}} on the Reign in Pain world tour, with Overkill in the US, and Malice in Europe. The band was added as the opening act on W.A.S.P.'s US tour, but just one month in, drummer Lombardo left the band: [...] "I wasn't making any money. I figured {{if we were}} gonna be doing this professionally, on a major label, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>my</b> rent and utilities paid." [...] To continue with the tour, Slayer enlisted Tony Scaglione of Whiplash. However, Lombardo was convinced by his wife to return in 1987. At the insistence of Rubin, Slayer recorded a cover version of Iron Butterfly's [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" [...] for the film Less Than Zero. Although the band was {{not happy with the}} final product, Hanneman deeming it [...] "a poor representation of Slayer" [...] and King labeling it [...] "a hunk of shit," [...] it was one of their first songs to garner radio airplay.|$|E

Luke and Kelly were initially commissioned {{to work on a}} new track for Spears, and entered the studio with no concept prepared, as Kelly explained, [...] "just knowing her style and knowing what she does." [...] After Luke came up with the music, they based the song on the public's perception of her life at the time. Spears explained that after listening to [...] "Circus" [...] for the first time, she felt inspired and imagined a story behind it. She also stated, [...] " [...] put the whole album together as far as what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>my</b> show to be like. You can play with a circus in so many different ways". [...] "Circus" [...] was recorded at Conway Recording Studios and Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, and at Glenwood Place Studio in Burbank, California.

2500|$|On the one hand, Christ is a {{historical}} figure, and I must narrate his life objectively; on the other hand, a Sanskrit Mahakavya must conform to certain norms laid down by Sanskrit rhetoricians.

Referring to Hanson's [...] "Talk", Coates wrote: [...] "Let us be direct—in any other context we would automatically recognize this [...] "talk" [...] as stupid advice. If I were {{to tell you that}} I only employ Asian-Americans to do my taxes because [...] "Asian-Americans do better on the Math SAT," [...] you would not simply question my sensitivity, but my mental faculties. That is because you would understand that in making an individual decision, employing an ancestral class of millions is not very intelligent. Moreover, were I to tell you <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>my</b> son to marry a Jewish woman because [...] "Jews are really successful," [...] you would understand that statement for the stupidity which it is...There is no difference between my argument above and the notion that black boys should be avoided because they are overrepresented in the violent crime stats. But one of the effects of racism is its tendency to justify stupidity." ...|$|E
