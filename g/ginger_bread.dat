2500|$|According to the French legend, {{gingerbread}} {{was brought}} to Europe in 992 by the Armenian monk, later saint, Gregory of Nicopolis (Gregory Makar).

An early medieval Christian legend elaborates on the Gospel of Matthew's account of the birth of Jesus.

As he was lingering in his last days in a city in Syria, the magus gave his chest of ginger roots to the Rabbi who had kindly cared for him in his illness. The Rabbi told him of the prophesies of the great King who was to come to the Jews, one of which was that He would be born in Bethlehem, which, in Hebrew, meant [...] "House of Bread". The Rabbi was accustomed to having his young students make houses of bread to eat over time to nourish the hope for their Messiah.

Gingerbread was also shaped into different forms by monks in Franconia, Germany in the 13th century. Lebkuchen bakers are recorded as early as 1296 in Ulm and 1395 in Nuremberg, Germany. Nuremberg was recognized as the [...] "Gingerbread Capital of the World" [...] when in the 1600s the guild started to employ master bakers and skilled workers to create complicated works of art from gingerbread. Medieval bakers used carved boards to create elaborate designs. During the 13th century, the custom spread across Europe. It was taken to Sweden in the 13th century by German immigrants; there are references from Vadstena Abbey of Swedish nuns baking gingerbread to ease indigestion in 1444. The traditional sweetener is honey, used by the guild in Nuremberg. Spices used are ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Ginger</b> <b>bread</b> like Nürnberger Lebkuchen {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous delicacies of Franconian cuisine. In the Middle Ages Nuremberg (German: Nürnberg) was a trading centre also for exotic spices and other specialities.

From the end of August until winter time the little biscuits are offered with [...] "Christkindlesmarkt-Glühwein" [...] (mulled wine made with blueberries). Nowadays there are only a few small manufacturers left with artisanal production and the majority of the Lebkuchen are made in industrial production.During Christmas and advent season there are also several bakeries and confectioner shops producing their own Lebkuchen and other Christmas biscuits. The most common and most famous variety is the [...] "Elisenlebkuchen" [...] which often has a rectangular shape (most varieties are traditionally round-shaped). Very important are also the quality levels which are determined in the [...] "Leitsätze für feine Backwaren" [...] (Principles for pastries and baked goods) and the sophisticated quality level for Lebkuchen requires it to be made with wafers.|$|E
50|$|Thailand's Sam Chuk Community and Old Market District {{along the}} Tha Cheen River {{not far from}} Bangkok, {{northwest}} of the Thai capital in Suphan Buri province—is a bit of Old China in once rural Siam. Witness to a disappeared way of life, the distinctive river and canal-side community was recently granted an Award of Merit in the 2009 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation. A century ago, Sam Chuk was a renowned centre for waterborne trade and commerce, when rivers and canals were Siam’s main mode of transport. But today, times have changed, and the old town’s way of living has changed accordingly. The negative impact on its survival was heightened when roads were cut through the old community, reducing the need for and importance of water transport, and cutting off easy access to places {{that had once been}} central. Passed by the new ways of life, SamChuk was deteriorating, falling into ruin. Old wooden houses and buildings were decaying as a result of termites and accumulated damage from rain and old age. Realising the changes taking place, local residents formed a SamChuk Market Conservation Committee. Rather than pulling down the old buildings, they organised to preserve what they received from their ancestors and restored 19 local buildings, adapting the old style architecture described in Thai as Khanompang Khing (<b>ginger</b> <b>bread)</b> style, into a contemporary market, welcoming to traditionalists and those with new style taste as well. Local homes have been converted into welcoming shops, cafes and museums, where visitors can get a glimpse - touch, taste and feel the past - a sense {{of what it was like}} a century ago when the market was really bustling. As a venue for its mouthwatering rare traditional dishes and old-style desserts, Samchuk Market has attracted visitors and habitués from all walks of life, particularly those Thais who are known for crossing cities or towns just in order to taste local delicacies.|$|E
5000|$|Early in {{his life}} {{he was known as}} a [...] "humble, patient, and soft-spoken boy." [...] When he was eight years old, he was {{enrolled}} in Sunday School in Holderness, and his parents were criticized for sending him to a newly founded school, as it was started by a cashier who found God later in life and was not considered [...] "God's child from birth." [...] He began to work at age nine at the school and spent his allowance on honey and <b>ginger</b> <b>bread,</b> considered luxuries at the time. His rebellious side was exposed on numerous occasions, most notably when a Free Will Baptist came to the family's house to recite lessons, Cheney jumped and stabbed the windowsill with his jack-knife scaring everyone in the room, which formed an ongoing reputation of the young boy. Soon after Sunday School, Cheney began to work at his father's paper mill, tending to the engines, and housekeeping, at night. The paper he would form would go on to print the very first copy of The Morning Star, the single most important newspaper of Free Will Baptists. At age thirteen, he attended the New Hampton Institute, which was five mile away, his mother's decision to send him so far way was partly based off Cheney's unhealthy interest with knives; he cut the end of his thumb while husking corn. Cheney's demanding personality was developed quickly as he taught at elementary schools during his time at New Hampton. A notable example of this was when a drunken father stumbled into the school yard accusing a young Cheney of disciplining his child in unfair ways, Cheney drew his measuring stick and quieted the man. While at the New Hampton Institute, he was exposed to Free Will Baptism at personal level through his studies, and peers, and soon after returned to his father's mill. After the mill was sustainable through the hiring of other local school boys, Cheney was sent to Parsonsfield Seminary, which was 14 miles away; a three-day trip.|$|E

40|$|Lean {{manufacturing}} {{has been}} acknowledged as a methodology to eliminate waste, while six sigma has {{been regarded as}} a diagnostic tool to improve processes by eliminating variation. The important objective of both of the methodologies is to identify the most critical processes to generate savings for an organization. Lean sigma integrates these two methodologies into an effective hybrid method which combines the variability elimination tools from six sigma with the waste elimination methodology from lean manufacturing. Previous studies debate over the consistent result of the lean sigma methodology in the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) considering their implementation barriers (size, resource, skill, time). Moreover, the unique characteristics of food sector such as variability in raw material, seasonality, low self-life {{and complexity of the}} supply chain make it even more difficult to implement lean sigma methodology in the SMEs operating in the food sector. In this context, this paper aims to study the application of lean sigma methodology in a medium sized confectionary (<b>ginger</b> <b>bread)</b> producing company in Belgium. The results shows that the company successfully applied lean sigma methodology and saved a huge sum of money by reducing overfilling/overweight of final product (<b>ginger</b> <b>bread).</b> However, there are number of barriers identified during the implementation process that mainly derived from the unique characteristics of the food sector on one hand, and of SMEs on the other. This study proposes a lean sigma framework to reduce the overfill and rework. The proposed framework integrates lean tools and six sigma DMAIC methodology to reduce overfill and rework to enhance the bottom-line results. The result of this study will help food SMEs to apply lean sigma methodology to reduce variability and consequent waste in their production process. Moreover, the results on barriers of lean sigma implementation in food SMEs will paves the way for further research...|$|E
