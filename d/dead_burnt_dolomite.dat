40|$|A {{possible}} {{new process}} for the partial desalination of seawater is to use bentonite clay or attapulgite as an adsorbent. The ion exchange property of these clays, which {{is a result of}} the characteristic t-o-t layer structure, enables the use of these materials as adsorbents. This technique has the opportunity to be used as a pre-treatment as current commercial seawater desalination processes are very expensive. The clay was characterized using XRD, XRF and SEM analyses. To ensure maximum adsorption of all possible elements onto the clay, <b>burnt</b> <b>dolomite</b> (CaO. MgO) was added to the solution to raise the pH. It was found that adsorption of Ca, Mg, K and Na onto bentonite clay and attapulgite follow pseudo-second order kinetics and the Langmuir isotherm model. With the increase in the pH higher adsorption capacities were obtained. FTIR analyses show that the OH - functional group is responsible for the metal adsorption[URL]...|$|R
50|$|Calcining at {{different}} temperatures produces magnesium oxide of different reactivity. High temperatures 1500 - 2000 °C diminish the available surface area and produces dead-burned (often called <b>dead</b> <b>burnt)</b> magnesia, an unreactive form {{used as a}} refractory. Calcining temperatures 1000 - 1500 °C produce hard-burned magnesia, which has limited reactivity and calcining at lower temperature, (700-1000 °C) produces light-burned magnesia, a reactive form, also known as caustic calcined magnesia. Although some decomposition of the carbonate to oxide occurs at temperatures below 700 °C, the resulting materials appears to reabsorpb carbon dioxide from the air.|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} phosphates in freshwater {{has significant}} importance to regulate eutrophication. Phosphate excess leads to highly undesirable changes in ecosystems st ructure. The increasing of water body trophicity {{can result in}} water quality deterioration. This paper presents the testing results of reactive materials used for phosphorus removal from wastewater at sewage treatment plant. Twelve materi als of different origin available in Belarus were tested as potential reactive material s for phosphates removal. They are natural materials, industrial by-products and manufactured sorbents. Based on chemical composition the available and inexpensive materials rich in Al, Fe, Mg and Ca were selected. Relationship between purification degree of phosphates and specific material consumption (mg/mg PO[4]{ 3 –}) was investigated to choose potential reactive materials for phosphorus. Four materials (wa-ter conditioning sludge (WCS), dead-catalyst of petroleum hydrocarbon cracking (DCC), electric arc furnace slug (EAF-slug), <b>dolomite</b> <b>burnt</b> at 700 °C) have been chosen for detailed sorption tests. WCS, DCC, EAF-slug and <b>burnt</b> <b>dolomite</b> have the apparent sorption capacities of: 13. 6; 21. 2; 35. 3; 70. 8 mg PO[4]{ 3 -}/g respectively.

50|$|Similar to the {{production}} of lime, magnesite can be burned in the presence of charcoal to produce MgO, which, {{in the form of a}} mineral, is known as periclase. Large quantities of magnesite are burnt to make magnesium oxide: an important refractory material used as a lining in blast furnaces, kilns and incinerators. Calcination temperatures determine the reactivity of resulting oxide products and the classifications of light <b>burnt</b> and <b>dead</b> <b>burnt</b> refer to the surface area and resulting reactivity of the product, typically as determined by an industry metric of the iodine number. 'Light burnt' product generally refers to calcination commencing at 450 °C and proceeding to an upper limit of 900 °C - which results in good surface area and reactivity. Above 900 °C, the material loses its reactive crystalline structure and reverts to the chemically inert 'dead-burnt' product- which is preferred for use in refractory materials such as furnace linings.|$|R

40|$|Synopsis: It is broadly {{recognized}} that the adsorption of superplasticizers on cement particles is {{a key factor in}} determining the rheology of concrete. In order to avoid the problems linked to the hydration of cement, the adsorption of superplasticizers is often studied on unreactive model powders. However, in order for the model system to remain {{as close as possible to}} cement, the surface should have a similar charge and a similar chemical nature. Furthermore, the pH of the solution should be close to that of the hydrating cement (about 12. 5). Under these conditions, cement has been shown to have a positively charged surface. The model powders used in this study were Mg(OH) 2 and <b>dead</b> <b>burnt</b> MgO, which have nominal isoelectric points of 12. 0 and 12. 4 respectively, and which are chemically similar to Ca(OH) 2 and CaO. The surface charge of such model suspensions was studied as a function of added superplasticizer. These were either commercially available or currently under development, ranging from strongly to very weakly ionic. Adsorption isotherms for two polymeric superplasticizers, with similar structures but with different ionic group spacing, have been measured for both MgO and Mg(OH) 2 at pH 12 and 11. 3 respectively and between 10 and 40 °C. Results showed a strong temperature dependence for the adsorption of the less ionic polymer on MgO...|$|R

50|$|The T-O {{clay mineral}} {{kaolinite}} {{does not contain}} interlayer cations or interlayer water. The temperature of dehydroxylation depends on the structural layer stacking order. Disordered kaolinite dehydroxylates between 530 and 570 °C, ordered kaolinite between 570 and 630 °C. Dehydroxylated disordered kaolinite shows higher pozzolanic activity than ordered. The dehydroxylation of kaolin to metakaolin is an endothermic process due to {{the large amount of}} energy required to remove the chemically bonded hydroxyl ions. Above the temperature range of dehydroxylation, kaolinite transforms into metakaolin, a complex amorphous structure which retains some long-range order due to layer stacking. Much of the aluminum of the octahedral layer becomes tetrahedrally and pentahedrally coordinated.In order to produce a pozzolan (supplementary cementitious material) nearly complete dehydroxylation must be reached without overheating, i.e., thoroughly roasted but not burnt. This produces an amorphous, highly pozzolanic state, whereas overheating can cause sintering, to form a <b>dead</b> <b>burnt,</b> nonreactive refractory, containing mullite and a defect Al-Si spinel. Reported optimum activation temperatures vary between 550 and 850 °C for varying durations, however the range 650-750 °C is most commonly quoted. In comparison with other clay minerals kaolinite shows a broad temperature interval between dehydroxylation and recrystallization, much favoring the formation of metakaolin and the use of thermally activated kaolin clays as pozzolans. Also, because the octahedral layer is directly exposed to the interlayer (in comparison to for instance T-O-T clay minerals such as smectites), structural disorder is attained more easily upon heating.|$|R
