40|$|Background: Body weight, {{body mass}} index, {{fibrinogen}} concentration and relative plasma viscosity {{can contribute to}} the development of hypertension in <b>diabetics.</b> This study compares body weight, body mass index, fibrinogen concentration and relative plasma viscosity between hypertensive <b>diabetics,</b> normotensive <b>diabetics</b> and healthy controls. Methods: The present study was carried out on normotensive and hypertensive <b>diabetics</b> taken from medical OPD of Saidu group of teaching hospitals, Swat. A group of healthy male subjects between 30 - 60 years of age from the staff members of Saidu Medical College, Swat was also included. Each group comprised of 35 subjects. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body weight, height, body mass index, fibrinogen concentration and relative plasma viscosity were measured and compared. Results: Body weight, body mass index, fibrinogen concentration and relative plasma viscosity were all significantly more in hypertensive <b>diabetics</b> than normotensive <b>diabetics</b> and healthy control subjects.

40|$|The relaive {{risk for}} Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) death in type 2 <b>diabetics</b> was 1. 9 - 3. 3 times higher, when {{compared}} to non-diabetics.

Previous studies reported that the accumulation of dental plaque and dental calculus, and the severity of periodontal disease in type 2 <b>diabetics</b> were widely varied. A cross-sectional study on periodontal and CHD status of 36 non smoker type 2 <b>diabetics</b> was performed. The periodontal status was determined using Plaque Index of Sillness and Löe, Calculus Index of lingual anterior teeth, Papillary bleeding Index of Muleman, Periodontal Index of Russell, and dental panoramic rontgenogram.

Statistical analysis was using Fisher's exact test with the significant level of p 2) was not found in positive CHD <b>diabetics,</b> but found in 925 (36 %) of negative CHD diabetics; a slight to moderate dental plaque accumulation was found in 11 / 11 (100 %) of positive CHD <b>diabetics,</b> and 16 / 25 (64 %) of negative CHD <b>diabetics</b> (p=. 03). A heavy lingual calculus accumulaiton (score> 2) was found in 11 / 11 (100 %) of positive CHD <b>diabetics</b> and 10 / 25 (40 %) of negative CHD <b>diabetics</b> (p= 0. 006). A severe generalized gingival bleeding (score> 2) was not found in positive CHD <b>diabetics,</b> but found in 8 / 25 (32 %) of negative CHD diabetics; a mild to moderate gingival bleeding was found in 11 / 11 (100 %) of positive CHD <b>diabetics</b> and 17 / 25 (68 %) of negative CHD <b>diabetics</b> (p= 0. 7). A severe generalized periodontal disease (score> 5) was not found in positive CHD <b>diabetics,</b> but found in 9 / 25 (36 %) of positive CHD diabetics; a mild to moderate periodontal disease (score< 5) was found in 11 / 11 (100 %) of positive CHD <b>diabetics</b> and 16 / 25 (64 %) of negative CHD <b>diabetics</b> (p=. 03). In conclusion, our data suggest that in type 2 <b>diabetics,</b> the presence of CHD is significantly correlated with the presence of a slight to moderate dental plaque accumulation, a heavy lingual calculus accumulation of anterior teeth, and a mild to moderate periodontal disease status.

40|$|SUMMARY Erythrocyte {{deformability}} was {{studied in}} a total of 83 poorly controlled <b>diabetics</b> (mean blood glucose 12 - 2 mmol/l) who were divided into three groups, each with matched healthy controls. There was no appreciable difference between <b>diabetics</b> and matched controls regarding the filtration of erythrocytes through 3 gum diameter straight channel pores (25 <b>diabetics)</b> or tortuous channel pores (28 <b>diabetics),</b> or for the measurement of erythrocyte elongation over a range of osmolalities in the Ektacytometer (30 <b>diabetics).</b> When erythrocytes from 17 additional <b>diabetics</b> and 17 healthy controls were incubated for two hours at 37 °C in hyperglycaemic (50 mmol glucose/l) buffer, how-ever, there was a considerable reduction in erythrocyte filterability for both <b>diabetics</b> and controls in parallel with an increase in erythrocyte sorbitol concentration. This loss of filterability was prevented by the addition of an aldose reductase inhibitor (Sorbinil). High glucose concentrations (- 50 mmol/l) impair the filterability of erythrocytes through 3 gm pores, and the intracellular accumulation of sorbitol in poorly controlled outpatients is therefore unlikely to have a major adverse effect on erythrocyte rheology in diabetes mellitus.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{determine}} the mechanism of decreased glucose tolerance in lean type 2 <b>diabetics,</b> glucose turnover in such subjects and controls was studied under basal conditions and during hyperglycemia induced by intravenous administration of glucose. The <b>diabetics</b> had decreased intravenous glucose tolerance and a fasting plasma glucose of 6 - 8 mM (108 - 144 mg/dl). Glucose was infused for 2 hr at 2 mg/kg per min in the controls (n = 16) and <b>diabetics</b> (n = 9). Furthermore, 11 healthy subjects were infused also with glucose at 4 mg/kg per min to match the glycemia of the <b>diabetics.</b> Glucose production, utilization, and metabolic clearance were assessed by the primed constant tracer infusion technique. In the basal state, <b>diabetics</b> showed normal plasma insulin, C peptide, and glucagon concentrations. Their increased basal plasma glucose levels were associated with normal rates of glucose production and utilization, but the metabolic glucose clearance was 21 % lower than in the controls (P < 0. 001), indicating decreased sensitivity to insulin. During infusion of glucose at 2 mg/kg per min, the hyperglycemia attained in the <b>diabetics</b> (170 mg/dl) was higher than that in controls (115 mg/dl) but {{comparable to that of}} the controls exposed to the higher glucose load. With the lower glucose load, metabolic clearance rate decreased more markedly in <b>diabetics,</b> again suggesting insulin resistance. This was further substantiated by the fact that, at the same insulin levels, glucose utilization did not increase more in the <b>diabetics</b> than in the controls, although the glycemia reached was considerably higher in the <b>diabetics.</b> With the lower glucose load, glucose production was suppressed to the same degree in the controls and <b>diabetics,</b> although the attained glycemia was much more marked in the latter. Because both insulin and hyperglycemia can suppress glucose production, some defect in the regulation of glucose production of the <b>diabetics</b> is also indicated. The insulin and C peptide levels were much higher in the controls than in the <b>diabetics</b> at the same levels of glycemia, demonstrating the inadequacy of insulin response to glycemia of the <b>diabetics.</b> Glucagon concentration was equally suppressed in all groups. In conclusion, impaired glucose tolerance of mild type 2 <b>diabetics</b> resulted both from inadequate insulin response and from decreased sensitivity to insulin. The insulin resistance could mainly be ascribed to inadequate glucose uptake, but a defect in glucose-induced suppression of glucose production may also have contributed...|$|R
