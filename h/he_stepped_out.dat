5|$|Barnes lingered for {{a further}} ten minutes on 96 before {{reaching}} his century with a straight drive from Laker. He had taken 255 minutes and hit ten fours in reaching triple figures. Having registered his century and fulfilled his bet, Barnes became particularly aggressive. <b>He</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> of his ground to attack Laker, but missed, as did Evans, who was unable to stop the ball as it spun down the leg side. Barnes dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, including two consecutive shots over the long on boundary and two fours. Barnes was finally removed for 141, caught on the boundary by Cyril Washbrook from the bowling of Yardley. He struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings and the speed of his batting had allowed Australia to reach 2/296 in 277 minutes after a 174-run partnership with Bradman. Hassett was bowled first ball, so Miller came to the crease at 3/296 to face the hat-trick ball. He survived a loud lbw appeal to deny Yardley his hat-trick; Australia consolidated and eventually declared at 7/460 on the fourth day.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing to}} the New England Patriots in the American Football Conference Championship Game and losing Marcus Washington who joined the Washington Redskins, the Colts shuffled their linebacker lineup and June was listed as a starter when the Colts arrived at mini-camp. At the 2004 Colts {{training}} camp, June competed with Keyon Whiteside for the starting weakside linebacker position. By the end of training camp, June was the starter, and 2004 rookie Gilbert Gardner was the backup. June made his debut as a starter in the opening game against the 2004 Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. That season, the Colts used a 4-3 defense with a fourth linebacker on passing downs. In week 5, June had a team-high ten tackles and his first interception in a 3514 victory over the Oakland Raiders. In week 15, June returned an interception 71yards to the four-yard-line where <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> of bounds with 59seconds remaining in the game at the RCA Dome, the Colts' home stadium. This prompted the fans to chant for Peyton Manning to enter the game to attempt to tie Dan Marino's single-season touchdown pass record. Since the Colts led the game 2010 and had clinched the AFC South division, Manning took a knee instead. Coach Dungy's scheme is designed so that the weakside linebacker is supposed {{to make the most}} tackles, and June was the Colts' leading tackler by a wide margin that season. June started every game that season.|$|E

25|$|Netherlands {{made more}} {{runs on the}} second day, with van Troost and Edgar Schiferli sharing an Intercontinental Cup record ninth-wicket {{partnership}} worth 95. During the partnership, the Dutch also surpassed the previous highest Intercontinental Cup total, of 444 for 4 between Ireland and UAE. They were eventually bowled out for 474, Schiferli hitting to Collins Obuya for 69, and Kenya {{got a chance to}} bat shortly before tea. They faced 52 second-day overs, with five batsmen making it into double figures, but only captain Steve Tikolo could convert it into a score past 25, as the Dutch snared five wickets. Darron Reekers got the best bowling figures, with two for 28. Reekers failed to take any wickets on the third day, however, when Kenya fought back – they scored 197 runs on that day, for the loss of four wickets (compared to 135 for 5 on the first), with Peter Ongondo lasting {{two and a half hours}} in a 123-run eighth-wicket stand with Tikolo. Netherlands then got two wickets in successive overs, and Kenya were 315 for 9, nine short of the follow on with the injured Modi still in the pavilion. <b>He</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> with one arm in a strap, batting one-handed to see out the day as Kenya totalled 332 for 9.|$|E

500|$|Presley {{made his}} {{third and final}} Ed Sullivan Show {{appearance}} on January 6, 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity. In any event, as critic Greil Marcus describes, Presley [...] "did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn {{on the first two}} shows, <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out." [...] To close, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, [...] "Peace in the Valley". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley [...] "a real decent, fine boy".|$|E
500|$|There were {{difficulties}} {{getting this}} episode {{up to the}} minimum length of an episode and many scenes were added in post-production. The episode starts with a repeat of a couch gag that was first used in the episode [...] "Lisa's First Word", which is considerably longer than the typical couch gag. The crew added an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon and a few misleads as to {{who was trying to}} kill Bart. Even with all of these additions, the episode still ran short of time. This {{led to the creation of}} the rake sequence, which became a memorable moment of the episode, and the entire series. Originally, Sideshow Bob was only supposed to step on one rake after <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> from the underside of the Simpson family's car, but this was changed to nine rakes in a row. According to executive producer Al Jean, the idea was to make the scene funny, then drag the joke out so that it is no longer funny, and then drag it out even longer to make it funny again.|$|E

500|$|Physicist Isidor Rabi noticed Oppenheimer's disconcerting triumphalism: [...] "I'll {{never forget}} his walk; I'll {{never forget the}} way <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> of the car... his walk was like High Noon... this kind of strut. He had done it." [...] At an {{assembly}} at Los Alamos on August 6 (the evening of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima), Oppenheimer took to the stage and clasped his hands together [...] "like a prize-winning boxer" [...] while the crowd cheered. He noted his regret the weapon had not been available in time to use against Nazi Germany. However, he {{and many of the}} project staff were very upset about the bombing of Nagasaki, as they did not feel the second bomb was necessary from a military point of view. He traveled to Washington on August 17 to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned. In October 1945 Oppenheimer was granted an interview with President Harry S Truman. The meeting, however, went badly, after Oppenheimer remarked he felt he had [...] "blood on my hands". The remark infuriated Truman {{and put an end to}} the meeting. Truman later told his Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson [...] "I don't want to see that son-of-a-bitch in this office ever again." ...|$|E

He became entranced with Minnelli and the couple became engaged three days later, despite Minnelli's current betrothal to Desi Arnaz, Jr., and Sellers still being married. Their relationship lasted a month before breaking up. By 1974, Sellers's friends were concerned {{that he was having}} a nervous breakdown. Directors John and Roy Boulting considered that Sellers was [...] "a deeply troubled man, distrustful, self-absorbed, ultimately self-destructive. He was the complete contradiction." [...] Sellers was shy and insecure when out of character. When he was invited to appear on Michael Parkinson's eponymous chat show in 1974, he withdrew the day before, explaining to Parkinson that [...] "I just can't walk on as myself". When he was told he could come on as someone else, he appeared dressed {{as a member of the}} Gestapo. After a few lines in keeping with his assumed character, <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> of the role and settled down and, according to Parkinson himself, [...] "was brilliant, giving the audience an astonishing display of his virtuosity". In 1974, Sellers again claimed to have communicated with the long-dead music hall comic Dan Leno, who advised him to return to the role of Clouseau.|$|E
