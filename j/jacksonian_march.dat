40|$|A 57 -year-old man, {{operated}} {{eight years}} before for a left frontal falx meningioma, presented with short lasting, stereotyped episodes of paresthesias ascending from the right foot to the hand. A diagnosis of somatosensory seizures with <b>jacksonian</b> <b>march</b> was made. The patient was given antiepilectics but 5 days later, {{a few hours after}} another paresthesic episodes, he developed right hemiplegia, hemianesthesia and dysartria due to an infarct of left capsular posterior limb. We deem that in this patient the paresthesic episodes were more likely an expression of a capsular warning syndrome than of parietal epilepsy because of the frontal localization of the surgical lesion, the absence of motor components in all episodes, the negativity of repeated EEG, and the lack of recurrences after stroke. In capsular warning syndrome sensory symptoms mimicking a <b>jacksonian</b> <b>march</b> can be due to ischemic depolarization progressively recruiting the somatotopically arranged sensory fibers in the posterior capsular limb...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT – Epilepsia partialis {{continua}} (EPC) {{is a rare}} form of focal status epilepticus. It {{may have}} vascular, immune-mediated, neoplastic or metabolic-toxic causes. The origin of EPC has been linked with the motor cortex. This has been solidly supported by sophisticated electrophysiological studies. Here, a series of video sequences from patients with EPC (due to Rasmussen encepha-litis, early-stage multiple sclerosis, and steroid responsive encephalopathy with autoimmune thyroiditis), and other cases with repetitive myoclonic jerks or movement disorders (myoclonic epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibers, <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>march,</b> myoclonic seizures in other types of frontal lobe or idio-pathic generalized epilepsies, and different types of tremor) is presented.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a child with}} progressive neurologic deterioration and epilepsia partialis continua of the right extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested cortical dysplasia of the left frontal region including the central sensorimotor cor-tex. Subdural grid recordings showed widespread ictal activity and frequent interictal discharges from the motor cortex. A tailored resection was performed, and histologic analysis confirmed cortical dysplasia. This case demonstrates that cortical dysplasia may be the underlying cause in some cases of childhood epilepsia partialis continua of the progressive type. (J Child Neurol 1993; 8 : 386 - 388). Epilepsia partialis continua is characterized bycontinuous rhythmic or irregular jerking mo-tor activity {{of a group of}} muscles. The hand and foot are more often affected than other areas, and occa-sionally extension into a <b>jacksonian</b> <b>march</b> may oc-cur. ~ 1 The etiology of epilepsia partialis continua in children is diverse. Tumors, vascular lesions, trauma and postencephalitis have been documented. 2,...|$|E
40|$|TO DELINEATE RUB EPILEPSY—a type of reflex {{epilepsy}} {{induced by}} prolonged or repetitive cutaneous stimulation in a circumscribed {{area of the}} body—three cases are presented, {{as well as one}} of tooth brushing epilepsy for comparison. In all three cases of rub epilepsy, cutaneous stimuli in a particular body area on the left side initially induced a sensory <b>jacksonian</b> <b>march</b> in the middle of, or in close vicinity to, the trigger zone, which led to subsequent unilateral tonic contractions with intact consciousness. By contrast, a motor jacksonian seizure without sensory aura was induced in the patient with tooth brushing epilepsy. A review of cases with rub epilepsy, including those in this paper, disclosed a striking consistency in clinical manifestations. The symptomatology of the induced seizures indicates a propagation of epileptic discharges from the postcentral gyrus to the supplementary motor area. Rub epilepsy is proposed as a separate clinical entity, clearly demarcated from other somatosensory evoked reflex epilepsies such as startle and tooth brushing epilepsy. ...|$|E
40|$|Limb shaking {{presenting}} as rhythmic involuntary hyperkinetic movements {{may represent}} as severe bilateral occlusive carotid disease. This unusual form of transient ischemic attack is often misdiagnosed as focal motor seizures. However, careful assessment reveals {{a lack of}} usual seizure characteristics such as a <b>jacksonian</b> <b>march</b> or facial involvement. The movements also appear to be precipitated by activities that lower blood pressure. We present two cases of patients with severe bilateral carotid stenosis leading to limb-shaking transient ischemic attacks. There was complete stenosis in the internal carotid artery (ICA) contralateral to the jerking limb, combined with significant stenosis in the ipsilateral ICA. Cerebral perfusion on the occluded ICA side was maintained through collateral circulation from the opposite ICA and posterior circulation. When blood pressure was lowered orthostatically or by medication, the resulting cerebral hypoperfusion manifested as limb jerking. Recognition of limb shaking as a rare form of transient ischemic attack and differentiating it from focal motor epilepsy can facilitate early identification of critical carotid stenosis, allowing for appropriate interventions and thus {{reducing the risk of}} a disabling stroke. We recommend that clinicians should consider carotid disease in elderly patients presenting with orthostatic or episodic movement disorders...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Limb shaking Transient Ischemic Attack {{is a rare}} {{manifestation of}} carotid-occlusive disease. The {{symptoms}} usually point towards a seizure like activity and misdiagnosed as focal seizures. On careful history the rhythmic seizure like activity reveals no <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>march</b> mainly precipitated by maneuvers which lead to carotid compression. We here present a case of an elderly gentleman who was initially worked up as suffering from epileptic discharge {{and then later on}} found to have carotid occlusion. Case presentation Elderly gentleman presented with symptoms of rhythmic jerky movements of the left arm and both the lower limbs. Clinical suspicion of focal epilepsy was made and EEG, MRI-Brain with MRA were done. EEG and MRI-Brain revealed normal findings but the MRA revealed complete occlusion of right internal carotid artery. On a follow-up visit jerky movements of the left arm were precipitated by hyperextension and a tremor of 3 – 4 Hz was revealed. Based on this the diagnosis of low flow TIA was made the patient was treated conservatively with adjustment of his anti-hypertensive and anti-platelet medications. Conclusion Diagnosis of limb-shaking TIA is important and should be differentiated from other disorders presenting as tremors. Timely diagnosis is important as these patients are shown to benefit from reperfusion procedures either surgical or radiological reducing their risk of stroke. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background Cortical {{myoclonus}} with ataxia {{has only}} rarely {{been reported in}} association with Coeliac Disease (CD). Such reports also suggested that it is unresponsive to gluten-free diet. We present detailed electro-clinical characteristics of a new syndrome of progressive cortical hyperexcitability with ataxia and refractory CD. Methods At our gluten/neurology clinic we have assessed and regularly follow up over 600 patients with neurological manifestations due to gluten sensitivity. We have identified 9 patients with this syndrome. Results All 9 patients (6 male, 3 female) experienced asymmetrical irregular myoclonus involving one or more limbs and sometimes face. This was often stimulus sensitive and became more widespread over time. Three patients {{had a history of}} <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>march</b> and five had at least one secondarily generalised seizure. Electrophysiology showed evidence of cortical myoclonus. Three had a phenotype of epilepsia partialis continua at onset. There was clinical, imaging and/or pathological evidence of cerebellar involvement in all cases. Eight patients adhered to a strict gluten-free diet with elimination of gluten-related antibodies. However, there was still evidence of enteropathy in all, suggestive of refractory celiac disease. Two died from enteropathy-associated lymphoma and one from status epilepticus. Five patients were treated with mycophenolate and one in addition with rituximab and IV immunoglobulins. Their ataxia and enteropathy improved but myoclonus remained the most disabling feature of their illness. Conclusions This syndrome may well be the commonest neurological manifestation of refractory CD. The clinical involvement, apart from ataxia, covers the whole clinical spectrum of cortical myoclonus...|$|E
