40|$|Many California rice growers are {{now using}} foliar-active {{herbicides}} that require fields to be drained before application. Current regulations limit aerial herbicides {{and they must be}} applied by ground, requiring a soil surface dry enough to support application equipment. Our research showed that draining rice fields for a prolonged period early in the season led to a buildup of nitrate in the soil. About 60 % of this nitrogen was lost when the field was reflooded, reducing nitrogen-use efficiency and uptake, and lowering grain yields. Nitrate-nitrogen accumulated {{at a rate of about}} 1. 8 pounds per acre daily, and accumulation began about 4 days after the field was drained. During a typical drain of 10 to 14 days, about 20 pounds of nitrate-nitrogen per acre can be lost. Field experiments showed that incorporating fertilizer nitrogen into the subsurface soil increases nitrogen-use efficiency. Based on this research, we recommend that growers incorporate as much of their preplant nitrogen as possible below the soil surface and limit the <b>drain</b> <b>period</b> as much as possible...|$|E
40|$|Each {{moving part}} and {{cylinder}} {{walls in the}} internal combustion engine require clean oil for proper lubrication and lasting life. Engine oil is intended not only to lubricate the rotating parts, but also to cool, clean, and seal the critical engine components. It also aids in suspending wear metals and hard particles such as soot that is produced in the combustion process. However, with engine operation, engine oil degrades. Carmakers usually recommend that car owners change oil on the basis of driving hours or driving distance. Engine oil filters may assist to delay the time of oil replacement. If used properly, a lube oil and filter combination can reduce wear and prolong the life of an engine and its components. Especially for this research buses used in regular long-distance routes were equipped with additional bypass oil filters. The oil <b>drain</b> <b>period</b> was extended to see the influence of additional oil filter on the engine oil and engine wear. Oil samples were taken periodically and sent to the laboratory. According to the results of chemical analysis of oil samples conclusions were made. An additional filter helps remove very small particles suspended in the engine oil, that is why the wear processes are reduced. An additional filter helps delay degrading of engine oil, so the oil change interval can be prolonged...|$|E

The work of {{analysis was performed}} merely on automatic transmission fluid (ATF) Perodua original equipment manufacturer (OEM) (ATF- 3) series. The ATF was analyzed through continuous dynamometer basis at operating speed of 3000 rpm and actual travelled distance mission profile categories. The operating mileage tested during continuous dynamometer basis ranges from 0 km up to 10, 000 km maximum operating distance. The traces of wear elements were quantitatively analyzed at each operating mileage of 1, 500 km, 3, 000 km, 4, 500 km, 7, 000 km and 10, 000 km, respectively. The mileage selected and observed for second mission profile category was divided into three main categories. Category sample number A 1 -B 3 referred to the actual travelling distance between 800 km up to less than 20, 000 km. Category C 1 -D 2 and E 1 -F 5 each represents the operating travelling distance of 20, 000 km up to less than 40, 000 km and 40, 000 km up to less than 60, 000 km, respectively. Spectrometric analysis is primarily commenced based on serious limitations of the wear particle size that usually expressed as wear concentration in parts-per-million (ppm) unit. The typical concentration range for every element is between 1 - 100 ppm and the severity level of concentration for every element varies from one another. The element of Aluminum (Al), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), (Ferum) Fe, Lead (Pb), Nickel (Ni), Tin (Sn), Titanium (Ti), Vanadium (V), Manganese (Mn), Argentum (Ag) and Cadmium (Cd) are principally categorized as the wear elements.

This article {{describes}} the motivation, design and implementation of Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart (BLCR), a system-level checkpoint/restart implementation for Linux clusters that targets the space of typical High Performance Computing applications, including MPI. Application-level solutions, including both checkpointing and fault-tolerant algorithms, are recognized as more time and space efficient than system-level checkpoints, which cannot make use of any application-specific knowledge. However, system-level checkpointing allows for preemption, making it suitable for responding to “fault precursors ” (for instance, elevated error rates from ECC memory or network CRCs, or elevated temperature from sensors). Preemption can also increase the efficiency of batch scheduling; for instance reducing idle cycles (by allowing for shutdown without any queue <b>draining</b> <b>period</b> or reallocation of resources to eliminate idle nodes when better fitting jobs are queued), and reducing the average queued time (by limiting large jobs to running during off-peak hours, without the need to limit the length of such jobs).

Appearance of red rice (Oryza Sativa) as the main weed problem in rice production has forced producers and researchers to develop new irrigation techniques to control the weed. The Pin-Point irrigation method is one of these techniques, but little is know about the water balance and water use efficiency of the Pin-Point method in comparison to the conventional Flush-Flood technique. The water balance of Pin-Point and Flush-Flood were studied during the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons in Bewmont, TX. Three plots were subjected to the PinPoint irrigation technique and three to the Flush-Flood method. Nine non-weighing lysimeters per plot were installed to measure infiltration, transpiration and evapotranspiration. Three pots containing soil and three pots containing soil and plants were also installed in each conventional irrigation plot and weighed periodically to measure evapotranspiration during the <b>drain</b> <b>period.</b> Stomatal resistance was measured every two to three hours during daytime using a steady state porometer. Canopy temperature, soil surface temperature and water temperature were measured with an infrared thermometer. A net radiometer was installed in each plot to measure net radiation. The Pin-Point method used less water than the Flush-Flood method. There were no significant yield differences between the two methods. The Pin-Point method produced earlier maturity of the crop and suppressed weed development. No herbicide was necessary in the Pin-Point plots. During the period when the Flush-Flood plots were drained, the net radiation was slightly lower than in the Pin-Point plots, and the stomatal resistance was always higher. Also the canopy temperature was higher in the Flush-Flood plots compared to the Pin-Point Plots during the drained period. These results suggest that the Pin-Point method can be useful not only to suppress red rice, but also to save water. Also the earlier maturity of the crop under the Pin-Point irrigation regimen increases the probability of a good harvest in the ratoon crop...|$|E

40|$|Piles {{driven in}} clay are often {{subjected}} to indirect loading {{as a result}} of the surcharge applied on the surrounding area. During the <b>drained</b> <b>period,</b> both the pile and the soil undergo downward movements caused by the axial and the surcharge loading, respectively.

A numerical model was developed to simulate the case of a single pile driven in soft clay layer overlying a deep deposit. Coupled consolidation method of analysis is adopted to predict time/settlement/skin friction distribution relationships.

40|$|Introduction In {{the current}} study, an {{extended}} 3 -pore model (TPM) is presented {{and applied to}} the problem of optimizing automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) with regard to osmotic water transport (UF), small/middle-molecule clearance, and glucose absorption. Methods Simulations were performed for either intermittent APD (IPD) or tidal APD (TPD). IPD was simulated for fill and drain volumes of 2 L, whereas TPD was simulated using a tidal volume of 0. 5 L, 1 L, or 1. 5 L with full drains and subsequent fills (2 L) occurring after every fifth dwell. A total of 25 cycles for a large number of different dialysate flow rates (DFR) were simulated using 3 different glucose concentrations (1. 36 %, 2. 27 %, and 3. 86 %) and 3 different peritoneal transport types: slow (peritoneal equilibrium test D/Pcrea 0. 8), and average. Solute clearance and UF were simulated to occur during the entire dwell, including both fill and <b>drain</b> <b>periods.</b> Results It is demonstrated that DFRs exceeding ∼ 3 L/h are of little benefit both for UF and small-solute transport, whereas middle-molecule clearance is enhanced at higher DFRs. The simulations predict that large reductions (> 20 %) in glucose absorption are possible by using moderately higher DFRs than a standard 6 × 2 L prescription and by using shorter optimized “bi-modal” APD regimens that alternate between a glucose-free solution and a glucose-containing solution. Discussion Reductions in glucose absorption appear to be significant with the proposed regimens for APD; however, {{further research is needed to}} assess the feasibility and safety of these regimens...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} based on a BRGM study on piezometric indicators, {{threshold}} values of discharge and groundwater levels for the assessment of potentially-exploitable water resources of chalky watersheds. A method for estimating low water levels based on groundwater levels is presented from three examples representing chalk aquifers with different cycles: annual, combined and interannual. The first is located in Picardy and the two others in the Champagne-Ardennes region. Piezometers with annual cycles, used in these examples, are supposed to be representative of the aquifer hydro-dynamics. Except for multi-annual systems, the analysis between discharge measurements at a hydrometric station and groundwater levels measured at a piezometer representative of the main aquifer, leads to relatively precise and satisfactory relationships within a chalky context. These relationships may be useful for monitoring, validation, extension or reconstruction of the low water flow data. On the one hand, they allow definition of the piezometric levels corresponding to the different alert thresholds of river discharges. On the other hand, they clarify the proportions of low surface water flow from runoff or drainage of the aquifer. Finally, these correlations give an assessment of the minimum flow for the coming weeks. However, these correlations cannot be used to optimize the value of the exploitable water resource because it seems to be difficult to integrate the value of the effective rainfall that could occur during the <b>draining</b> <b>period.</b> Moreover, in the case of multi-annual systems, the solution is to attempt a comprehensive system modelling and, if it is satisfactory, using the simulated values to get rid of parasites or running the model for forecasting purposes...|$|R
40|$|Traditional oil {{analysis}} methods - e. g. acidity and viscosity measurements - {{have been used}} to monitor lubricant conditions. These methods can detect when the useful life of a lubricant is over but fall short when trying to gain insight on how long a lubricant in current use could last. This makes it difficult to make proactive decisions and estimate oil <b>drain</b> <b>periods.</b> Lubricants do not start to degrade until the antioxidants, which prevent from oxidation, have depleted to a certain level where they no longer can protect the base oil from degradation. During the degradation process insoluble contaminants form that can lead to sludge and varnish. Four engine oils were oxidized using oxygen pressurized vessels and four hydraulic oils were oxidized with turbine oil stability test (TOST). At different stages of oxidation, sample aliquots were withdrawn and analysed. A blend of engine oil and biodiesel was also tested as well as a mixture of hydraulic oil and water. Samples of engine oils were also tested from a rig test running at SCANIA’s facilities in Södertälje, Sweden. The samples were evaluated with Remaining Useful Life Evaluation Routine (RULER) and Membrane Patch Colorimetry (MPC). RULER is a voltammetric method that measures the antioxidant level in a lubricant sample and MPC measure the insoluble contaminants by spectrophotometric analysis. Results from these analyses were compared to conventional methods such as acid number, viscosity, and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results from the MPC-analyses showed that this method is dependent on the type of the lubricant tested. RULER performed well for all tested lubricants. It was shown that this analyse method can predict when the lubricant is going to start to degrade due to oxidation.

30|$|The {{specific}} operation method for counterloaning, taking March to June 2014 as an example, was as follows: (1) the payment settlement period settled on was every 6  months, that is, the <b>draining</b> <b>period</b> {{for the capital}} of suppliers was half a year and the payment for the first month was settled after 6  months, which indicates that the payment for March was not settled until September; (2) the borrowing amount of suppliers could not exceed the total amount that DSH owed. Assuming the March to June period as the calculating unit, the borrowing amount of suppliers in June could not exceed {{the total amount of}} 1.04 million in 3  months; and (3) the interest for the debts was 3 cents. If the supplier borrowed 1 billion, taking the amount for 3  months as a borrowing period, the supplier would need to pay 90, 000 for each loan. In fact, material suppliers tended to adopt the full borrowing amount to realize the effect of similar cash transactions. From this behavior of borrowing and lending that emerged in this case, we can see first, DSH’s borrowing scale was restricted within the total amount of payment he owed to the material supplier, as a result of which he not only did not need to take risks but he could also earn some interest. The worst situation for him was to conduct transactions in cash. As for the supplier, despite the 90, 000 paid for interest, every deal he made was a cash transaction so he relieved the stress of capital shortage due to debts. This was similar to the agreement by both parties. The cost of cash transaction was lower than a loan; thus, the material supplier agreed to DSH’s strategy. In 2014, when I learned of this case, the amount of debt was still short of 1 -month debt to reach 1 million. Therefore, the material supplier would rather pay interests more than 1  month to DSH in order to borrow 1 million from him to resolve the capital shortage. Therefore, the practice of the countervailing mechanism also made up for the problem of capital shortage.|$|R

Currently, ~ 25 % of the global N 2 O emission is ascribed to uncultivated tropical soils, but the exact locations and controlling mechanisms are not clear. Here we present the first study of soil N 2 O emission from the Pantanal indicating that this South American wetland may be a significant natural source of N 2 O. At three sites, we repeatedly measured in situ fluxes of N 2 O and sampled porewater nitrate (NO 3 -) during the low water season in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, ten sites were screened for in situ fluxes of N 2 O and soil NO 3 - content. The in situ fluxes of N 2 O were comparable to fluxes from heavily fertilized forests or agricultural soils. An important parameter affecting N 2 O emission rate was precipitation, inducing peak emissions of > 3 mmol N 2 O m- 2 d- 1, while the mean daily flux was 0. 43 &# 177; 0. 03 mmol N 2 O m- 2 d- 1. Over 170 days of the <b>drained</b> <b>period,</b> we estimated non-wetted drained soil to contribute 70. 0 mmol N 2 O m- 2, while rain-induced peak events contributed 9. 2 mmol N 2 O m- 2, {{resulting in a total}} N 2 O emission of 79. 2 mmol N 2 O m- 2. At the sites of repeated sampling, the pool of porewater nitrate varied (0. 002 - 7. 1 &# 181;mol NO 3 - g dw- 1) with higher concentrations of NO 3 - (p < 0. 05) found in drained soil than in water-logged soil, indicating dynamic shifts between nitrification and denitrification. In the field, O 2 penetrated the upper 60 cm of drained soil, but was depleted in response to precipitation. Upon experimental wetting the soil showed rapid O 2 depletion followed by N 2 O accumulation and a peak emission of N 2 O (2. 5 - 3. 0 mmol N 2 O m- 2 d- 1).

40|$|In modern {{automotive}} engines, {{especially in}} diesel engines, consumer demand for ever increasing service intervals for vehicles {{has led to}} longer oil <b>drain</b> <b>periods.</b> Consequently this has increased contamination levels in lubricating oils that will in turn reduce engine efficiency and increase the possibility of system failure due to increases in viscosity and the potential of oil starvation leading to scuffing and catastrophic failure of the engine. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} investigate the effects of diesel engine oil contaminants on the tribological performance of tribocontacts and also the possible interaction between the contaminants. The thesis aims to investigate the influence of contaminants and their interactions on diesel engine oil using Electro sensing (ES) monitoring. ES monitoring suggest sensitivity to tribocharging, triboemission, surface charging, and wear debris generated in the tribocontact. However, ES monitoring is still in its initial stages of development but the relationships between the ES charge signal and corresponding wear mechanisms are established. Initial experiments showed the sensitivities between charge and wear to changes in additive chemistry, as well as contamination (specifically a soot stimulant). The results indicated some interesting findings which were difficult to elucidate but paved the way for a parametric study. The parametric matrix examined the effect of contaminants and it was observed that wear rate was mainly influenced by acid and soot additions. The best correlation of steady state charge with the other measured tribological parameters of wear rate, friction and temperature is seen for the series of oxidised oils. The multi-contaminated oil (L 4 × 4) shows remarkably little degradation in tribological performance with a reduced friction level compared with the uncontaminated oil and only a modest increase in wear rate, slight increase in charge levels. This clearly showed that there were interactions between the contaminants. The factorial matrix studied interactions between the diesel engine oil contaminants on various tribo-couple materials, including silicon nitride, using ES monitoring. For charge, pin material – sulphuric acid and oxidation –sulphuric acid, interactions were statistically identified as having significant influence on performance. For friction, both pin and disc materials were identified as main influences along with pin material – sulphuric acid interactions. For wear, the presence of soot and the influence of pin material were identified statistically as the main effects. To conclude, the ES monitoring was sensitive to the presence and levels of contaminants in diesel lubricating oil, particularly diesel soot. The change in charge levels indicated the concentration of soot level present in the contact, which was directly related to wear. ES monitoring also detected interactions between the contaminants through statistical analysis. ES monitoring has shown that monitoring lubricant performance and the effects of contamination are feasible under laboratory conditions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Sensitive clay is {{the type}} of clay, which loses its shear {{strength}} when it is subjected to cyclic loading. High-rise buildings, towers, bridges etc., founded on sensitive clays and subjected to overturning moment are usually suffer from a steady reduction of the bearing capacity of their foundations and accordingly the safety factor. Cyclic loading of foundation on sensitive clay during the undrained period may lead to quick clay condition and catastrophic failure of the structure. In the literature, governing parameters are listed as: cyclic deviator stress, pore water pressure, axial strain, pre-consolidation pressure, confining stress, initial degree of saturation, water content, liquidity index and the number of cycles. The present study has introduced the governing parameters in two categories; namely physical and mechanical as a function of sensitivity number of the clay material. A well planned experimental investigation was conducted to examine the effect of these governing parameters during the undrained and the <b>drained</b> <b>periods</b> of sensitive clay subjected to static or cyclic loadings. The soil samples, known as “Champlain clay” were obtained from the city of Rigaud, Quebec (Canada). Consolidation tests, static and cyclic undrained and drained triaxial tests were performed on representative samples of this clay. Tests were conducted to identify the role of the key parameters governing this complex behavior during the drained and the undrained periods. The study examined individually the effect of cyclic loading, deviator stress, frequency, pre-consolidation pressure/OCR, and the confining pressure during the drained and undrained conditions. Absence or presence of the matric suction in fully saturated or partially saturated clay, effect of sensitivity number and liquidity index were also examined. Based on {{the results of the present}} experimental investigation, a hypothetical model was introduced to explain the process of shear strength reduction for the case of static and cyclic loading of sensitive clay subjected to cycling loading. The model was capable to define the term remolding agent or degree of remolding, the reduction in shear strength due to remolding. The increase in the water content is identified as the most critical or intrinsic shear strength for sensitive clay. The present study used the “Modified Cam Clay Model” to predict the factor of safety for a foundation on sensitive clay subjected to cyclic loading as function of the physical and mechanical parameters. A design procedure is developed to determine the safe zone for the undrained and drained responses, within which a combination of the cyclic deviator stress and the number of cycles for a given soil/loading/site conditions can achieve a quasi-elastic resilient state without reaching failure. The proposed design procedure is applicable to all regions around the world, where sensitive clays can be found. Furthermore, this procedure can be adopted to examine the conditions of existing foundations built on sensitive clay at any time during its lifespan. ...|$|R

40|$|The global {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O) budget remains unbalanced. Currently, ~ 25 % {{of the global}} N 2 O {{emission}} is ascribed to uncultivated tropical soils, but the exact locations and controlling mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we present the first detailed study {{of the dynamics of}} soil nitrogen pools and flux of N 2 O from the world's largest wetland Pantanal, South America. At three long-term measurement sites we measured porewater pH, NO 3 –, NH 4 +, N 2 O and O 2 as well as N 2 O dynamics in soil slurry, and in situ fluxes of N 2 O and CO 2. The pool of inorganic nitrogen changed (7. 1 – 92 μg NH 4 + -N g dw − 1, and 0. 1 – 201 μg NO 3 – -N g dw – 1) with the seasonal flooding and drying cycles, indicating dynamic shifts between ammonification, nitrification and denitrification. In the field, O 2 penetrated to a depth of 60 cm in dry soil, but O 2 was rapidly depleted in response to precipitation. Soil pH fluctuated from pH 7 – 7. 5 in flooded soil to pH 3. 5 – 4. 5 in the same drained soil. Microsensor measurements showed rapid N 2 O accumulation reaching > 500 – 1000 Pa in soil slurries due to incomplete denitrification. In situ fluxes of N 2 O were comparable to heavily fertilized forest or agricultural soils. The dominating parameter affecting N 2 O emission rate was precipitation inducing peak emissions of > 3 mmol N 2 O m − 2 d − 1, while the mean daily flux was 0. 43 mmol N 2 O m − 2 d − 1. Single measurement based screening of in situ activity at 10 Pantanal sites during dry conditions averaged 0. 39 mmol N 2 O m − 2 d − 1. The in situ N 2 O fluxes were only weakly correlated (r 2 = 0. 177) with NO 3 – and pH value, showing a tendency (p = 0. 063) for NO 3 – concentration to be positively correlated with the in situ N 2 O flux and a weaker tendency (p = 0. 138) for the pH value to be negatively correlated with the in situ N 2 O flux. Over 170 days of the <b>drained</b> <b>period</b> we estimated non-wetted drained soil to contribute 70. 0 mmol N 2 O m − 2, while rain induced peak events contributed 9. 2 mmol N 2 O m − 2, resulting in a total N 2 O emission of 79. 2 mmol N 2 O m − 2. The total nitrogen loss via emission of NO, N 2 O and N 2 was estimated to be 206 mmol N m − 2 over 170 days, representing 0. 7 – 1. 6 % of the total nitrogen in the top 6. 5 cm soil layer...|$|R
25|$|Between Hillhead Farm and Wheatrig Farm is a {{dwelling}} marked as Lochend on the 1860 OS, {{although it is}} not marked on earlier or later maps. It is mentioned, together with Crumshaw Mill in 1618. It lies on the old track that connected the two farms and it is close to the confluence of the Garrier and Lochridge Burns, suggesting that a small loch or lochan could well have existed here. A wet meadow still exists at this point, suggesting that the loch was <b>drained</b> during the <b>period</b> of agricultural improvements around 1775. A very large underground culvert was built to carry the large volumes of water away from this area, although its course is no longer known locally. The Lochridge Burn, Garrier Burn and Brackenburn all merge before Alton Bridge. The old bridge here, with its proximity to the 'Old Toun', may have been the Lambroch Bridge marked on Pont's 1654 map.|$|R

However, when blacks began visiting the McKinley Park pool June 6, 1930, whites at the pool and in the neighborhood reacted strongly. Confrontations over the following weeks occasionally turned violent and the pool was closed and <b>drained</b> for a <b>period.</b> Singleton supported desegregation {{of the pool and}} was generally against the mayor's plan to open new pools for blacks. He also spoke out against lynching and murder of Raymond Gunn in Maryville, Missouri. In 1931, a Negro regiment was stationed at Fort Omaha in the Miller Park neighborhood to great protest from whites in the area. Singleton along with Killingsworth (past commander of the Roosevelt Post of the American Legion) and Gene Thomas (past commander of the Legion Post of Spanish War Veterans) were instrumental in support of the troops In 1933 he left Omaha for Jamaica, Long Island, New York.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{functional}} imaging {{studies have}} revealed a supraspinal network, which {{is involved in}} perception and processing of bladder distention. Very little information exists on the cortical representation of C-fiber transmitted temperature sensation of the human bladder, although C-fibers seem {{to be involved in}} the pathomechanisms of bladder dysfunctions. Our aim was, therefore, to evaluate the outcome of bladder cold stimulation on supraspinal activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A block design fMRI study was performed in 14 healthy females at the MR-center of the University of Zurich. After catheterization, all subjects were investigated in a 3. 0 -Tesla Scanner. The scanning consisted of 10 repetitive cycles. Each cycle consisted of five conditions: REST, INFUSION, SENSATION, DRAIN 1, and DRAIN 2. Cold saline was passively infused at 4 - 8 degrees C during scanning. Not more than 100 ml were infused per cycle. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal analysis of the different conditions was compared to REST. All activations were evaluated on a random effects level at P = 0. 001. Activation of brain regions for bladder cold stimulation (<b>DRAIN</b> 1 <b>period)</b> was found bilaterally in the inferior parietal lobe [Brodmann area (BA) 40], the right insula (BA 13), the right cerebellar posterior lobe, the right middle temporal gyrus (BA 20), and the right postcentral gyrus (BA 3). In conclusion, bladder cooling caused a different supraspinal activation pattern compared to what is known to occur during bladder distention. This supports our hypothesis that cold sensation is processed differently from bladder distension at the supraspinal level. Hum Brain Mapp, 2010. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Variação do peso fresco em Cornops aquaticum (Bruner) (Orthoptera, Acrididae) associado a Eichhornia azurea (Sw) Kunth (Pontederiaceae) em uma baía no Pantanal de Poconé, Mato Grosso. Cornops aquaticum (Bruner, 1906) (Orthoptera, Acrididae) desenvolve seu ciclo de vida sobre macrófitas aquáticas da família Pontederiaceae. Como os gafanhotos são capazes de {{responder}} às mudanças sazonais, a alternância de períodos que ocorre no Pantanal pode refletir em sua biologia. Este estudo foi desenvolvido no Pantanal de Poconé - MT, com o objetivo de avaliar possíveis variações no peso fresco dos adultos e ninfas de C. aquaticum. Durante o período de março/ 2006 a fevereiro/ 2007 coletaram-se mensalmente, 50 indivíduos de C. aquaticum. Um total de 600 indivíduos foi avaliado, sendo 43, 5 % adultos e 56, 5 % ninfas. Os maiores valores de peso fresco total ocorreram nos meses de setembro (9, 106 g; 0, 182 g/indivíduo) e outubro/ 2006 (8, 865 g; 0, 177 g/indivíduo) e os menores em março/ 2006 (3, 413 g; 0, 068 g/indivíduo). Nos indivíduos adultos os maiores pesos frescos foram registrados em setembro/ 2006 (8, 680 g; 0, 223 g/indivíduo) e outubro/ 2006 (8, 654 g; 0, 234 g/indivíduo), no final do período de seca, e o menor em março/ 2006 (1, 792 g; 0, 138 g/indivíduo), durante o período de cheia. As ninfas tiveram o maior peso fresco em abril/ 2006 (2, 913 g; 0, 076 g/indivíduo) início da vazante, enquanto o menor peso fresco ocorreu em outubro/ 2006 (0, 211 g; 0, 016 g/indivíduo) início da enchente. Apenas a variação no peso fresco médio das fêmeas foi significativa (f = 6, 43; p = 0, 001), com os maiores registros durante o período de enchente, o que pode evidenciar uma estratégia reprodutiva. Cornops aquaticum (Bruner, 1906) (Orthoptera, Acrididae) develops {{its life}} cycle on aquatic macrophyte of the Pontederiaceae family. As grasshoppers {{are able to}} respond to the seasonal changes, the alternation of periods that occurs in the Pantanal may reflect in their biology. This study was carried out in the Pantanal of Poconé- MT, with the aim of evaluating possible variations in the fresh weight of the adults and nymphs of C. aquaticum. From March/ 2006 to February/ 2007, 50 individuals of C. aquaticum were collected each month. A total of 600 individuals was assessed, 43. 5 % of which were adults and 56. 5 % nymphs. The highest values of total fresh weight occurred in September (9. 106 g; 0. 182 g/individual) and October/ 2006 (8. 865 g; 0. 177 g/individual) and the lowest in March/ 2006 (3. 413 g; 0. 068 g/individual). Among the adult individuals the highest fresh weight was registered in September/ 2006 (8. 680 g; 0. 223 g/individual) and October/ 2006 (8. 654 g; 0. 234 g/individual), {{at the end of the}} dry period, and the lowest in March/ 2006 (1. 792 g; 0. 138 g/individual) during the flood period.

By {{presenting}} this case we aim to describe an uncommon complication of herniation of fallopian tube following the simple procedure of surgical drain removal. Case Presentation. This case describes a 23 -year G 2 P 1 L 1 who underwent an emergency cesarean section for obstructed labor with intraperitoneal drain insertion. The patient had an uneventful postoperative <b>period,</b> <b>drain</b> was removed on day 4, and she was discharged. She presented on day 8 with the complaint of soakage of drain site dressing. On examination an edematous, tubular structure with early sign of necrosis was seen coming out of drain site and a provisional diagnosis of appendix herniation was made. On emergency laparotomy fallopian tube was seen coming out through the drain site and salphingectomy was done. Conclusion. Drains are {{not a substitute for}} good surgical technique. Although herniation of intestine, omentum, appendix, gall bladder, and ovary have been reported, we could not find any case of fallopian tube herniation in the literature searched by us...|$|R
