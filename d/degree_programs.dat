40|$|Many {{theories}} on college retention recognize {{the significance of}} student satisfaction as a positive factor in students' persistence. Yet, there are few theories that address the relationship of <b>degree</b> <b>program</b> satisfaction to study behaviour and dropout. This paper explores the impact of <b>degree</b> <b>program</b> satisfaction on academic accomplishment and dropout. The impact of <b>degree</b> <b>program</b> satisfaction was studied within a multitheoretical framework. The {{results of the study}} show that student accomplishment not only depends on differences in academic ability but also on <b>degree</b> <b>program</b> satisfaction. Decreased <b>degree</b> <b>program</b> satisfaction appears to diminish both study motivation and study behaviour. The authors discuss some implications for current educational practice...|$|R
