50|$|Once {{the motor}} is in operation, {{the speed of}} the motor is {{dependent}} only on the supply frequency. When the motor load is increased beyond the breakdown load, the motor falls out of synchronization and the field winding no longer follows the rotating magnetic field. Since the motor cannot produce (synchronous) torque if it falls out of synchronization, practical synchronous motors have a partial or complete squirrel-cage damper (amortisseur) winding to stabilize operation and facilitate starting. Because this winding is smaller than that of an equivalent induction motor and can overheat on long operation, and because large slip-frequency voltages are induced in the rotor <b>excitation</b> <b>winding,</b> synchronous motor protection devices sense this condition and interrupt the power supply (out of step protection).|$|E

40|$|This paper derives {{a closed}} form {{solution}} for wind-induced response of actively controlled tall buildings with linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers {{to facilitate the}} real application of modern active control theory. The <b>wind</b> <b>excitation</b> acting on a tall building is decomposed {{into a number of}} component <b>wind</b> <b>excitations</b> in which any two component <b>wind</b> <b>excitations</b> are uncorrelated and each component <b>wind</b> <b>excitation</b> can be obtained as the output of a shaping filter with unit intensity white noise input. After the equations of motion of the system are established, the closed form solution for wind response of the system is then derived by combining the complex modal superposition method together with the pseudo-excitation method and the residue theorem. With the derived closed from solution, extensive parametric studies can be performed on wind-excited tall buildings with LQG controllers to seek beneficial weighting matrices so that the maximum wind response reduction can be achieved with reasonable control forces. The results from a numerical example demonstrate that if weighting matrices are selected appropriately, the modal damping ratios of the system can be significantly increased and the alongwind response of the building can be considerably reduced.

50|$|The second diagram shows {{a machine}} with no <b>excitation</b> <b>winding,</b> but instead, a {{constant}} voltage {{is connected to}} the quadrature brushes. This produces a flux similar to the one produced by the rotation of the armature in the excitation flux in the first example. The operation of the machine is therefore very similar, with the output current rising until the flux it produces almost counteracts the flux generated by the applied voltage. Tustin has shown that the input and output power are the same, and so the machine transforms the constant-voltage input into a constant-current output. As with the metadyne generator, the Metadyne transformer can be partially compensated, and will continue to operate as a constant-current device until the compensation exceeds 97 per cent.|$|E

This feature is purposefully designed for sequential input selection during adaptive identification {{and control of}} nonlinear systems, which allows the input space to be organized dynamically, while the excitation is occurring. The neural network has the main advantages of (1) automating the input selection process for time series that are not known a priori; (2) adapting the representation to nonstationarities; and (3) using limited observations. The algorithm designed for the adaptive input space assumes local quasi-stationarity of the time series, and embeds local maps sequentially in a delay vector using the embedding theorem. The input space of the representation, which in our case is a wavelet neural network, is subsequently updated. We demonstrate that the neural net {{has the potential to}} significantly improve convergence of a black-box model in adaptive tracking of a nonlinear system.

40|$|International audienceThe {{ability to}} {{accurately}} identify structural parameters, either on-line or almost on-line, based on vibration data measured from sensors, {{is essential for}} the structural health monitoring system. The problem is quite challenging, in particular when the external excitations are not completely measured and when the structural system is nonlinear. In practical applications, external excitations (inputs), such as seismic <b>excitations,</b> <b>wind</b> loads, traffic loads, etc., may not be measured or may not be measurable, and the structure may not always be linear.

In this approach, external excitations and some structural responses may not be measured. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach will be demonstrated by numerical simulations without the measurement of external excitations. The simulation results indicate that the proposed damage detection technique is capable of identifying structural parameters, as well as predicting the unknown external excitations...|$|R

Development of a {{mathematical}} model that enables to detect resonance modes during asynchronous startup of salient-pole synchronous motors, in which capacitors are switched on to increase the electromagnetic moment in the circuit of the <b>excitation</b> <b>winding.</b> Methodology. The asynchronous mode is described by a system of differential equations of the electric equilibrium of motor circuits written in orthogonal coordinate axes. The basis of the developed algorithm is the mathematical model of the high-level adequacy motor and the projection method for solving the boundary value problem for the equations of the electric equilibrium of the circuits written in orthogonal coordinate axes, {{taking into account the}} presence of capacitors in the <b>excitation</b> <b>winding.</b> The coefficients of differential equations are the differential inductances of the motor circuits, which are determined {{on the basis of the}} calculation of its magnetic circuit. As a result of the asymmetry of the rotor windings in the asynchronous mode, the current coupling and currents change according to the periodic law. The problem of its definition is solved as a boundary one. Results. A mathematical model for studying the asynchronous characteristics of synchronous motors with capacitors in an <b>excitation</b> <b>winding</b> is developed, by means of which it is possible to investigate the influence of the size of the capacity on the motor's starting properties and the resonance processes which may arise in this case.

Indeed, {{in order to ensure}} serviceability and safety standards, it is the engineers' responsibility to investigate the response of high-rise buildings to <b>wind</b> <b>excitation.</b> Tuned mass dampers are usually used to limit the response of the buildings to wind. However, these devices are generally tuned for a particular bandwidth of frequencies. Therefore, in order to improve the effectiveness of these devices, control schemes must be implemented. For this thesis, the design of a modified friction device (MFD) has been studied. Requiring only a small amount of energy, the MFD is a new kind of semi-active damper that provides stability, accurate control and effectiveness. Using a MATLAB program, it was possible to model a primary structure hit by a certain <b>wind</b> <b>excitation.</b> The modified friction device was designed to counterbalance the effects of wind and decrease displacements and accelerations. It was placed {{on the top of the}} building where the displacements are generally the highest. The parameters of the MFD were examined, and many simulations were run in order to optimize the action of the device on the mitigation of <b>wind</b> <b>excitation.</b> The results demonstrate that the MFD effectively mitigates wind induced motion in buildings. Therefore, this thesis corroborates the benefits of implementing modified friction devices in civil structures. by Saad Mikou. Thesis (M. Eng.)
