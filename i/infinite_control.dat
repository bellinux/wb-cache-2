50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of neutral-density filters {{is that to}} be entirely flexible in your shooting you need to carry a range of different NDs. This can become an expensive proposition, especially if using screw filters with different lens filter sizes, which would require carrying a set for each diameter of lens carried (although inexpensive step-up rings can eliminate this requirement). To counter this problem, some manufacturers have created variable ND filters. These work by placing two polarizing filters together, {{at least one of}} which can rotate. The rear polarizing filter cuts out light in one plane. As the front element is rotated, it cuts out an increasing amount of the remaining light, the closer the front filters comes to being perpendicular to the rear filter. By using this technique, the amount of light reaching the sensor can be varied with almost <b>infinite</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pushdown systems (PDSs) are an automata-theoretic {{formalism}} for specifying a {{class of}} infinite-state transition systems. Infiniteness {{comes from the fact}} that each configuration 〈p, S 〉 in the state space consists of a (formal) “control location ” p coupled with a stack S of unbounded size. PDSs can model program paths that have matching calls and returns, and automaton-based representations allow analysis algorithms to account for the <b>infinite</b> <b>control</b> state space of recursive programs. Weighted pushdown systems (WPDSs) are a generalization of PDSs that add a general “black-box ” abstraction for program data (through weights). WPDSs also generalize other frameworks for interprocedural analysis, such as the Sharir-Pnueli functional approach. This paper surveys recent work in this area, and establishes a few new connections with existing work. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the optimal control problem of transferring population between states of a quantum system where the coupling proceeds only via intermediate {{states that are}} subject to decay. We pose the question whether it is generally possible {{to carry out this}} transfer. For a single intermediate decaying state, we recover the Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) process which we identify as the global optimum in the limit of <b>infinite</b> <b>control</b> time. We also present analytic solutions for the case of transfer that has to proceed via two consecutive intermediate decaying states. We show that in this case, for finite power the optimal control does not approach perfect state transfer even in the infinite time limit. We generalize our findings to characterize the topologies of paths that can be achieved by coherent control under the assumption of finite power. Comment: 12 page...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{numerical}} stability analysis for inde-pendent modal vibration suppression of a fluid-conveying pipe using a piezoelectric inertia actuator (PIA). The stability {{issue of the}} approach as proposed by the pioneer developers is ad-dressed. The approach utilizes an <b>infinite</b> <b>control</b> weight for one component of the modal control input and results in a severe control spillover problem for the complex mode con-trolled, easily leading to closed loop instability even for open loop stable systems. The stability of the system depends on how the left eigenvector is normalized for transforming the original coupled equations to the decoupled ones in the modal space. A novel approach by rotating the left eigenvector on the complex plane is systematically examined to define the region of stabil-ity in this work. A feasible modal control design for systems possessing complex modes can thus be accomplished using the proposed approach. I...|$|E

40|$|Under the multi-objective framework, {{this paper}} {{presents}} a hybrid algorithm to solve robust static output feedback control problem for continuous poly-topic uncertain system. To obtain static output feedback gain, a new hybrid algorithm is proposed by combination of a hybrid algorithm of the Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution (DE), and the linear matrix inequality method. The proposed algorithm is used to solve a optimization problem with a bi-linear matrix inequality constraints. The Particle Swarm Optimization-DE hybrid algorithm was used to obtain a population of controllers, and linear matrix inequality approach was used to optimize a performance criterion of the system.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} high {{performance}} control in a {{synchronous reference frame}} for a single-phase grid connected converter. The proposed control allows to obtain easily an <b>infinite</b> <b>control</b> loop gain at fundamental frequency and a superior disturbance rejection. So doing only active current is injected in the grid thus achieving maximum conversion efficiency and decreasing current distortion. The control has been implemented in a single-stage converter for single-phase PV systems. The converter is a standard full-bridge three-level voltage source inverter that delivers a sinusoidal current to the grid through an inductive filter and a line frequency isolation transformer. The presence of the transformer block out the DC components injected in the grid but the current feedback, closed around {{the output of the}} transformer, can lead to core saturation. To avoid saturation a compensation strategy has been developed relying on output current distortion in correspondence of voltage zero crossings. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control architecture and of the strategy adopted to avoid transformer core saturation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} region of attraction of stabilizing receding horizon control strategies for nonlinear systems. This study builds on earlier results of the authors on obtaining stability guarantees for Receding Horizon methods by using an a priori obtained Control Lyapunov function (CLF) as terminal cost. It is shown that as the horizon length is increased, the region of attraction grows and approaches the region of attraction of the <b>infinite</b> horizon <b>control</b> strategy as the horizon length approaches infinity. The main contribution of these results is that a terminal state constraint is not required as some other available methods do.

40|$|In {{film and}} still photography, {{depth of field}} control is often {{employed}} to control viewer interest in an image. This technique is also used in computer animation, but, in a medium where artists have near <b>infinite</b> <b>control,</b> must we rely on replicating photorealism? This research is a viable, non-photorealistic {{solution to the problem}} of directing viewer interest. Vision is directed by reducing superfluous visual information from parts of the image, which do not directly affect the depictive meaning of that image. This concept is applied to images and animations rendered from three-dimensional, computergenerated scenes, where detail is defined as visual information pertaining to the surface properties of a given object. A system is developed to demonstrate this concept. The system uses distance from a user-defined origin as the main mechanism to modulate detail. This solution is implemented within a modeling and shading environment to serve as a non-photorealistic, functional alternative for depth of field. This approach is conceptually based on a model of human vision, specifically, the relationship between foveal and peripheral vision, and is artistically driven by various works in the disciplines of painting and illustration, that through the careful manipulation of detail, control interest and understanding within the image. The resulting images and animations produced by this system provide viable evidence that detail modulation can be used to control effectively viewer interest in an image eliminating the need to use photographic techniques like depth of field...|$|E
40|$|Although {{automated}} finite-state verification {{techniques have}} matured considerably {{in the past}} several years, they are invariably applicable only to simplified, idealized models of systems. Finding the right design abstractions and organizing a model to be amenable to automated verification, avoiding the well-known state explosion problem, is a creative task that cannot be fully automated. Nonetheless, some formal relation between the verified model and the “as-built” structure of the software system is required to gain confidence in their consistency, e. g., through conformance testing. One way to maintain the relation is by constructing one of the structures by transforming the other. ^ We describe how as-built design models can be refactored for compositional state-space analysis. The process is semi-automated (the designer must choose from among a set of idiomatic transformations, but each transformation is applied and the behavioral equivalence is checked automatically). We show how such refactoring transformations are used to obtain models that can be hierarchically composed, avoiding excessive state explosion. Since the refactoring transformations are checked, the original model of the system structure “as-built” can be used to generate conformance test oracles relating the actual system to the refactored, verified design. We argue that this indirect, two-phase approach is more sensitive than direct specification-based testing of implementations. ^ Our refactoring can also be applied to systems parameterized by <b>infinite</b> <b>control</b> parts, such as systems composed of many identical processes. These systems can sometimes be verified inductively using a network invariant, but systems whose component processes vary in some systematic way are not amenable to direct application of that method. We describe how variations in behavior can be “factored out” into additional processes by refactoring, thus enabling induction over the number of processes. ...|$|E
