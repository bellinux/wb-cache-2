40|$|Are <b>international</b> <b>organizations</b> a {{positive}} force in improving good governance and reducing corruption? <b>International</b> <b>organizations</b> {{have traditionally been}} perceived as {{a positive}} force in international politics.

The paper thereby shows the benefits of moving beyond descriptions of system level features, such as inbuilt transparency mechanisms, to also study the effect that systems have on participants involved.

After the storm, displaced residents stayed in public buildings or outside damaged houses. Due to the collective impacts of Chapala and Megh, various Persian Gulf countries sent 43planes with supplies to the island by 19November.

40|$|Immunity {{is freedom}} from liability, and as such, it can quite {{literally}} provide a “get {{out of jail}} free” card.

Conversely, the Third Circuit recently held that <b>international</b> <b>organizations</b> are only entitled to restrictive immunity, which limits immunity to claims involving an organization’s public acts and does not exempt them from suits based on their commercial or private conduct. This Note contends that a plain reading of the IOIA, combined with a full understanding of the history and legislative purpose behind the immunity of <b>international</b> <b>organizations,</b> presents a third interpretation.

International {{responsibility}} of member states for acts of <b>international</b> <b>organizations</b> {{is one of}} the most complex, but also the most controversial issues in the field of international responsibility. Overview of the practice shows us that there is still no unified view on this issue.

International legal personality of <b>international</b> <b>organizations</b> thus represents a shield which provides member states protection from potential international legal responsibility for acts of <b>international</b> <b>organizations.</b> However, aiming to protect the rights and interests of third parties, some authors advocate the view that the member states are, exclusively due to their membership, concurrently or secondarily liable for internationally wrongful acts committed by <b>international</b> <b>organizations.</b> Nevertheless, acceptance of concurrent and secondary liability of member states, based solely on their membership, would result in interference by member states in the activities of <b>international</b> <b>organizations</b> and would thereby bring into question the autonomy and separate international legal personality of <b>international</b> <b>organizations.</b> Although the <b>International</b> Law Commission has rejected the possibility of concurrent and secondary liability of member states, based solely on their membership, the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s Draft Articles on the Responsibility of <b>International</b> <b>Organizations</b> from 2011 anticipated international legal responsibility of member states for internationally wrongful acts committed by <b>international</b> <b>organizations.</b> However, it is necessary to further elaborate certain Articles of the Draft in order to create effective mechanisms through which a real connection between member states and acts committed by <b>international</b> <b>organizations</b> could be determined in practice, as otherwise there is a risk of abuse of <b>international</b> <b>organizations</b> and their <b>international</b> legal personality by member states in order to avoid international legal responsibility...|$|R
