40|$|The {{control of}} low {{frequency}} {{noise and vibration}} in <b>distributed</b> <b>structures</b> has traditionally been difficult and expensive, because of the long acoustic wavelengths involved. In this paper, conventional technology such as passive, linear, lumped-parameter, dynamic vibration absorbers (DVAs) for <b>distributed</b> <b>structures</b> is introduced first. Then, {{a new type of}} active nonlinear distributed-parameter DVAs for <b>distributed</b> <b>structures</b> is investigated. Such absorbers, called Vibration Clamping Absorbers (VCAs), make use of quadraticmodal- positive-position-feedback (QMPPF) control to suppress the vibration of structures at various resonant frequencies. The VCAs can be constructed by using PZT patches driven by a digital signal processor controller. Moreover, the VCAs can control multiple vibration modes by means of a few pairs of sensors and actuators. The effectiveness of the VCA design based on the QMPPF strategy is validated under multiple-mode control on a flexible cantilever beam system with a single sensor-actuator pair. Simulation and experimental results reveal that the proposed strategy is a potentially viable means for active vibration control in <b>distributed</b> <b>structures.</b> Lei Chen and C. H.

50|$|Three {{functions}} (routing function, local statistic computation {{and monitoring}} function, and integrated decisionmaking function) are {{implemented in the}} {{different parts of the}} mobile network. Due to the <b>distributed</b> <b>structure,</b> the computation and implementation complexity of therouting scheme are reduced. Also, since routes are discovered based on the up-to-date local information and selected by the optimization computation, routing parameters (e.g., number of paths, FEC parity length, and traffic distribution rate) are dynamic and optimized. In additionto supporting multiple QoS requirements, traffic balancing and bandwidth resources are factored into our decisionmaking process. The <b>distributed</b> <b>structure</b> of the local QoS statistics used in the routing enables this QoS support mechanism to be scalable in mobile networks. Simulationresults indicate that the performance (i.e., packet loss and end-to-end delay) are much better and less susceptible to the state changes (i.e., node mobility, transmission power, channel characteristics, and the traffic pattern) of the network, compared to a nonadaptive routing strategy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} TOTA (“Tuples On The Air”), a novel {{middleware}} {{to coordinate the}} movements {{of a large number}} of autonomous components (i. e. agents) in a ubiquitous computing scenario. The key idea in TOTA is to rely on spatially distributed tuples for both representing contextual information and supporting uncoupled and adaptive interactions between application components. The TOTA middleware takes care both of propagating tuples across a network on the basis of application-specific rules and of adaptively re-shaping the resulting <b>distributed</b> <b>structures</b> accordingly to changes in the network structures. Application agents – via a simple API – can locally sense such <b>distributed</b> <b>structures</b> to achieve context-awareness and to effectively coordinate their movements. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{distributed}} {{and parallel}} computing environments, {{there are many}} computational problems that require efficient communication and coordination between the processes. For such problems there have been proposed several <b>distributed</b> <b>structures,</b> each designed to solve a particular problem or a class of problems. The <b>distributed</b> <b>structures</b> {{take into account the}} particularities of the specific problems and provide efficient solutions for them. In this work we study two distributed structures: counting networks and the mesh network. Counting networks are used for implementing distributed counters; mesh is a communication network. So far, counting networks have been used for increment operations only. We demonstrate that counting networks can be extended to support decrement operations as well. Furthermore, we present new efficient counting network constructions. For the mesh network we study the communication problem, known as hot-potato routing, and we provide novel algorithms for the class of hot-potato algorithms known as “greedy. ” Although counting networks and the hot-potato routing in the mesh are used for different purposes, their underlying <b>distributed</b> <b>structures</b> share a common characteristic: the basic structural elements contain a very limited amount of memory.
