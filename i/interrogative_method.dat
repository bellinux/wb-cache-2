The theoretical part addresses the characterisation of terms related to unemployment, it deals with, unemployment commencement, its types and factors affecting it. It focuses on the description of highrisk groups of persons, as well as effects of unemployment on mental and somatic health of men. Furthermore, the thesis deals with the state politics of unemloyment and its implements. The practical {{part of the work}} covers research carried out with the use of an <b>interrogative</b> <b>method,</b> as well as the use of statistical and demographic data, which characterize the examined problematics. Based on the results of the research, further possible application in practice were proposed, namely within the implementation of retraining courses and projects.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this dissertation is best apportioned into two distinct parts; the first part (Chapters 2 - 4) describes several investigations of low-valent manganese carbonyl/isocyanide complexes, while the second part (Chapters 5 - 7) details the generation of coordination polymers and other supramolecular complexes using the ditopic isocyanide [CNArMes 2] 2. With this division in mind, the attentive reader will hopefully observe that the <b>interrogative</b> <b>method</b> utilized in studies of discrete, molecular complexes can be translated efficiently and effectively to materials development. 	In the first part, the mixed carbonyl/isocyanide complex Mn(CO) 3 (CNArDipp 2) 2 was isolated in gram scale {{with the aid of}} the sterically encumbering isocyanide CNArDipp 2. This green solid, which is electronically and structurally similar to the homoleptic carbonyl Mn(CO) 5, displays the radical-based chemistry expected for an open-shelled, low-spin d 7 organometallic species. However, the kinetic stabilization engendered by the m-terphenyl groups has allowed for a careful study of reaction products, with the notable isolation of several manganese η 2 -N,O-nitroxide radicals. The identification of these species raises doubts concerning earlier work regarding nitrosoarene spin-trapping of photolytically generated Mn(CO) 5, and underscores the importance of the cis-labilizing effect in low-valent Mn chemistry. This latter fact has been elaborated upon with the generation of multiple Mn κ 2 -carboxylates (eg. (κ 2 -O,O’-RCO 2) Mn(CO) 2 (CNArDipp 2) 2) via the cis-labilization of CO from the [Mn(CO) 3 (CNArDipp 2) 2] framework using a variety of metal carboxylate reagents. These Mn carboxylate species can serve as viable sources of the [Mn(CO) 2 (CNArDipp 2) 2]+ fragment under reductive conditions or with the use of Lewis acidic reagents. Finally, the stability of Mn(CO) 3 (CNArDipp 2) 2 permitted a thorough electrochemical study of the Mn(- 1 / 0 / 1) redox couple, with particular attention paid to the reduction of CO 2 by the manganate [Mn(CO) 3 (CNArDipp 2) 2]–. The results of this study are informative towards the design of improved Mn-based molecular catalysts for the catalytic reduction of CO 2. 	In the second part of this dissertation, the development of isocyanide coordination polymers derived from the sterically encumbering diisocyanide [CNArMes 2] 2 is described. In particular, it was found that control over nodal geometry and ligand coordination number is accomplished for Cu(I) isocyanide coordination polymers in direct analogy to previously surveyed chemistry for molecular Cu(I) m-terphenyl isocyanide complexes. The ability to favor low isocyanide coordination was further utilized in the preparation of Ni-ISOCN- 1, the first authenticated metal-organic material utilizing zerovalent metal sites as nodes. Similar to the aforementioned Cu(I) polymers, Ni-ISOCN- 1 features low isocyanide coordination, which results in a formal 16 e– count at each Ni(0) site. An assessment of the physical properties of these and other polymers is presented, providing a first glimpse into the chemistry of crystalline transition metal-isocyanide coordination polymers...|$|E
40|$|During the life, people {{encounter}} hazardous {{factors which}} can negatively influence their health. Society tries {{to avoid these}} hazardous factors introducing preventive programmes {{with a wide range}} of impact. This MA thesis is called "Preventive programmes analysis in a selected town". These programmes were specified to preventive programmes focused on addictive substances with the aim to find out how participants from Jindrichuv Hradec perceive these addiction preventive programmes. The research has revealed that preventive programmes in schools are conducted by various organizations and lecturers. In order to gain the relevant data, the research was focused on evaluation of the last preventive programme carried out in the school. After elaborating the practical part, the strategy of quantitative research was chosen and accomplished by the <b>interrogative</b> <b>method</b> realized by a questionnaire. The research was done in six elementary schools and five high schools in Jindrichuv Hradec. The participants were made up of the 8 th and 9 th grade elementary-school pupils and the 3 rd and 4 th grade high-school students. As a research tool, a questionnaire consisting of 12 questions was used. The questions targeted to reveal in which form of the preventive programme the respondents had taken part, which form they preferred, who conducted the programme, and what sort of lecturer they would prefer. Using the semantic differential involving opposite pairs of adjectives on a 7 -grade scale, the respondents' attitude towards the content of the preventive programmes was elicited as well as their attitude towards the person conducting the programme. Two research questions were stated: 1) What kind of addiction preventive programmes do the participants in Jindrichuv Hradec prefer? 2) What positive and negative aspects do the preventive programmes contain according to the participants in Jindrichuv Hradec? Regarding the set aim and the research questions of this MA thesis, two hypotheses have been determined. Hypothesis no. 1 : "High-school participants, in contrast to elementary-school participants, rather prefer the interactive form of the preventive programme. " This hypothesis has been tested by the Khi-Quadrate Test. As a result, a statistically significant relation between the type of school and the interactive programme preference has been revealed. Hypothesis no. 2 : "High-school participants perceive preventive programmes rather in a negative way in comparison to elementary-school participants. " This hypothesis has been tested by the T-Test. The data concerning the preventive programme's content evaluation and the data concerning the evaluation of the person conducting the programme have been analysed separately. A statistically significant relation between the variables has been discovered by the final result. The results show that the high-school students prefer the form of the interactive preventive programme; however, they have a more negative attitude towards preventive programmes in general. A detailed examination of the results suggests that it is due to their previous knowledge of the information and that they would prefer a lecturer introducing the topic in a new, more amusing way. The elementary-school pupils prefer discussion as a form of preventive programmes. In comparison to the high-school students, they have a more positive attitude towards preventive programmes. Even though the examination of efficiency was not the subject of the research, it has been found out that the elementary-school pupils consider preventive programmes being useful for them. Regarding the lecturer of the programme, both groups of respondents prefer a cured user of addictive substances. This thesis can be used as an inspiration for professionals in various areas education or social care and also for organizations providing addiction preventive programmes...|$|E

40|$|For the {{foreseeable}} future, gathering information from others {{is likely to}} remain a fundamental goal for those concerned with protecting national and international security. A central challenge facing all information gatherers is to identify howa sender (the information collector) might ‘manage’ a receiver (the information holder) to best effect, that is how to encourage the receiver to move from a position of witholding to imparting information. Additional challenges arise from recent moves away from coercive, <b>interrogative</b> <b>methods</b> towards intelligence interviewing, and the increasing use of synthetic environments as communication channels, and so how senders might persuade receivers when interacting in synthetic environments. Here we disciss how the information gathering literature, with reference to intelligence interviewing, might advance {{in the face of such}} change, suggesting that those tasked with developing bespoke plans, or operational accords might wish to consider social cognition and cognitive styles theory to support positive outcomes in synthetic environments, without commanding them...|$|R
40|$|While confessions are a {{powerful}} form of evidence, innocent people sometimes confess to crimes {{they did not}} commit. Many researchers have studied false confessions through laboratory experiments with university students or by focusing on proven cases of false confession. These approaches have led many researchers to form a conceptual framework that law enforcement <b>interrogative</b> <b>methods</b> are a key cause of false confessions. A gap exists in the literature as few researchers have queried law enforcement about false confessions or consulted with officers who specialize in interrogation. For this study, a qualitative case study approach was used to explore the experiences of 13 federal law enforcement polygraph examiners who specialize in interrogation. Telephone interviews were conducted regarding their approach to criminal interrogation, their experiences with false confessions, and the circumstances when false confessions were elicited. NVivo software was used to organize the data. Common themes in interview responses were identified and reduced to a simplified format that could be understood {{in the context of}} the research questions. The themes identified that participants conduct themselves professionally, they treat criminal subjects respectfully, they avoid unethical interrogative practices, and false confessions result from individual subject characteristics and police misconduct. No participants reported eliciting a false confession. These findings suggest that false confession researchers may have a biased view of how law enforcement officers interrogate due to their overreliance on laboratory experimentation and their focus on false confession cases. This study promotes positive social change by increasing truthful confessions, decreasing false confessions, and providing a more accurate view of what occurs during real world criminal interrogations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Past {{research}} has frequently demonstrated {{the impact of}} life adversity on the behaviour and mindset of individuals. In terms of the formal police interview, the experience of negative life-events may have an effect upon interviewee performance. This study, therefore, aims to investigate how negative life-events may influence interviewee performance on the Gudjonsson suggestibility scale (GSS). Moreover, self-esteem will also be investigated in relation to both the experience of negative life-events and <b>interrogative</b> suggestibility. <b>Method.</b> Sixty participants were administered the GSS 1. In between the immediate and delayed recall phases, interviewees {{were asked to complete}} the culture-free self-esteem inventory, the life-events questionnaire and the Eysenck personality questionnaire. Results. Negative life-events (NLEs) were significantly correlated with all of the GSS suggestibility scores (yield 1, yield 2, shift and total Suggestibility). Contrary to past research, however, self-esteem scores were not significantly related to any of the GSS components or to NLE scores. Conclusion. This paper is the first to show a link between the experience of NLEs and GSS scores. The findings suggest that interviewees reporting a high number of NLEs are significantly more susceptible to the leading questions, as well as to negative feedback, administered during the GSS interview. Erroneous reports and false confessions may thus be more likely with such interviewees, potentially classifying them as vulnerable witnesses...|$|R
