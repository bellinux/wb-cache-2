40|$|Blast-associated sensory and {{cognitive}} trauma sustained by military service members {{is an area}} of extensively studied research. Recent studies in our laboratory have revealed that low-level blast exposure increased expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), proteins well characterized for their role in mediating pain transmission, in the cornea. Determining the functional consequences of these alterations in protein expression is critical to understanding blast-related sensory trauma. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine TRPV 1 and ET- 1 expression in ocular associated sensory tissues following primary and tertiary blast. A rodent model of blast injury was used in which anesthetized animals, unrestrained or restrained, received a single or repeat blast (73. 8 Â± 5. 5 kPa) from a compressed air shock tube once or daily for five consecutive days, respectively. Behavioral and functional analyses were conducted to assess blast effects on nocifensive behavior and TRPV 1 activity. Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot were also performed with trigeminal ganglia (TG) to determine TRPV 1, ET- 1 and glial fibrillary associated protein (GFAP) expression following blast. Increased TRPV 1, ET- 1 and GFAP were detected in the TG of animals <b>exposed</b> to <b>repeat</b> blast. Increased nocifensive responses were also observed in animals <b>exposed</b> to <b>repeat,</b> tertiary blast as compared to single blast and control. Moreover, decreased TRPV 1 desensitization was observed in TG neurons <b>exposed</b> to <b>repeat</b> blast.

In the present study, we examined the physiological consequences of repeated high temperature exposure with recovery periods between these stress events in Myzus persicae. We subjected individuals to either a single prolonged three hour heating event, or three one hour heating events with a recovery time of 24 h between bouts.

Recovery time had more physiological costs (based on production of more protein and consumption of more trehalose and triglyceride) and benefits (based on production of more osmolytes) in repeated high temperature treatments.
