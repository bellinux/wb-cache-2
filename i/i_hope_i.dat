5|$|<b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> {{have not}} exaggerated {{in talking about}} Liszt; he won't make me {{anything}} wonderful, so that I can come home and set the Thames on fire—not at all, so don't expect it; but—his readings or interpretations are greater and higher than anyone else's; if I can {{spend some time with}} him and go through a good deal of music with him, I shall pick up at least a great deal of his ideas;... The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed me what an immensity I might learn.|$|E
5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
25|$|The film is grandiose, horrible, showing monstrous crimes...regrettably, {{the film}} {{people here are}} putting me under {{pressure}} to finish {{the whole thing in}} ten days even though the film is barely finished. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> can get it all together. I'm living here like a monk, I go to bed at 8 in the evening, eat and drink very little and don't feel at all at ease in this giant city with all the responsibility for the film.|$|E
60|$|I drew a {{long breath}} as <b>I</b> left her. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>I</b> had hurt; <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>I</b> had humiliated her. I wished I could have thought {{of things to say}} that would have cut her to the heart. I was quite {{indifferent}} to her, but when I remembered--I hated her.|$|R

25|$|White {{decided not}} to accept any more prizes for his work, and he {{declined}} both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by Harry M. Miller {{to work on a}} screenplay for Voss but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia’s decision to participate in the Vietnam War. His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in 1971, after losing to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he wrote to a friend: That Nobel Prize! <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> never hear it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind it seems a bit dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards. In my case to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I feel I am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner.|$|E

500|$|Cameron {{calls the}} {{connection}} a [...] "subconscious" [...] reference: [...] "I have just loved... the mythology, the entire Hindu pantheon, seems so rich and vivid." [...] He continued, [...] "I didn't want to reference the Hindu religion so closely, but the subconscious association was interesting, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> haven't offended anyone in doing so." [...] He {{has stated that}} he was familiar {{with a lot of}} beliefs of the Hindu religion and found it [...] "quite fascinating".|$|E

500|$|There is also {{debate over}} whether or not a-consciousness and p-consciousness always co-exist or if they can exist separately. [...] Although p-consciousness without a-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some {{hypothetical}} examples of A without P. Block for instance suggests the case of a “zombie” that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding [...] "I don’t know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> have illustrated their conceptual possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|Duff {{explained}} of the album's title, [...] "I'm {{older and}} more mature now than I was when I made my last record, but I don't think I know it all. Having dignity is something you work on your whole life, in how you treat people and how you treat yourself. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> always strive to have it." [...] She continued, [...] "It's not {{something that you can}} be given or that you can just get or that you're born with. It's something that you have to work on." ...|$|E
500|$|Song said in 2005, [...] "Besides Hollywood grand-openings and award shows, I try to {{stay away}} from the parties. It's so easy to be swept away from that whole scene because it's {{expected}} of you. I've never drank or smoked in my entire life, but I've seen 15-year-olds drinking and smoking and I just think that's gross." [...] On being a young role model to kids, Song said: [...] "Oh goodness, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> can set a good example. If I can do it, anyone can. I'm living my dream every single day." ...|$|E

500|$|Bride {{heard the}} band playing {{as he left}} the radio cabin, which was by now awash, in the company of the other radio operator, Jack Phillips. He had just had a fight with a man who Bride thought was [...] "a stoker, or someone from below decks", who had {{attempted}} to steal Phillips' lifebelt. Bride wrote later: [...] "I did my duty. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> finished [...] I don't know. We left him on the cabin floor of the radio room, and he was not moving." [...] The two radio operators went in opposite directions, Phillips aft and Bride forward towards collapsible lifeboat B.|$|E
500|$|The attempt failed; Little Juniata [...] faced {{extreme weather}} conditions, {{and was forced}} to retreat a few miles from Cape York. [...] De Long {{returned}} to Juniata [...] in mid-August, having found no trace of the Polaris [...] crew (who had meanwhile been rescued by the Scottish whaler Ravenscraig), but the experience had profoundly affected his outlook. Having earlier described the Greenland coast {{in a letter to his}} wife Emma as [...] "a dreary land of desolation... <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place", he returned home captivated by the Arctic. Emma later wrote: [...] "The polar virus [...] was in his blood and would not let him rest".|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Getzlaf {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Mark Messier Leadership Award along with Calgary Flames defencemen Mark Giordano and Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno. In the 2017 playoffs, Getzlaf surpassed former {{teammate}} Teemu Selänne's franchise record of 35 playoff goals against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 of the best of seven series. During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to insult an on-ice official. He later said, [...] "That's my responsibility to understand that there are eyes and ears on us all the time. Fortunately enough, nobody heard it. If you can read lips, it's a little bit harder, and I apologize for that. That's a thing that you won't hear from me again. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> didn't offend anybody outside the circle that we trust." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1932 Gielgud {{turned to}} directing. At the {{invitation}} of George Devine, {{the president of the}} Oxford University Dramatic Society, Gielgud took charge of a production of Romeo and Juliet by the society, featuring two guest stars: Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet and Edith Evans as the Nurse. The rest of the cast were students, led by Christopher Hassall as Romeo, and included Devine, William Devlin and Terence Rattigan. The experience was satisfactory to Gielgud: he enjoyed the attentions of the undergraduates, had a brief affair with one of them, James Lees-Milne, and was widely praised for his inspiring direction and his protégés' success with the play. Already notorious for his innocent slips of the tongue (he called them [...] "Gielgoofs"), in a speech after the final performance he referred to Ashcroft and Evans as [...] "Two leading ladies, the like of whom <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> shall never meet again." ...|$|E
500|$|Spain's first match during {{qualification}} for the 2010 World Cup {{was against}} Bosnia and Herzegovina where Villa scored the only {{goal of the}} game. He {{would go on to}} score four goals in Spain's next three games, including a last minute winner against Belgium. Another goal during a friendly match against Chile saw him end the year with 12 goals, breaking Raúl's record of 10 goals held since 1999. Villa began 2009 with a goal against England in a 2–0 friendly, with this goal, he broke another record and became the first Spanish international to have scored in six consecutive games, seeing off records set by Telmo Zarra and László Kubala. Speaking of the goal, he said, [...] "I am very happy with the goal. Truth is, I really want to see it on TV. The record is very nice. I would never have imagined in years that I would be able to obtain it. I am very proud and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> can continue breaking records." ...|$|E
500|$|When he {{returned}} to the Tigers for spring training in 1952, Tigers' manager Red Rolfe noted, [...] "Artie could be our best pitcher. He's the slump-breaking type, a guy who can throw a shutout once in a while". After a poor season without Houtteman in 1951, Rolfe predicted, [...] "We'll be back in the first division this season because Art Houtteman is back. Houtteman makes us at least a dozen games better than [...] ". Houtteman worked out in Detroit with pitcher Ted Gray over the winter before the 1952 season. Before the season started, Houtteman said, [...] "It all depends on how I get off. I'm anxious to get into the season. My arm doesn't feel any different than it did in '50. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> can do even better than my last year". Houtteman also took number21 on his uniform, the number he had when he first arrived with the Tigers, because he felt that it had given both him and teammate George Kell, who won a batting title with the number, good luck.|$|E
60|$|LESLIE. And be a {{politician}} like the Deacon! All in good time, but not now. I hearkened while I could, and when I {{could no more}} I slipped out and followed my heart. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>I</b> should be welcome.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{will not}} mind this sombre light," [...] said Dorothea, {{standing}} in the middle of the room. [...] "Since you forbade books, the library has been out of the question. But Mr. Casaubon will soon be here again, <b>I</b> <b>hope.</b> <b>Is</b> he not making progress?" ...|$|R
500|$|The series {{introduced}} a new incarnation of the Doctor, the Eleventh, played by Matt Smith. This followed the departure of David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, who left the role to help ease the transition from Davies to Moffat's showrunning. Smith's agent had called him and suggested that he try out for the role. Moffat was looking to cast a middle-aged actor, who was [...] "young enough to run but old enough to look wise". However, Smith, who was only 26 when cast, was the third person to audition and the production team knew [...] " [...] had their man". The producers were cautious about casting Smith because they felt that a 26-year-old actor could not play the Doctor adequately; BBC Head of Drama and executive producer Piers Wenger shared the sentiment, but noted that Smith was capable enough to play the role. Moffat also stated that Smith {{did not appear to}} be youthful at all. [...] Smith's casting in the role was revealed during an episode of Doctor Whos companion show Doctor Who Confidential, during which he described the role as [...] "a wonderful privilege and challenge that <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> will thrive on".|$|E
500|$|Lee later lamented: [...] "Malaysia — to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, {{sitting in}} this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian. This is the doubt that hangs over many minds, and ... {{emotions}} are set in motion, and men pitted against men along these unspoken lines, you will {{have the kind of}} warfare that will split the nation from top to bottom and undo Malaysia." [...] At times, however, Lee worsened things by making racial comments of his own. Many of his speeches harped on the ethnic composition of Malaysia, reminding listeners that the non-Malays were now in the majority, with 61% of the population to the Malays' 39% asking at one point, [...] "Why should we go back to old Singapore and once again reduce the non-Malays in Malaya to a minority?" [...] Lee exacerbated deteriorating PAP-UMNO relations by constantly demanding that the federal government [...] "smack down their 'ultras'", whose ranks included prominent UMNO leaders such as Syed Jaafar Albar and Syed Nasir Ismail.|$|E
500|$|Cornwallis {{believed}} that the terms of union should include Catholic emancipation. [...] While some rights had been restored in the early 1790s, Catholics were still denied elective offices and other rights. [...] Almost everyone in the establishments of Dublin and London, including the king and much of Pitt's cabinet, opposed this, leading Cornwallis to write that [...] "some mode must be adopted to soften the hatred of the Catholics to our government". In {{a letter to the}} Home Secretary he wrote, [...] "I trust that your grace and His Majesty's other ministers will on no account consent to the insertion of any clause which shall unalterably bind the United Parliament to persevere in the exclusion of Catholics." [...] Protestants, including the Lord Chancellor, Lord Clare, who favoured union, opposed Catholic emancipation. [...] "I trust, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> am not deceived, that they are fairly inclined to give them up, and to bring [...] forward unencumbered with the doctrine of emancipation." [...] King George, after Cornwallis' appointment, wrote to Pitt that [...] "Cornwallis must clearly understand that no indulgence can be granted to the Catholics farther than has been". Cornwallis' efforts to include support for emancipation clearly had negative repercussions. [...] One Protestant wrote, [...] "his silly conduct, his total incapacity, and self conceit and mulishness have alone lost the question [...] ", while another wrote to Castlereagh that Cornwallis had been rendered [...] "not only an object of disgust, but of abhorrence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Captain," [...] said Mrs. Flanders, {{bursting}} into the drawing-room, [...] "I {{had to run}} after Barker's man... <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> Rebecca... <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> Jacob..." ...|$|R

6000|$|His {{conscious}} honest {{eyes looked}} away an instant. [...] "It's perhaps {{enough for the}} present that you're cleverer than I! I was very glad the other day," [...] he continued, [...] "to make the acquaintance of your daughter. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>I</b> should find her with you." ...|$|R
