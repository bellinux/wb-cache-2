5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Edge and Randy Orton. Edge took early {{control of the}} match by driving Orton into the {{barricade}} outside the ring. Orton was able to recover, and performed a rope hung DDT on Edge. While setting up for his finishing move, the RKO, Orton appeared to injure his arm, and went outside the ring {{in an attempt to}} recover. Edge followed <b>him,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> perform the spear, but Orton was able to avoid it, and Edge hit the barricade. Neither man was able to return to the ring before the count of ten, and as a result, the match ended in a double countout.|$|E

In an effort to open up to him, she confesses that she played a role in the death of their {{neighbour}} Aynsley, and is shocked when Donnie responds by confessing that he accidentally shot and killed Dr. Aldous Leekie, the director of the Dyad Institute, the night before.

Steph becomes friends with Niall, who fell for her, although she saw him more as someone to confide her problems in. Max began to see Steph as selfish and only interested in her career and money, which led to several arguments between the pair. One day, he caught her alone with Niall, wearing only a shirt. She'd spilled something on her dress, but he assumed the worst and they broke up. A few days later {{she went back to}} Niall's place and they kissed, but were interrupted by his room-mate.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to several}} rain showers between {{first and second}} practice, the track was again wet during the second session, which limited the drivers to using the {{intermediate}} tyres only. Hamilton was again fastest, setting a time of 1:38.841. Teammate Rosberg crashed at turn seven thirty minutes into the session, damaging a new-specification front wing that the team had deliberately not run in first practice for fear of damage. Rosberg later apologised for the incident, which saw <b>him</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get back to pit lane, before his team told him to stop on track, calling an early end to his session. Nico Hülkenberg, Räikkönen, Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz Jr. all finished within one second of Hamilton's time, while Sergio Pérez was at one point {{on his way to}} a new fastest time overall, setting best times in the first two timechecks along the track, before having to slow in the last part of the lap due to heavy rain. The two Manor drivers Pascal Wehrlein and Haryanto covered the highest number of laps, with 24 and 22 laps in 12th and 14th place respectively. Neither Renault nor Williams drivers set a time, albeit going on track. The Sauber cars and Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso did not leave the garage at all during the session.|$|E

25|$|The two {{vehicles}} {{with the group}} of whites pulled off the freeway and into the motel parking lot. The group said they believed that Anderson was trying to steal a vehicle because they saw <b>him</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> break into one. The vehicle was Anderson's own; {{he had lost his}} keys. The group repeatedly beat Anderson and robbed him, the district attorney said, citing reports from witnesses. Video from a motel security camera shows the perpetrators entering and leaving the picture frame; it did not capture the beating. One witness reported that one of the perpetrators yelled, “white power,” when returning to his truck after the beating.|$|E
25|$|Akbar-Birbal folk tales {{were passed}} on mainly by oral tradition. They {{focus on how}} Birbal manages to outsmart envious courtiers who try to trap and portray him in poor light in front of Akbar, often in a humorous manner with him shown giving sharp and {{intelligent}} responses. Others show his interactions with the Emperor which involve <b>him</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> test Birbal's wit and Birbal making him realise his folly, which always ends with Akbar getting amused and impressed. He occasionally challenges Birbal by giving him a line of poetry which Birbal has to complete. Some of the other stories are simple humorous anecdotes. Getting an advantage in a seemingly impossible situation and making his challengers look silly are usual occurrences in these tales.|$|E

Dr. Welner stated that [...] "These videos do not help us understand Cho. They distort him. He was meek. He was quiet.

His father was [...] "a dissolute former MP, living {{beyond the bounds of}} respectable society, and... his mother [...] born of the self-promoting Paget family".

He is also [...] "a scoundrel, a drunk, a liar, a cheat [...] a braggart", who was described by Fraser as [...] "an unrepentant old cad" [...] whose only positive features are [...] "humour and shameless honesty as a memorialist".|$|E
500|$|A {{couple of}} weeks after her trial, Clark pressed charges of false arrest against the officer who had arrested her. The next day, the officer {{physically}} attacked Clark {{in the presence of}} witnesses for having brought charges against him. [...] Crane, who initially went briefly to Philadelphia to escape the pressure of publicity, returned to New York to give testimony at Becker's trial despite advice given to him from Theodore Roosevelt, who was Police Commissioner at the time and a new acquaintance of Crane. [...] The defense targeted Crane: police raided his apartment and interviewed people who knew <b>him,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find incriminating evidence in order to lessen the effect of his testimony. A vigorous cross-examination took place that sought to portray Crane as a man of dubious morals; while the prosecution proved that he frequented brothels, Crane claimed this was merely for research purposes. After the trial ended on October 16, the arresting officer was exonerated, and Crane's reputation was ruined.|$|E

500|$|It {{seems clear}} that, {{towards the end}} of the decade, Themistocles had begun to accrue enemies, and had become arrogant; {{moreover}} his fellow citizens had become jealous of his prestige and power. The Rhodian poet Timocreon was among his most eloquent enemies, composing slanderous drinking songs. Meanwhile, the Spartans actively worked against <b>him,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> promote Cimon (son of Miltiades) as a rival to Themistocles. Furthermore, after the treason and disgrace of the Spartan general Pausanias, the Spartans tried to implicate Themistocles in the plot; he was, however, acquitted of these charges. In Athens itself, he lost favour by building a sanctuary of Artemis, with the epithet Aristoboulẽ ("of good counsel") near his home, a blatant reference to his own role in delivering Greece from the Persian invasion. Eventually, in either 472 or 471BC, he was ostracised. In itself, this did not mean that Themistocles had done anything wrong; ostracism, in the words of Plutarch, [...] "was not a penalty, but a way of pacifying and alleviating that jealousy which delights to humble the eminent, breathing out its malice into this disfranchisement." ...|$|E

Later, she plays a sudoku game on a computer however her boyfriend makes her leave.

The following day, they start following the recently-arrived couple, and at night, in the hotel restaurant, Ellis-Bextor manages to steal the couple's room key and breaks into the room. She steals money from a safe in the room, while in the restaurant, her boyfriend looks at the other couple repeatedly. She and her boyfriend pack and leave the hotel, and the latter gets angry when he learns that Ellis-Bextor has stolen from the couple. She decides to abandon their car, and, seemingly angry as well, goes near a cliff. The visual ends with <b>him</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> comfort Ellis-Bextor, hugging her.|$|E

[...] "He accepts his injury, he accepts his compromised status in society ... Peggy says, 'Forget this. I'm Peggy Carter. I'm going to do something else.' I think that's the difference between the two of them." [...] Considering a potentially romantic relationship between Sousa and Carter, Gjokaj said, [...] "I think there’s definitely a situation where … if she hadn't dated Captain America, he might ask her out for a drink. It’s like if your new girlfriend dated Ryan Gosling. It’s going to make you sweat a bit." [...] For the second season, Gjokaj said, [...] "you’ll see him deal with actually being part of the machine. Not trying to get [...] the machine, but being the boss. The first season was <b>him</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> be listened to, and now he’s being listened to by a lot of people."
