40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to determine the potential of two avermectin compounds, abamectin and emamectin benzoate, <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> plant-parasitic nematodes when applied by three methods: foliar spray, root dip, and pseudostem injection. Experiments {{were conducted}} against Meloidogyne incognita on tomato, M. javanica on banana, and Radopholus similis on banana. Foliar applications of both avermectins to banana and tomato were not effective <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> any of the nematodes evaluated. Root dips of banana and tomato were moderately effective <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> M. incognita on tomato and R. similis on banana. Injections (1 ml) of avermectins into banana pseudostems were effective <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> M. javanica and R similis, and were comparable to control achieved with a conventional chemical nematicide, fenamiphos. Injections of 125 to 2, 000 μg/plant effectively controlled one or both nematodes on banana; abamectin was more effective than emamectin benzoate <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> nematodes...|$|R

5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. <b>For</b> <b>control,</b> the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes <b>for</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
