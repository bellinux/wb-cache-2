5|$|By August 1944, Turkey {{broke off}} {{relations}} with Germany, as defeat {{began to seem}} <b>inevitable.</b> In February 1945, it declared war on Germany and Japan, a symbolic move that allowed Turkey to join the emerging United Nations.|$|E
5|$|In Abels' view, Æthelred's sons {{attempted}} to shame Alfred into handing over the lands they claimed {{so as to}} strengthen {{their position in the}} <b>inevitable</b> battle that would break out over the succession when Alfred died, and the Langandene assembly was Alfred's riposte.|$|E
5|$|To most a monarch was God's earthly representative, {{chosen by}} Him {{for the benefit}} of His people. For men to meddle in that choice was to tamper with the divine order, the <b>inevitable</b> price of which was chaos.|$|E
5|$|Although Watership Down is a {{peaceful}} habitat, Hazel realizes {{there are no}} does (female rabbits), thus making {{the future of the}} warren certain to end with the <b>inevitable</b> death of the rabbits present. With the help of their useful new friend, a black-headed gull named Kehaar, they locate a nearby warren called Efrafa, which is overcrowded and has many does. Hazel sends a small embassy, led by Holly, to Efrafa to present their request for does.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment <b>inevitable,</b> but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|As {{the chief}} {{parliamentary}} spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown {{when he was}} reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert bowed to the <b>inevitable.</b> On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations {{for the sale of}} his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{education}} {{was the product}} of an ancient Greek educational tradition that stretched back to the 5th century BC. It comprised a tripartite system of education that, taking shape during the Hellenistic era, was maintained, with <b>inevitable</b> changes, up until the fall of Constantinople. The stages of education were the elementary school, where pupils ranged from six to ten years, secondary school, where pupils ranged from ten to sixteen, and higher education.|$|E
5|$|Circumstances changed {{suddenly}} when Henry died on 6 June 1217 {{after receiving}} a head wound from a tile which came loose while he was playing with other children at the palace of the Bishop of Palencia. His guardian, Count Álvaro Núñez de Lara, tried to hide the fact, taking the king's body to the castle of Tariego, although it was <b>inevitable</b> that the news would reach Berengaria.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are <b>inevitable.</b> Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is <b>inevitable.</b> These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at the OMSF, Shea helped to resolve {{many of the other}} <b>inevitable</b> {{engineering}} debates and conflicts that cropped up during the development of the Apollo spacecraft. In May 1963, he formed a Panel Review Board, bringing together representatives of the many committees that aimed to coordinate work between NASA centers. Under Shea's leadership, this coordination became far more efficient.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{literary}} and theatrical {{activities of the}} Round Table members, it was perhaps <b>inevitable</b> that they would write and stage their own revue. No Sirree!, staged for one night only in April 1922, was a take-off of a then-popular European touring revue called La Chauve-Souris, directed by Nikita Balieff.|$|E
5|$|Henderson and JPL {{director}} Bruce Ng {{prepare a}} space probe to deliver {{enough food to}} last Watney until Ares IV's arrival. When the Hab's airlock malfunctions due to a small puncture, it destroys Watney's crops. Sanders orders the team {{to speed up the}} supply mission with the Iris probe by skipping the safety inspections. However, an oversight causes the destabilization and subsequent explosion of the rocket 40 seconds after liftoff, causing Watney to think about his seemingly <b>inevitable</b> death.|$|E
5|$|Images of meth mouth {{are usually}} {{considered}} disturbing {{and have been}} used in anti-drug campaigns, even being placed on hoardings/billboards. The condition is often mentioned in media coverage of methamphetamine, and it has been included in media portrayals of drug abuse to demonstrate the scope of the drug's effects or to provoke disgust in the audience. Opponents argue that the term is used to negatively stereotype methamphetamine users, and that it is falsely portrayed as <b>inevitable</b> or characteristic.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 he {{returned}} to Germany {{as a member of}} the International Force supervising the Saarland plebiscite. Afterwards, he joined the German Intelligence Section at the War Office. In 1937 he became Assistant Military attaché in Berlin to Noel Mason-Macfarlane. As such, Strong got to know many senior German military officers personally, including Wilhelm Keitel. Like Mason-Macfarlane, he became convinced that war with Germany was imminent and <b>inevitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|In harmony it {{is often}} better {{for the sake of}} {{consistency}} to maintain a whole succession of clusters, once they are begun; since one alone, or even two, may be heard as a mere effect, rather than as an independent and significant procedure, carried with musical logic to its <b>inevitable</b> conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} his {{athletic}} record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired {{a reputation as a}} clumsy, likable, and simple-minded Everyman. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by Chevy Chase, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Pieces of Ford's common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford's <b>inevitable</b> comparison to Nixon, as well as his perceived Midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, biographers {{began writing}} about Lenin {{soon after his}} death; some – like Christopher Hill – were {{sympathetic}} to him, and others – like Richard Pipes and Robert Gellately – expressly hostile. Some later biographers, such as Read and Lars Lih, sought to avoid making either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes. Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions. The Soviet view characterised {{him as a man}} who recognised the historically <b>inevitable</b> and accordingly helped to make the <b>inevitable</b> happen. Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived him as a person who manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies. More recently, revisionists in both Russia and the West have highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.|$|E
5|$|It was <b>inevitable...</b> On {{one hand}} our stubbornness has paid off, {{but on the}} other hand refusing to buy into the way things are {{traditionally}} supposed to be done has made things worse for us... The realistic part is it hasn't proved to be a huge money-making venture for a lot of guys in the band.|$|E
5|$|Less {{successful}} at first were {{the efforts of}} the American battleships to match their British counterparts in excellence of gunnery. Having provided numerous veteran gun-crews to serve aboard armed merchantmen in the previous months, the gunnery complements of Division Nine were badly depleted and filled with inexperienced officers and recent recruits. The <b>inevitable</b> effect of this loss of talent became apparent when, on 17 December 1917, Battleship Division Nine conducted its first full-caliber target practice in nearby Pentland Firth.|$|E
5|$|Morton also {{believed}} that war was <b>inevitable</b> and began to prepare the state for its outbreak during his early tenure as governor. Morton appointed men to positions in state government who opposed any compromise with the southern states. He also established without legislative permission a state arsenal, where up to 700 men produced ammunition, and made many other preparations for the impending war.|$|E
5|$|Nine Inch Nails {{frontman}} Trent Reznor {{announced in}} 2007 that the band had completed its contractual obligations to its record label, Interscope Records, and {{would no longer}} be working with the company. He also revealed that the band would likely distribute its next album independently, possibly in a fashion similar to Saul Williams' 2007 album The <b>Inevitable</b> Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!, which Reznor produced.|$|E
5|$|Pre-Code female audiences {{liked to}} indulge in the carnal lifestyles of mistresses and adulteresses {{while at the same}} time taking joy in their usually <b>inevitable</b> {{downfall}} in the closing scenes of the picture. While gangster films were claimed to corrupt the morals of young boys, vice films were blamed for threatening the purity of adolescent women.|$|E
5|$|Since {{electrical}} energy cannot easily {{be stored in}} quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against <b>inevitable</b> disturbances and losses.|$|E
5|$|Soon Vladimir Bukovsky {{was again}} out of favour with the Russian authorities. He {{supported}} Yeltsin against the Supreme Soviet in the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis in October that year but criticised the new Constitution of Russia approved two months later, as being {{designed to ensure}} a continuation of Yeltsin's power. According to Bukovsky, Yeltsin became a hostage of the security agencies from 1994 onwards, and a restoration of KGB rule was <b>inevitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|That morning Burke and {{the other}} ships in the Mindoro-bound TG 77.11 (under the command of Captain George F. Mentz) were at general {{quarters}} shortly after receiving the dawn weather report that reported that air cover would not launch until the poor weather cleared. The crews began their wait for the <b>inevitable</b> arrival of Japanese aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Velvet Underground & Nico is {{the debut}} album by American rock band the Velvet Underground, {{released}} in March 1967 by Verve Records. Accompanied by vocalist Nico, {{the album was}} recorded in 1966 while the group were featured on Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic <b>Inevitable</b> multimedia event tour, which gained attention for its experimental performance sensibilities and controversial lyrical topics, including drug abuse, prostitution, sadomasochism and sexual deviancy.|$|E
5|$|The ZX80 was an {{immediate}} success, selling 20,000 units over the following nine months. Science of Cambridge was producing ZX80s {{at the rate of}} 9,000 a month by the end of 1980 and within 18 months of its launch the company had sold 100,000 units. The commercial success of the ZX80 made a follow-up product <b>inevitable.</b> The company was renamed Sinclair Computers in November 1980, reflecting its new focus, and became Sinclair Research in March 1981.|$|E
5|$|The <b>inevitable</b> {{consequence}} of demands for ever greater speed, striking power, and endurance meant that displacement, and hence cost, of dreadnoughts tended to increase. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 imposed {{a limit of}} 35,000 tons on the displacement of capital ships. In subsequent years treaty battleships were commissioned to build up to this limit. Japan's decision to leave the Treaty in the 1930s, {{and the arrival of}} the Second World War, eventually made this limit irrelevant.|$|E
5|$|Their {{early career}} {{attracted}} much publicity, with each divisional promotion regarded {{by the media}} {{as part of an}} <b>inevitable</b> rise to the top ranks. Takahanada's progress was rapid and he set numerous age-related records, including the youngest ever makushita division tournament champion (16years 9months), youngest ever promoted to the second highest jūryō division (17years 3months), and the youngest ever promoted to the top makuuchi division (17years 8months).|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many parts}} of South Africa, {{conflict}} was an element largely absent from Jan Smuts's early life. Whether conflict between Briton and Boer, or conflict between Black and White — it had been many years since the farmers of the Swartland had {{had to deal with}} turmoil on their doorsteps. The absence of conflict, along with its <b>inevitable</b> counterpart, development of prejudice, had its effect upon Smuts.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{official}} Belgian {{withdrawal from the}} Western Alliance, the Belgians refused to engage in any official staff meetings with the French or British military staff for fear of compromising its neutrality. The Belgians did not regard a German invasion as <b>inevitable</b> and were determined that if an invasion did take place it would be effectively resisted by new fortifications such as Eben Emael.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the <b>inevitable</b> change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E
5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an <b>inevitable</b> compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|E
5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in Europe {{was much more}} vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as <b>inevitable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the <b>inevitable</b> fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned the theme of the crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|As Naiad, Triton and Alcmene {{streamed}} past {{in pursuit}} of Santa Brigida, Young focused his attention on Thetis, coming within range at 11:30. Mendoza, seeing that battle was <b>inevitable,</b> bore up across Ethalions bows {{in an effort to}} rake Young's ship. Young turned in order to thwart the manoeuvre and fired two rapid broadsides into Thetis, which responded in kind. For an hour the frigates exchanged running fire until Mendoza, realising escape was impossible, surrendered. Thetis had lost one man killed and nine wounded in the exchange while Ethalion had suffered no casualties.|$|E
