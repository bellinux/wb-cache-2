Hummus is often slathered in olive oil and sometimes sprinkled with paprika, oregano and pine nuts; the latter are especially popular in the West Bank. Chick peas are also mixed with ful (fava beans), resulting <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> dish, mukhluta, with a distinct flavor and brownish color.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of writing}} has made {{language}} even {{more useful to}} humans. It {{makes it possible to}} store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E
5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and in the choir of York.|$|E

To escape the teleportation chamber, Shephard is forced to enter a separate portal, briefly taking him to Xen before depositing him <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> area of the facility. The facility is now heavily damaged, and it soon becomes clear that a new alien race, Race X, has exploited the situation to mount a localized invasion, attacking both human and Xen forces in Black Mesa indiscriminately. Fighting between the black operations units and Race X quickly intensifies.|$|E

25|$|While Shakespeare closely {{followed}} Cinthio's tale in composing Othello, he departed {{from it in}} some details. In Cinthio's tale, for example, the ensign suffers an unrequited lust for the Moor's wife, Desdemona, which then drives his vengeance. Desdemona dies <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> manner in Cinthio's tale; the Moor commissions his ensign to bludgeon her {{to death with a}} sand-filled stocking.

She then cast a spell of enchanted sleep upon herself to await someone who could rescue her from Charn.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, a {{fractional}} Brownian motion (fBm) is a Gaussian stochastic process, which varies pointedly from semimartingales {{and a standard}} Brownian motion to other processes usually utilized {{in the theory of}} stochastic processes. An fBm depends on the Hurst index H ∈ (0, 1), the parameter introduced by Kolmogorov [19]. We refer to [20] for more detail on fBm. As a centered Gaussian process, it is examined by its stationary increments and the medium- or long-memory property. The fBm reduces to standard Brownian motion when H= 1 / 2. However, when H≠ 1 / 2, the fBm acts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> way, that is, it is neither a Markov process nor a semimartingale. Recently, the theory of differential equations driven by an fBm has been investigated intensively by many researchers (see [21 – 29] and references therein).|$|R

25|$|The {{important}} role of language, however, {{is not confined to}} the taming plot. For example, in a psychoanalytic reading of the play, Joel Fineman suggests there is a distinction made between male and female language, further subcategorising the latter into good and bad, epitomised by Bianca and Katherina respectively. Language is also important in relation to the Induction. Here, Sly speaks in prose until he begins to accept his new role as lord, at which point he switches to blank verse and adopts the royal we. Language is also important in relation to Tranio and Lucentio, who appear on stage speaking a highly artificial style of blank verse full of classical and mythological allusions and elaborate metaphors and similes, thus immediately setting them aside from the more straightforward language of the Induction, and alerting the audience {{to the fact that they}} are now <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> milieu.|$|E
25|$|This {{practice}} {{is believed to}} have been passed down through the centuries from the Apostles, with different practices developing in different places. As Christian monasticism spread, the practice of specified hours and liturgical formats began to develop and become standardized. Around the year 484, the Greek-Cappadocian monk Sabbas the Sanctified began the process of recording the liturgical practices around Jerusalem while the cathedral and parish rites in the Patriarchate of Constantinople evolved <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> manner; the two were synthesized commencing in the eighth century to yield an office of great complexity. In 525, Benedict of Nursia set out one of the earliest schemes for the recitation of the Psalter at the Office. With the Cluniac Reforms of the 11th century, there was a new emphasis on liturgy and the canonical hours in the reformed priories of the Order of Saint Benedict, with Cluny Abbey at their head.|$|E
500|$|When Kosygin told Brezhnev that it {{was time}} to {{reconcile}} with the PRC, Brezhnev replied: [...] "If you think this is necessary, then you go by yourself". Kosygin was afraid that the PRC would turn down his proposal for a visit, so he decided to stop off in Beijing on his way to Vietnamese Communist leaders in Hanoi on 5 February 1965; there he met with Zhou. The two were able to solve smaller issues, agreeing to increase trade between the countries, as well as celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Sino-Soviet alliance. Kosygin was told that a reconciliation between the two countries might take years, and that rapprochement could occur only gradually. In his report to the Soviet leadership, Kosygin noted Zhou's moderate stance against the USSR, and believed he was open for serious talks about Sino-Soviet relations. After his visit to Hanoi, Kosygin returned to Beijing on 10 February, this time to meet Mao Zedong personally. At first Mao refused to meet Kosygin, but eventually agreed and the two met on 11 February. His meeting with Mao was <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> tone to the previous meeting with Zhou. Mao criticized Kosygin, and the Soviet leadership, of revisionist behavior. He also continued to criticize Khrushchev's earlier policies. This meeting was to become Mao's last meeting with any Soviet leader.|$|E

2500|$|Leibniz then {{enrolled}} in the University of Altdorf and quickly submitted a thesis, which he had probably been working on earlier in Leipzig.

Leibniz earned his license to practice law and his Doctorate in Law in November 1666.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to prove that in writing the Faerie Queene, Spenser was {{deliberately}} following in the footsteps of the earlier Italian and English writers of courtesy books. Although Spenser presented the Faerie Queene <b>in</b> <b>a</b> style <b>entirely</b> <b>different</b> from that of courtesy books such as The Courtier, The Civile Conversation, and Galateo, his purpose was the same. With the decline of chivalry and the disappearance of the Medieval Court, courtesy, as Spenser portrayed it, was outmoded.
