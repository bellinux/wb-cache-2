5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, <b>her</b> <b>nostrils</b> twitching, when she {{caught a whiff of}} her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E
2500|$|The success hasn't {{made life}} in the theatre any easier for Vertinskaya. She remembered how in Sovremennik (after Ophelia made her known internationally) she was shifted back to the mass scenes. Yevgeny Yevstigneev complained bitterly because the moment he (as the King in The Naked King) stepped on stage the {{audience}} responded in a hushed collective whisper: [...] "Look over there, it's Vertinskaya in the crowd!" [...] Occasionally, Vertinskaya remembered, she had to artificially [...] "simplify" [...] her facial features (even to stuff <b>her</b> <b>nostrils)</b> so as to fit the Soviet [...] "common heroine" [...] stereotype. [...] "In those times, they demanded {{a different kind of}} heroine: ruddy-faced cheerful 'activistkas'", â€“ the actress responded when asked about huge gaps in her working schedule in the early 1970s.|$|E
60|$|Sandra {{opened her}} eyes very slightly. Possibly <b>her</b> <b>nostrils</b> {{expanded}} a little too.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Conroy did not pout {{as another}} woman might have done. She only smiled a haggard smile that deepened {{the line of}} <b>her</b> <b>nostril</b> into <b>her</b> cheek, and pinched her thin, {{straight}} nose. Then she said, looking at the fire-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, why didn't you let"--She stopped herself quickly, {{but could}} not stop the fierce glint in her eye nor the sharp curve in <b>her</b> <b>nostril.</b> Luckily, Leonidas did not see this, being preoccupied with his other graceful charmer, William Henry.|$|R
60|$|At {{the exact}} moment that it began to catch fire, she opened her eyes, raised her hand and, with two dainty fingers, had taken the burning scrap of paper from the young man's hand. Then she blew out the flame, and held the paper to <b>her</b> <b>nostril</b> with perfect unconcern.|$|R
60|$|ZOE: (Spouts walrus smoke through <b>her</b> <b>nostrils)</b> He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.|$|E
60|$|Shirley leaned {{forwards}} on the table, <b>her</b> <b>nostrils</b> dilating a little, her taper fingers interlaced and compressing {{each other}} hard.|$|E
60|$|She arose with catlike {{ease and}} suddenness to her full height, her eyes flashing, <b>her</b> <b>nostrils</b> quivering like a deer's.|$|E
60|$|No book, no work, no {{occupation}} {{of any kind}} but her own thought, beguiled the tardy time. Some purpose, strong enough to fill up any pause, possessed her. With her lips pressed together, and quivering if {{for a moment she}} released them from her control; with <b>her</b> <b>nostril</b> inflated; <b>her</b> hands clasped in one another; and her purpose swelling in her breast; she sat, and waited.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Duncan with {{a roll of}} {{cheesecloth}} held by {{her mouth}} and poked in <b>her</b> right <b>nostril.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} her. She {{was dressed in}} a wool jacket and boots, her hands in her pockets. A cloud of steam came from <b>her</b> mouth and <b>nostrils.</b> <b>Her</b> breast was rising and falling.|$|R
60|$|Glancing behind her, Lysbeth saw the {{creature}} nip <b>her</b> <b>nostrils</b> with her fingers, {{as though to}} shut out an evil smell.|$|E
60|$|She {{made another}} discovery. Ever {{since she had}} entered the forest she had become aware of a {{fullness}} in her head and a something affecting <b>her</b> <b>nostrils.</b> She imagined, with regret, that she had taken cold. But presently her head cleared somewhat and {{she realized that the}} thick pine odor of the forest had clogged <b>her</b> <b>nostrils</b> as if with a sweet pitch. The smell was overpowering and disagreeable because of its strength. Also her throat and lungs seemed to burn.|$|E
60|$|Shrill {{shriek of}} {{laughter}} sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss Douce huffed and snorted down <b>her</b> <b>nostrils</b> that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.|$|E
60|$|Her spoon {{ceased to}} stir up the sugar. She gazed {{straight}} before her, inhaling through <b>her</b> arched <b>nostrils.</b>|$|R
60|$|With <b>her</b> thin <b>nostrils</b> {{distended}} to this scent, Lady Casterley bore {{a distinct}} resemblance to a small, fine game-bird.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unmannerly churl!" [...] exclaimed Sybil {{starting}} in her chair, her eye flashing lightning, <b>her</b> distended <b>nostril</b> quivering with scorn.|$|R
60|$|Rhythmically, Miriam was swaying and {{stroking}} the flower with her mouth, inhaling the scent which ever after made her shudder {{as it came}} to <b>her</b> <b>nostrils.</b>|$|E
60|$|The lady rose, {{stood for}} a second with her eyebrows raised and <b>her</b> <b>nostrils</b> {{slightly}} distended, then went away, and left a peculiarly pleasant scent of violets behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a man to}} live with!" [...] sighed her ladyship, {{appealing}} to Miss Armytage. [...] "What a man!" [...] And she applied a vinaigrette delicately to <b>her</b> <b>nostrils.</b>|$|E
60|$|She looked away, {{and would}} not answer. There was a pitiful redness about <b>her</b> {{sensitive}} <b>nostrils,</b> and <b>her</b> quivering lips.|$|R
6000|$|But she {{answered}} nothing. For that last question {{she had no}} heart to answer; no heart {{to tell him that}} in her veins were some drops, at least, of the blood of slaves. Instinctively she had looked round at the mirror--for might he not, if he had eyes, discover that secret for himself? Were there not in her features traces of that taint? And as she looked,--was it the mere play of her excited fancy,--or did her eyelid slope more and more, <b>her</b> <b>nostril</b> shorten and curl, her lips enlarge, her mouth itself protrude? ...|$|R
50|$|Jennifer Kale, {{back with}} long hair and a {{prominent}} ring on <b>her</b> right <b>nostril,</b> is picked up hitchhiking by Daniel Ketch, a tool of Mephisto, and is murdered and dumped in Fresh Kills Landfill.|$|R
60|$|He went upstairs, {{and found}} Elinor, with her hat on, {{standing}} by the pianoforte, with battle in <b>her</b> <b>nostrils.</b> Mr. Lind, looking perplexed and angry, was opposite to her.|$|E
60|$|Agatha {{closed her}} lips, {{drew in a}} long breath through <b>her</b> <b>nostrils,</b> and marched to within {{a few feet of}} Miss Wilson, where she halted with her hands clasped before her.|$|E
60|$|SHE sat at {{the window}} {{watching}} the evening invade the avenue. Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in <b>her</b> <b>nostrils</b> was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{prepared}} for milk and honey," [...] said Euphrosyne, [...] "but this is too delightful," [...] as she travelled through lanes of date-bearing palm-trees, and sniffed with <b>her</b> almond-shaped <b>nostrils</b> the all-pervading fragrance.|$|R
60|$|Elsa {{stood for}} a moment quite still there in the dark, with the silence of the night and all its sweet sounds {{encompassing}} her, and the scent of withered flowers and slowly-dying leaves mounting to <b>her</b> quivering <b>nostrils.</b>|$|R
60|$|But {{she only}} turned a blighting brown {{eye on the}} culprit, curled her short lip till it almost {{vanished}} in <b>her</b> scornful <b>nostrils,</b> drew <b>her</b> skirt aside with a jerk, and continued her way straight to Jackson Wells, where she halted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha'n't touch a hair of your head!" [...] she says, and I see <b>her</b> <b>nostrils</b> {{spread and}} her eyes snap when she said it, too.|$|E
60|$|Above her, {{through the}} {{apertures}} in the tiled roof, {{she could see}} the sky aglow with lurid crimson, and the smell of burning wood and of charred stuffs filled <b>her</b> <b>nostrils</b> with their pungent odour.|$|E
6000|$|She breaks out, {{speaking}} through <b>her</b> <b>nostrils.</b> [...] "Yes, I love him, I love him. I'm {{not ashamed of}} it. What right have you to deny it me? You gave me nothing. You made me a chattel, a thing----" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{paused a}} moment, <b>her</b> {{delicate}} <b>nostrils</b> quivering, and <b>her</b> face alight with the prescience of ungarnered splendours; then like a swooping swallow flitted to where, by dead Atene, the gold circlet {{fallen from the}} Khania's hair lay upon the floor.|$|R
60|$|It {{was that}} of a lady, elegantly dressed and very handsome, whose dark proud eyes were fixed upon the ground, and in whom some passion or {{struggle}} was raging. For as she sat looking down, she held a corner of her under lip within her mouth, her bosom heaved, <b>her</b> <b>nostril</b> quivered, <b>her</b> head trembled, indignant tears were on her cheek, and her foot was set upon the moss as though she would have crushed it into nothing. And yet almost the self-same glance that showed him this, showed him the self-same lady rising with a scornful air of weariness and lassitude, and turning away with nothing expressed in face or figure but careless beauty and imperious disdain.|$|R
6000|$|The {{respiration}} {{is likewise}} affected; the chest heaves, and the dilated nostrils quiver.[5] As Tennyson writes, [...] "sharp breaths of anger puffed <b>her</b> fairy <b>nostrils</b> out." [...] Hence {{we have such}} expressions as breathing out vengeance," [...] and [...] "fuming with anger."[6] ...|$|R
