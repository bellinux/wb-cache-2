5|$|In {{order to}} meet {{production}} targets, GAF was required to complete 1.5 Hornets per month. Production fell behind schedule {{during the first half}} of 1987, however, as a result of inefficiencies at the company's factory and industrial relations problems. GAF was able to accelerate production later in the year, though some components that were planned to be manufactured in Australia were purchased <b>from</b> <b>companies</b> in the United States instead. The final cost of the Hornet project was A$4.668 billion; after adjusting for the depreciation of the Australian dollar this was $186 million less than the initial estimate.|$|E
5|$|Innovation Park and Ignition Park, dual-certified {{technology}} parks, {{have already}} attracted technology businesses to South Bend. Located {{across the street}} from the University of Notre Dame, Innovation Park was completed in 2009 and houses innovative researchers <b>from</b> <b>companies</b> and the university.

5|$|Produced by Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts brand, BK Joe was Burger King's coffee {{line that}} was first {{introduced}} in 2001 in North America and later in parts of Europe. Advertised as being made from Arabica coffee, the product was made using Douwe's Cafitesse system, a platform that eschews coffee brewed from ground beans {{in favor of a}} beverage made from a coffee concentrate with hot water added. Sara Lee claims the advantage of the system is that each cup of coffee is made at the time of order with minimal waste and labor. The product was not designed to compete with products <b>from</b> <b>companies</b> such as Starbucks, but was intended to appeal to customers who seek a consistent cup of coffee.|$|E

5|$|The NSR {{coaching}} stock was, even until grouping, predominantly four and six wheeled vehicles. Four-wheeled carriages were the norm {{from the start}} and the last were constructed in the 1880s, although by then they had progressed from the unbraked coaches of the 1840s {{with the introduction of}} the communication cord in 1869 and the simple vacuum brake in 1883. The first bogie coaches were introduced in 1906 for use on the Derby–Llandudno service and these were followed by further examples until 1923. By 1919 all carriages, except 13 four-wheelers used on miners trains, had been fitted with steam heating and a number of vehicles had been fitted with through pipes to allow use in trains equipped with Westinghouse brakes. Most carriages were constructed at Stoke but some were purchased <b>from</b> <b>companies</b> such as the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a local}} {{perception}} that Shepton Mallet has been in economic decline for some time. Some 350 manufacturing jobs {{were lost in the}} late 1990s and early years of the 21st century. However, the District Council asserts that, despite the loss of the manufacturing jobs on which Shepton Mallet has been historically dependent, more jobs in distribution, business services and public administration, health, education, quarrying, construction and hi-tech services (<b>from</b> <b>companies</b> such as the ISP Easynet) have been created, thereby creating a more balanced economy. In 2001, there were slightly more jobs in the town than economically active people, resulting in a small in-flow of workers.|$|E
