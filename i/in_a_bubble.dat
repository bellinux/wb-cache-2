5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in ambient pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E

25|$|Electronic {{paper was}} first {{developed}} in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometers across. Each sphere is a janus particle composed of negatively charged black plastic {{on one side and}} positively charged white plastic on the other (each bead is thus a dipole). The spheres are embedded in a transparent silicone sheet, with each sphere suspended <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> of oil so that they can rotate freely. The polarity of the voltage applied to each pair of electrodes then determines whether the white or black side is face-up, thus giving the pixel a white or black appearance.|$|E

Tom Kenny's character kisses Jill Talley's character's hand as the two enter the zeppelin, which was being held to the ground by people dressed as sailors using rope. The zeppelin approaches the Moon, which has a face like the Moon's face in A Trip to the Moon.

500|$|They {{considered}} {{working on}} the show {{to be similar to}} working <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bubble</b> {{due to the lack of}} interference from the Fox network's executives, as is commonplace on other shows. This allowed them to produce any episodes they wanted, as Weinstein commented: [...] "The great thing about The Simpsons is that we pretty much were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like [...] "Two Bad Neighbors" [...] and [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us." [...] Such was the network's limited input, when an executive suggested the staff introduce a new character to live with the Simpsons so as to [...] "liven up the show", the staff rejected the idea and instead created the episode [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", inserting the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who he was, or why he was living with the family, as a reference to the executive's proposal. The episode, which marked the point at which The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones for the number of episodes produced for an animated series, was named by the BBC as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show. They noted [...] "the writers used the opportunity to pay tribute to the art of animation and rail against network interference in their show." [...] The intrusion of the network censors was limited: the normal procedure is for an episode's script to be sent to the censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted, causing limited problems as often the offending lines are removed or changed for comedic purposes after animation. The episode [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] drew the censor's objections. Its script came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word [...] "gay", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that [...] "the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for broadcast". The censor problems ultimately came to nothing when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: [...] "acceptable for broadcast".|$|E
