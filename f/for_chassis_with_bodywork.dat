5000|$|The car {{features}} an {{all wheel drive}} electric drivetrain with one inboard mounted direct drive motor per wheel. It {{is based on a}} tubular spaceframe <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> <b>bodywork</b> derived from Aquila CR1 racing car. Drive eO gives the following vehicle specification: ...|$|R
50|$|Midland Electric Vehicles was a British {{manufacturer}} of milk floats and other battery electric road vehicles between 1936 and 1958. They were based in Leamington Spa, {{and one of}} their major customers was Midland Counties Dairies, to whom they supplied just the <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> <b>bodywork</b> being built by the customer. At least two of their vehicles survive in museums.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, {{the design}} of small school buses {{underwent}} evolution. As the redesigned Ford Econoline and Chevrolet G-Series/GMC Vandura were introduced, the full-size van segment saw {{the advent of a}} new type of commercial vehicle: the cutaway van chassis, a van <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> <b>bodywork</b> unfinished beyond the front seats. In the context of school bus manufacturing, this allowed practical small school buses that were no longer adapted from passenger vans or full-size SUVs.|$|R
50|$|TS11 1972-1973 F5000. Based on the TS9 with a Chevrolet engine. Gijs van Lennep won the 1972 Rothmans European Formula 5000 Championship {{driving the}} TS11 and a McLaren M18. A TS11 <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> TS8 <b>bodywork</b> was {{prepared}} to run the 1972 Tasman Series after the TS8 intended for the series was wrecked beyond repair. Hailwood {{finished second in the}} series in this car.|$|R
50|$|The {{first three}} buses were {{converted}} in 1950 at the company's workshops in Bristol using old buses acquired that {{year with the}} takeover of Cheltenham District Traction. They had AEC Regent III <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Weymann <b>bodywork.</b> Following {{the success of the}} first year's operation, four buses that were more in keeping {{with the rest of the}} local fleet were converted. These had Bristol K <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> 5-cylinder Gardner engines and Bristol bodies.|$|R
5000|$|... 1988-1993 Celica All-Trac Turbo 1988-1989 <b>for</b> ST165 <b>chassis</b> and 1990-1993 <b>for</b> ST185 <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> 4cyl turbo 1998 cc 3S-GTE ...|$|R
50|$|After {{few years}} since its launch, the chassis of the Enviro300 became {{available}} with East Lancs Esteem <b>bodywork,</b> <b>with</b> {{the first two}} for Courtney Coaches entered service in 2006. This {{is the first time}} the Enviro300 <b>chassis</b> being constructed <b>with</b> <b>bodywork</b> by another manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|The {{expanding}} trolleybus {{network in}} Perth, Western Australia, placed {{an order for}} 50 F4 vehicles in 1950/51. These were shipped to Australia as <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> <b>bodywork</b> provided on arrival. Ten of the trolleybuses carried bodies by Commonwealth Engineering of Sydney, while the remaining 40 were bodied more locally, by the bus manufacturer Boltons of West Perth. Boltons and Commonwealth Engineering formed a close working relationship during this period, with Boltons effectively working as a sub-contractor. All of the vehicles had 2-axles, with an entrance in {{the centre of the}} vehicle. A variety of configurations was available and Hull Corporation trialled a Roe-bodied Sunbeam in February 1953, which had a separate entrance and exit, and twin staircases. This reduced the seating capacity to 54, but the design, which was specified by the Transport Manager Mr G H Pulfrey, was well-received, and an order for a further 15 such vehicles was placed in April 1953. Electrical equipment was by Metro-Vick.|$|R
50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the later 2500M, the 2500 (marketed as the Vixen 2500 in the United States) was built between 1971 and 1972, and was designed to take advantage of the fact that the Triumph 2.5L inline-six engine had already been certified for US emissions standards (although only in 105 bhp form.) The final production run of the 2500 (comprising 96 cars) used the M Series <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Vixen-style <b>bodywork.</b>|$|R
50|$|De Cadenet's Lola was 14th, {{finishing}} the race <b>with</b> a <b>bodywork</b> stuck together <b>with</b> {{a lot of}} adhesive tape. De Cadenet came back in 1976 <b>with</b> the same <b>chassis</b> updated <b>with</b> major <b>bodywork</b> modifications finishing third for what remains the best result of de Cadenet at Le Mans, and the best result of a Lola chassis.|$|R
50|$|In Italy Bandini was {{developing}} {{a car to}} take a Maserati power plant, {{as well as an}} O.S.C.A.-powered Formula Three model, reflecting the excellence of intra-business networking in Italy's industrial north. Meanwhile, a Bandini <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Zagato <b>bodywork</b> was prepared for Alex Raymond. A 1955 Zagato Berlinetta won the Concourse d'Elegance at Rimini in 1957. The Zagato was also the first to race in America. It ran at Sebring and Daytona Beach in 1960 (piloted by Paul Richardson for Racemaster).|$|R
50|$|Both the Type 562 and Type 710 sidecars {{share the}} same <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> only the <b>bodywork</b> being different. Both feature either a 16 Inch or 18 Inch wheel with a 160mm. {{diameter}} single leading shoe drum brake, which is linked, when fitted to a Jawa motorcycle, to the rear brake mechanism to provide balanced braking.|$|R
50|$|In early 2005 Kowloon Motor Bus ordered 25 B9TL <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Wrightbus <b>bodywork,</b> which entered {{service in}} 2005/2006. One of them (fleet number AVBW25) {{had participated in}} the EFE Showbus 2005 event in the UK before delivery. Among these 25 Wright-bodied B9TL, two of them are prototypes - fleet no. AVBW15 and AVBW26 (registration no. MG470 and MH7721 respectively). AVBW15 is fitted with a D9A340 engine coupled to a four-speed Voith DIWA864.5 gearbox instead of the D9A300 engine coupled to a {{six-speed}} ZF6HP592C gearbox, which is unique among the whole Wright-bodied B9TL fleet.|$|R
25|$|Although the {{standard}} body-style was popular, the 127 {{was a common}} basis for conversion to specialist uses, such as mobile workshops, ambulances, fire engines and flatbed transports. In South Africa, the Land Rover assembly plant offered a 127 4x4 with seating for 15. Land Rover also offered the 127 as a bare <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> just front <b>bodywork</b> and bulkhead, for easy conversion.|$|R
50|$|To {{meet the}} new {{regulations}} brought in by the ACO for endurance racing, the AMR-One {{is powered by a}} downsized, 2.0 litre turbocharged straight six petrol engine, which features a blade-fin behind the cockpit. The AMR-One is built around a light carbon fibre monocoque <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> open top <b>bodywork,</b> in contrast to the closed cockpits of the contemporary Peugeot 908 and Audi R18.|$|R
50|$|In 1913, the 10 hp was the {{cheapest}} {{model in the}} Austin range, costing £260 <b>for</b> a <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> tyres. The 10 hp (of 14.32-h.p.) was renamed 12-14 hp before midsummer 1915 but production was limited due to the war.|$|R
50|$|When Ventura sought new buses in 1992 Leyland {{had ceased}} production, so two Scania L113s and a Volvo B10M with Volgren bodies were {{purchased}} for evaluation. Ventura settled on Scanias after the evaluation period and {{have since been}} the main chassis used in the Ventura fleet with 293 in the fleet as at May 2013. It has also purchased 107 DesignLine bodied MANs. Since 2013 the fleet has switched to Volvo B7RLE's <b>with</b> Volgren <b>bodywork.</b> As of 2015, new deliveries have reverted to Scania, <b>with</b> their K310UB <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Volgren Optimus <b>bodywork.</b>|$|R
50|$|ETN 909 W is a Shelvoke & Drewry Emergency Tender {{built on}} a Shelvoke WX SPV (special Purpose Vehicle) <b>chassis</b> fitted <b>with</b> Benson <b>bodywork</b> it was {{supplied}} new to Tyne & Wear Metropolitan Fire Brigade Fossway fire station in the East end of Newcastle. It is fitted with a Boughton 5 ton hydraulic winch and a 10 KW generator, which powers the extending lighting mast.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{fleet of}} Volvo B10L buses in the UK was {{purchased}} by Travel West Midlands, consisting of 80 conventional diesel-powered <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> Wright Liberator <b>bodywork,</b> and 14 CNG-powered buses with Alexander Ultra bodies. The Alexander Ultra models are now converted to run on conventional diesel, with seven having been transferred to the training fleet before being returned to normal passenger use to replace the ageing Volvo B10Bs withdrawn from the fleet.|$|R
5000|$|As if the {{existing}} four bodystyles didn't suffice, a beach buggy version was introduced simultaneously. While highly prized by collectors today, the Buggy only sold about 100 examples {{and was only}} available for a single model year. The 440 kg Fellow Buggy was actually not a [...] "real" [...] Fellow, as it was built on a Hijet <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> fibre-reinforced plastic <b>bodywork.</b> The Buggy also used the Hijet's lower powered (...) engine, providing {{a top speed of}} 95 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Harbilt {{also built}} the HSV (higher speed vehicle), {{which was a}} general {{delivery}} truck. The payload was reduced {{to allow it to}} travel at faster speeds in urban traffic, and 30 were supplied to the United States Post Office for mail deliveries in Cupertino, California. The vehicles were supplied in March 1974 as right-hand drive <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> the <b>bodywork</b> assembled in Scotts Valley, California and this model was officially the HSV3. The main issue encountered was that the battery liquid dried up rapidly in the hotter conditions of California. Initially, each cell had to be topped up individually, but Chloride batteries developed a reservoir system, which allowed all the cells to be topped up from a single fill, significantly reducing the time spent on maintenance.|$|R
50|$|The Mercedes-Benz W11 was a midsize six-cylinder {{automobile}} {{introduced by}} Daimler-Benz it 1929. It was {{developed from the}} Mercedes-Benz W02 first seen in 1926, and the W11 shared its <b>chassis</b> and <b>bodywork</b> <b>with</b> the W02, but the W11 came with a larger more powerful engine, a new name and a wider list of “standard bodies” from which customers could choose.|$|R
50|$|The K93 and K113 {{were the}} most common <b>chassis</b> <b>for</b> coaches, <b>with</b> a {{longitudinally}} rear-mounted engine.|$|R
5000|$|While results {{continued}} {{to come with}} the production XK120 model, England and Jaguar boss William Lyons realised {{that it was too}} overweight and aerodynamically compromised to have a serious chance of winning the Le Mans race. Their solution was to take the drivetrain from the XK120 and to install it in a lightweight <b>chassis,</b> clothed <b>with</b> slippery <b>bodywork</b> designed by Malcolm Sayer. The XK120C (for competition), later known as the C-Type, made its debut at the [...] Le Mans race.|$|R
5000|$|The {{canonical}} {{example of}} a car-like dual-mode vehicle is the Alden staRRcar. The staRRcar looked like existing city cars of the era, using a steel <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> fibreglass <b>bodywork</b> on top. Batteries gave the vehicle a 30 mph top speed {{with a range of}} a few tens of miles. For longer distance trips, Alden envisioned concrete guideways similar to the existing interstate highways. When the staRRcar entered the guideway, small wheels {{on either side of the}} vehicle pressed against the sides of the guideways and handled steering, while an on-board guidance system prevented collisions with the vehicle in front - the only collision hazard in this mode of transit. Since the driving was automated, the vehicles could be operated with almost no distance between them, or [...] "short headways, which increased the capacity of the lanes. A single lane of guideway could safely operate at loads twice or greater than a conventional expressway.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{traditional}} kart racing, many commercial enterprises offer karts for rent, {{often called}} [...] "recreational" [...] or [...] "concession" [...] karts. The tracks can be indoor or outdoor. Karts are rented by sessions (usually from 10 to 30 minutes). They use sturdy <b>chassis</b> complete <b>with</b> dedicated <b>bodywork,</b> providing driver safety. Most of these enterprises use an [...] "Arrive and Drive" [...] format which provide customers {{with all the}} safety gear (helmets, gloves and driver outfits) necessary, {{and allow them to}} show up any time to race at a reasonable price, without the problem of having to own their own equipment and gear.|$|R
40|$|Presented {{constructive}} {{solution of}} the robotic system effectively solves the problem of movement in human-adapted not pre-prepared environment. AnyWalker stabilization system consists of three flywheels, implemented {{in the form of}} motor-wheels or driven with the help of transfer mechanisms each from its motor, in orthogonal planes, and the centers of mass flywheels are the same. It is proposed to formalize the functionality of the movement in the human-adapted environment {{in the form of a}} standard architecture <b>for</b> robotic <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> the possibility of hardware and software extension...|$|R
50|$|Charlie Merz did pick up one {{victory at}} the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the track's seventh auto race in August 1909. The race was a four lap (10 miles) affair <b>for</b> stock <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> engines of 301 to 450 cubic inch displacement. Only four cars started the race, with Jap Clemens {{retiring}} almost immediately. Merz, driving another National, won over Louis Chevrolet in a Buick. His victory was met with applause from local fans as both driver and car were from Indianapolis. He finished second and third in two other handicap events as well.|$|R
50|$|In 1948, {{the company}} name was changed to Transport Equipment (Thornycroft) Ltd to prevent {{confusion}} with the shipbuilding Thornycroft company. The company was well known <b>for</b> providing fire-engine <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> multi-axle drive <b>for</b> uses such as airports. A limited number of 4x4 chassis were also provided to Worcester-based fire engine manufacturer, Carmichael for sale to civilian brigades in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The Jamaican {{was also}} one of Fiberfab's early car bodies. It was {{designed}} to be fitted to a TR3, TR4, MGA, Austin-Healey or a Volkswagen Beetle. Later Fiberfab built their own 'Jamaican' <b>chassis</b> <b>for</b> use <b>with</b> a V8 power-plant.|$|R
50|$|Pérez {{switched}} to the British Formula 3 Championship for 2007. Pérez relocated his personal residence to Oxford. He competed in the National Class - <b>for</b> older <b>chassis</b> - <b>with</b> the T-Sport team, winning the championship by a comfortable margin. In the process, he won two-thirds of the races and a similar proportion of pole positions, and finished all but two races on the podium.|$|R
2500|$|Caterham {{have had}} {{something}} of a tentative relationship with the installation of motorbike engines into their cars. Since 2000, a Canadian firm has been selling Caterham 7 models using the GSXR1300 engine used in the Suzuki Hayabusa. It reportedly does 0-62 in under 3 seconds. In 2000 the Honda CBR1100 engine was installed into a [...] superlight chassis to create the Caterham Blackbird, delivering [...] at 10,750 rpm (although just [...] of maximum torque).

5000|$|For 2010, Strakka Racing raced a LMP2 twin-turbo V6 engined HPD ARX-01c in the Le Mans Series, {{recording}} one of {{the most}} remarkable seasons in sportscar racing. LMP2 victory at the Le Mans 24 Hour race broke five records, including the highest ever overall finish for a LMP2 car (5th), a new lap record and the greatest distance ever covered in the famous race by a LMP2 car. The team also achieved the first ever LMS outright win <b>for</b> a LMP2 <b>chassis,</b> <b>with</b> victory at the 1,000 km race at the Hungaroring.|$|R
25|$|The Venturer II had {{a common}} front profile for all models, {{together}} with a standard dash panel featuring a four-part radiator grille with a central cross within an oval outline which also embraced the headlamps. A rear-end revision marked {{the launch of the}} Venturer III in 1954, and the following year a version was produced <b>for</b> underfloor-engined <b>chassis</b> <b>with</b> the entrance ahead of the front axle. This required a return to a more vertical front profile, and meant that there were now three variants of the Venturer – front engined, underfloor-engined with a centre entrance and underfloor-engined with a front entrance. This three-variant approach, established with the Venturer, continued throughout the life of the succeeding Consort model and into the Embassy era, although the relative importance of the three versions varied significantly over the years.|$|R
25|$|The Daimler DS420 Limousine was {{introduced}} in 1968 to replace their Daimler DR450 and BMC's Vanden Plas Princess. The DS420 used a Jaguar Mk X unitary carcass with a restyled roof and a floor pan extended by 21inches behind {{the front seat and}} strengthened. The extension of the Mark X unit bodies was done by Motor Panels, a subsidiary of Rubery Owen. The floor pan with mechanicals was available to coachbuilders as a rolling <b>chassis</b> <b>for</b> use <b>with</b> specialised <b>bodywork,</b> usually as hearses; Startin of Birmingham built more than 300 DS420-based hearses. Finishing from the bare metal, including final assembly and trimming the interior, was done by Vanden Plas, who had earlier made the Princess for BMC.|$|R
