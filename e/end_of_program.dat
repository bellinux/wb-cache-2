50|$|In 1920 the Girl Scout rankings were: Tender Foot, Second Class, First Class, Corporal and Patrol Leader. In the 1920s Camp Bonnie Brae had Bonnie Brae Echoes, a newspaper. It cost 5 cents. A feast {{known as}} the Natures Bouquet was the closing feature of the camp season, which was a great success. In 1921, some of the tents were {{substituted}} by cabins for the younger girls. Sunday worship happened at camp, and scholarships were established. During the year of 1922, the girls were taught to make their beds. If you went {{in the summer of}} 1923, you would have been taught how to weave on a loom. There were more athletics, and a Trails End club for older girls. In 1924 and 25, the camp got electricity, and an archery program was developed. Sherwood, Camelot and the Jungle units were established. By 1926, the girl scout council system of self-government was recognized nationally. In 1927, Camp Bonnie Brae was run by the Massachusetts Girl Scouts. There were 800 campers that season. In 1929, the Romani Patrin gypsy unit was formed. As time went by, the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>program</b> ceremonies became an important tradition in which girls created a skit, decorations, formations, poems and songs that were sung and played on instruments. Music and creativity continue to be a traditional component of girl scout camping.|$|E

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of highly multithreaded architectures, performance monitoring techniques face new challenges in efficiently locating sources of performance discrepancies in the program source code.

Furthermore, even if supported, any fine-grained sampling of performance counters will distort the actual program behavior and will make the sampled values inaccurate.

In this paper, we present a novel software-based approach for monitoring the memory hierarchy performance in highly multithreaded general-purpos...|$|E

40|$|Background: Limited {{evidence}} {{exists on the}} impact of nurse practitioner-managed diabetes mellitus care coordination programs in the primary care setting and specifically on the use of telehealth to manage veterans with diabetes in the home. Objective: To compare the impact of nurse practitioner-based diabetes mellitus care management programs using either a telehealth or a telephone intervention. Specific aims were to (i) compare the efficacy of telehealth and telephone interventions in a diabetes care management program, with regards to glycemic control; (ii) examine the impact of program exposure on the control of diabetes following patient disenrollment from the program; and (iii) identify the average duration of use of a telehealth or telephone intervention required to reach individualized glycemic goals. Design, setting, and patient population: A retrospective pre-post cohort study of a nurse practitioner-managed diabetes care coordination program was performed in primary care clinics in a Midwest Veterans Administration Medical Center in the US. The cohort included in this study consisted of 259 patients who were enrolled in the program between August 2003 and October 2005 and who disenrolled from the program before January 2006. Results: The mean reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) associated with the program were 2. 4 % for the telehealth intervention (baseline 9. 86 %; <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>program</b> 7. 46 %) and 2. 39 % for telephone intervention (baseline 9. 75 %; <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>program</b> 7. 36 %). No significant difference in the reduction in HbA 1 c was noted between telehealth and telephone interventions (p_=_ 0. 96) after adjusting for baseline HbA 1 c and age. The number of days of participation in the program was greater for the telehealth group than the group receiving the telephonic intervention (192. 2 vs 161. 9) but this difference was not statistically significant (p_=_ 0. 13). Approximately 75 % of the patients (n = 192) worked with nurse practitioners and had reached individualized glycemic goals at disenrollment. Among these patients, those receiving the telehealth intervention had a 3. 1 % (SD_=_ 1. 9, p_Diabetes-mellitus, Telemedicine...|$|E
