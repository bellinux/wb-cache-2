40|$|Study {{on fishing}} {{operation}} of <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> {{was conducted at}} reef waters at {{the west coast of}} Selayar Island from November 2008 to October 2010. The main objective of this research is to determine the best design and technical operation for environmental friendly catching of reef fish. <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> is chosen as an experimental fishing gear because its shape is a combination between basket trapnet ???bubu???, traditional fishing gear which is cosidered as environmental friendly fishing gear for catching coral reef fish and fence setnet (sero) shape. The first design of the experimantal <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> follows the original shape, support with 5 rectangular steel frames and surrounding by 0. 75 inch of webbing 5 m in length, 1. 8 m in width and 1. 2 m in height. It has two 2 m fixed and 15 m flexible extended wings. Unlike ???bubu???, <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> has not use bait for attracting the fish, therefore the entrance of <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> should be large enough to make the fish entering freely. In two months of operations the <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> did not show satisfactory results because the fish moved back and forward through the entrance of <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> easily and the main problem was bycatch of turtels, therefore the second <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> was designed. The new feature of the second <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> was playground with rectangular vertical opening. The size of the opening was 150 x 15 cm devided into seven small entrances {{in order to protect the}} turtles entering the gear. To keep the fish inside the playground some 40 cm cableties are tied at the frame of the entrance functioning as shieves. In two months of operations the second <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> was show better results however the new problem was the weight of the gear became heavier because of the increase of diameter of steelframe used, therefore, the third <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> was designed to find a lighter gear. The third <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> was supported by a rectangular polyvinil chloride (PVC) tube frames combined by polyethylene ropes, covered by 1. 25 inch of webbing. No more turtles was caught but more life reef fish was caught. To evaluate which design and methods of operation was better, three types of fyke nets and two methods of operations were examined. RAPFISH (Rapid Appraisal of Fish Status) is used to analyze which type of <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> is the most suitable for reef fishing and to analyze the status of <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> as an environmental friendly fishing gear. RAPFISH applies a statistical ordination technique called multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). Based on this analysis the third <b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> lighter gear with PVC tube frames, shows the best value for it performance and technical operations, and <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> is an environmental friendly fishing gear (value > 50. 0 in the range of 0 - 100). Ecological aspects gave the highest value for the status of <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> as an environmental friendly fishing gear followed by ethical, technological, social and economical aspects...|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} small-mesh (4 -mm) <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> {{and boat}} electrofishing for sampling a littoral fish assemblage in Muskegon Lake, Michigan. We hypothesized that <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> selects for small-bodied fishes and electrofishing selects for large-bodied fishes. Three sites were sampled during May (2004 and 2005), July (2005 only), and September (2004 and 2005). We {{found that the}} species composition of captured fish differed considerably between <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> and electrofishing based on nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Species strongly associated with <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> (based on NMDS and relative abundance) included the brook silverside Labidesthes sicculus, banded killifish Fundulus diaphanus, round goby Neogobius melanostomus, mimic shiner Notropis volucellus, and bluntnose minnow Pimephales notatus, whereas species associated with electrofishing included the Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, catostomids (Moxostoma spp. and Catostomus spp.), freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, walleye Sander vitreus, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, and common carp Cyprinus carpio. The total length of fish captured by electrofishing was 12. 8 cm (95 % confidence interval ¼ 5. 5 – 17. 2 cm) {{greater than that of}} fish captured by <b>fyke</b> <b>netting.</b> Size selectivity of the gears contributed to differences in species composition of the fish captured, supporting our initial hypothesis. Thus, small-mesh <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> and boat electrofishers provided complementary information on a littoral fish assemblage.

We compared {{the efficiency of}} dip-netting to that of <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> in sampling the macroinvertebrate assemblage of a temporary pond in Don˜ ana National Park (SW Spain). We sampled the pond at four different times—morning, afternoon, evening and night—distinguishing between deep and shallow zones. In our sampling, dip-netting captured a higher number of taxa, and higher abundances of individuals than <b>fyke</b> <b>nets.</b> However, both techniques captured exclusive taxa, not recorded with the other device. <b>Fyke</b> <b>nets</b> distinguished between nocturnal and diurnal macroinvertebrates, and hence are more appropriate to study macroinvertebrate diel activity. We detected nocturnal activity in Gerris thoracicus larvae, and adults of Colymbetes fuscus, Rhantus suturalis, Rhantus hispanicus and Hydrochara flav- ipes. Conversely, larvae of Sympetrum fonscolombei and Notonecta spp., and adults of Notonecta glauca were mainly diurnal. The overall diel activity pattern of the macroinvertebrate assemblage depended on the diel activities of their integrating taxa and stages. Although dip-netting was more appropriate to sample macroinvertebrate assemblages in different micro- habitats, <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> better captured nocturnal and fast- swimming invertebrates. Consequently, the joint use of both sampling techniques would capture a better picture of the representative macrofauna of a tempo- rary pond than either one on its ownPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{conflicts}} between seals and fisheries along the Swedish west coast have intensified {{during the last}} decades, concurrently {{with the increase in}} the harbour seal population size. This study presents published information about interactions between harbour seals and fisheries in the Kattegat-Skagerrak, in addition to new information on the seal by-catch rate and an overview of fisheries suffering from seal damage. Several fisheries have reported interactions with seals, principally fisheries with <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> gill nets and static gear. Development of mitigation measures has been focused on the eel fishery with <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> in which the use of stronger net material has significantly decreased the damage frequency from seals and has yet maintained the catches at satisfactory levels. Under-water filming at <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> together with studies of the prey preferences of seals has shown individual specializations in certain foraging techniques. For example, eel may not be a common prey for harbour seals in general, but, it was chosen in preference to other species by seals attacking <b>fyke</b> <b>nets.</b> There is a lack of current data concerning the diet of harbour seals. Previous studies, based on material from the 1970 s and 1980 s, have shown that locally and seasonally abundant prey is preferred.

40|$|Sampling and {{assessment}} of nearshore fish communities is difficult due to {{the wide variety of}} habitats, substrates, and often complex structures. During the summers of 2005 and 2006, we conducted a comparison of ten different gear types, with the intent to develop a long-term sampling protocol of nearshore communities in Oneida Lake, NY. Gear types consisted of nine configurations of <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> and one seine. <b>Fyke</b> <b>nets</b> varied by frame size (large vs. small), mesh size (large vs. small), orientation (parallel vs. perpendicular), and the inclusion/exclusion of wings. Summers were broken into two sampling periods, during which 2 different sites were chosen for each of three major substrate types (sandy, rocky, and muddy) for a total of six sites. Student?s t-test indicated significantly higher species richness and total catch during sampling period two. However, few significant differences were observed in any net-to-net comparisons using Tukey?s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD). Catches of key sport fishes, such as smallmouth bass and largemouth bass were significantly higher in smaller meshed nets. In order to maximize ease, efficiency and accuracy, we recommend assessments of nearshore communities take place in sampling period two, using a combination of perpendicularly set medium frame <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> with both large and small mesh sizes. Additional species, not caught by <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> can be supplemented by seining at all sites...|$|R

40|$|Fishes {{belonging}} to the family Galaxiidae are relatively small (usually < 300 mm long), freshwaterdwelling teleosts that are found on several land masses in the southern hemisphere (McDowall & Fulton 1996). Many galaxiid species have nondiadromous life histories {{and the distribution of}} some of these consists of discrete lacustrine populations (McDowall 2000; Allen, Midgley & Allen 2002). As a result of restricted or fragmented distributions, along with other impacts (e. g. introduced fish species), many lacustrine galaxiid species are considered to be threatened; hence monitoring populations for conservation purposes is a common management practice. Fyke nets are known to be effective for capturing small-sized benthic or littoral fish in lakes (Fago 1998; Krueger & Hubert 1998), including galaxiids (Rowe & Chisnall 1997; Rowe, Konui & Christie 2002). <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> catches of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in lakes vary seasonally, suggesting relative abundance indices based on catch data often require correction for differences in catchability (Ryan 1984). Seasonal fluctuations in <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> catches of European perch, Perca fluviatilis L., due to spawning-related habitat shifts were also reported by Kubeka (1992). Other studies showed that cover-orientated fish species tend to have increased catchability by fyke nets because fyke nets provide cover (Krueger & Hubert 1998; Rogers, Hansen & Beard 2003) ...|$|E

The seal sock developed and tested in this study was a cylindrical net attached to the <b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> allowing the seals access to the surface to breathe while trapped inside fishing gear. The number of dead and live seals caught in fyke nets without a seal sock (years 2008 - 2010) and with a sock (years 2011 - 2013) was recorded. The seals caught in fyke nets were mainly juveniles. Of ringed seals (Phoca hispida botnica) both sexes were equally represented, while of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) the ratio was biased (71 %) towards males. All the by-caught seals were dead in the fyke nets without a seal sock, whereas 70 % of ringed seals and 11 % of grey seals survived when the seal sock was used. The seal sock proved to be effective in reducing the by-catch mortality of ringed seals, but did not perform as well with grey seals. 201...|$|E
40|$|The {{littoral}} zone of small off-stream water storage containing a translocated population of Galaxias auratus was sampled fortnightly at {{day and night}} with <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> electrofishing and snorkelling over 3 months. Variation in population data provided by each method, including relative abundance indices, size structure, and habitat preferences, were examined. Aspects of behaviour and activity patterns were also investigated. Night sampling using all methods consistently yielded larger catches than day sampling. The size structure of catches varied, with electrofishing at night and <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> during the day having higher proportions of juveniles, whilst snorkelling at night and electrofishing during the day had higher proportions of adults. <b>Fyke</b> <b>netting</b> at night yielded {{by far the largest}} catches (3 -fold more than other methods) and also captured balanced proportions of juveniles and adults. Galaxias auratus had a strong diel activity pattern and were most active at night. The majority of the population migrated into the {{littoral zone}} during the night and back into deeper water during the day. A small number of juveniles remained in the littoral zone and some adults sheltered in the dense cover of species-rich littoral vegetation during the day. Shores with shallow depth profiles appeared to be preferred due to higher catches in these areas using all methods. Based on the results of this study, <b>fyke</b> <b>netting</b> at night in littoral habitats is recommended for monitoring populations of G. auratus. <b>Fyke</b> <b>netting</b> is likely to be an effective method for monitoring other lacustrine galaxiid species; however, further work is required to investigate the effects of habitat variables and fish community structure on activity patterns of galaxiids, and hence their catchability with various methods, in more extensive lentic environments...|$|R

40|$|The {{invasive}} {{comb jelly}} Mnemiopsis leidyi is a lobate ctenophore native of coastal and estuarine {{waters of the}} temperate western Atlantic Ocean. In the last decades this species has expanded its range of distribution, colonizing marine and transitional environments in Europe. In October 2015, during a survey fishing the European eel Anguilla anguilla in Sardinia (western Mediterranean), a massive bloom of this specie was observed in the eutrophic S’Ena Arrubia Lagoon for the first time. In November 2015, sampling was conducted at three stations in the lagoon and in a <b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> in order to estimate the abundance of M. leidyi and to determine {{its impact on the}} fishing activity. The results showed an abundance of 2. 83 ctenophores m- 3. Specimens were all adults, measuring 18 - 62 mm total length. The abundant number of ctenophores (6837 individuals per <b>fyke</b> <b>net)</b> damaged fishing operations, reducing catches and affecting the performance of fishing gears. Since there is no effective mechanical, chemical or biological method to counter M. leidyi, the short term economic damage may be approached by new management measures of fisheries. In addition, other actions against the recurring of M. leidyi invasion, can include management strategies, in particular those finalized to reduce the high trophic state of the lagoon...|$|E

However, {{little is known}} about gear-specific biases for many common fish species because few multiple-gear comparison studies exist that have incorporated seasonal dynamics. We sampled six lakes and impoundments representing a diversity of trophic and physical conditions in Iowa, USA, using multiple gear types (i. e., standard modified <b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> mini-modified <b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> sinking experimental gill net, bag seine, benthic trawl, boat-mounted electrofisher used diurnally and nocturnally) to determine the influence of sampling methodology and season on fisheries assessments. Specifically, we describe the influence of season on catch per unit effort, proportional size distribution, and the number of samples required to obtain 125 stock-length individuals for 12 species of recreational and ecological importance. Mean catch per unit effort generally peaked in the spring and fall as a result of increased sampling effectiveness in shallow areas and seasonal changes in habitat use (e. g., movement offshore during summer). Mean proportional size distribution decreased from spring to fall for white bass Morone chrysops, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, and black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, suggesting selectivity for large and presumably sexually mature individuals in the spring and summer.

40|$|Intertidal {{migration}} is relatively well-studied in marine fish biology. Most studies focused on marine sandy beaches and rocky shores. Comparatively little work, however, {{has been done}} on the distribution and migration patterns of fishes on estuarine mudflats. The seasonal composition of an intertidal estuarine fish community was studied with directional <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> at different heights on the mudflat. These <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> each sampled an opposite direction and as such could be used to analyze the migration patterns of fishes on the mudflat. The fish assemblage was dominated by juveniles of Clupea harengus, Dicentrarchus labrax, Platichthys flesus and Solea solea. The composition of the intertidal fish community reflected the cyclicity of seasonal recruitment of species into the estuary. Analysis of the directional data of the <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> showed that the flatfish species, flounder and sole, migrated actively onto the mudflat. In contrast, the distribution of herring and seabass in the <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> suggests that they were transported passively by the tidal currents. These (semi-) pelagic species can be considered opportunistic vagrants onto the mudflat. They might follow their migrating hyperbenthic and pelagic prey and may find a valuable supplement to their diet in the infauna that disperses into the water column. Because of the low predator abundance and high turbidity {{in this part of the}} Scheldt estuary, predation is probably not an important trigger for intertidal migration. Species didn’t show a clear zonation on the mudflat and, if observed, this was mainly the result of species-specific differences in mobility. The zonation of flatfishes tended to be affected by density-dependent processes. Whenfish densities were higher, relatively more flounder were caught on the upper shore. By doing so, they avoid competition for food or space with sole, which stays on the middle and lower reaches of the mudflat...|$|R

40|$|Between 1991 and 2008 a {{total of}} 71 fish species was {{recorded}} in the brackish and fresh water zone of the Schelde estuary (Zeeschelde). The results were obtained from fish surveys from the cooling water filter screens of the power plant at Doel (between 1991 and 2008) and <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> surveys {{along the length of}} the estuary between 1995 and 2008. Species abundance in the different salinity zones was analysed using the <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> data only. The ten most abundant species represent 90. 8 % of the total number of individuals caught. In decreasing order of abundance: flounder (Platichthys flesus), roach (Rutilus rutilus), herring (Clupea harengus), eel (Anguilla anguilla), pike-perch (Sander lucioperca), sole (Solea solea), common goby (Pomatoschistus microps), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and white bream (Blicca bjoerkna). With fyke nets 33 species were caught in the tidal freshwater zone, 43 species in the oligohaline zone and 59 species in the mesohaline zone. Each salinity zone is characterised by a typical fish assemblage, lthough some species are shared between all three salinity zones: e. g. three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Prussian carp (Carrasius gibelio), roach (Rutilus rutilus) and eel (Anguilla anguilla). Diadromous species occur in all zones and make up, on average up 22 % of the species richness. Freshwater species comprise about 70 % of the species in the tidal freshwater zone. In the oligohaline zone the contribution of the freshwater species to the species richness is less while marine migrants become more abundant. As expected, the contribution of marine migrants and estuarine species is higher in the mesohaline zone.

40|$|The {{challenges}} {{associated with}} environmental monitoring {{such as the}} impact on the environment and the financial costs are problems we face when trying to conserve freshwater systems around the world. The need for precise and accurate results that are cost effective is important so that we can achieve our conservation goals. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} explore Next-Generation - metabarcoding for the detection of feral and native freshwater fish species based on the DNA shed by individual organisms into the water column. Cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) primers were developed for this study using DNA from six freshwater species expected to be found in the waterbody. These primers, along with 16 S rRNA (16 S) primers, were assessed to ensure that the molecular method was robust and suitable for use in the field. Along with the cost effectiveness of the molecular method when compared to the more traditional surveying method of <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> surveying. This study comprised development of field and lab protocols for the detection of freshwater fish species in a lentic system. Both the COI and 16 S primer sets showed results that were comparable to previous <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> surveys, though both primer sets detected species that the other did not. Further qPCR analysis showed that there were differences in detection for both primers for each of the species. The molecular surveying of the waterbody has been proven sensitive enough to detect Maccullochella peelii. This species has a very low abundance in the waterbody (believed to be n= 1) so these results suggest that this method can be used to target low abundance species. The outcome of this study highlighted the need for multi-location sampling within a waterbody as increasing the number of locations sampled, led to an increase in the number of species detected. Along with the multi-location sampling, it was also important to sample throughout the year to account for seasonal variability. The eDNA study emphasized the importance of having knowledge of both the ecology and the biology of the species targeted so that a robust monitoring method can be implemented. As well as comparing the apparent accuracy of Fyke netting and the eDNA approach in the study waterbody, a cost benefit analysis comparing the relative costs of multiplex DNA surveying, single species molecular surveying, and <b>Fyke</b> <b>net</b> surveying was undertaken. Molecular environmental surveying was found to be a cost effective method for monitoring, as the analysis suggested single species monitoring would break even after only 95 waterbodies were surveyed, and multiplex surveying would break even after 145 waterbodies, under the proposed scenario. The cost benefit analysis explored the costs associated with all three methods, including lab set up costs, along with the number of waterbodies that could be surveyed on both a weekly and yearly basis...|$|E
50|$|A {{fishing net}} is a net used for fishing. Nets are devices made from fibers woven in a grid-like structure. Some fishing nets are also called fish traps, for example <b>fyke</b> <b>nets.</b> Fishing nets are usually meshes formed by {{knotting}} a relatively thin thread. Early nets were woven from grasses, flaxes and other fibrous plant material. Later cotton was used. Modern nets are usually made of artificial polyamides like nylon, although nets of organic polyamides such as wool or silk thread were common until recently {{and are still}} used.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe key {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the sampling efficiency of various fish sampling gears for a lentic ecosystem health assessment. A fish survey for the lentic ecosystem health assessment model was sampled twice from 30 reservoirs during 2008 – 2012. During the study, fishes of 81 species comprising 53, 792 individuals were sampled from 30 reservoirs. A comparison of sampling gears showed that casting nets were the best sampling gear with high species richness (69 species), whereas minnow traps were the worst gear with low richness (16 species). Fish sampling efficiency, based on the number of individual catch per unit effort, was best in <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> (28, 028 individuals) and worst in minnow traps (352 individuals). When we compared trammel nets and kick <b>nets</b> versus <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> and casting nets, the former were useful in terms of the number of fish individuals but not in terms of the number of fish species...|$|R
40|$|Otters And <b>Fyke</b> <b>Nets</b> -Some Aspects Which Need Further AttentionPages 7 - 20 (Article) Claus ReutherEurasian otters (Lutra lutra) become {{attracted}} by fishes caught in <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> lobster creels or other fishing gear, and they sometimes are drowned {{by trying to}} get access to these fish. Numerous publications describe this problem and the attempts to avoid this kind of loss. By comparing these data with unpublished data provided from different European countries, and in trying to prepare recommendations for fishermen, it became obvious that there are some results which are inconsistent or founded on too small a database to offer a background for adequate conservation recommendations. Therefore, some aspects are highlighted here to encourage otter conservationists and researchers to collect more data and to contribute to a more reliable database for conservation measures. In particular, an improvement in the knowledge of fishing techniques and of fishing gear used by fishermen seems to be necessary for {{a better understanding of the}} factors which influence the number of otters drowned...|$|R
40|$|To {{contribute}} to mass balanced trophic model parametrization, estimates of annual food consumption/biomass ratio (Q/B) were compiled for 37 selected fish {{species of the}} Curuçá Estuary in Northern Brazil using an empirical model. Samples were taken bimonthly between July 2003 and July 2004 in the main channel and intertidal creeks using an otter trawl and a <b>fyke</b> <b>net,</b> respectively. The aspect ratio of the caudal fin varied between 0. 8 for Poecilia vivipara and 4. 6 for Sciades herzbergii and the Q/B ranged from 2. 3 for Epinephelus itajara to 67. 3 for Cetengraulis edentulus. This study represents the first reference available on Q/B values of 29 fish species. This compilation of Q/B ratio presented here should be useful for construction of Ecopath models particularly in tropical conditions.   Keywords: consumption/biomass; aspect ratio; trophic models; Ecopath.   DOI: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Lake Eber is a small, shallow tectonic lake, {{located in}} {{the central part of}} Anatolia. Lake is under effect of {{pollution}} and exotic fish species. In order to define environmental degradation within the lake and its effects on fish assembly in a historical perspective field study was conducted. Water sampling was conducted seasonally between December, 2012 and September, 2013. Physico-chemical paramaters as dissolved oxygen, pH, total phosphorus and total Kjeldahl nitrogen was assessed. Trophic state index was calculated from phosphorus concentrations and trophic state of the lake was assessed. Fishing was carried out in April, 2013, on randomly selected eight stations with benthic multimesh nets (30 m long, 1. 5 m depth, 12 different mesh size from 5 x 5 mm to 55 x 55 mm) and <b>fyke</b> <b>net.</b> Fish assembly, catch data (catch per unit effort), length-weight relationships of the species with enough sample size is reported...|$|E

Fish sampling was carried out by gill net and <b>fyke</b> <b>net</b> in the western region of Anzali wetland (SW of the Caspian Sea) between Nov. 2010 and May 2011. 368 specimens were measured and weighed. The values of the exponent b in the length-weight relationships (LWRs) ranged from 2. 5358 to 3. 3613 and those of the length-length relationship (LLRs) ranged from 0. 8717 to 0. 9412. Also, relative condition factor (Krel) ranged from 1. 00 ± 0. 11 to 1. 30 ± 0. 21 and Fulton’s condition factor (K) ranged from 0. 80 ± 0. 05 to 1. 60 ± 0. 18 for all species...|$|E
40|$|Wrasse species {{went from}} having almost no {{commercial}} value in Norway, {{and not being}} fished, to a landing of 21. 2 million individuals in 2014 with 11. 68 million of these being goldsinny. This explosive growth in fishing might have affected the populations of goldsinny severely. Establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) could be a helpful tool in management and conservation of goldsinny populations. Differences in selection of the two gear types used in the wrasse fishery (<b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> and pots) could also affect the goldsinny populations. To test for effects of MPAs, I compared catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of goldsinny above the legal size limit in four MPAs along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast to that obtained in four neighboring control areas where fishing is allowed. The CPUE of legal size goldsinny was higher in the MPAs compared to the control areas in all four localities, suggesting that MPAs have impacted the abundance of goldsinny. There was much variation in the size and age distribution of the goldsinny populations in the different localities, and no clear trends {{of changes in the}} size and age distribution of the goldsinny populations inside the MPAs were found. The gear type used in the wrasse fishery might also affect the populations since pots seemed to catch more goldsinny than <b>fyke</b> <b>nets,</b> whereas <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> seemed to catch larger sized goldsinny than pots. Catch data in this study compared to data from a study on the Skagerrak coast in the late 1990 s indicates that the increased fishing pressure since then has affected the abundance of goldsinny on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. Results from this study have shown that MPAs affect the populations of goldsinny on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast and MPAs could be a helpful tool in the management of this species...|$|R
40|$|Although many goby {{species have}} become widely {{established}} {{outside of their}} native ranges, little is known yet about invasive population biology. The age, growth and population dynamics of two introduced goby species (Rhinogobius giurinus and Rhinogobius cliffordpopei) were quantified in Lake Erhai (southwest China) with the general aim to improve empirical knowledge and management strategies. The results revealed that their lifespan ranges 2 years. The size and time at sexual maturity for R. cliffordpopei was lower than for R. giurinus. R. cliffordpopei displayed higher total mortality, fishing mortality and exploitation rates than R. giurinus, whereas the natural mortality of R. cliffordpopei was {{lower than that of}} R. giurinus. The catch per unit effort of benthic <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> was low from April to June in R. cliffordpopei and from July to September in R. giurinus, whereas it was high from July to September in R. cliffordpopei and from April to June in R. giurinus. Thus, several specific strategies are suggested to improve the cost-efficiency of the current management practices related to the mesh size of benthic <b>fyke</b> <b>nets</b> used for physical removals, the timing of deployment of control actions and the use of synergic control methods...|$|R
