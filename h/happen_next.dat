5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
5|$|Attendances {{continued}} to increase during {{the remainder of the}} 1900s, as 121,452 saw the 1908 Scotland v England match. The two Old Firm matches played for the 1909 Scottish Cup Final attracted a total of 131,000. After the second match there was a riot because there was confusion over what would <b>happen</b> <b>next</b> when the second match also ended in a draw. The fans believed that the replay would be played to a conclusion and demanded that a period of extra time be played. The Scottish Cup trophy was withheld as Hampden was not in a fit condition to host a second replay. In response to the riot, the Scottish Football Association decided not to use Hampden as the Scottish Cup Final venue until after the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Blizzard {{posted a}} release {{date for the}} game's first beta of Summer 2009, but failed to release a beta during that time. Since May 6, 2009, it was {{possible}} to sign up for the beta phase of the game. In November 2009, the game's producer Chris Sigaty confirmed there would be no public beta for the game taking place in 2009 but assured fans that it would <b>happen</b> <b>next</b> year. In February 2010, Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime announced that a closed beta would open later that month. On February 17, 2010, StarCraft II began closed beta testing, as promised. The beta was expected to last for 3–5 months. Beta keys for the initial release were sold on eBay for prices as high as $400. Blizzard also released a map editor for the beta as part of Patch 9. According to the company, they had planned to release a major content patch towards the end of beta testing. As of July 23, 2010, eighteen patches had been released for the beta (only seventeen on European servers), including a patch which provided access to the Galaxy map editor. On May 12, 2010 Blizzard released the beta client for computers running Mac OS X, for the users who had signed up. On May 17, 2010, Blizzard announced that {{the first phase of the}} beta test would be coming to an end in all regions on May 31, but it was later extended to June 7. The second phase began on July 7, 2010, and ended on July 19, 2010.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b> For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E

As Emma arrives at the place, Gold sets up the hat to absorb her and her powers in a closed room. Emma waits for Gold at the other side, and before she opens the door, Gold appears behind her, telling Emma that everything will be fine once her powers are gone, and that she will be able to live a normal life. Emma then thanks Gold, not knowing will <b>happen</b> <b>next</b> as she ponders about opening the door.|$|E

The numerous tattoos on Lucas's torso were actually transfers planted on Armitage, and took a couple of hours to apply.

500|$|Having {{previously}} {{discovered that}} his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) was faking her pregnancy, Will tells her he no longer {{feels the same way}} he did when they first fell in love.

She announces her intention to leave McKinley High School, explaining that it will be too painful for her to carry on working with Will and Ken.

500|$|According to Chahi, he was {{inspired}} by his 1999 trip to Mount Yasur's crater in Vanuatu. The scenery, {{and the power of}} the volcano, which was extremely active at the time, fascinated and scared him. Chahi, still intending to make another video game [...] "before [...] died", hoped that his next project could convey the: [...] "ambivalence of Nature, beautiful and potentially violent at the same time". Becoming more and more interested in the world's natural forces, Chahi went on to visit different volcanoes, including Dolomieu crater on Reunion Island, and a volcano in the Indian Ocean. Once the development was underway, Montpellier even recorded audio from a real volcano for inclusion in the game. Nature and cycle were some of the most important key elements of the game. The team intended to create different cycles and loops that would result in different kinds of interaction between the environments. For example, the tide cycle and eruption cycle changes dynamically, and it impacts the growth of plants and the lives of the villagers. According to Chahi, the cycle allows players to anticipate what will <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E

500|$|It is {{considered}} to have [...] "one of the most shocking twists on Black Mirror", as Jenelle Riley of Variety puts it, some time before the third series started. Writing before the third series, Margaret Lyons of The New York Times said it is [...] "the most outright disturbing" [...] episode of Black Mirror. Right after it aired, Cocks deemed it [...] "the single darkest episode of Black Mirror so far" [...] and considered its twist to be [...] "nothing short of genius". Sims stated that it [...] "is, by a significant margin, the most disturbing episode Black Mirror has produced". Although he praised the twist as [...] "a smart one, brilliantly concealed and smartly revealed," [...] he criticized it because [...] "once the point is made, it is made over and over again." [...] Lambie praised its [...] "fearsome pace" [...] and highlighted [...] "its subtle approach", with sparse dialogue, that gives [...] "the events and performances greater impact". He concluded: [...] "its horror-infused drama leaves us unsure whom we can trust or what will <b>happen</b> <b>next,</b> and its last act is truly gut-wrenching". Monahan wrote that the twist was unpredictable and the episode [...] "was an exciting and efficient piece of narrative rug-pulling".|$|E

[...] He went on writing that the song is an extraordinary tribute to her father Mathew Knowles, stating that Beyoncé [...] "embraces [...] the man that has helped take the kind of artistic leap that Dangerously in Love represents." [...] He ended up by adding that [...] "By the time listeners get to the fifteenth and final track, they will have been so pleasantly surprised and impressed by Beyoncé's performance throughout, that 'Daddy' seems less corny" [...] {{but it is in}} this song that she finally accepts the state of being a woman, rather than a girl. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine described the song as an ode dedicated to the man that [...] "instilled perseverance".|$|E
