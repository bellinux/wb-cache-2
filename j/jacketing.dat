5|$|At {{one point}} a {{proposal}} {{was on the}} table to protect the uranium in a reactor from corrosion by <b>jacketing</b> it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used to solder the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E

The coating process consists of a <b>jacketing</b> application via pressurized extrusion. The benefits of PVC coating on wire rope are for not only aesthetics, but for ergonomics, abrasion protection and visibility.

25|$|Seismic {{retrofit}} (or rehabilitation) {{strategies have}} been developed {{in the past few}} decades following the introduction of new seismic provisions and the availability of advanced materials (e.g. fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP), fiber reinforced concrete and high strength steel). Retrofit strategies are different from retrofit techniques, where the former is the basic approach to achieve an overall retrofit performance objective, such as increasing strength, increasing deformability, reducing deformation demands while the latter is the technical methods to achieve that strategy, for example FRP <b>jacketing.</b>|$|E

25|$|For {{reinforced}} concrete beam-column joints – various retrofit solutions {{have been proposed}} and tested in the past 20 years. Philosophically, the various seismic retrofit strategies discussed above can be implemented for {{reinforced concrete}} joints. Concrete or steel <b>jacketing</b> have been a popular retrofit technique until the advent of composite materials such as Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP). Composite materials such as carbon FRP and aramic FRP have been extensively tested for use in seismic retrofit with some success. One novel technique includes the use of selective weakening of the beam and added external post-tensioning to the joint {{in order to achieve}} flexural hinging in the beam, which is more desirable in terms of seismic design.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes viaducts {{may fail}} in the {{connections}} between components. This {{was seen in the}} failure of the Cypress Freeway in Oakland, California, during the Loma Prieta earthquake. This viaduct was a two-level structure, and the upper portions of the columns were not well connected to the lower portions that supported the lower level; this caused the upper deck to collapse upon the lower deck. Weak connections such as these require additional external <b>jacketing</b> – either through external steel components or by a complete jacket of reinforced concrete, often using stub connections that are glued (using epoxy adhesive) into numerous drilled holes. These stubs are then connected to additional wrappings, external forms (which may be temporary or permanent) are erected, and additional concrete is poured into the space. Large connected structures similar to the Cypress Viaduct must also be properly analyzed in their entirety using dynamic computer simulations.|$|E
25|$|Plastic {{products}} are printed with numbers 1–7 {{depending on the}} type of resin. Type 1 (polyethylene terephthalate) is commonly found in soft drink and water bottles. Type 2 (high-density polyethylene) is found in most hard plastics such as milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 (polyvinyl chloride) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, hula hoops, credit cards, wire <b>jacketing,</b> medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 (low-density polyethylene) is found in shopping bags, squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet. Type 5 is polypropylene and makes up syrup bottles, straws, Tupperware, and some automotive parts. Type 6 is polystyrene and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon water bottles, and sunglasses. Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is. Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled.|$|E
50|$|Another {{influence}} is the Japonism in fashion. The Japanese aesthetic became popular within many fashion {{trends in the}} form of simplified kimono <b>jackets,</b> geometric patterns, popular motifs and embroidery. The bomber <b>jacket</b> was influenced by Sukajan <b>jackets,</b> a souvenir <b>jacket</b> from Japan. Sukajan <b>jackets</b> have a similar silhouette to the bomber <b>jacket.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Jacket</b> fetishism {{is usually}} {{associated}} with the fixation or attraction to padded nylon <b>jackets</b> - though {{it can also be}} associated with leather <b>jackets,</b> particularly in association with Bondage (BDSM).

500|$|Lavis's {{design for}} the final viaduct passageway, which would be raised on {{concrete}} piers across the Meadowlands, included two vertical-lift bridges [...] above the Passaic and Hackensack rivers, sufficient {{for the majority of}} ships to pass underneath. He resigned in 1928, believing his task was complete, but in January 1929 the War Department objected to the continued existence of the Lincoln Highway bridges once the skyway was complete. Since the Route1 Extension was not intended for local traffic, and replacing the vertical-lift bridges with tunnels would have been expensive, a compromise was worked out by late 1929 to raise the river bridges to [...] while allowing the Lincoln Highway drawbridges to remain in place. The concrete <b>jacketing</b> of the steel was removed from the plans since it would make the taller fixed bridges heavier. This resulted in more maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|The deck {{above the}} main deck {{was called the}} “boiler deck”. [...] A portion of the boiler, known as the “steam drum” {{protruded}} into the hall on the forward end of boiler deck, and was surrounded with metal <b>jacketing.</b> [...] Overcoats, valises and other things were often stowed on tope of the <b>jacketing</b> while the vessel was under way.|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} work, belt {{fit on the}} Hybrid-III six-year-old (6 YO) anthropomorphic {{test device}} (ATD) was found {{to depend on the}} positioning of the chest <b>jacket</b> of the ATD. Moreover, differences were noted between <b>jackets</b> manufactured by Denton-ATD and First Technology Safety Systems (FTSS). The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify differences between the manufacturers’ <b>jackets</b> by detailed measurements of exemplar <b>jackets</b> and to assess the effects of <b>jacket</b> installation procedure on <b>jacket</b> position. A custom fixture was designed to hold rigidly the thorax, pelvis, and head of a 6 YO ATD while allowing the chest <b>jacket</b> to be installed and removed. Testing was conducted with two <b>jackets</b> from FTSS and one from Denton. In pilot testing, <b>jacket</b> position was affected by the installation procedure and by the initial position of the shoulder components. Detailed measurements were made using a portable surface measurement device (laser scanner) with each <b>jacket</b> in six conditions defined by initial shoulder position and the manner in which the <b>jacket</b> was installed. Quantitative comparisons in <b>jacket</b> position and shape were conducted in software using the laserscan data. Notable differences in <b>jacket</b> shape were observed between the FTSS and Denton <b>jackets,</b> with the FTSS <b>jacket</b> having a wider, flatter profile in the lateral shoulder area and the Denton <b>jacket</b> extending more forward in the upper chest area. However, the effects of <b>jacket</b> positioning were much larger than differences between manufacturers in <b>jacket</b> shape. Pulling the <b>jacket</b> down firmly resulted in <b>jacket</b> shoulder positions relative to the spine differing by more than 25 mm from those obtained by pulling the <b>jacket</b> down lightly, with results dependent on the initial positions of the shoulder components. The results of this study indicate that careful attention to <b>jacket</b> positioning is needed to obtain a consistent relationship between the chest and shoulder surfaces and the ATD skeleton. Pulling the <b>jacket</b> down firmly after initially placing the shoulder components in a downward/rearward position is suggested. Monitoring and adjusting the location of reference points on the <b>jacket</b> relative to specified hard points on the ATD skeletonprovides a means for ensuring that the <b>jacket</b> is consistently placed for static or dynamic testing...|$|R

2500|$|The {{rotary engine}} places severe thermal {{stresses}} on its cases, as {{two sides of}} rotor are constantly exposed to high ignition and exhaust temperatures, while the third side inducts cool fuel/air mixture. To cope with this, and probably capitalizing on their previous experience with water cooling, Suzuki opted for a liquid-cooled engine using two separate systems. Oil is used to lubricate and cool the internals of the rotor and water-cooled the external <b>jacketing.</b> Oil is fed from an engine sump by a trochoid pump at around [...] The oil is then circulated through an oil cooler mounted across the frame and below the radiator. A pressure regulator also acts as a bypass {{in case of a}} blockage in the cooler. A centrifugal pump sends coolant around the external rotor <b>jacketing</b> but via an intricate path in an attempt to even out the massive thermal stresses. Liquid enters at the point of highest temperatures (ignition), passing from the right side to the left, and then makes a 180° turn, returning to the right side and passing near the exhaust port. Most of the coolant is then routed to the very large radiator that sits across the frame in front of the bike. Some of the coolant that was not directed to the radiator is now sent around the inlet port and the left side housing. Its passage is once again reversed before flowing to the radiator. [...] The water cooling is thermostatically controlled, and a shrouded fan {{on the right side of}} the radiator takes care of excessive temperatures, switching on at [...] and cutting when the temperature falls below [...]|$|E
2500|$|All {{so-called}} [...] "fission-fusion-fission" [...] weapons (i.e., all conventional modern thermonuclear warheads) {{employ the}} additional step of [...] "jacket fissioning," [...] using fusion neutrons. This works as follows: the high-energy or [...] "fast" [...] neutrons generated by fusion {{are used to}} fission a fissionable jacket located around the fusion stage. In the past this jacket was often made of natural or depleted uranium; but today's weapons {{in which there is}} a premium on weight and size (i.e., virtually all modern strategic weapons) use moderately-to-highly enriched uranium as the <b>jacketing</b> material (see Oralloy thermonuclear warheads section below). The fast fission of the secondary jacket in fission-fusion-fission bombs is sometimes referred to as a [...] "third stage" [...] in the bomb, but it should not be confused with the obsolete true three-stage thermonuclear design, in which there existed another complete tertiary fusion stage.|$|E
2500|$|Fissionable, non-fissile {{isotopes}} {{can be used}} as {{fission energy}} source even without a chain reaction. Bombarding 238U with fast neutrons induces fissions, releasing energy as long as the external neutron source is present. This is an important effect in all reactors where fast neutrons from the fissile isotope can cause the fission of nearby 238U nuclei, which means that some small part of the 238U is [...] "burned-up" [...] in all nuclear fuels, especially in fast breeder reactors that operate with higher-energy neutrons. That same fast-fission effect is used to augment the energy released by modern thermonuclear weapons, by <b>jacketing</b> the weapon with 238U to react with neutrons released by nuclear fusion {{at the center of the}} device. But the explosive effects of nuclear fission chain reactions can be reduced by using substances like moderators which slow down the speed of secondary neutrons.|$|E

[...] This led to the introduction of the Cartridge S.A.

[...] Similar hollow-point bullets were used in the Mk IV and Mk V loadings, which were put into mass production. The design of the Mk IV hollow-point bullet shifted bullet weight rearwards, improving stability and accuracy over the regular round-nose bullet. [...] These soft-nosed and hollow-point bullets, while effective against human targets, had a tendency to shed the outer metal jacket upon firing; the latter occasionally stuck in the bore, causing a dangerous obstruction. [...] The Hague Convention of 1899 later declared that use of expanding bullets against signatories of the convention was inhumane, and as a result the Mk III, Mk IV, and Mk V were withdrawn from active service. The remaining stocks (over 45 million rounds) were used for target practice.|$|E
