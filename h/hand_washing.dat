5|$|A {{supply of}} easily {{accessible}} uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices {{are important for}} reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis. Personal measures (such as <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> with soap) {{have been found to}} decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration. Avoiding contaminated food or drink should also be effective.|$|E

40|$|Hand hygiene {{compliance}} {{is extremely}} important in hospitals, clinics and food businesses. Caregivers' compliance with hand hygiene {{is one of the}} most effective tools in preventing healthcare associated infections (HAIs) in hospitals and clinics. In food businesses, hand hygiene compliance is essential to prevent food contamination, and thus food borne illness. <b>Washing</b> <b>hands</b> properly is the cornerstone of hand hygiene. However, the <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> compliance rate by the workers (care givers, waiters, chefs, food processors and so on) is not up to the mark. Monitoring <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> compliance along with a reminder system increases the compliance rate significantly. Quality of a <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> is also important which can be achieved by <b>washing</b> <b>hands</b> in accordance with standard guidelines. In this paper, we present Harmony, a <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> monitoring and reminder system that monitors <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> events and their quality, provides real time feedback, reminds the person of interest when he/she is required to <b>wash</b> <b>hands,</b> and stores related data in a server for further use. Worker worn smart watches are the key components of Harmony that can differentiate <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> gestures from other gestures with an average accuracy of about 88 %. Harmony is robust, scalable, and easy to install, and it overcomes most of the problems of existing related systems...|$|R

5|$|Prevention {{includes}} <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> with soap, drinking clean water, {{proper disposal}} of human waste, and breastfeeding babies {{instead of using}} formula. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended in children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts, and sugar). In those who are breast fed, continued breastfeeding is recommended. For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|The only useful ways {{to reduce}} the spread of cold viruses are {{physical}} measures such as <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, thus, highly improbable.|$|E
5|$|Frequent <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> {{reduces the}} risk of viral spread. Wearing a {{surgical}} mask is also useful. Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza. Their benefits in those who are otherwise healthy {{do not appear to be}} greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.|$|E

Distillation was believed by medieval scholars to produce the essence of the liquid being purified, and the term aqua vitae ("water of life") was used as a generic term for all kinds of distillates. The early use of various distillates, alcoholic or not, was varied, but it was primarily culinary or medicinal; grape syrup mixed with sugar and spices was prescribed for a variety of ailments, and rose water was used as a perfume and cooking ingredient and for <b>hand</b> <b>washing.</b> Alcoholic distillates were also occasionally used to create dazzling, fire-breathing entremets (a type of entertainment dish after a course) by soaking a piece of cotton in spirits.

25|$|In {{developing}} countries, <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> {{with soap}} {{is recognized as}} a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health, and even good nutrition. However, a lack of reliable water supply, soap or <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> facilities in people's homes, at schools and at the workplace make it a challenge to achieve universal <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> behaviors. For example, in most of rural Africa handwashing taps close to every private or public toilet are scarce, even though cheap options exist to build handwashing stations.

The vision system is designed to increase accuracy to detect the unclean areas of <b>washed</b> <b>hands</b> after using the GLO GERM. GLO GERM acts as stimulated germs. This system will not only detect the unclean areas, but will also estimate {{the percentage of the}} unclean areas which will be used as further analysis of the efficiency of the system. However, we need to build the <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> prototype using ultraviolet light and a camera that is connected to the computer to process and display the results of the <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> screening audit using image processing software. In the image processing technique, we used hand detection to detect the areas of the palm of the hand and stain on palm detection to detect the unclean areas of the hands using HSV thresholding and RGB masking techniques. We detected the areas of unclean hands which dictated by the colored that has GLO GERM stains. The GUI will show the captured image and detected unclean area image and also the percentage of the unclean areas of the hands. The GUI will notify the decision of clean or unclean based on the percentage of unclean areas. This system design is efficient and commercial in the market especially in HUSM for requirements of health care applications. Other hospitals or industries whom hand hygiene is very crucial are potential buyers...|$|R

25|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>washing</b> {{with soap}} {{is the single}} most {{effective}} and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities worldwide. Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, taking the life of an estimated 1.8 million children per year. Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million child deaths annually. According to UNICEF, turning <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-quarter. <b>Hand</b> <b>washing</b> is usually integrated together with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.|$|E

40|$|Background: Nosocomial {{infection}} rate are often higher for {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) than other units of hospitals, and hands of health-care workers (HCWs) {{play a major role}} in the transmission of the infections. Aim: To compare the efficacy of conventional <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> with the <b>hand</b> rub in reducing the transient bacterial flora on the hands of nurses in ICU. Subject and Methods: The 34 nurses posted in our ICU during January-March 2003 were included. A total of 204 samples were collected for the residual bacterial flora on fingers using impression method on MacConkey agar plates. The subjects then used alcoholic hand rub or conventional <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> and the residual bacterial flora rechecked by testing impression of fingers on MacConkey agar. Results: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., nonlactose fermenting Gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci, and streptococci formed the transient bacterial flora on the hands. Moderate to heavy bacterial density was seen in more than 92. 2 &#x 0025; of the <b>hands</b> before <b>washing</b> or <b>hand</b> rub application. Conventional <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> resulted in drastic reduction in the transient bacterial flora on hands in 50 &#x 0025; cases whereas alcoholic hand rub achieved the effect in 95 &#x 0025; of the samples. Conclusion: Compared with conventional <b>hand</b> <b>wash,</b> alcoholic <b>hand</b> rub is far more efficient in reducing transient bacterial flora on the hands of HCWs and it is more convenient and time saving. It is recommended as a hand hygiene practice in critical areas such as ICU...|$|R
