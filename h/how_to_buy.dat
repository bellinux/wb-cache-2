The introduction also includes a list of places to receive mail-order products. The book goes over the history of curing bacon, discussing the various international traditions.

The {{companies}} were bought relatively cheaply by Australian businessman Robert Holmes à Court, who acquired Associated Communications Corporation (the parent company) in 1982, asset-stripped the subsidiaries, and sacked many long serving employees before selling the companies on again.

Jackson grew more excited as he examined the pages. He inquired about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> songs and what the songs were used for. McCartney explained that music publishing was a way to make big money. Jackson replied by telling McCartney that he would buy The Beatles' songs one day. McCartney laughed, saying [...] "Great.

On one occasion, when a lady in waiting who usually picked up the girls from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, the two girls decided to go shopping in a store when they had a break. They ordered the carriage driver to stop in a shopping district and went into a store where they were not recognized because of their nursing uniforms. However, they discovered that they didn't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> anything because they had never used money. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to go about purchasing an item from a store.

Spin referred to the [...] "R.E.M. model"—career decisions that R.E.M. made which set guidelines for other underground artists to follow in their own careers. Spin's Charles Aaron wrote that by 1985, [...] "They'd shown how far an underground, punk-inspired rock band could go within the industry without whoring out its artistic integrity in any obvious way. They'd figured out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> in, not sellout-in other words, they'd achieved the American Bohemian Dream." [...] Steve Wynn of Dream Syndicate said, [...] "They invented a whole new ballgame {{for all of the}} other bands to follow whether it was Sonic Youth or the Replacements or Nirvana or Butthole Surfers. R.E.M. staked the claim. Musically, the bands did different things, but R.E.M. was first to show us you can be big and still be cool." [...] Biographer David Buckley stated that between 1991 and 1994, a period that saw the band sell an estimated 30 million albums, R.E.M. [...] "asserted themselves as rivals to U2 for the title of biggest rock band in the world." [...] Over the course of its career, the band has sold over 85 million records worldwide.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} econometric {{technique}} for modeling endogenous selectivity in householdsâ€™ quantity outcomes as observed in scanner panel data. Simultaneous models of incidence, brand choice and quantity, that treat quantity outcomes as count data, ignore such self-selectivity considerations in quantity outcomes. Previously proposed approaches to modeling selectivity in continuous quantity outcomes {{do not apply}} to count data. Therefore, we adopt a recently proposed econometric technique to deal with selectivity in count data, and then appropriately extend it to handle correlations of quantity outcomes not only with incidence outcomes but also with brand choice outcomes. Our proposed methodology will be useful to researchers who want to estimate simultaneous models of whether, what and <b>how</b> much <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> decisions of households, treating quantity data as counts.
