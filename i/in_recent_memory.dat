5|$|Great Britain {{had broken}} the Peace of Amiens by declaring war on France in May 1803. In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} became the first step towards {{the creation of the}} Third Coalition. By April 1805, Britain had also signed an alliance with Russia. Austria had been defeated by France twice <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>memory</b> and wanted revenge, so it joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Corzine {{has been}} the only New Jersey {{governor}} <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>memory</b> to make any headway in addressing the crisis of municipal funding. While not directly touching the third rail of New Jersey governance – property taxes – Corzine's reform of the school funding formula (passed and signed in January 2008) resulted in significant relief to many New Jersey towns with outsize school costs but limited tax base. The plan survived a legal challenge and was declared constitutional by the New Jersey Supreme Court on May 28, 2009.|$|E

40|$|Based on the self-memory {{system model}} (SMS; Conway, Singer, & Tagini, 2004) of autobiographical memory, this study uses a large sample of young and middle-aged adults to {{investigate}} the relation between individuals’ current self-characteristics {{and the content of}} both their earliest childhood <b>memory</b> and a <b>recent</b> <b>memory.</b> <b>In</b> the first session, participants’ current self-characteristics were assessed. In the second session, individuals provided a written narrative of their earliest childhood memory and a more <b>recent</b> <b>memory</b> (within-participants design) and rated the self themes present in each memory. In keeping with the SMS model, findings show that current self-characteristics were reflected in individuals’ memories. As predicted, however, <b>recent</b> <b>memories</b> were more frequently linked to current self-characteristics than were earliest memories. All six current self-characteristics predicted the inclusion of these themes <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>memories,</b> but only four self-characteristics were associated with memory themes in earliest memories. The relation between current self-characteristics and memory themes did not differ across young and middle-aged adults, suggesting developmental stability in these relations. Findings provide general support for the SMS model but also suggest possibilities for its extension and refinement...|$|R

5|$|On April 23, 2017, Miller {{was taken}} out of the game after being {{diagnosed}} with an apparent elbow injury. The next day, on April 24, Miller was put on the 10-day disabled list. After MRI tests, it was revealed that Miller's right elbow was diagnosed with a strained flexor strain and a partially torn UCL. On April 29, Miller announced that he would have Tommy John surgery, therefore ending his 2017 season. He officially underwent the surgery on May 10. Miller started four games, with a 2-2 record and 4.09 ERA in 22 innings. Due to Swanson's top prospect status, Inciarte's All-Star nod, Miller's extremely underwhelming 2016 season and Miller's season-ending injury in 2017, the trade has been panned as one of the worst <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E

Nevertheless, while most of the hereditary lands remained a part of the Habsburg realm, France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to the Poles and the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians. Austria lost over three million subjects, about one-fifth of her total population, {{as a result of these}} territorial changes. Although fighting in Iberia continued, the War of the Fifth Coalition would be the last major conflict on the European continent for the next three years.|$|E

5|$|With the {{resumption}} of hostilities, Napoleon (proclaimed Emperor in 1804) planned an invasion of England, spending {{the better part of}} the next two years (1803–05) on this objective. In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement led to the creation of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France and neutralising the threat of invasion. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes, and by April 1805, the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Alarmed by Napoleon's consolidation of northern Italy into a kingdom under his rule, and keen on revenge for having been defeated twice <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>memory</b> by France, Austria would join the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Barça's 2012–13 season {{yet again}} {{began with a}} Supercopa contention, this time another {{incarnation}} of El Clásico. Barcelona would win the first leg at home 3–2 with goals from Messi, Pedro and Xavi, but in the second leg, despite a wonderfully-struck free kick from Messi from 35 yards out, Barcelona would succumb 2–1 to their fiercest foes with goals from Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuaín. In La Liga, Barcelona would shoot straight {{up to the top}} of the league table with a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad. In the most-hyped game of the season so far, Barcelona and Real Madrid would play out what many regard as the best Clásico <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>memory,</b> ending in a 2–2 draw at the Camp Nou with both Messi and Ronaldo netting twice for their respective clubs. Barça would also kick of their Copa del Rey defence with a 3–0 win over Alavés. In the Champions League on 7 November 2012, Barcelona would fall 2–1 to Celtic, with Messi grabbing his third Champions League goal of the 2012–13 season in the 90th minute in Glasgow. Barcelona were eliminated from Europe 0–7 on aggregate in the semi-finals against eventual champions Bayern Munich, the worst-ever aggregate loss in any European competition for the club.|$|E

50|$|Milan {{survived a}} first round fight, {{defeating}} Celtic (eventual champions of that year's Scottish Premier League) 1-0 on aggregate after an extra time goal by Kaká. Milan would {{then go on}} to defeat Bayern Munich 4-2 on aggregate (2-2 at San Siro and 2-0 at Allianz Arena) to reach the semi-finals, marking the third consecutive, and fourth time in five years, that Milan has reached the final four of the competition. The first leg of the semi-final was played against Manchester United at Old Trafford. Manchester scored early on a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, but Milan answered back through a brace from Kaká, ensuring a 1-2 lead at half-time. United would ultimately prove victorious, however, due to two second-half goals from striker Wayne Rooney. This match was regarded by the media and UEFA President Michel Platini as the greatest match <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>memories.</b> The second leg of the semi-final was played at San Siro on 2 May, where Milan played a near-perfect first-half, taking a 2-0 lead into the break with goals from Kaká and Clarence Seedorf. A 78-minute goal by Alberto Gilardino sealed the victory for the home side.|$|R

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that electrolytic lesions of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) produce a severe deficit in contextual fear if made 1 d, but not 28 d, after fear conditioning (). As such, the hippocampus seems {{to play a}} time-limited role in the consolidation of contextual fear conditioning. Here, we examine retrograde amnesia of contextual fear produced by DH lesions in a within-subjects design. Unlike our previous reports, rats had both a remote and <b>recent</b> <b>memory</b> {{at the time of}} the lesion. Rats were given 10 tone-shock pairings in one context (remote memory) and 10 tone-shock pairings in a distinct context (with a different tone) 50 d later (<b>recent</b> <b>memory),</b> followed by DH or sham lesions 1 d later. Relative to controls, DH-lesioned rats exhibited no deficit in remote contextual fear, but <b>recent</b> contextual fear <b>memory</b> was severely impaired. They also did not exhibit deficits in tone freezing. This highly specific deficit <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> contextual <b>memory</b> demonstrated <b>in</b> a within-subjects design favors mnemonic over performance accounts of hippocampal involvement in fear. These findings also provide further support for a time-limited role of the hippocampus in memory storage...|$|R
