50|$|In Canada, all {{veterinary}} drugs used in food production processes {{are required to}} pass stringent tests and regulations set by the Veterinary Drugs Directorate (VDD) and are enforced by the Food and Drug Act of Health Canada. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) monitors all food products in Canada by sampling and testing by veterinarians and inspectors working {{on behalf of the}} provincial and federal governments. They monitor the food supply to condemn and destroy any product that is unacceptable. In the rare case where the CFIA have found a residue, it has been substantially below the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) to make acceptable for safe consumption. The MRL is the maximum amount of a drug residue that may remain in a food product at the time of human consumption. MRLs are safety measures based on Accepted Daily Intakes (ADIs). The ADI level is determined from toxicology studies to be the highest amount of a substance that can be consumed daily throughout a lifespan without causing adverse effects. Beef <b>hormone</b> <b>residues</b> are MRLs that have been established by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives of the United Nations. Although there is growing concern that <b>hormone</b> <b>residues</b> in meat and milk might be harmful to human and animal health, the quantities of hormones found in a serving of meat are far below the level considered to be a risk to the development of cancer. Besides, the World Health Organization stated that the hormone levels are indistinguishable between the implanted and nonimplanted animals.|$|E

Females in the experimental groups were given 0. 2 ml/animal (2. 5 mg/ml) hexoestrol diacetate, intramuscularly. After 30, 60, 90 and 120 days respectively, blood, urine, muscle tissue (by biopsy) samples were harvested in order to determine, through electrochemioiluminescence, the concentrations of the residue of this steroidal compound. Ovaries were also harvested through ovarioectomy for histo-pathological examination. The maximum levels of this <b>hormone</b> <b>residue</b> were identified in urine (the average value being 652, 4 pg/ml, for group I), intermediate values in blood samples (43. 74 pg/ml), while the muscle samples revealed concentrations inferior to the detection limit for the utilized method (18. 4 pg/g). Atretic follicles were present in very large numbers, and the primordial follicle pool was reduced by over 50 % in the ovaries harvested from the experimental group.

30|$|Since the 1990 s, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} awareness about the presence of widespread <b>hormone</b> <b>residues</b> in environment or in food and about the consequent potential human health hazards [9]. Europe, America, Japan, and other developed countries and some of the united organizations (such as OECD, WHO, and WWF) attach great importance to the study of hormone substances [10]. The hazard is identified, but the risks are not quantified. Therefore, the survey about the hormone pollution and the study of the quantitative measurements have become a hot issue of the environmental science in the world. In the recent decades, chromatographic methods applied for the detection of hormone using GC–MS [11], LC–MS [12], HPLC [13], as well as SPE [14] have been reported. These techniques exhibited advantages of sensitivity, specificity, and accurate determination. However, because of necessary cleanup procedures, time-consuming processes, and expensive equipment [15], methods with simplicity, specificity, low-cost, less analytical time, and high-throughput characters should be developed.|$|E

A better understanding of the regulation pathway of bone remodeling has led to the identification of new therapeutic targets. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor κB-ligand (key molecule in osteoclastogenesis) is a fast-working, reversible antiresorptive treatment. A subcutaneous injection is required twice a year, a significant advantage over bisphosphonates whose efficiency is limited by an inadequate long-term compliance. The only anabolic agent currently available, Teriparatide (parathyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>residues</b> 1 - 34), administered daily via subcutaneous injection, stimulates both sides of bone remodeling in favour of bone formation. Anti-sclerostin antibodies neutralize an inhibitor of Wnt pathway, the master switch for osteoblastic differentiation, and meet the challenge of pioneering an anabolic drug that does not increase bone resorption. If the tolerance of these promising treatments is good in clinical trials of short duration, their implication in signaling pathways affecting various tissues means that one has to keep a very close watch on their long-term potential risks.

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{occurrence}} of boar taint, castration of piglets without pain relief is a common practice in pork production. Due to increasing animal welfare concerns, the practice will be banned in organic agriculture from 2012 and alternative methods will have to be implemented. An important factor for the successful implementation of such alternatives is consumers’ acceptance of the methods, as consumers’ daily buying decisions are crucial to the further development of the organic pork sector. Thus, this paper explores organic consumers’ attitudes towards piglet castration without pain relief and three alternative methods and examines which aspects of these alternatives are important to consumers of organic products. The analysis of nine focus group discussions in Germany conducted in fall 2009 and involving a total of 89 participants, shows that castration without pain relief in organic farming was unacceptable for participants. Animal welfare, food safety, taste, and costs were principal aspects that participants used to assess the three alternatives. Participants had mainly favorable attitudes towards castration with anesthesia and analgesia. Although participants had some concerns regarding the fattening of boars (taste), there was openness towards this alternative due to its perceived naturalness. Immunocastration was seen quite critically because participants feared that this alternative might lead to (<b>hormone)</b> <b>residues</b> in meat. Overall, the results suggest that fattening of boars and castration with anesthesia and analgesia could be acceptable alternatives to consumers of organic pork...|$|E
40|$|The steroids {{trenbolone}} acetate (TbA) and melengestrol acetate (MGA) are licensed as growth promoters for farm animals in several meat-exporting countries. Although {{many studies have}} explored their safety for both animals and consumers, {{little is known about}} their fate after excretion by the animal. Our study aimed to determine the residues and degradation of trenbolone and MGA in solid dung, liquid manure, and soil. In animal experiments lasting 8 weeks, cattle were treated with TbA and MGA. Solid dung and, in case of trenbolone, liquid manure were collected and spread on maize fields after 4. 5 and 5. 5 months of storage, respectively. Determination of the <b>hormone</b> <b>residues</b> in all samples included extraction, clean-up (solid-phase extraction), separation of metabolites and interfering substances by HPLC (RP- 18), and quantification by sensitive enzyme immunoassay. Procedures were validated by mass spectrometry (MS) methods. During storage of liquid manure the level of trenbolone decreased from 1, 700 to 1, 100 pg/g (17 alpha-isomer), corresponding to a half-life of 267 days. Before storage, the concentrations in the dung hill ranged from 5 to 75 ng/g TbOH and from 0. 3 to 8 ng/g MGA. After storage, levels up to 10 ng/g trenbolone, and 6 ng/g MGA were detected.

The {{data were obtained}} by a survey method from 224 families living in the urban areas of Tokat Province in June 2010. In this study, a binomial logit model was used to investigate the selected socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of consumers that determine households ’ organic milk consumption choices and non-consumption choices. Housewife education, permanent income, household size, having a working wife, knowledge of organic product has statistically significant impacts on household organic milk choices.

40|$|Agriculture and Food Research Initiate Competitive from USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2010 - 65102 - 20403]Rural {{communities}} in the United States usually use a series of aerated lagoons to treat domestic wastewater. Effluents from these systems are typically discharged to receiving watersheds, {{which leads to a}} potential transfer of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and steroid hormones from sanitary sewage to the environment. The primary objectives of this study are to identify and quantify PPCPs and steroid hormones in rural sewage treatment lagoons, to investigate the removal efficiency of these emerging contaminants in the treatment processes, and to monitor their occurrence in the surrounding watershed. In this study, a method has been developed to analyze thirteen PPCPs and eight steroid hormones in various water samples. Among all of the PPCPs considered, ten chemicals were detected in sewage influents, lagoon waters of different treatment stages, or effluents at concentrations in the ng/L to low mu g/L range. Three hormones were observed in the influents at total concentrations as high as 164 ng/L, but no <b>hormone</b> <b>residues</b> were detected in the effluents. This indicates that the aerated lagoons may effectively remove hormone conthminants. With the exception of carbamazepine, removal rates for the other detected PPCPs were relatively high in the range of 88 to 100 % in September with average air temperature equal to 20 degrees C. However, the removal efficiency of nine PPCPs in the rural wastewater treatment plant exhibited large temporal variability. The concentrations of PPCPs in the lagoon waters and effluents collected in November, with average air temperature equal to 4. 4 degrees C, were 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than those samples collected in September. Occurrence of these PPCP contaminants in the surrounding watershed was also monitored. The discharge of effluents significantly elevated the PPCP concentrations in the receiving creek and increased their occurrence in the adjacent river. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Whereas the interrelationship of sequence and structure {{has been extensively}} investigated, the origins of folding efficiency are enigmatic. We demonstrate that the folding of proinsulin requires a flexible N-terminal hydrophobic residue that is dispensable for the structure, activity, and stability of the mature <b>hormone.</b> This <b>residue</b> (PheB 1 in placental mammals) is variably positioned within crystal structures and exhibits 1 H NMR motional narrowing in solution. Despite such flexibility, its deletion impaired insulin chain combination and led in cell culture to formation of non-native disulfide isomers with impaired secretion of the variant proinsulin. Cellular folding and secretion were maintained by hydrophobic substitutions at B 1 but markedly perturbed by polar or charged side chains. We propose that, during folding, a hydrophobic side chain at B 1 anchors transient long-range interactions by a flexible N-terminal arm (residues B 1 –B 8) to mediate kinetic or thermodynamic partitioning among disulfide intermediates. Evidence for the overall contribution of the arm to folding was obtained by alanine scanning mutagenesis. Together, our findings demonstrate that efficient folding of proinsulin requires N-terminal sequences that are dispensable in the native state. Such arm-dependent folding can be abrogated by mutations associated with β-cell dysfunction and neonatal diabetes mellitus...|$|R

Official veterinary services have been recently informed about the misuse of human injectable contraceptives in pig farms. Farmers and local animal health workers have been suspected of treating pigs for growth promotion and of using human progestins, especially medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), as a chemical alternative method for castration of sows that are then fattened before culling. Indeed, MPA may arrest the onset of farrowing and induce post-lactational anestrus in sows. Because the use of synthetic hormones in pig husbandry is consid¬ered a fraud by the Malagasy legislation, an exploratory study was carried out to confirm these suspicions and investigate the main molecules concerned. We investigated 80 pigs slaughtered in seven Malagasy abattoirs and raised in eight (out of 22) Malagasy regions (i) to confirm the contamination of carcasses by anabolic hormones by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), (ii) to identify the concerned molecules, and (iii) to explore consumers' exposure to <b>hormone</b> <b>residues.</b> Only adult sows were sampled con¬sidering that chemical castration with progestogens {{was the most common}} hypothesis of misuse of synthetic hormones in the field. The screening of the 80 kidney-fat samples did not reveal residues of progestogens other than MPA. MPA-positive samples were detected in 10 out of 15 districts (66. 7 %), and in all eight surveyed regions except one (87. 5 %), Diana Region in Northern Madagascar. Our results revealed heavy contamination of pork products by synthetic hormone residues; its prevalence was high considering that such residues are not supposed to occur accord¬ing to the Malagasy legislation. Investigations by Malagasy vet¬erinary services revealed that farmers and animal health workers purchased syringes of progestogens (Confiance™, Pfizer). These low-price progestins are easily available in private local dispen-saries and basic health centers (public sector). Without any control, farmers can easily administer MPA to pigs. It has thus become urgent to launch public-awareness campaigns and improve control within the sectors of animal production and public health over the entire country. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|In March of {{this year}} the daily press {{discussed}} an American study {{on the relationship between}} the consumption of red meat and an elevated mortality rate caused by diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) evaluated the article by Sinha et al. "Meat Intake and Mortality" and the evidence for a relationship between an increased mortality rate and increased meat consumption. The prospective cohort study examined whether the consumption of red meat, white meat and sausage products led to elevated mortality from cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other causes of death. To this end, the data on meat consumption and the causes of death from around 550, 000 men and women aged 50 to 71 years from six US States and two cities were collected over a period of 10 years. In the study, consumers with the highest intake of red meat and sausage products were found to have a 31 % (men) and 36 % (women) higher mortality rate than people in the group with the lowest consumption. In the case of white meat the reverse effect was observed. According to the BfR, the prospective study is suitable for statistical evaluation of the data. However, no direct causal relationship between meat consumption and cancer and other causes of death can be established from the Sinha study. There are several conceivable causes that could lead to increased mortality from the consumption of red meat: chemical compounds formed during the preparation of meat, genetic factors, dietary habits and life-styles of the respondents, iron content of meat, the intake of unsaturated fatty acids from other foods, the amount of fruit and vegetables consumed and the possible <b>hormone</b> <b>residues</b> in meat. When evaluating the data, the study authors therefore took into account variables such as family history with cancer, smoking, sport, fruit and vegetable consumption which can also influence the study outcome...|$|E
40|$|Development and {{characterization}} of rabbit proximal tubular epithelial cell lines. We have isolated rabbit kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell lines. The selection {{was based on}} their ability to form confluent monolayers on porous supports and to maintain receptor-mediated signal transduction and ion transport, characteristic of the proximal tubule. The isolation method consisted of several steps: (1) superficial cortical proximal tubule segments were microdissected and cultured on a matrix-coated porous support until cells formed a confluent monolayer; (2) primary cultures showing hormone-regulated ion transport typical for the proximal tubule were selected and co-cultured with irradiated fibroblasts; and (3) the epithelial cells surviving after several passages were expanded and passaged on porous substrates. Most of the cell lines developed in this manner were obtained by co-culture with irradiated fibroblasts producing a recombinant retrovirus encoding SV 40 large T antigen and G 418 resistance. However, SV 40 T antigen expression was not essential for immortalization, since neither T antigen nor G 418 resistance was detected in the isolated cell lines and co-culture with non-producing 3 T 3 cells gave similar results. One cell line (vEPT) has been characterized in some detail with respect to morphological, biochemical, and ion transport properties. This line forms confluent monolayers with apical microvilli, tight junctions, and convolutions of the basolateral plasma membrane. Once confluent, monolayers maintain conductances of 25 to 32 mS/cm 2 for several weeks in culture and possess phlorizin-sensitive short-circuit current (Isc) in glucose containing media, indicative of apical Na+-glucose co-transport. vEPT cells also retain receptor and signaling mechanisms for angiotensin II (Ang II). Apical and basal Ang II and 5, 6 -epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (5, 6 -EET) modulate the Isc {{in a manner similar to}} primary cultures. The cell lines share with primary cultures expression of the cytokeratins K 8, K 10 /K 11, and K 19 (“nomenclature” [21]). They also retain several receptor and signal transduction mechanisms. For example, Ang II, arachidonate, bradykinin, 5, 6 -EET, parathyroid <b>hormone</b> (<b>residues</b> 1 through 34), and purine nucleotides increase cytosolic Ca 2 +, PTH elevates cAMP levels, and Ang II enhances proximal tubule-specific arachidonic acid metabolism...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) is {{a natural}} agonist for GLP- 1 R, a G protein-coupled {{receptor}} (GPCR) {{on the surface of}} pancreatic β cells. GLP- 1 R agoinsts are attractive for treatment of type 2 diabetes, but GLP- 1 itself is rapidly degraded by peptidases in vivo. We describe a design strategy for retaining GLP- 1 -like activity while engendering prolonged activity in vivo, based on strategic replacement of native α residues with conforma-tionally constrained β-amino acid residues. This backbone-modification approach may be useful for developing stabilized analogues of other peptide hormones. Many vital physiological processes are modulated by Gprotein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the B family; 1 their natural agonists are long polypeptide <b>hormones</b> (≥ 27 <b>residues).</b> Extensive efforts to develop small-molecule agonists or antagonists of these GPCRs have yielded little success, bu...|$|R
40|$|New {{sanitation}} systems {{based on}} separation at source offer a large potential for resource recovery from wastewater, e. g. energy and nutrients from black water and irrigation water from grey water. This review {{focuses on the}} components in source separated black water. The treatment options for the key components are reviewed, focusing on recovery of organic compounds, nitrogen and phosphorus and removal of <b>hormones,</b> pharmaceutical <b>residues</b> and pathogens. A feasible treatment system for black water (faeces and urine), collected with vacuum toilets, would consist of anaerobic treatment followed by struvite precipitation for phosphorus recovery and autotrophic nitrogen removal. By applying these techniques, {{it is possible to}} produce 56 MJ/p/y of electricity, representing 40 % of the energy that now is required for conventional WWTPs. Furthermore, the production of global artificial phosphorus fertilizer can be reduced by maximum 21 %. As an alternative a higher degree of separation could be applied by separating the urine from the faeces, but this only would be feasible if the urine can be directly reused as a fertilizer. The issue of hormones, pharmaceuticals and pathogens in wastewater and their entry into the environment requires more research to determine to which extent additional treatment is necessary. Finally, the scope of this thesis is explained and the research questions which were addressed are presented...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the level of consciousness of the people who are involved in agricultural activities about food safety and quality. The current study also aims to understand the difference of approaches by different sexes while displaying their perception of food safety and healthy nourishment concerning the consumer choices. The perceptions about food safety in a random sample of 800 different households from rural Turkey which are involved in economic activity both as consumers and producers, was determined and the responsibilities of woman and man in food production were displayed. Besides, information on socio-demographic characteristics of the households was given. The evaluations were performed on the data obtained from 1590 questionnaires answered by a man and a woman in each of a total of 795 household. Some differences were identified between men and women regarding the perception of food safety. The idea that <b>hormones</b> and <b>residues</b> cause harm dominates both groups’ thoughts. In addition, they denoted that the chemical boxes and packaging should be evaluated as threats to food safety. Willingness of the women to participate in the courses that would be given in their locations was high, while their partners’ sensitivity to these courses was low. Some nutrition knowledge was mis-established, and it was determined that, due to the commitment to traditions, in some of the families difficulties may arise in changing the customs...|$|R
