His relief ends abruptly when Angelica arrives - he finds her attractive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the stir of lust.

He praised it for being [...] "full of both fear and curiosity, and those emotions were channeled through its production." [...] Dave Hughes, writing in Slant Magazine, stated: [...] "Ten years on, Aquemini is the single strongest aspect {{of one of the}} art form's deepest benches. Snappier and more experimental than the pair's early work, and focused <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable in a sprawl, it's the moment when OutKast came fully into itself." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1940s, Robey {{appeared}} predominantly in troop concerts {{as himself}} but caused controversy by jokingly supporting the Nazis and belittling black people during his act. His intentions were to gently {{poke fun at}} the [...] "Little Englanders", but audiences {{thought that he was}} sympathising with Nazism. His jocular view that a defeat for Hitler would mean a victory for bolshevism was highlighted in a series of controversial interviews, which caused him much embarrassment when challenged and which he regretted afterwards. His views became known in the press as [...] "Robeyisms", which drew increasing criticism, but his Prime Minister of Mirth remained popular, and he used the character to divert the negative publicity. Cotes wrote that Robey was not a politician, merely a jingoist, who [...] "lived long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> [...] his little-Englander outlook [...] acute embarrassment, and his army of admirers deep dismay." ...|$|E

500|$|Tales of Xillia {{was one of}} the top selling {{games on}} the North American PlayStation Network in August 2013. All English reviewers agreed the battle system was fast and engaging; however, Electronic Gaming Monthly, Game Informer, GameSpot, and PlayStation Official Magazine panned the map designs calling them repetitive, lifeless and bland. The plot {{received}} neutral to positive reception. Game Revolution wrote [...] "There's a pleasing inertia to the way plotlines form, unfold, and reach a conclusion that propels our heroes ever-forward, never stopping long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> meandering but never feeling rushed or forced either.", praising the narrative {{to be one of the}} qualities to the game. Game Informer described the plot as [...] "investing" [...] and liked the balance in tragic and lighthearted moments. Joystiq lauded the execution of the plot for avoiding the usual JRPG [...] "info dumps" [...] and how small plot-lines intertwined into a larger conflict. PlayStation Official Magazine considered the plot as average and called it a let-down compared to the combat system. Reviewers have also noted the dual-protagonist execution caused incoherency in Milla's story.|$|E
500|$|Although Agnes {{initially}} {{continued to}} track northwest, {{passing through the}} Caroline Islands, by the evening of November 1, Agnes moved northward <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{the effects of a}} subtropical ridge anchored to its north, causing the storm to turn west-northwest. Despite its asymmetric structure, the JTWC classified Agnes as a typhoon midday on November2. The storm began to rapidly intensify on November 3, with the JMA upping Agnes to a severe tropical storm at 00:00UTC, and to a typhoon six hours later. Meanwhile, the JTWC elevated the intensity to , which would make it a Category3 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). That afternoon, however, the typhoon began to level off in strength. Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Undang. After developing a small [...] wide eye, at 18:00UTC on November4, the JTWC increased the winds to , equal to Category 4 intensity on the SSHWS, its peak intensity. At the same time, the JMA estimated peak intensity of [...] and a minimum barometric pressure of [...]|$|E

For Steins;Gate, the development team aimed for a rate of [...] "99% science and 1% fantasy"; Shikura called the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II a direct influence on Steins;Gate, citing how it is just believable <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> real. For Robotics;Notes, 5pb. cooperated with JAXA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, to bring further realism to the story. The concept of the phone system used in Steins;Gate was created by Tatsuya Matsuhara at 5pb., who at first wanted the game {{to make use of the}} player's own cell phone, but changed the idea due to concerns that it might have gone against Japanese privacy laws.|$|E
