5|$|Uzbekistan remains {{hesitant}} {{to join the}} Economic Union, with Uzbek officials making opposing claims on the prospect of integration. The country prefers not to pursue economic and political integration as of now. Russian officials have stated that integration with {{the country would be}} slow and analysts state that as Russian influence and trade increases in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan it may persuade Uzbekistan to join in the future. Uzbekistan began its integration process when Russia announced it would write off USD$865 million off debt owed by the country. Uzbekistan joined the CIS <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Area</b> in 2014, meaning it has free trade with EEU member states.|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{preferential}} trade agreements has greatly {{increased over the}} past two decades, yet most existing bilateral arrangements take the form of <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas,</b> and less than ten percent can be considered to be fully °edged customs unions. This paper develops a political economy model of trade policy under imperfect competition to provide a positive explanation for the prevalence of <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas.</b> In a three- country setting, a representative from each prospective member is elected to determine the tariffs to be applied on imported goods. Under a customs union, the necessity to coordinate tariffs leads voters to strategically delegate power to more protectionist representatives. Contrary to most of the existing literature, we show that strategic delegation may imply that <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> increase welfare compared to customs unions. Moreover, the model also indicates that <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> {{are more likely to be}} politically viable than customs unions. ...|$|R
50|$|Free-trade zones {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas.</b> A <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> zone is normally established in a single country, although {{there are a few}} exceptions where a free zone may cross a national border, such as the Syrian/Jordanian <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Zone. <b>Free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> are set up between countries such as the Latin America <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Association (LAFTA), which was created in the 1960 Treaty of Montevideo by Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, or the North American <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Agreement between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. In <b>Free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> tariffs are only lowered between member countries. They should also {{be distinguished from}} customs unions, like the former European Economic Community where several countries agree to unify customs regulations and eliminate customs between the union members.|$|R

5|$|Though both England and Scotland {{recognised}} Anne {{as their}} queen, only the English Parliament had settled on Sophia, Electress of Hanover, as the heir presumptive. The Parliament of Scotland (the Estates) had not formally settled the succession {{question for the}} Scottish throne. In 1703, the Estates passed a bill that declared that their selection for Queen Anne's successor {{would not be the}} same individual as the successor to the English throne, unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants in England and its colonies. At first Royal Assent was withheld, but the following year Anne capitulated to the wishes of the Estates and assent was granted to the bill, which became the Act of Security 1704. In response the English Parliament passed measures which threatened to restrict Anglo-Scottish trade and cripple the Scottish economy if the Estates did not agree to the Hanoverian succession. Eventually, in 1707, both Parliaments agreed on an Act of Union which united England and Scotland into a single political entity, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and established the rules of succession as laid down by the Act of Settlement 1701. The union created the largest <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>area</b> in eighteenth-century Europe.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{distinguishing}} feature of recent regional trade agree-ments is a predominance of <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> in the WTO.

Furthermore we provide two statistical facts to support the results: First, the probability of a country being a hub of overlapping <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> agreements is positive.

40|$|The renewed {{interest}} {{sparked by the}} potential for intraregional cooperation in Latin America and the Caribbean today has been reflected in numerous agreements regarding trade preferences and in attempts to establish <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas,</b> customs unions or common markets. The possibility has even been discussed of setting up <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> arrangements on a hemispheric scale. This plethora of proposals inevitably raises a great many questions. What {{is the reason for}} this {{renewed interest}}? Are the differences between the schemes of today and those of the 1960 s and 1970 s significant enough to avert the obstacles and difficulties encountered by those earlier schemes? What are the most suitable mechanisms and instruments for promoting intra-Latin American integration? What are the defining characteristics of the various categories of integration initiatives, such as <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas,</b> customs unions and common markets? Is it feasible to set up <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> involving countries having very dissimilar levels of development or macroeconomic policies? Would it be wise to work towards a gradual convergence of all these initiatives into a single, regionwide scheme?

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Areas</b> (FTAs) on the incentives for multilateral liberalization and challenges the contention that <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Areas</b> are superior to GATT style (multilateral) trade liberalization {{as a way of}} getting to multilateral <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> for all. Incorporating political economy factors in a model of trade with imperfect competition in segmented markets, this paper reaches two conclusions: First, that preferential arrangements which divert trade away {{from the rest of the}} world are more likely to be supported politically, and second, that such preferential arrangements will reduce member country incentives for multilateral liberalization. It is also argued that in some cases this reduction in incentives could be critical: Multilateral liberalization that is initially feasible could be rendered infeasible by preferential arrangements. The larger the trade diversion resulting from the preferential arrangement, the more likely this will be the case. <b>Free</b> Trade; <b>Trade...</b>|$|R

40|$|A key {{characteristic}} of any trade bloc is its “flexibility ” – {{the extent to}} which it can be modified or augmented by existing members. This paper investigates how prospective trade bloc members value the flexibility of proposed trade agreements in a changing trading environment. We demonstrate that country characteristics as well as the nature of the trade shock influence a nation’s desire for trade bloc flexibility. Our model of endogenous coalition formation yields predictions that are consistent with three stylized facts which characterize regionalism: (i) overlapping trade agreements, (ii) the popularity of <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> relative to customs unions and (iii) renegotiation or disbandment of existing trade agreements is rare. Finally, for the first time in the literature, we provide clear predictions about the identity of “hub ” and “spoke ” trade bloc members when overlapping <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> arise in equilibrium...|$|R
