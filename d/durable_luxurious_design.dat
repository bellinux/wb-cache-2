2500|$|Alpaca fleece is {{the natural}} fiber {{harvested}} from an alpaca. It is light or heavy in weight, depending on how it is spun. It is a soft, <b>durable,</b> <b>luxurious</b> [...] and silky natural fiber. While similar to sheep’s wool, it is warmer, not prickly, and has no lanolin, which makes it hypoallergenic. Alpaca is naturally water-repellent and difficult to ignite. Huacaya, an alpaca that grows soft spongy fiber, has natural crimp, thus making a naturally elastic yarn well-suited for knitting. Suri has no crimp and thus is a better fit for woven goods. The designer Armani has used Suri alpaca to fashion men's and women's suits. Alpaca fleece is made into various products, from very simple and inexpensive garments made by the indigenous communities to sophisticated, industrially made and expensive products such as suits. In the United States, groups of smaller alpaca breeders have banded together to create [...] "fiber co-ops," [...] to make the manufacture of alpaca fiber products less expensive.|$|R
