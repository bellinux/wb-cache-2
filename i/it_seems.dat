5|$|During the interview, Kunichika {{claimed to}} have moved 107 times, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> more likely that he moved only ten times.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> clear (already from {{enumeration}} arguments), {{that not}} all Sudokus can be generated this way.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> that it {{was first}} made for Leona Lewis.|$|E
60|$|Wait, though! Something surely WAS {{stirring}} on the desert--something {{her eyes}} had not observed at first. Now <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> like a cloud; now <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> like a spot of silver; now <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to be a mass of rainbow colors that moved swiftly toward her.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> 'twas {{diamonds}} in the air, or little flakes of frost; [...] <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> 'twas golden smoke around, or sunbeams lightly tost; [...] <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> an elfin music like to reeds and warblers rose: [...] 'Nay!' Lucy said, 'it is {{the wind that}} through the branches flows.' ...|$|R
60|$|To my checked, bridled, disciplined expectation, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> very kind: to my longing and famished thought <b>it</b> <b>seemed,</b> perhaps, kinder than it was.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> {{that the}} {{insignia}} {{had been cut}} out so the tapestries would not be destroyed by the mob when the château was looted in 1793.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> to {{have been}} built on older foundations. The main {{improvement}} made by the Portuguese was to construct a gun deck looking over the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of events over the next 45 years. However, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> likely that the Celtic monks {{returned}} to their old clas.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to me that}} George harped {{too much}} on the getting-upset idea. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> to me the wrong spirit to go about the trip in.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> such {{a ridiculous}} thing to ask, holding her thus in his arms, {{if it were}} true; <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> such a villainous question, if it were not.|$|R
6000|$|At first <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> {{a little}} speck, [...] And then <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> a mist: [...] It moved and moved, and took at last [...] A certain shape, I wist.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> {{that these}} four parties {{actually}} formed two blocs in the election: Annibaldi joined pars Imperii, while Orsini aligned himself with pars Caroli.|$|E
5|$|Thirdly, the teleological {{explanation}} of adaptation is uncomfortable because <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; because <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to attribute {{the action of}} a conscious mind when none {{is assumed to be}} present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically.|$|E
5|$|According to Marshall Hodgson, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> {{that in the}} pre-Islamic times, some Arab Christians made {{pilgrimage to}} the Kaaba, a pagan temple at that time, honoring Allah there as God the Creator.|$|E
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} Denton {{was moved}} to speak of something that had already flickered across his mind. He had hit upon it at last. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> to him so wild a suggestion that he made it only half seriously. But to put a thing into words has ever {{a way of making}} <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> more real and possible than <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> before. And so it was with him.|$|R
60|$|She was chilled, hardened. And {{yet this}} world of passions and {{lawlessness}} was fascinating to her. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> to her a splendid recklessness. Her adventure in life was beginning. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> very splendid.|$|R
60|$|Strange as <b>it</b> <b>seemed,</b> <b>it</b> was {{nevertheless}} true that George had mysteriously disappeared.|$|R
5|$|According to Shahbazi. the Zu'l-faqar and {{the lion}} {{decorated}} the Iranian flags at the time. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> that {{towards the end}} of Fath' Ali Shah’s reign the two logos were combined and the lion representing Ali was given Ali's saber, Zu'l-faqar.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} {{for the sixth}} season, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> as though Kurt and Blaine have broken off the engagement due to difficulties living together and Blaine has moved back to Lima. Kurt later regrets this and decides to continue his schooling in Lima, {{to try to win}} Blaine back.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of darts in many superfamilies of the Stylommatophora, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> likely that love darts appeared during the early evolution of the Pulmonata, and that the ancestors of the Stylommatophora possessed darts already.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> typical. A jerry-built world, apparently. With {{the best}} {{intentions}} <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> impossible to move in it without doing {{more harm than good}} to it, bringing things down about one that one had not intended.|$|R
60|$|At least, so <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to me, {{the first}} day that I went, awe struck, into the High Woods; and so <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to me, the last day that I came, even more awe-struck, out of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, do {{you think}} it was teasing? I did, at first, and then again <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to me that I came out with the word because <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> the right one. I presume I couldn't explain that to her." ...|$|R
5|$|Cubes, {{cylinders}} and pimples {{were deployed}} in long rows, often several rows deep, to form anti-tank barriers at beaches and inland. They {{were also used}} in smaller numbers to block roads. They frequently sported loops at the top for the attachment of barbed wire. There was also a tetrahedral or caltrop-shaped obstacle, although <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> these were rare.|$|E
5|$|Dimorphodon {{has been}} envisioned as a puffin {{analogue}} in the past, but its jaw structure and gait, combined with its poor flight capabilities, {{indicate that it}} was a terrestrial/semiarboreal feeder. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> to have been a predator of small mammals and squamates, and possibly also preyed on large insects.|$|E
5|$|Earth-based {{observations}} {{announced in}} 2005 appeared {{to show that}} Neptune's rings are much more unstable than previously thought. Images taken from the W. M. Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by Voyager 2. In particular, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that the Liberté arc might disappear {{in as little as}} one century.|$|E
6000|$|The Judge was {{as badly}} {{defeated}} as Bradley. He took it very hard. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to give the}} lie to all his prophecies of Democratic progress. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> to him a defeat of Jeffersonian principle. He consoled himself by saying-- ...|$|R
2500|$|... 1969: Sembrava una serata come tante / Gente (<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>it</b> was an {{ordinary}} evening / People) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> like {{a routine}} {{delivery}} job.|$|R
5|$|In St. Joseph Marquis {{worked for}} various newspapers, {{including}} the St. Joseph Daily News, the St. Joseph Gazette, and the St. Joseph Herald. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> that work {{was easy to}} find as many printworkers had left the city after the printworkers union achieved a closed shop.|$|E
5|$|Lucy only {{appears in}} the second half of the poem, where she is linked with the English landscape. As such, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> as if nature joins with the narrator in {{mourning}} for her, and the reader is drawn into this mutual sorrow.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group {{offender}} profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{investigate a}} series of murders mimicking urban legends. The case soon leads them to a psychiatric hospital for violent criminals, where all is not as <b>it</b> <b>seems.</b>|$|E
60|$|And {{suddenly}} the aeropile slipped {{over the edge}} of the Council House and fell. It dropped, tilting at an angle of forty-five degrees, and dropping so steeply that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to Graham, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> perhaps to most of these below, that it could not possibly rise again.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the most}} terrible thing in likenesses I have ever seen," [...] the woman {{continued}} slowly. [...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to me that a}} miracle had happened. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> to me that the dead had come to life." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> that John {{would never}} calm down.|$|R
