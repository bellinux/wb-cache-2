Simple regressions were performed in order to find correlations and determine factors that may affect the flows within the Rio Grande Project. Correlations were found in the difference between Rio Grande below Caballo flows and Rio Grande at El Paso flows, and between the <b>diversion</b> <b>ratio</b> and groundwater levels. Caballo Reservoir release amounts were found to be fairly well correlated with the difference between the Rio Grande below Caballo and the Rio Grande at El Paso gaging stations. The higher the release from Caballo, the lower the percent difference between the two gages. Groundwater levels data was taken from a United States Geological Survey (USGS) well section in the City of Las Cruces, New Mexico. The well section is located in a major losing reach of the Lower Rio Grande River. Groundwater levels and the <b>diversion</b> <b>ratio</b> were found to be highly correlated for certain wells. Groundwater levels have been declining in this section as the <b>diversion</b> <b>ratio</b> has also been declining. A declining <b>diversion</b> <b>ratio</b> points to dropping groundwater levels. The previous year’s groundwater levels could potentially be used to get an estimate of the <b>diversion</b> <b>ratio</b> for an upcoming irrigation season.

30|$|Coming back {{to policy}} implications, notice that {{horizontal}} mergers are commonly proposed and usually accepted {{in case there}} is no substantial lessening of competition or the merger is a necessary condition to achieve efficiency gains. Since the isolated strategic effects do not allow to clear horizontal mergers, we resort to considering efficiency effects linked to horizontal mergers to check the conditions antitrust authorities should impose to clear them for the case of n= 2. To tackle this issue we consider a price index to evaluate unilateral effects of a merger which takes into account, on the one hand, the <b>diversion</b> <b>ratio</b> and the pre-merger margin index and, on the other, the pass-through rate. We find that both the <b>diversion</b> <b>ratio</b> and the pre-merger margin index are greater in a composite good industry, compared to a regular good industry. Thus, despite being counter intuitive, firms’ market power is greater in a four-firm composite good industry than in a standard duopoly of a regular good. The pass-through rate, however, is lower in a composite good industry. An important {{result is that the}} marginal cost saving required for a horizontal merger in order not to increase prices is greater in a composite good industry than in a regular good one. Antitrust authorities should request, therefore, higher savings levels in the case of horizontal mergers in composite good markets.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — To provide {{heterogeneous}} quality-of-service (QoS) {{to various}} applications, the bandwidth of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) {{is divided into}} multiple number of sub-bands, which employ {{a different set of}} transmission technologies, such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), packet scheduling, adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) depending on the traffic type. According to this concept, DiffSeg system, where the two-dimensional resource domain of OFDM is filled with four different resource units, called segments, and the occupancy ratio of each type of segment is determined by the segment map, has been recently proposed in [5][6]. In this paper, we introduce a concept of segment diversion to utilize the radio resource more efficiently considering the status of QoS. We then propose a system optimization model, which finds an optimal segment map and <b>diversion</b> <b>ratios</b> of real-time (RT) connections in order to maximize the residual resource for non-real-time (NRT) traffic while satisfying the minimum QoS requirement of RT traffic.

The amount of flow and sediment discharge entering the intake as well as design of submerged vanes to control sediment depends on determination of dividing stream width. In this study, the experimental tests were carried out at a 30 degree water intake from a trapezoidal section. Three components of velocity data were obtained for different flow conditions.

40|$|Stormwater {{pollutants}} {{caused by}} urban runoff {{are a major}} concern for the Albuquerque Metropolitan Arroyo Flood Control Authority (AMAFCA), and other flood control authorities, as stormwater channels eventually are discharged into natural waterways. One method of improving stormwater quality is diverting frequent storms or the first flush of less frequent storms to a structural debris filter and/or a constructed wetland prior to reentrance into the channel. The focus {{of this study was}} to develop a procedure to allow determination of laterally diverted flows of stormwater from a supercritical channel for treatment. A range of design flows were tested and evaluated for a trapezoidal channel with a lateral outflow pipe. Lateral pipe angle, pipe invert, and vane configurations were tested for outflow efficiency and to observe hydraulic effects in the main channel. A bench-top model was constructed and tested to determine which pipe invert, configuration, and pipe diameter would be used for the larger scale experiments. An 8 inch (20. 32 cm) diameter pipe set across the base of the channel with a pipe invert of 50 % increased the <b>diversion</b> <b>ratio</b> within the range of 15 % to 100 %, depending on the configuration tested. Three pipe angles, 30 °, 45 ° and 90 °, were used in the experiment with the 30 ° pipe diverting the highest amount of water, with 97. 8 % being the lowest at a Froude number of 2. 71 and velocity of 2. 97 ft/s (0. 905 m/s), with little to no negative hydraulic effects to channel flow. A uniform and tapered vane structure at different vane angles, 35 °, 40 ° and 45 °, was added to the different pipe angles to increase the <b>diversion</b> <b>ratio.</b> A tapered vane at a 45 ° vane angle diverted the most water, with a <b>diversion</b> <b>ratio</b> of 97. 31 % being the lowest at a Froude number of 2. 96 and a velocity of 3. 76 ft/s (1. 15 m/s), with a stable jump upstream of the vane. HEC-RAS was used to model three different pipe angles relative to the main channel axis to determine if the numerical program was able to capture the hydraulic effects observed from the physical model. The results from the program are in agreement of the adverse affects that were seen at the different pipe angles.

30|$|First of {{all it is}} {{important}} to comment that the <b>diversion</b> <b>ratio</b> for composite goods is greater (in absolute terms) than that of the regular good industry, D_ 12 >D̅_ 12. The reason is that an increase in one component price affects two composite goods. Thus the opportunity cost of that price increase in terms of sales in favor of the other component of the same type is higher as compared with the regular product market. Secondly, the price margin ratio for the composite good market is greater than that of the regular market, M>M̅. Therefore, four independent firms in a composite good market have more market power than a duopoly in a regular market. Note that higher diversion ratios and higher price margin ratios are conditions that tend to increase the upward pricing pressure after the merger. Thus as products become more substitutes the pressure on prices increases and this is true for both type of goods.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} 50 years, {{influenced}} by global climate change, the East Asian summer monsoon intensity (SMI) changed significantly, {{leading to a}} response by the water cycle of the Yellow River basin. The variation in SMI has three stages: (1) 1951 - 1963, SMI increased; (2) 1963 - 1965, SMI declined sharply, a feature that may be regarded as an abrupt change; and (3) 1965 - 2000, SMI remained at low levels and showed a tendency to decline slowly. The decreased SMI led {{to a reduction in}} water vapour transfer from the ocean to the Yellow River basin, and thus precipitation decreased and the natural river runoff of the Yellow River also decreased. Due to the increase in population and therefore in irrigated land area, the ratio of net water diversion to natural river runoff increased continuously. Comparison of the ratio of net water diversion to natural river runoff before and after the abrupt change in SMI indicates some discontinuity in the response of the man-induced lateral branch of the water cycle to the abrupt change in SMI. The frequently occurring flow desiccation in the lower Yellow River can be regarded as a response of the water cycle system to the decreasing summer monsoon intensity and increasing population. When the ratio of net water <b>diversion</b> exceeded the <b>ratio</b> of natural runoff of the low-flow season to the annual total natural runoff, flow desiccation in the lower Yellow River would occur.

The United States and United Kingdom horizontal merger guidelines released last year incorporate an approach {{based on the work}} of Werden (1996), Farrell and Shapiro (2010 a) and others that uses information local to pre-merger prices to indicate the directional impacts of the mergers. This “first-order ” approach to merger analysis (FOAM) is admirable for adopting both the simplicity and transparency of approaches based on market definition and the fir...|$|E
30|$|If firms do {{the same}} activity, it seems natural to {{consider}} costs savings after a merger due to the similarity in production of both components. 9 Efficiencies are obtained from the rationalization of production, economies of scale, technological progress (know-how, R&D), purchasing economies or savings in factor prices. 10 If efficiency gains are sufficiently large to extend the benefits to consumers, then antitrust authorities have reasons to clear proposed horizontal mergers. Then a direct question raises, which is this minimum required efficiency to clear a horizontal merger in a composite good industry? In order {{to answer this question}} the level of marginal cost saving that results in a non-increase in the price index used is computed. We find that a greater marginal cost saving is required for a horizontal merger in a composite good industry not to increase prices as compared with a horizontal merger in a regular good industry. The above result is interesting for antitrust authorities since it advises them to be more demanding when dealing with horizontal mergers in composite goods industries. We would like to note that this difference is rooted to the higher <b>diversion</b> <b>ratio</b> and margin that arise in composite good industries.|$|E
