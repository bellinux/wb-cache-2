5|$|Mutations in the TREM2 gene <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with a 3 to 5 {{times higher}} risk of {{developing}} Alzheimer's disease.

40|$|This paper reexamines {{growth in}} {{transition}} using panel data to 1997. It suggests that output <b>has</b> <b>been</b> strongly affected by export market growth; that inflation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with weaker output only above a threshold inflation rate; that structural reform <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with weaker output initially, {{but that it}} stimulates higher growth thereafter; and that rapid disinflation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with output losses only {{in the presence of}} pegged exchange rates. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} famous trains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with King's Cross, {{such as the}} Flying Scotsman service to Edinburgh. The Gresley A3 and later {{streamlined}} A4 Pacific steam locomotives handled express services from the 1930s until 1966.

5|$|Antibodies {{to certain}} types of {{chromatin}} organization, in particular, nucleosomes, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> {{with a number of}} autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction. As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.|$|E

25|$|High-dose (10mg/day) NET <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with hepatic veno-occlusive disease, {{and because}} of this adverse effect, NET should not be given to {{patients}} undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, as it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with substantially lower one-year survival post-transplantation.|$|R
50|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with WHIM syndrome. WHIM like {{mutations}} in CXCR4 were recently identified {{in patients with}} Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, a B-cell malignancy. The presence of CXCR4 WHIM mutations <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with clinical resistance to ibrutinib in patients with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.|$|R
5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{started his}} career as a clerk to King Henry II of England in the royal chamber. He {{probably}} owed the position to his brother, who was already in royal service. Coutances may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with the Beaumont family faction at court before beginning work for the king, but this is not certain.|$|E
5|$|Diuretics <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with {{attacks of}} gout. However, a low dose of {{hydrochlorothiazide}} {{does not seem}} to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E

5|$|Dogs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> {{with the}} school's sports teams on an {{unofficial}} basis {{since the late}} nineteenth century. Early dog mascots may have included a mutt called Hoya around 1900, a Borzoi named Richmond Jack in 1906, a bulldog named Hoya in 1907, and a Boston Bull Terrier in 1911. At that time, most mascots were primarily associated with the school's football team, and were cared for by students or individual sports teams, rather than the administration.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{plays a role}} in pain {{processing}} {{in multiple}} levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This {{may be because}} they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may be {{as a result of}} an increase in glucagon levels.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E

5|$|Potbelly sculptures {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{in a variety}} of manners. Investigators have theorised that potbelly sculptures represent dead ancestors. Alternatively, they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with babies or with the poorly understood Fat God of Mesoamerican mythology. Potbelly monuments have also been associated with a group of supernatural entities associated with the domestic hearth. A further interpretation, based on the sculpture found at Teopán in western El Salvador, interprets potbelly figures as pregnant women at full term, possibly in the very act of giving birth.|$|E
