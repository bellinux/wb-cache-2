5|$|Syria {{missed a}} 15 March {{deadline}} for destroying its 12 chemical weapons production facilities. Syria has proposed to instead render the facilities inoperable by sealing their entrances; the U.S. {{and its allies}} oppose this proposal and <b>insist</b> on destruction.|$|E
50|$|Ōno {{consulted}} {{his principal}} retainer, Ōishi Yoshio. Ōno <b>insisted</b> on surrendering to the Tokugawa shogunate, whereas Ōishi and other retainers <b>insisted</b> on defending the castle. However, Ōno <b>insisted</b> on {{the necessity of}} distributing remaining money according to annual earnings, while Ōishi <b>insisted</b> on favoring those with lower incomes. It was distributed according to Ōishi's wish.|$|R

5|$|Mohandar {{tried to}} <b>insist</b> on only sending Nerazim to the sanctuary, but Selendis talked him into {{allowing}} {{a small number}} of templar warriors to accompany the expedition. He agreed, but only if there was no disrespect. Vartanil went along with them, and (much to Mohandar's annoyance) so did Dahl. Mohandar pointed out the protoss were still evaluating her, a terran female.|$|E
5|$|Molly Haskell {{has argued}} that nevertheless, women are mostly {{uncritical}} of the scene, and that by and large it is consistent with what women have in mind if they fantasize about being raped. Their fantasies revolve around love and romance rather than forced sex; they will assume that Scarlett was not an unwilling sexual partner and wanted Rhett {{to take the initiative}} and <b>insist</b> on having sexual intercourse.|$|E
5|$|Only one of {{the small}} {{detachment}} of marines on board participated in the mutiny. While the half-dozen remaining were too outnumbered and taken by surprise to fulfill their role of shipboard police and oppose the mutineers, they did <b>insist</b> on being treated as prisoners of war by the Spanish and were accordingly exchanged six months later, along with the surviving warrant officers.|$|E
25|$|Clifford <b>insisted</b> {{that he had}} no {{knowledge}} of illegal activity at First American, and <b>insisted</b> that he himself had been deceived about the extent of BCCI's involvement.|$|R
60|$|Here again, therefore, we {{find that}} {{in so far as}} we value {{democracy}} and the self-renewing energies of the west, we {{are much more likely to}} find them in the old theology than the new. If we want reform, we must adhere to orthodoxy: especially in this matter (so much disputed in the counsels of Mr. R.J.Campbell), the matter of <b>insisting</b> on the immanent or the transcendent deity. By <b>insisting</b> specially on the immanence of God we get introspection, self-isolation, quietism, social indifference--Tibet. By <b>insisting</b> specially on the transcendence of God we get wonder, curiosity, moral and political adventure, righteous indignation--Christendom. <b>Insisting</b> that God is inside man, man is always inside himself. By <b>insisting</b> that God transcends man, man has transcended himself.|$|R
50|$|Sahir was a {{controversial}} figure {{in that he}} was artistically temperamental. He <b>insisted</b> that the film score should be composed for his lyrics {{and not the other}} way around. He also <b>insisted</b> on being paid one rupee more than Lata Mangeshkar and this created a rift between them. Sahir promoted his girlfriend, Sudha Malhotra's singing career. He also <b>insisted</b> that All India Radio credit lyricists.|$|R
5|$|Still, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, {{as well as}} {{a number}} of other pro-Soviet Russian {{politicians}} and commentators, continue to deny all Soviet guilt, call the released documents fakes, <b>insist</b> that the original Soviet version—Polish prisoners were shot by Germans in August 1941—is the correct one, and call on the Russian government to start a new investigation that would revise the findings of the one concluded in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{action would}} prove {{controversial}} in the United States as several officers' reports suggested that Lieutenant Maley, commander of Experiment, had shown cowardice during the engagement. Lieutenant Porter stated that Maley {{had tried to}} <b>insist</b> on surrendering to the picaroons immediately upon their arrival. It was alleged that Maley thought the situation was hopeless due to {{the sheer number of}} pro-French Haitians who were attacking the convoy, and he had attempted to strike the colors.|$|E
5|$|The folly and {{absurdity of}} the Queen in {{allowing}} this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers themselves do not <b>insist</b> on her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may {{occur on the}} occasion. The idea... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. But it seems everything is conspiring to lower us {{in the eyes of}} Europe.|$|E

5|$|Although he feuded with York {{over the}} primacy, it appears clear that Ralph {{considered}} the Investiture Crisis settled in England for, in 1117 while visiting Rome, {{he took a}} neutral position as regards the issues between the Pope and the Emperor. In 1115, however, he refused to consecrate Bernard as Bishop of St David's in the royal chapel, although Robert of Meulan, the king's chief counsellor, advocated that the consecration must {{take place in the}} royal chapel according to ancient custom. The king did not <b>insist</b> and Ralph won the confrontation. He was also involved in ecclesiastical affairs in Normanday, as he attended the provincial synod, or Council of Rouen, held in 1118.|$|E
5|$|As {{a magnet}} school founded to promote school integration, racial and {{economic}} diversity {{have been important}} factors in admissions decisions. The student body was 52.1percent black, 41.7percent low income, and 7.7percent disabled in 2009–10. In 2007, {{in response to a}} US Supreme Court decision prohibiting racial criteria for assigning students to public schools, CPS eliminated race and gender as determining factors in magnet school admissions. School officials <b>insist</b> this will have little impact, despite parent concerns that the decision will erode diversity.|$|E
5|$|As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser {{evaluated}} Jeter extensively {{before the}} 1992 MLB draft. The Astros held the first overall {{pick in the}} draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, lobbied team management to select him. The Astros feared that Jeter would <b>insist</b> on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract, so they passed on him, instead choosing Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston for $700,000. Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.|$|E
50|$|Kaunda raised Johansson, but he <b>insists</b> {{that she}} is not his mother, {{particularly}} in light of her refusal to take a DNA test for maternity. Kaunda, a former beauty queen, <b>insists</b> that Banda is not his father.|$|R
60|$|The humane {{heart of}} Isabella revolted at such sanguinary counsels: she <b>insisted</b> that their triumph {{should not be}} disgraced by cruelty. Ferdinand, however, was {{inflexible}} in refusing to grant any preliminary terms, <b>insisting</b> on an unconditional surrender.|$|R
50|$|At {{least one}} local {{resident}} <b>insisted</b> on a completely natural {{explanation for the}} phenomena: Mary Fleming, who lived in Dale County {{after the war and}} saw the hole many times, asserted that Sketoe's friends, including one named Wash Reynolds, secretly kept it clean - all while <b>insisting</b> that some supernatural force was to blame. Reynolds adamantly denied this, <b>insisting</b> that he knew no more {{about what was going on}} at the hole than anyone else.|$|R
5|$|As the House of Councillors can veto a {{decision}} made by the House of Representatives, the House of Councillors can cause the House of Representatives to reconsider its decision. The House of Representatives however, can still <b>insist</b> on its decision by overwriting the veto by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|E
5|$|At the {{marriage}} venue, Govindayya plots revenge by inciting Venkatapathy to <b>insist</b> on the dowry being paid before {{the marriage}}. Viyyanna issues a promisory note; Venkatapathy rejects it and drags Ramana from the marriage hall. However, Ramana leaves for Madras and lives there with Ammadu. When Venkatapathy arrives, Ramana feigns mental illness while Ammadu and Raja {{pretend to be}} a nurse and a doctor. Ammadu endears herself to Venkatapathy by showing interest in his recitals of the puranas.|$|E
5|$|Both Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans {{attempt to}} {{diagnose}} {{what is going}} on with Michael. They both see it as a coping mechanism, and both <b>insist</b> that the other reality is a dream. To try to prove this to Michael, Dr. Evans has Michael read a part of the United States Constitution, as if that reality was a dream, Michael could not have done so, unless he had memorized the Constitution. Michael learned that he had alcohol in his system the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E

5|$|Diamond {{writes that}} jury {{consultants}} then compare the three data sets {{to determine which}} background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use that information to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with inexorably biased or dumb jurors; in turn, practitioners <b>insist</b> this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.|$|E
5|$|From then on, {{relations}} {{became increasingly}} strained between Matilda and Henry. The couple suspected that they lacked genuine support in England for {{their claim to}} the throne, and proposed in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda and should <b>insist</b> that the Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to her. This {{would have given the}} couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death, but the King angrily refused, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy while he was still alive. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert had {{previously}} been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but this hearing came to nothing for two reasons. One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. The second reason was {{that no one had}} a copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a private meeting with a number of the attendees, where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to <b>insist</b> that they were the only persons who could judge the case.|$|E
50|$|Jawad {{said his}} interrogators <b>insisted</b> {{he was a}} spy for the Taliban, Iran and Pakistan,that his family had all been {{captured}} and had already confessed, {{and that he was}} being held because his Canadian employers had <b>insisted</b> on it.|$|R
25|$|Baxter <b>insisted</b> {{that the}} Calvinists {{of his day}} ran the danger of {{ignoring}} the conditions that came with God's new covenant. Justification, Baxter <b>insisted,</b> required at least some degree of faith as the human response to the love of God.|$|R
5000|$|Islam <b>insists</b> {{that only}} God is eternal; {{everything}} else was created by him ex nihilo. Mormonism denies this, <b>insisting</b> that matter and intelligence are equally eternal, and that God only [...] "organized" [...] them, rather than creating them out of nothing.|$|R
