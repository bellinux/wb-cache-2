Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>be</b> colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations.|$|E

500|$|Historian H. M. Walbrook {{wrote in}} 1921 that Pinafore [...] "satirizes {{the type of}} {{nautical}} drama of which Douglas Jerrold's Black-Eyed Susan is a typical instance, and the 'God's Englishman' sort of patriotism which consists in shouting a platitude, striking an attitude, and doing {{little or nothing to}} help one's country". G. K. Chesterton agreed that the satire is pointed at the selfishness of [...] "being proud of yourself for being a citizen" [...] of one's country, which requires no virtuous effort of will to resist the [...] "temptations to belong to other nations" [...] but is merely an excuse for pride. In 2005, Australian opera director Stuart Maunder noted the juxtaposition of satire and nationalism in the opera, saying, [...] "they all sing 'He is an Englishman', and you know damn well they're sending it up, but the music is so military... that you can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>be</b> swept up in that whole jingoism that is the British Empire." [...] In addition, he argued that the song ties this theme into the main satire of class distinctions in the opera: [...] "H.M.S. Pinafore is basically a satire on... the British love of the class system.... f course [...] can marry [...] daughter, because he's British, and therefore he's great'". Jacobs notes that Gilbert is lampooning the tradition of nautical melodrama in which the sailor's [...] "patriotism guarantees his virtue".|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 37 reviews. Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone called the album {{one of her}} strongest efforts. Jim Carroll from The Irish Times hailed M.I.A. as [...] "a musical super-sharpshooter with an incredible ear for hard-bodied pop tracks (Bad Girls, Come Walk With Me, Exodus) that boil and steam the most mutant genres into submission." [...] Gavin Haynes of the NME wrote, [...] "MIA takes the basic template of right-now chart music and subverts it by forcing it to work triple time". He continued, [...] "Beats are constantly morphing, and every track chucks handfuls of sonic debris at you", Likewise, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted, [...] "Like the woman who made it, Matangi is hugely inventive and a bit exhausting: if it's hard to take in anything other than small doses, you can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>be</b> glad it exists". However, Petridis also acknowledged the abrasiveness of the album's sonic scope: [...] "More characteristic is , an unyielding, punishing rhythmic assault on which the only semblance of a tune comes from a distorted electronic horn section".

[...] "Lose Control" [...] was inspired by Balsamo's loud guitar and contains influences from Portishead.

He wrote that [...] "Spit & Eggs" [...] was a welcome episode for longtime fans, as it involved several plots converging {{in a way that}} he found satisfactory. He praised the final few scenes, writing that the episode transitions well into the next mystery of Dean O'Dell's death by developing it slowly {{over the course of the}} season's prior episodes, but he was more mixed towards the reveal of Mercer as the rapist, commenting [...] "the ultimate revelation can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>be</b> a little underwhelming, since not enough time has been spent on any of the credible suspects to really have a good handle on them or be invested in them one way or another." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, who was quite critical of the rape storyline in earlier episodes, said that the conclusion made the storyline slightly better overall. He praised the double reveal of Mercer and Moe as accomplices, stating, [...] "That twist overall is effective because it plays on everyone's expectations.
