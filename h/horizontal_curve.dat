25|$|Collisions {{tend to be}} more {{frequent}} in locations where a sudden change in road character violates the driver's expectations. A common example is a sharp curve {{at the end of a}} long tangent section of road. The concept of design consistency addresses this by comparing adjacent road segments and identifying sites with changes the driver might find sudden or unexpected. Locations with large changes in the predicted operating speed are likely to benefit from additional design effort. A <b>horizontal</b> <b>curve</b> with a significantly smaller radius than those before it may need enhanced curve signs.|$|E

To {{be able to use}} the trams on the desired lines, Oslo Sporveier had to upgrade its infrastructure several places. The SL95 need a vertical curve radius of , requiring upgrades at Wessels plass and Gamlebyen. The curves would also need to be fixed at Geita Bridge, but this was not done since the trams exceed the bridge's permitted load. The minimum permitted <b>horizontal</b> <b>curve</b> radius is , making it impossible for the trams to operate through the intersection between Riddervolds gate and Inkognitogata, where the radius is [...] This means the trams cannot operate on the Briskeby Line, and all trams to Majorstuen are therefore operated with SL79.

2500|$|Sky Screamer, a first-generation Intamin Freefall ride, was {{constructed}} in the Plaza de Fiesta section and opened in 1983. Consisting of a tower reaching [...] in height and a horizontal braking runout, Sky Screamer had an L-shaped appearance. It featured eight uniquely designed gondolas, each holding four riders. The gondolas used one set of wheels to go up the lift and down the drop (4 large wheels at each back corner), but used a different set in the transfer and loading and unloading area of the ride (smaller rollers located {{on the bottom of}} the gondola). Gondolas were lifted upward through a shaft in the tower's center by a lift chain. Once at the top, the gondola was disengaged from the lift chain and pushed forward into the drop position. The gondola was released into freefall following the sounding of a loud klaxon (which was audible throughout sections of the park and often lured visitors to the ride). A pair of guide rails ran downward along the outside of the tower before curving into the horizontal braking runout. The freefall drop into the <b>horizontal</b> <b>curve</b> applied a g-force of 4.5 on the riders. In late 1983, 50% more anti-rollback devices were installed. The additional anti-rollbacks were staggered on each side of the lift. These modifications were intended to improve stopping ability in wet conditions and were a response to a non-fatal accident on a similar ride at another park. In 1986, the ride's [...] "G-Block" [...] was moved farther down the horizontal braking runout. The end of [...] "H-Block" [...] was extended to the beginning of the station conveyors in 1994. Sky Screamer was dismantled on November 2, 1997.|$|E

If in fig. 24, PN represent a horizontal wire passing by a marked magnetic pole, so that the direction of its motion shall coincide with the curved line proceeding from below upwards; or if its motion parallel to itself be in a line tangential to the curved line, but {{in the general direction of}} the arrows; or if it pass the pole in other directions, but so as to cut the magnetic curves[A] in the same general direction, or on the same side as they would be cut by the wire if moving along the dotted curved line;--then the current of electricity in the wire is from P to N. If it be carried in the reverse directions, the electric current will be from N to P. Or if the wire be in the vertical position, figured P' N', and it be carried in similar directions, coinciding with the dotted <b>horizontal</b> <b>curve</b> so far, as to cut the magnetic curves on the same side with it, the current will be from P' to N'. If the wire be considered a tangent to the curved surface of the cylindrical magnet, and it be carried round that surface into any other position, or if the magnet itself be revolved on its axis, so as to bring any part opposite to the tangential wire,--still, if afterwards the wire be moved in the directions indicated, the current of electricity will be from P to N; or if it be moved in the opposite direction, from N to P; so that as regards the motions of the wire past the pole, they may be reduced to two, directly opposite to each other, one of which produces a current from P to N, and the other from N to P.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis documents an evaluation of the relationships between accident rates at <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> and preceding tangent length and sight distance. Data collection and statistical methods used to evaluate this relationship are presented. A base relationship between accident rates at <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> and degree of curvature was established, and the effects of various variables on this relationship were examined. These variables included lane width, total pavement width, state in which the data was collected, tangent length and sight distance. Analysis was performed to determine whether these variables should be included in an operating-speed or workload based consistency model. The analysis of lane width, total pavement width, and state demonstrated no practical significance for explaining the variability in the relationship between accident rate at <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> and degree of curvature. Therefore, none of these variables were included in the final model. This thesis included two hypothesis: (11) tangent length is a significant factor that should be included in an operating- speed or workload based consistency model, and (2) preceding sight distance is a significant factor that should be included in an operating-speed or workload based consistency model. Regression analysis on this database suggested that neither tangent length nor preceding sight distance are significant variables in explaining the variability in accidents on <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves</b> for a given degree of curvature category. Results, however, did verify that degree of curvature is a strong predictor of accident rates on <b>horizontal</b> <b>curves...</b>|$|R

In order to increase speed limit compliance, the RSA team proposed the use of automatic speed cameras.
