5000|$|Leicester Tigers won {{the match}} 15-9, {{becoming}} {{the first team to}} defend the trophy successfully. [...] In the first minute Tigers had a try by Freddie Tuilagi ruled out for illegal blocking on Munster wing John Kelly. Munster took a 3-0 lead from Ronan O'Gara's penalty before Tigers had a second try ruled out inside the first 10 minutes, Martin Johnson had pounced on a Frankie Sheahan over throw but referee Joël Jutge was not ready and the throw re-taken. After 20 minutes O'Gara slotted his second penalty for a 6-0 lead after Lewis Moody had been ruled offside. Geordan Murphy scored Tigers first try after a sweeping break from Tim Stimpson and dummy before finding Murphy to make it 6-5 when the conversion was missed. A scrum penalty against Darren Garforth gave O'Gara his third penalty goal for a 9-5 lead. However once Harry Ellis, a try scorer in the semi final, was introduced on 52 minutes the game swung into Leicester's favour. Tigers turned down kicks at goal in search of the try that came when Austin Healey darted over, Tim Stimpson's conversion gave Leicester a 12-9 lead. O'Gara missed an opportunity to level the scorers and seconds later Stimpson slotted the last points of the game for a 15-9 final score. More drama was to come though as Munster wing Kelly thought he had scored in the corner, only to be denied by a last <b>ditch</b> <b>cover</b> tackle by man of the match Healey.|$|E

50|$|Construction of {{the castle}} was begun on 15 March 1614 and {{was more or less}} {{completed}} only four months later. That the castle, which including the outer <b>ditches</b> <b>covered</b> more than 60 hectares, was completed so quickly derives {{from the fact that it}} had only earthwork walls and no donjon (Tenshukaku). One of the corner towers (yagura) near the main gate was expanded to three-stories tall in order to fulfill the role instead. The reason for these austerities was that in 1614 the Shogunate was preparing for the Siege of Osaka and had to concentrate its resources.|$|R

50|$|The Bull Oak is an {{oak tree}} in a field near Lytchett Minster, inscribed with a coffin and the legend 'SC 1849'. The field belonged to a Samuel Crumpler, the SC in the inscription, who kept his bull there. In 1849, {{in order to prove}} the bull wasn't dangerous, Crumpler took a walk across the field and was {{promptly}} gored to death. The Remedy Oak just outside Verwood, is where King Edward VI stopped to rest while out hunting one day. At that time it was believed that an anointed king was so sacred he had the ability to cure the sick and so when the locals heard of his presence they gathered around him asking to be touched. This the king dutifully did. A third famous tree in the county is the Monmouth Ash which stood a few miles north of Bournemouth.

Two-month-old cape gooseberry plants, propagated by seeds, {{were subjected to}} different durations of continuous waterlogging in a greenhouse: 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 days, with evaluations up to 50 days. The plants were placed in <b>ditches</b> <b>covered</b> with polyethylene and filled with water up to 5 cm above the substrate surface of the pots. The parameters evaluated were: plant height, leaf area, stem diameter, dry weight of the aerial part, root and reproductive organs, and general symptoms following a wilting scale. The 6 and 8 -day-waterlogged plants were the most affected by the flooding conditions, presenting the lowest values for all the measured variables. Due to the oxygen stress in the root zone, the plants showed yellowing, epinasty, necrosis and abscission of the leaves, more so in the 8 -day-waterlogged plants.

40|$|International audienceMan-made {{drainage}} networks consisting {{primarily of}} ditches {{have been constructed}} by farmers for centuries to remove excess water from ﬁelds. In addition to removing water, ditch networks are involved in other hydrological processes, such as redistributing soil or pesticides. To maintain the hydraulic capacity of ditches, farmers apply various management regimes to regulate <b>ditch</b> vegetation <b>cover</b> that can impact the aforementioned hydrological processes. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterise the time-varying impacts of ditch management regimes on vegetation cover and to discuss the resulting hydrological impacts. The vegetation associated with the surveyed ditches was observed and used to deﬁne the different ditch management regimes and to quantify their impacts on <b>ditch</b> vegetation <b>cover.</b> The management regimes were heterogeneous and involved a combination of dredging, chemical weeding, mowing and burning. The variety of management practices and the frequency with which they were applied to the ditches resulted in strong spatial variability in the vegetation cover and in strong temporal variability for a given ditch. Finally, it is probable that the surveyed management regimes had time-varying and contrasting impacts on the hydraulic capacity of ditches, the erosion of ditch banks, sedimentation and pesticide retention in the ditches, as indicated by the extensive literature on these topics...|$|R

40|$|Conduits {{buried in}} narrow {{trenches}} {{and covered with}} granular soil backfills are commonly used for several services. Because of soil arching action, a significant fraction of self-weight of the backfill is transferred to the wall. The load {{on top of the}} conduit is expressed as Cd γ B 2 where γ is the unit weight of granular backfill, B is the trench width, and Cd is the load coefficient, which increases with depth. Values of Cd for <b>ditch</b> conduits <b>covered</b> with granular backfills have been presented in the literature. Recent research has shown that providing a layer of geosynthetic above the conduit, anchored at both the walls, can reduce the overburden load transferred to the conduit. This paper is aimed at formulating a theoretical framework for computing the load coefficient CdR for <b>ditch</b> conduits <b>covered</b> with geosynthetic-reinforced granular backfills. The new CdR -value takes into account the load reduction attributable to soil arching as well as geosynthetic arching but ignores the soil-geosynthetic frictional/adhesion interaction in the analysis for simplicity’s sake. It is shown that the CdR -values depend on the stiffness of the geosynthetic layer and the rut depth, among other factors that govern the unreinforced case. The developed expression should be useful for field applications of geosynthetics in buried structures and for developing standards for such applications...|$|R

40|$|Drainage ditches are {{ubiquitous}} yet understudied {{features of}} the agricultural landscape. Nitrogen pollution disrupts the nutrient balance of drainage ditch ecosystems, {{as well as the}} waterbodies in which they drain. Denitrification can help ameliorate the impact of N-fertilization by converting reactive nitrogen into dinitrogen gas. However, factors affecting denitrification in drainage ditches are still poorly understood. In this study, we tested how within-ditch and regional environmental conditions affect denitrifier activity, abundance, and community structure, to understand controls on denitrification at multiple scales. To this end, we quantified in situ denitrification rates and denitrifier abundance in 13 drainage ditches characterized by different types of sediment, vegetation and land-use. We determined how denitrification rates relate to denitrifier abundance and community structure, using the presence of nirS, nirK and nosZ genes as a proxy. Denitrification rates varied widely between the ditches, ranging from 0. 006 to 24 mmol N m− 2 h− 1. <b>Ditches</b> <b>covered</b> by duckweed, which contained high nitrate concentrations and had fine, sandy sediments, were denitrification hotspots. We found highest rates in ditches next to arable land, followed by those in grasslands; lowest rates were observed in peatlands and nature reserves. Denitrification correlated to nitrate concentrations, but not to nirK, nirS and nosZ abundance, whereas denitrifier-gene abundance correlated to organic matter content of the sediment, but not to nitrate concentrations. Our results show a mismatch in denitrification regulators at its different organizational scales. Denitrifier abundance is mostly regulated at within-ditch scales, whereas N-loads, regulated by landscape factors, are most important determinants of instantaneous denitrification rates...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{contribution}} is to refresh my studies on Gaspare Beretta, published in the 90 ’s. At the service of three kings, Philip IV, Charles II, Philip V, thanks to his memory of 1696 {{we know a lot}} about his life: from the first enrollment 1639 - 51, to his election as State’s First Engineer in 1657, up to being designated as Engineer of Factories, from 1651 to 1703. The documents analyzed, which are often autograph, are locate in: Biblioteche Trivulziana e Ambrosiana, Civica Raccolta «Bertarelli», Archivi di Stato di Milano e Torino; Archivo General de Simancas, and Osterreichisches Staatsarchiv, Kriegsarchiv, Vienna. The accurate drawings, of great skill, often with captions, reveal a mature awareness in the theories and techniques of representation of cities, fortresses and territory, especially when compared to the previous generation. The new grammar of the bastioned front is characterized by bulwarks of larger sizes, multiple levels of artillery in casemates and open pit, greater use of advanced works - ravelins, crescents, counterguards, lunettes, arrows, batten - with <b>ditches,</b> <b>covered</b> roads and feasting divided by gabions, paradoxes, bearers stands, with border squares, hub, supportive. The drawings will be cross evaluated with various documents and compared with drawing schools, geometry and military strategies. Beretta, therefore, has a strong profile in European defense context.

2500|$|When the Duke {{had left}} his horse at Woodyates Inn, he {{exchanged}} clothes with a shepherd, who was soon discovered by local loyalists and interrogated. Dogs were then put onto the Duke's scent. Monmouth dropped his gold snuff-box, full of gold pieces, in a pea-field, where it was afterwards found. From Woodyates Inn the Duke had gone to Shag's Heath, {{in the middle of}} which was [...] a cluster of small farms, called the [...] "Island". Amy Farrant gave information that the fugitives were concealed within the Island. The Duke, accompanied by Busse and Brandenburgher, remained concealed all day, with soldiers surrounding the area and threatening to set fire to the woodland. Brandenburgher deserted him at 1 am, and was later captured and interrogated, and is believed to have given away the Duke's hiding place. The spot was at the north-eastern extremity of the Island, now known as Monmouth's Close, in the manor of Woodlands, the property of the Earl of Shaftesbury. At about 7 am Henry Parkin, a militia-soldier and servant of Samuel Rolle, discovered the brown skirt of Monmouth's coat as he lay hidden in a <b>ditch</b> <b>covered</b> with fern and brambles under an ash tree, and called for help.

The garrison was, however, fully equal in strength to the force of Peterborough, and {{should have been able to}} defend the city against an army vastly exceeding their own numbers.

There is a singular fire in the besieging party. For example, Four Grenadiers,--I think of this First Column, which succeeded sooner, certainly of the Regiment Glasenapp,--four grenadiers, owing to slippery or other accidents, in climbing the glacis, had fallen a few steps behind the general body; and on getting to the top, took the wrong course, and rushed along rightward instead of leftward.

[...] Three of the grenadiers stand to see that done; the fourth runs off for force, and happily gets back with it before the comedy had become tragic for his comrades.
