40|$|ABSTRACT: Avalanche {{control by}} {{explosives}} {{is among the}} key temporary preventive measures and fixed avalanche control installations are frequently installed today. Hitherto, {{little is known about}} weak layer failure and crack propagation due to an explosion. In the winter 2013 - 2014 we performed field ex-periments on a flat study site. We triggered slurry explosive charges ranging from 4. 25 to 5 kg as used <b>in</b> <b>avalanche</b> <b>control</b> at different heights above the snow surface. At three different distances from the point of explosion we measured surface air pressure and accelerations within the snowpack at various depths. Cameras were placed in the snow pits for recording weak layer failure and crack propagation and to monitor the snowpack deformation by particle tracking velocimetry. We assessed whether weak layer fail-ure occurred and if so whether it was caused by crack propagation or the direct impact of the air pressure wave above the point of observation (pit). We compared these results to the data recorded by the accel-erometers and microphones to obtain magnitudes required to cause weak layer failure in a given snow-pack. First results show loading conditions using explosives required to fail a weak layer given a certain snowpack...|$|E
50|$|To {{mitigate}} the hazard of avalanches, social interventions {{reduce the incidence}} and prevalence of human avalanche involvement by modifying the behavior of people, so that their use of avalanche terrain is adapted to prevent their involvement <b>in</b> <b>avalanches.</b> <b>Avalanche</b> <b>control</b> organizations accomplish this by targeting awareness and education programs at communities that frequent avalanche terrain. Surveys of avalanche accidents have observed that most avalanches that involve people are caused by people, and of those victims many were unaware {{of the risk of}} avalanche occurrence. To address this observation, introductory awareness and education programs provide instruction in the avoidance of hazardous avalanche involvement through the recognition of avalanche terrain, the observation of snow pack instabilities, and the identification of human activities that cause <b>avalanches.</b> <b>Avalanche</b> <b>control</b> organizations also publicly disseminate forecasts, bulletins, warnings, and reports of avalanche activity to assist communities of avalanche terrain users.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Avalanche</b> <b>control</b> or <b>avalanche</b> defense {{activities}} {{reduce the}} hazard avalanches pose to human life, activity, and property. <b>Avalanche</b> <b>control</b> {{begins with a}} risk assessment conducted by surveying for potential avalanche terrain by identifying geographic features such as vegetation patterns, drainages, and seasonal snow distribution that are indicative of avalanches. From the identified avalanche risks, the hazard is assessed by identifying threatened human geographic features such as roads, ski hills, and buildings. <b>Avalanche</b> <b>control</b> programs address the avalanche hazard by formulating prevention and mitigation plans, which are then executed during the winter season. The prevention and mitigation plans combine extensive snow pack observation with three major groups of interventions: active, passive, and social - sometimes more narrowly defined as [...] "explosive", [...] "structural", and [...] "awareness" [...] {{according to the most}} prevalent technique used <b>in</b> each. <b>Avalanche</b> <b>control</b> techniques either directly intervene {{in the evolution of the}} snow pack, or lessen the effect of an avalanche once it has occurred.

The results indicate that two pound air charges are more effective at releasing avalanches than two pound hand charges,while for four pound charges both delivery methods perform equally. Neither the delivery method nor the size of the charge seems to effect the size of the avalanche.

50|$|Explosive {{techniques}} {{involve the}} artificial triggering of smaller less destructive avalanches, by detonating charges either above {{or on the}} snow surface. The explosives may be deployed by manually hand tossing and lowering, by bombing from a helicopter, or by shelling with a small howitzer, recoilless rifle, or air gun. In balancing the hazard to personnel with {{the effectiveness of the}} deployment method at accessing and triggering avalanche terrain, each method has its drawbacks and advantages. Among the newest methods, strategically placed remote controlled installations that generate an air blast by detonating a fuel-air explosive above the snow pack <b>in</b> an <b>avalanche</b> starting zone, offer fast and effective response to <b>avalanche</b> <b>control</b> decisions while minimizing the risk to <b>avalanche</b> <b>control</b> personnel; a feature especially important for <b>avalanche</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> transportation corridors. For example, the Avalanche Towers (Sprengmast) installed in Switzerland, Austria, and Norway use solar powered launchers to deploy charges from a magazine containing 12 radio controlled charges. The magazines can be transported, loaded, and removed from the towers by helicopter, without the need for a flight assistant, or on site personnel.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The U. S. Forest Service {{initiated}} <b>avalanche</b> <b>control</b> and forecasting <b>in</b> the United States. The Forest Service manages {{large tracts}} of publicly owned land called National Forests and they permit certain activities and businesses on those lands. The Forest Service began permitting ski areas on National Forests in 1938 when they issued a special use permit to Alta Ski Area in Little Cottonwood Canyon near Salt Lake City, Utah. Almost immediately the Forest Service realized that avalanches threatened the public both while they traveled the Little Cottonwood Canyon Road to reach Alta Ski Area and while they actually skied. The Forest Service hired Douglass Wadsworth to help mitigate the threat and {{he became the first}} Forest Service Snow Ranger. The Forest Service Snow Ranger Program grew {{to become one of the}} most effective and innovative <b>avalanche</b> <b>control</b> and forecasting programs in the world. Forest Service Snow Rangers pioneered the use explosives for <b>avalanche</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the US, developed the first effective <b>avalanche</b> forecasting programs <b>in</b> the US, and initiated the use of military artillery for <b>avalanche</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the US. My paper will trace the development of the Military Artillery for <b>Avalanche</b> <b>Control</b> Program <b>in</b> the United States from its inception to today. It will explain how military artillery work, examine alternatives to military artillery, discuss three 106 mm RR accidents and discuss the future of military artillery for <b>avalanche</b> <b>control</b> <b>in</b> the U.

40|$|Complex systems {{close to}} their {{critical}} state can exhibit abrupt transitions, avalanches, between their metastable states. It is a challenging task to understand the mechanism of the <b>avalanches</b> and <b>control</b> their behavior. Here we investigate microwave (mw) stimulation of <b>avalanches</b> <b>in</b> the so- called vortex matter of type II superconductors, a system of interacting Abrikosov vortices close to the critical (Bean) state. Our main finding is that the avalanche incubation strongly depends on the excitation frequency, a completely unexpected behavior observed close to the so-called depinning frequencies. Namely, the triggered vortex <b>avalanches</b> <b>in</b> Pb superconducting films become effectively inhibited approaching the critical temperature or critical magnetic field when the mw stimulus {{is close to the}} vortex depinning frequency. We suggest a simple model explaining the observed counter- intuitive behaviors as a manifestation of the strongly nonlinear dependence of the driven vortex core size on the mw excitation intensity.
