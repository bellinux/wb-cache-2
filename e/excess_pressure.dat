25|$|Fermentation {{of sugar}} into alcohol during {{winemaking}} always means that {{carbon dioxide is}} released. Carbon dioxide has the property of being very soluble in water (the main constituent of wine), a property that is utilized in sparkling wines. Production always starts from a base wine (where the carbon dioxide from the first fermentation has been gasified). In i.a. Champagne production the base wine is usually a blend of wines from different grape varieties and different wineries, where the distribution gives the final wine its special character, called cuvée. In some commonly used methods the base wine undergoes a secondary fermentation, which encloses the resulting carbon dioxide under <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> and binds it to the liquid in the sparkling wine. In this way the carbon dioxide content is created which, after opening the bottle, produces the bubbles. The dead yeast cells form a precipitate called lees, that often helps with appealing aromas to the sparkling wine but looks unappetizing. The lees is therefore normally removed before the wine is distributed.|$|E
25|$|If {{a bubble}} or an object exists which {{collects}} gas molecules {{this collection of}} gas molecules may reach a size where the internal pressure exceeds the combined surface tension and external pressure and the bubble will grow. If the solvent is sufficiently supersaturated, the diffusion of gas into the bubble will exceed {{the rate at which}} it diffuses back into solution, and if this <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> is greater than the pressure due to surface tension the bubble will continue to grow. When a bubble grows, the surface tension decreases, and the interior pressure drops, allowing gas to diffuse in faster, and diffuse out slower, so the bubble grows or shrinks in a positive feedback situation. The growth rate is reduced as the bubble grows because the surface area increases as the square of the radius, while the volume increases as the cube of the radius. If the external pressure is reduced due to reduced hydrostatic pressure during ascent, the bubble will also grow, and conversely, an increased external pressure will cause the bubble to shrink, but may not cause it to be eliminated entirely if a compression-resistant surface layer exists.|$|E

The achieved result can provide a foundation for further study for CPTU mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{consolidation}} {{behavior of}} soils {{is dependent upon}} {{the shape of the}} initial <b>excess</b> pore water <b>pressure</b> distribution. Despite this fact, a uniform distribution of <b>excess</b> pore <b>pressure</b> is commonly adopted in most geotechnical problems. In the case of land reclamation on soft soil foundations, a variety of non-uniform initial <b>excess</b> pore <b>pressure</b> distributions can be generated during various stages of the land reclamation process, as different loading and placement conditions are encountered. Two examples of land reclamation have been discussed, highlighting the conditions during which linearly increasing and decreasing initial <b>excess</b> pore <b>pressure</b> distributions can be expected to occur. The resulting <b>excess</b> pore <b>pressure</b> dissipation and consolidation settlement of a clay layer subjected to these distributions are investigated, with particular focus on the effect of one- or two-way initial drainage conditions...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} are developed for one-dimensional consolidation of double-layered saturated soil subjected to groundwater fluctuations. The {{solutions are}} derived by an explicit mathematical procedure using Duhamel’s theorem {{in conjunction with}} a Fourier series, when groundwater fluctuation is described by a general time-dependent function and assumed to be the pore water pressure variations at the upper boundary. Taking as an example the harmonic groundwater fluctuation, the relevant response of the <b>excess</b> pore water <b>pressure</b> is discussed in detail, and the main influencing factors of the <b>excess</b> pore <b>pressure</b> distribution are analyzed. A dimensionless parameter θ has been introduced because it significantly affects the phase and the amplitude of <b>excess</b> pore <b>pressures.</b> The influences of the coefficients of permeability and compressibility of soil on the <b>excess</b> pore <b>pressure</b> distribution are different and cannot be incorporated into the coefficient of consolidation in double-layered soil. The relative permeability ratio of two clayey soils also plays an important role on the curves of the distributions of the <b>excess</b> pore <b>pressures.</b> The effects of the thickness of the soil layer on the <b>excess</b> pore <b>pressure</b> distribution should be considered together with the dimensionless parameter θ and the permeability and compressibility of the double-layered soil system...|$|R
25|$|If {{the water}} {{in direct contact with}} the {{pressure}} transfer mechanism (diaphragm or piston and the spring balancing the internal pressure) of the regulator freezes, the mechanism will be locked in the position at which the freezing takes place, as the ice will prevent the movement required to close. Since the cooling takes place during flow through the regulator, it is common for the freezing to occur when the first stage valve is open, and this will freeze the valve open, allowing a continuous flow through the first stage. This will cause the inter-stage pressure to rise until the second stage opens to relieve the <b>excess</b> <b>pressure,</b> the pressure relief valve on the first stage opens, or a low pressure hose or fitting bursts. All of these effects will allow the flow through the first stage to continue, so the cooling will continue, and this will keep the ice causing the problem frozen. To break the cycle it is necessary to stop the gas flow or expose the ice to a heat source capable of melting it. While underwater, it is unlikely to find a heat source to thaw the ice and stopping the flow is only option. Clearly the flow will stop when the pressure in the cylinder drops to ambient, but this is undesirable as it means total loss of the breathing gas. The other option is to close the cylinder valve, shutting off the pressure at the source. Once this is done, the ice will normally melt as heat from the surrounding water is absorbed by the slightly colder ice, and once the ice has melted, the regulator will function again.|$|E

500|$|DCS is {{best known}} as a diving {{disorder}} that affects divers having breathed gas that is at a higher pressure than the surface pressure, owing to the pressure of the surrounding water.

The specific risk factors are not well understood and some divers may be more susceptible than others under identical conditions. [...] DCS has been confirmed in rare cases of breath-holding divers who have made a sequence of many deep dives with short surface intervals; and it may be the cause of the disease called taravana by South Pacific island natives who for centuries have dived by breath-holding for food and pearls.|$|E

500|$|Surgery may be necessary, e.g. {{to relieve}} <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> on the cord, to {{stabilize}} the spine, or to put vertebrae back in their proper place.

[...] Sometimes a patient has too many other injuries to be a surgical candidate this early.

500|$|Records of PTE exist from {{as early}} as 3000 BC. [...] Trepanation, in which a hole is cut in the skull, {{may have been used}} to treat PTE in ancient cultures. [...] In the early 19thcentury, the {{surgeons}} Baron Larrey and WC Wells each reported having performed the operation for PTE. [...] The French-educated American surgeon Benjamin Winslow Dudley (1785–1870) performed six trepanations for PTE between the years of 1819 and 1832 in Kentucky and had good results despite the unavailability of antisepsis. The surgery involved opening the skull at the site of injury, debriding injured tissue, and sometimes draining blood or fluid from under the dura mater. [...] Dudley's work was the largest series of its kind that had been done up to that point, and it encouraged other surgeons to use trepanation for post-traumatic seizures. [...] His reports on the operations came before it was accepted that surgery to relieve <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> within the skull was effective in treating epilepsy, but it helped set the stage for trepanation for PTE to become common practice. [...] The procedure became more accepted in the late 19thcentury once antisepsis was available and cerebral localization was a familiar concept. [...] However, in 1890, the prominent German physician Ernest von Bergmann criticized the procedure; he questioned its efficacy (except in particular circumstances) and suggested that operations had been declared successful too soon after the procedures to know whether they would confer a long-term benefit. [...] The late 19thcentury saw the advent of intracranial surgery, operating on brain lesions believed to be causing seizures, a step beyond cranial surgery which involved just the skull and meninges. [...] By 1893, at least 42 intracranial operations had been performed for PTE in the US, with limited success.|$|E

Gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble but the effects of long term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever-increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up. If left undiluted, improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring and/or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a fuel injection system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate (if applicable to the vehicle). Storage should be in an airtight container (to prevent oxidation or water vapors mixing in with the gas) that can withstand the vapor pressure of the gasoline without venting (to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions) at a stable cool temperature (to reduce the <b>excess</b> <b>pressure</b> from liquid expansion, and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions).
