25|$|In 1820, Godwin {{published}} Of Population: An Enquiry Concerning the Power of Increase in the Numbers of Mankind as a rebuttal to Malthus' essays. Godwin's main {{argument was}} against Malthus' notion that population tends to grow exponentially. Godwin believed that for population to double every twenty-five years (as Malthus had asserted {{had occurred in}} the United States, due to the expanse of resources available there), every married couple {{would have to have}} at least eight children, given the rate of childhood deaths. Godwin himself was one of thirteen children, but he did not observe the majority of couples in his day having eight children. He therefore concluded:In reality, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> taken up the pen with the express purpose of confuting all the errors of Mr Malthus’s book, and of endeavouring to introduce other principles, more cheering, more favourable to the best interests of mankind, and better prepared to resist the inroads of vice and misery, I might close my argument here, and lay down the pen with this brief remark, that, when this author shall have produced from any country, the United States of North America not excepted, a register of marriages and births, from which it shall appear that there are on an average eight births to a marriage, then, and not till then, can I have any just reason to admit his doctrine of the geometrical ratio.|$|E

Garran, along with others such as Atlee Hunt, worked essentially as secretaries to Barton's federation campaign, drafting correspondence and planning meetings. At one late night meeting, planning a speech Barton was to give in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield, Barton coined the phrase [...] "For the first time, we have a nation for a continent, and a continent for a nation"; Garran recalled that the now famous phrase [...] "would have been unrecorded <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> happened to jot it down." ...|$|E

During the session Russell provided {{a model of the}} table used and a photograph of the room, and questioned Gordon-Cumming about the bets where cheating had been suspected. Russell also asked him about why he had signed the document agreeing not to play cards: Gordon-Cumming stated that he had [...] "lost my head... on that occasion. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> lost my head I would not have signed that document". Gordon-Cumming's cross-examination ran into the second day, after which he was then re-examined by Clarke; his time in the witness box lasted until 1pm. The Illustrated London News considered that [...] "Gordon-Cumming made an admirable witness... leaning easily on the rail, his grey-gloved left hand resting easily on the bare right, perfectly dressed, his tones equable, firm, neither over-hurried nor over-deliberate, cool, but not too cool".|$|E

500|$|Her {{marriage}} to Ernst suffered a further blow in 1897, when Victoria {{returned home from}} a visit to her sister Queen Marie of Romania and reportedly caught Ernst {{in bed with a}} male servant. She did not make her accusation public, but told a niece that [...] "no boy was safe, from the stable hands to the kitchen help. He slept quite openly with them all." [...] Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard of trouble in the marriage from Sir George Buchanan, her chargé d'affaires, but refused to consider permitting her grandchildren to divorce because of their daughter, Elisabeth. Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and, when Queen Victoria died in January 1901, significant opposition {{to the end of the}} marriage was removed. The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901. Ernst, who had at first resisted the divorce, came to believe it was the only possible step. [...] "Now that I am calmer I see the absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and driving me nearly mad," [...] Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg. [...] "For to keep up your spirits and a laughing face while ruin is staring you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless. I only tried for her sake. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> loved her so, I would have given it up long ago." [...] Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was. [...] "Though both had done their best to make a success of their marriage, it had been a failure ...heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and I had noticed how they were gradually drifting apart." [...] The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe. Tsar Nicholas wrote to his mother that even death would have been better than [...] "the general disgrace of a divorce." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the tension}} between the two {{seemingly}} unresolved, following England's victory over Australia in the 4th Ashes Test at Melbourne which saw England retain the Ashes {{for the first time since}} the 1986-87 Ashes, Pietersen claimed that without the removal of Moores, England would not have been in a position to beat Australia, claiming the change in regime brought about a better working climate within the squad. [...] Pietersen went on to say: [...] "You know what - I have never said this before - I lost the captaincy, I got rid of the captaincy for the good of English cricket, and we would not be here today <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> done what I did then." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lynch got {{approval}} from Propaganda to switch projects; however, production {{was scheduled to}} begin {{two months after the}} rights had been purchased, forcing the director to work fast. He had Cage and Dern read Gifford's book and wrote a draft in a week. By Lynch's own admission, his first draft was [...] "depressing and pretty much devoid of happiness, and no one wanted to make it". Lynch did not like the ending in Gifford’s book where Sailor and Lula split up for good. For Lynch, [...] "it honestly didn’t seem real, considering the way they felt about each other. It didn’t seem one bit real! It had a certain coolness, but I couldn’t see it". It was at this point that the director's love of The Wizard of Oz (1939) began to influence the script he was writing and he included a reference to the [...] "yellow brick road". Lynch remembers, [...] "It was an awful tough world and there was something about Sailor being a rebel. But a rebel with a dream of the Wizard of Oz is kinda like a beautiful thing". Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. read an early draft of the screenplay and did not like Gifford’s ending either, so Lynch changed it. However, the director was worried that this change made the film too commercial, [...] "much more commercial to make a happy ending yet, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> changed it, so that people wouldn’t say I was trying to be commercial, I would have been untrue to what the material was saying".|$|E
2500|$|On the surface, the {{two main}} {{characters}} have little in common. As O'Brian wrote in The Ionian Mission, [...] "Although (they) were almost as unlike as men could be, unlike in nationality, religion, education, size, shape, profession, habit of mind, they were united in a deep love for music, and many and many an evening had they played together, violin answering cello or both singing together far into the night." [...] This musical connection began in the first paragraph of the first book in the series, when the two characters meet at a concert. They also share a delight in puns and dry witticisms, and particularly memorable wordplay is sometimes repeated in subsequent novels in the series, years later in book-time. One character in the novel, Sir Joseph Blaine, saw the two friends as romantics, in his remarks on Maturin in HMS Surprise Chapter 4: [...] "As I was saying, strong; but not without his weaknesses. He was blaming his particular friend for romantic notions the other day - the friend who is to marry the daughter of that woman we saw just now - and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been so shocked by his condition, I should have been tempted to laugh. He is himself a perfect Quixote: an enthusiastic supporter of the Revolution until ‘93; a United Irishman until the rising, Lord Edward’s adviser.... And now Catalan independence. Or perhaps I should say, Catalan independence from the beginning, simultaneously with the others. But always heart and soul, blood and purse in some cause from which he can derive no conceivable personal benefit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Our Rabbis {{taught that}} the {{obligation}} to confess sins comes {{on the eve of}} the Day of Atonement, as it grows dark. But the Sages said that one should confess before one has eaten and drunk, lest one become inebriated in the course of the meal. And even if one has confessed before eating and drinking, one should confess again after having eaten and drunk, because perhaps some wrong happened during the meal. And even if one has confessed during the evening prayer, one should confess again during the morning prayer. And even if one has confessed during the morning prayer, one should do so again during the Musaf additional prayer. And even if one has confessed during the Musaf, one should do so again during the afternoon prayer. And even if one has done so in the afternoon prayer, one should confess again in the Ne'ilah concluding prayer. The Gemara taught that the individual should say the confession after the (silent recitation of the) Amidah prayer, and the public reader says it in the middle of the Amidah. Rav taught that the confession begins: [...] "You know the secrets of eternity [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Samuel, however, taught that the confession begins: [...] "From the depths of the heart [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Levi said: [...] "And in Your Torah it is said, [...] " [...] (...) Rabbi Johanan taught that the confession begins: [...] "Lord of the Universe, [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Rav Judah said: [...] "Our iniquities are too many to count, and our sins too numerous to be counted." [...] Rav Hamnuna said: [...] "My God, before I was formed, I was of no worth, and now that I have been formed, it is as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been formed. I am dust in my life, how much more in my death. Behold, I am before You like a vessel full of shame and reproach. May it be Your will that I sin no more, and what I have sinned wipe away in Your mercy, but not through suffering." [...] That was the confession of sins used by Rav all the year round, and by Rav Hamnuna the younger, on the Day of Atonement. Mar Zutra taught that one should say such prayers only if one has not already said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] but if one has said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] no more is necessary. For Bar Hamdudi taught that once he stood before Samuel, who was sitting, and when the public reader said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] Samuel rose, and so Bar Hamdudi inferred that this was the main confession.|$|E

2500|$|Megan Lehmann, {{writing in}} The Hollywood Reporter, {{said that the}} film [...] "defies {{all but the most}} cynical not to get carried away by the force of its grandiose imagery and storytelling", and it is [...] "much less earnest than the trailer suggests, layered with a thin veneer of camp and a nod and a wink to {{accompany}} the requisite Aussie clichés", {{and the bottom line is}} [...] "In epic style, Baz Luhrmann weaves his wizardry on Oz". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, noting [...] "Baz Luhrmann dreamed of making the Australian Gone with the Wind, and so he has, with much of that film's lush epic beauty and some of the same awkwardness with a national legacy of racism". David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Kidman seems to blossom under Luhrmann's direction: she's funny, warm and charming, and the erotic charge between her and the gruff, hunky Jackman is delicious. In a solemn season, Australias bold, kitschy, unapologetic artifice is a welcome respite". In her review for the New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "this creation story about modern Australia is a testament to movie love at its most devout, cinematic spectacle at its most extreme, and kitsch as an act of aesthetic communion". Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Australia is clearly a labor of love, and a matter of national pride. It is also a bit of a mess. I must confess that I might have been harder on Mr Luhrmann's film <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> remained entranced by Ms Kidman ever since I first saw her in Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm in 1989; in my opinion, she has lost none of her luster in the 20 years since". In his review for Time, Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "Have you seen everything Australia has on offer a dozen times before? Sure you have. It's a movie less created by director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann than assembled, Dr Frankenstein-style, from the leftover body parts of earlier movies. Which leaves us asking this question: How come it is so damnably entertaining?" [...] Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, opines that, [...] "in its heart of hearts Australia is an old-fashioned Western - a Northern, if you will - and all the more enjoyable for it." [...] Nick Rogers, of FilmYap, adds that, [...] "Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns — dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves." [...] Ann Hornaday, in her review for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "A wildly ambitious, luridly indulgent spectacle of romance, action, melodrama and revisionism, Australia is windy, overblown, utterly preposterous and insanely entertaining". In her review for Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek wrote, [...] "The second half of Australia, Luhrmann's attempt to pull off a wartime weeper, is so aggressively sentimental that it begins to feel more like punishment than pleasure. I left Australia feeling drained and weakened, as if I'd suffered a gradual poisoning at the hands of a mad scientist".|$|E
