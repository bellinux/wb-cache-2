50|$|<b>Ethoxylation</b> is {{sometimes}} combined with propoxylation, the analogous reaction using propylene oxide as the monomer. Both reactions are normally {{performed in the}} same reactor and may be run simultaneously to give a random polymer, or in alternation to obtain block copolymers. Propylene oxide is more hydrophobic than ethylene oxide and its inclusion at low levels can significantly affect {{the properties of the}} surfactant. In particular ethoxylated fatty alcohols which have been 'capped' with ~1 propylene oxide unit are extensively marketed as low-foaming surfactants.|$|E
50|$|Alcohol ethoxylates are not {{observed}} to be mutagenic, carcinogenic, or skin sensitizers, nor cause reproductive or developmental effects. One byproduct of <b>ethoxylation</b> is 1,4-dioxane, a possible human carcinogen. Undiluted AEs can cause dermal or eye irritation. In aqueous solution, {{the level of}} irritation {{is dependent on the}} concentration. AEs are considered to have low to moderate toxicity for acute oral exposure, low acute dermal toxicity, and have mild irritation potential for skin and eyes at concentrations found in consumer products.|$|E
50|$|The {{starting}} materials are usually primary alcohols as they react ~10-30x faster than do secondary alcohols.Typically 5-10 units of ethylene oxide {{are added to}} each alcohol, however ethoxylated alcohols can be more prone to <b>ethoxylation</b> than the starting alcohol, making the reaction difficult to control and leading {{to the formation of}} a product with varying repeat unit length (the value of n in the equation above). Better control can be afforded by the use of more sophisticated catalysts. Ethoxylated alcohols are considered to be a high production volume (HPV) chemical by the US EPA.|$|E
50|$|Industrial <b>ethoxylation</b> is {{primarily}} performed upon fatty alcohols {{in order to}} generate fatty alcohol ethoxylates (FAE's), which are a common form of nonionic surfactant. Such alcohols may be obtained by the hydrogenation of fatty acids from seed oils, or via hydroformylation in the Shell higher olefin process. The reaction proceeds by blowing ethylene oxide through the alcohol at 180 °C and under 1-2 bar of pressure, with potassium hydroxide (KOH) serving as a catalyst. The process is highly exothermic (ΔH -92000 J/mol of ethylene oxide reacted) and requires careful control to avoid a potentially disastrous thermal runaway.|$|E
50|$|Some {{products}} containing SLES contain traces (up to 279 ppm) of 1,4-dioxane, {{which is}} {{formed as a}} by-product during the <b>ethoxylation</b> step of its production. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that these levels be monitored. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies 1,4-dioxane as a probable human carcinogen (not observed in epidemiological studies of workers using the compound, but resulting in more cancer cases in controlled animal studies), and a known irritant with a no-observed-adverse-effects level of 400 milligrams per cubic meter at concentrations significantly higher than those found in commercial products. Under Proposition 65, 1,4-dioxane is classified in the U.S. state of California to cause cancer. The FDA encourages manufacturers to remove 1,4-dioxane, though it is not required by federal law.|$|E
5000|$|As alcohol {{ethoxylate}} based surfactants are non-ionic {{they typically}} require longer ethoxylate chains than their sulfonated analogues {{in order to}} be water-soluble. Examples synthesized on an industrial scale include octyl phenol ethoxylate, polysorbate 80 and poloxamers.Ethoxylation is commonly practiced, albeit on a much smaller scale, in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries to increase water solubility and, in the case of pharmaceuticals, circulatory half-life of non-polar organic compounds. In this application, <b>ethoxylation</b> is known as [...] "PEGylation" [...] (polyethylene oxide is synonymous with polyethylene glycol, abbreviated as PEG). Carbon chain length is 8-18 while the ethoxylated chain is usually 3 to 12 ethylene oxides long in home products. They feature both lipophilic tails, indicated by the alkyl group abbreviation, R, and relatively polar headgroups, represented by the formula (OC2H4)nOH.|$|E
50|$|To avoid {{contamination}} and suppress {{the formation of}} by-products (which are difficult to remove) the reaction must be performed under careful control of mass ratios and process conditions. Excess sulfite (SO32−) or bisulfite (HSO3−) lead to an unpleasant odor of the downstream product, higher levels of ethylene glycol or glycol ethers (formed by the hydrolysis and <b>ethoxylation</b> of ethylene oxide) give hygroscopic and greasy surfactants. Concentrated ethylene glycol-containing sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate solutions can subsequently mostly be freed from ethylene glycol by continuous extraction with e.g. isopropanol (<0.5%). Therefore, in the continuous industrial process an aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfite solution is prepared in a first reactor by mixing a sodium hydroxide solution and sulfur dioxide. In a second reactor the sodium hydrogen sulfite solution is mixed with a slight excess of ethylene oxide to obtain sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate in almost quantitative yields at elevated temperature and pressure with a precise control of pH. The reaction has to take place under the exclusion of oxygen and under precise control of the stoichiometry of the reactants, the temperature, the pH and the throughput.|$|E
40|$|The {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) technique was applied to describe the mixing and the chemical reactions in commercially operated stirred <b>ethoxylation</b> reactors. Two reactor sizes in the existing <b>ethoxylation</b> operations were studied in this work: a laboratory-scale autoclave with a single-Rushton turbine and an industrial-scale reactor with a dual-Rushton turbine. The <b>ethoxylation</b> reactor contents were described as an incompressible, turbulent single-phase liquid mixing regime with chemical species undergoing heat and mass transfer. Since the accurate experimental <b>ethoxylation</b> flow data could not be extracted from the industrial operations, {{the development of the}} CFD model for the <b>ethoxylation</b> process was undertaken in two stages. The first stage simulated a single-phase liquid agitation system based on the literature with experimental data on velocities, such as Wu and Patterson [1989. Laser-Doppler measurements of turbulent-flow parameters in a stirred mixer. Chemical Engineering Science 44, 2207 - 2221], for a Rushton stirred reactor of standard configuration. Once validated, the numerical model was applied to compute the flow field in <b>ethoxylation</b> reactors. The second stage integrated the <b>ethoxylation</b> kinetics into the numerical model and simulated the <b>ethoxylation</b> process. In the simulation of the mean flow field, the qualitative features of the literature data were well reproduced. The computed results of both the ethylene oxide consumption and the temperature calculation compared very well with the measurements in the laboratory-autoclave operations. Reasonably good agreement was also reached between the simulated and experimental data on the time-dependent changes of ethylene oxide mass fraction in the bulk liquid in the industrial <b>ethoxylation</b> operations. These demonstrate that the CFD process model was capable of predicting the reaction behaviour and would be useful for exploration of any opportunity for increasing the <b>ethoxylation</b> capacity in the industrial operations...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the <b>ethoxylation</b> of two hydroxy acids was {{undertaken}} {{to determine if there}} was any group selectivity of <b>ethoxylation.</b> The hydroxy acids chosen for study were 12 -hydroxystearic and lactic acid. Standard <b>ethoxylation</b> reactions were carried out using one mole of ethylene oxide to one mole of each hydroxy acid. Unlike typical fatty acids or alcohols, 12 -hydroxystearic a id and lactic acid both ethoxylate without a catalyst. This could be explained by the presence of both a hydroxyl and carboxyl in the reaction solution or the presence of both groups in the same molecule. We suggest hat {{this may be due to}} some type of complex forming between the oxide and the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, since blends of stearic acid and stearyl alcohol fail to ethoxylate without a catalyst. Despite the fact that carboxyl groups of the hydroxy acids studied ethoxylate almost exclusively under base catalyst, and predominately with no catalyst, the reaction rate does not show an induction period, which would be expected for carboxyl group <b>ethoxylation.</b> The <b>ethoxylation</b> rates approximate those of primary alcohols under base catalyst. <b>Ethoxylation</b> of both hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups has been practiced for many years in the preparation of many surface-active agents.

40|$|Two <b>ethoxylation</b> reactors, powered with dual-Rushton impeller, were {{investigated}} {{in this paper}} using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
