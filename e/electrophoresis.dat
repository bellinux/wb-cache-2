5|$|To obtain more {{detailed}} information on the impurity profile of oligonucleotides, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS or HPLC-MS) or capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> mass spectrometry (CEMS) are used.|$|E
5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel <b>electrophoresis.</b> Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel <b>electrophoresis.</b>|$|E
5|$|After a {{successful}} insertion into a circular orbit at , the first experiments began; {{the first two}} samples were run through the Continuous Flow <b>Electrophoresis</b> System, and measurements were taken for the atmospheric luminosities study. A hydraulic circulation pump failed, but this was worked around and it proved to have no impact on operations.|$|E
5|$|Proteins may be {{purified}} {{from other}} cellular components {{using a variety}} of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, <b>electrophoresis,</b> and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification. Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} 16S ribosomal DNA suggest that S.iniae {{is closely related}} to other streptococcal pathogens of humans and animals. Specifically, it is clustered in the pyogenic group, along with other pathogenic streptococci such as S.pyogenes, S.agalactiae, S.uberis, S.canis, S.porcinus, S.phocae, and S.intestinalis. Of these related species, it is most closely related to S. porcinus. Genomic restriction fragment analysis of diverse host and geographical panels of S.iniae isolates has shown common profiles between virulent fish and human strains, though multiple pulsed field gel <b>electrophoresis</b> patterns have been identified among human isolates.|$|E
5|$|The TDRS-1 {{program was}} overall less successful, with the {{satellite}} suffering several computer failures and an overall loss of telemetry for several hours. In all, the orbiter {{was able to}} use the satellite for 65 of the planned 89 orbits, and could make successful use of the connection on about forty. The Continuous Flow <b>Electrophoresis</b> System equipment functioned as planned, processing several hundred times more material than would have been possible on Earth, and the Asahi Shimbun crystal experiment, flown for the second time, was able to produce snow crystals after the canister was redesigned.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{are usually}} {{analyzed}} by {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} polyacrylamide gel <b>electrophoresis</b> (SDS-PAGE), by native gel <b>electrophoresis,</b> by preparative gel <b>electrophoresis</b> (QPNC-PAGE), or by 2-D <b>electrophoresis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Denaturing gel <b>electrophoresis</b> {{is used in}} the DNA and RNA banding pattern-based methods {{temperature}} gradient gel <b>electrophoresis</b> (TGGE) and denaturing gradient gel <b>electrophoresis</b> (DGGE).|$|E
25|$|Two-dimensional gel <b>electrophoresis,</b> {{abbreviated}} as 2-DE or 2-D <b>electrophoresis,</b> {{is a form}} of gel <b>electrophoresis</b> {{commonly used}} to analyze proteins. Mixtures of proteins are separated by two properties in two dimensions on 2D gels. 2-DE was first independently introduced by O'Farrell and Klose in 1975.|$|E
25|$|The serum free light-chain assay in {{combination}} with serum protein <b>electrophoresis</b> and serum immunofixation <b>electrophoresis</b> is sufficient to screen for pathological monoclonal plasmaproliferative disorders other than AL amyloidosis which requires all the serum tests as well as 24 h urine immunofixation <b>electrophoresis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Characterization through ligand {{interaction}} may {{be performed}} by electroblotting or by affinity <b>electrophoresis</b> in agarose or by capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> as for estimation of binding constants and determination of structural features like glycan content through lectin binding.|$|E
25|$|Gel <b>electrophoresis</b> uses a gel as an anticonvective medium and/or {{sieving medium}} during <b>electrophoresis,</b> the {{movement}} of a charged particle in an electrical field. Gels suppress the thermal convection caused by application of the electric field, and can also act as a sieving medium, retarding the passage of molecules; gels can also simply serve to maintain the finished separation, so that a post <b>electrophoresis</b> stain can be applied. DNA Gel <b>electrophoresis</b> is usually performed for analytical purposes, often after amplification of DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but {{may be used as}} a preparative technique prior to use of other methods such as mass spectrometry, RFLP, PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, or Southern blotting for further characterization.|$|E
25|$|Free-flow <b>electrophoresis</b> (FFE) is a carrier-free <b>electrophoresis</b> {{technique}} that allows preparative protein separation in a laminar buffer stream {{by using an}} orthogonal electric field. By making use of a pH-gradient, that can for example be induced by ampholytes, this technique allows to separate protein isoforms up to a resolution of < 0.02 delta-pI.|$|E
25|$|Methanol {{is used as}} a destaining {{agent in}} {{polyacrylamide}} gel <b>electrophoresis.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} western blot, gel <b>electrophoresis</b> {{is used to}} {{separate}} native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by {{the length of the}} polypeptide. Polyacrylamide gel is generally used for the electrophoretic separation of proteins, and SDS is generally used as a buffer (as well as in the gel) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge, since proteins can be positively, negatively, or neutrally charged. This type of <b>electrophoresis</b> is known as SDS-PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide gel <b>electrophoresis).</b> Prior to <b>electrophoresis,</b> protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present. This ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) from degrading samples. Following electrophoretic separation, the proteins are transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are blocked with milk (or other blocking agents) to prevent non-specific antibody binding, and then stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. Lastly, the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining, which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods. The gel <b>electrophoresis</b> step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal {{haemoglobin}} forms can {{be detected}} on haemoglobin <b>electrophoresis,</b> a form of gel <b>electrophoresis</b> on which {{the various types of}} haemoglobin move at varying speeds. Sickle-cell haemoglobin (HgbS) and haemoglobin C with sickling (HgbSC)—the two most common forms—can be identified from there. The diagnosis can be confirmed with high-performance liquid chromatography. Genetic testing is rarely performed, as other investigations are highly specific for HbS and HbC.|$|E
25|$|The {{system of}} DNA {{profiling}} used today {{is based on}} PCR and uses simple sequences or short tandem repeats (STR). This method uses highly polymorphic regions that have short repeated sequences of DNA (the most common is 4 bases repeated, {{but there are other}} lengths in use, including 3 and 5 bases). Because unrelated people almost certainly have different numbers of repeat units, STRs can be used to discriminate between unrelated individuals. These STR loci (locations on a chromosome) are targeted with sequence-specific primers and amplified using PCR. The DNA fragments that result are then separated and detected using <b>electrophoresis.</b> There are two common methods of separation and detection, capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> (CE) and gel <b>electrophoresis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The HPCE-based viral titer assay uses a proprietary, {{high-performance}} capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> {{system to}} determine baculovirus titer.|$|E
25|$|For CE-SERS, {{capillary}} <b>electrophoresis</b> eluants can be deposited onto a SERS-active substrate. Analyte {{retention times}} {{can be translated}} into spatial distance by moving the SERS-active substrate at a constant rate during capillary <b>electrophoresis.</b> This allows the subsequent spectroscopic technique {{to be applied to}} specific eluants for identification with high sensitivity. SERS-active substrates can be chosen that do not interfere with the spectrum of the analytes.|$|E
25|$|Capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> may be {{used for}} the {{simultaneous}} determination of the ions NH4+,, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ in saliva.|$|E
25|$|Gel <b>electrophoresis</b> is {{a common}} {{laboratory}} technique {{that can be used}} both as preparative and analytical method. The principle of <b>electrophoresis</b> relies on the movement of a charged ion in an electric field. In practice, the proteins are denatured in a solution containing a detergent (SDS). In these conditions, the proteins are unfolded and coated with negatively charged detergent molecules. The proteins in SDS-PAGE are separated on the sole basis of their size.|$|E
25|$|Buffers in gel <b>electrophoresis</b> {{are used}} to provide ions that carry a current and to {{maintain}} the pH at a relatively constant value.|$|E
25|$|Capillary electrophoresis–mass {{spectrometry}} (CE-MS) is {{a technique}} that combines the liquid separation process of capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> with mass spectrometry. CE-MS is typically coupled to electrospray ionization.|$|E
25|$|Autoradiography, {{also used}} for protein band {{detection}} post gel <b>electrophoresis,</b> uses radioactive isotopes to label proteins, which are then detected by using X-ray film.|$|E
25|$|If {{some doubt}} remains {{regarding}} the diagnosis, definitive diagnosis can involve osmotic fragility testing, an autohaemolysis test, and direct protein assaying by gel <b>electrophoresis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2005 in Saudi Arabia a {{mandatory}} pre-marital test including HB <b>electrophoresis</b> was launched and aimed {{to decrease the}} incidence of SCD and thalassemia.|$|E
25|$|Chemical buffer stabilizes the pH {{value to}} the desired value within the gel itself and in the <b>electrophoresis</b> buffer. The choice of buffer also affects the electrophoretic {{mobility}} of the buffer counterions and thereby {{the resolution of the}} gel. The buffer should also be unreactive and not modify or react with most proteins. Different buffers may be used as cathode and anode buffers, respectively, depending on the application. Multiple pH values may be used within a single gel, for example in DISC <b>electrophoresis.</b> Common buffers in PAGE include Tris, Bis-Tris, or imidazole.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the type}} of {{analysis}} being performed, other techniques are often implemented in conjunction with the results of gel <b>electrophoresis,</b> providing a wide range of field-specific applications.|$|E
25|$|Native gel <b>electrophoresis</b> is {{typically}} used in proteomics and metallomics. However, native PAGE {{is also used}} to scan genes (DNA) for unknown mutations as in Single-strand conformation polymorphism.|$|E
25|$|To {{test for}} patulin contamination, {{a variety of}} methods and sample {{preparation}} methods have been employed including thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), capillary <b>electrophoresis.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of biophysical {{techniques}} for determining sequence information. Protein sequence can be determined by Edman degradation, in which the N-terminal residues are hydrolyzed from the chain one at a time, derivatized, and then identified. Mass spectrometer techniques can also be used. Nucleic acid sequence can be determined using gel <b>electrophoresis</b> and capillary <b>electrophoresis.</b> Lastly, mechanical properties of these biopolymers can often be measured using optical tweezers or atomic-force microscopy. Dual polarization interferometry can be used to measure the conformational changes or self-assembly of these materials when stimulated by pH, temperature, ionic strength or other binding partners.|$|E
25|$|Other {{blood tests}} done {{to aid in}} the {{diagnosis}} include CRP or ESR, complement levels, ANA, and LDH. Protein <b>electrophoresis</b> and immunoglobulin levels can show increased IgA in 50% of all patients.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{isozymes}} may {{be almost}} identical in function, they may differ in other ways. In particular, amino acid substitutions {{that change the}} electric charge of the enzyme (such as replacing aspartic acid with glutamic acid) are simple to identify by gel <b>electrophoresis,</b> and this forms {{the basis for the}} use of isozymes as molecular markers. To identify isozymes, a crude protein extract is made by grinding animal or plant tissue with an extraction buffer, and the components of extract are separated according to their charge by gel <b>electrophoresis.</b> Historically, this has usually been done using gels made from potato starch, but acrylamide gels provide better resolution.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of a {{purification}} strategy, denaturing condition <b>electrophoresis</b> provides an improved resolution oversize exclusion chromatography, but does not scale to large quantity of proteins in a sample as well as the late chromatography columns.|$|E
25|$|Selected {{laboratory}} tests {{can be used}} to look for associated problems or possible tumor spread. These include: full blood count, protein <b>electrophoresis,</b> antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (indicative of myasthenia), electrolytes, liver enzymes and renal function.|$|E
