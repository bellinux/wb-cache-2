40|$|Abstract Background Pattern {{discovery}} in DNA sequences {{is one of}} the most fundamental problems in molecular biology with important applications in finding regulatory signals and transcription factor binding sites. An important task in this problem is to search (or predict) known binding sites in a new DNA sequence. For this reason, all subsequences of the given DNA sequence are scored based on an scoring function and the prediction is done by selecting the best score. By assuming no dependency between binding site base positions, most of the available tools for known binding site prediction are designed. Recently Tomovic and Oakeley investigated the statistical basis for either a claim of dependence or independence, to determine whether such a claim is generally true, and they presented a scoring function for binding site prediction based on the dependency between binding site base positions. Our primary objective is to investigate the scoring functions which can be used in known binding site prediction based on the assumption of dependency or independency in binding site base positions. Results We propose a new scoring function based on the dependency between all positions in biding site base positions. This scoring function uses <b>joint</b> <b>information</b> <b>content</b> and mutual information as a measure of dependency between positions in transcription factor binding site. Our method for modeling dependencies is simply an extension of position independency methods. We evaluate our new scoring function on the real data sets extracted from JASPAR and TRANSFAC data bases, and compare the obtained results with two other well known scoring functions. Conclusion The results demonstrate that the new approach improves known binding site discovery and show that the <b>joint</b> <b>information</b> <b>content</b> and mutual information provide a better and more general criterion to investigate the relationships between positions in the TFBS. Our scoring function is formulated by simple mathematical calculations. By implementing our method on several biological data sets, it can be induced that this method performs better than methods that do not consider dependencies. </p...|$|E

We also propose and evaluate methodologies for constructing systemic risk indices that capture the <b>joint</b> <b>information</b> <b>content</b> of a large cross-section of systemic risk measures. We construct over 20 measures of systemic risk in the US and Europe extending across several decades. We show that, taken individually, these measures reveal low predictive ability for macroeconomic downturns. However, an index that parsimoniously aggre-gates individual measures consistently performs well in forecasting downturns both in-sample and out-of-sample. ∗We thank Lars Hansen for many helpful conversations about this project.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for a hybrid connectionistHMM speech recognition system. The system consists of a multi-feature HMM-based recognition module using three different neural networks as multiple neural codebooks. Each neural network receives a different feature (i. e. cepstrum, delta cepstrum, and delta power) as input and generates a vector quantizer label obtained from the firing neuron in the output layer. The neural networks are first trained separately using a special self-organizing information theory-based learning method. A 26 % error reduction is obtained with this method, compared {{to the performance of}} the same system using multiple k-means vector quantizers with the same codebook size. In a second training phase, the neural codebooks are further refined by extending the information theory-based training criterion into a joint criterion reflecting the <b>joint</b> <b>information</b> <b>content</b> and the dependencies of the three different label streams.

40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increasing}} number of flood-related fatalities has highlighted the necessity of improving flood risk management to reduce human and economic losses. In this framework, monitoring of flood-prone areas is a key factor for building a resilient environment. In this paper a method for designing a floodplain monitoring network is presented. A redundant network of cheap wireless sensors (GridStix) measuring water depth is considered over a reach of the River Dee (UK), with sensors placed both in the channel and in the floodplain. Through a Three Objective Optimization Problem (TOOP) the best layouts of sensors are evaluated, minimizing their redundancy, maximizing their <b>joint</b> <b>information</b> <b>content</b> and maximizing the accuracy of the observations.

40|$|Water systems {{management}} depends on monitoring data that adequately describes the hydrological processes {{of interest for}} such systems. An information theory-based method for siting the monitors is developed, {{with the objective of}} locating a limited set of monitors that maximizes the <b>joint</b> <b>information</b> <b>content</b> of water level measurements based on Shannon’s information theory. The multiobjective problem is posed as a search for a set of monitors that are mutually independent from an information viewpoint, and such that each station has the maximum possible information content.

Solutions involving an optimal Pareto set are obtained using the evolutionary optimization algorithm NSGAII. The methodology is applied to a Dutch polder system, by generating entropy and transinformation maps.

40|$|As digital terrain {{models are}} {{indispensable}} for visualizing and modeling geographic processes, terrain <b>information</b> <b>content</b> {{is useful for}} terrain generalization and representation. For terrain generalization, if the terrain information is considered, the generalized terrain may be of higher fidelity.

40|$|This study {{distinguishes between}} {{incremental}} and relative <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> Incremental comparisons ask whether one accounting measure provides <b>information</b> <b>content</b> beyond that provided by another, and apply when one measure {{is viewed as}} given and an assessment is desired regarding the incremental contribution of another (e. g., a supplemental disclosure). Relative comparisons ask which measure has greater <b>information</b> <b>content,</b> and apply when making mutually exclusive choices among alternatives, or when rankings by <b>information</b> <b>content</b> are desired (e. g., when comparing alternative disclosures). Questions of both incremental and relative <b>information</b> <b>content</b> arise frequently in accounting. However, few previous studies have examined questions of relative <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> Possible explanations include unfamiliarity with the relative versus incremental distinction, and the additional statistical complexity involved in testing for relative <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> First, we examine analytically the relation between incremental and relative <b>information</b> <b>content,</b> demonstrating that they address different research questions and require different tests for statistical significance. Second, we identify accounting research contexts in which questions of relative and incremental <b>information</b> <b>content</b> arise. Third, we propose a new regression-based test for relative <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> This test applies to both returns and valuation studies, generalizes to any number of predictor variables, {{and can be used}} in conjunction with White's (1980) adjustment for heteroskedasticity.

40|$|Abstract — The <b>information</b> <b>content</b> {{in remote}} sensing imagery depends upon various {{factors such as}} spatial and radiometric resolutions, spatial scale of the {{features}} to be imaged, radiometric contrast between different target types, and the type and amount of noise present in the imagery. Various statistical and textural measures are used to characterize image <b>information</b> <b>content,</b> based upon which different image processing techniques are employed to quantify this parameter. Previous work in this area have resulted in three different approaches for quantifying the image <b>information</b> <b>content,</b> primarily based on interpretability, mutual information, and entropy. These approaches, although well refined, are difficult to apply to all types of remote sensing imagery. We have developed an approach based on the use of classification accuracy to quantify image <b>information</b> <b>content,</b> since loss of information occurs if pixels in the image are wrongly classified. Using this approach, we have separately developed negative exponential models relating <b>information</b> <b>content</b> to image parameters such as spatial and spectral resolution. In this paper, we describe a preliminary unified <b>information</b> <b>content</b> model and assess its performance using hyperspectral AVIRIS imagery. The model combines the effects of the above parameters and takes into account the interrelationships between them with respect to information contained within the image. Using the model, appropriate trade-offs between the parameters can be investigated for obtaining a specific value for image <b>information</b> <b>content</b> for a particular application. I...|$|R
