5|$|On {{the issue}} of slavery, Smith took {{different}} positions. Initially <b>he</b> <b>opposed</b> it, but during the mid-1830s when the Mormons were settling in Missouri (a slave state), Smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly anti-abolitionist essay. Then in the early 1840s, after Mormons had been expelled from Missouri, he once again opposed slavery. During his presidential campaign of 1844, he proposed ending slavery by 1850 and compensating slaveholders for their loss. Smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites, and he welcomed slaves into the church. However, <b>he</b> <b>opposed</b> baptizing them without permission of their masters, and <b>he</b> <b>opposed</b> interracial marriage.|$|E
