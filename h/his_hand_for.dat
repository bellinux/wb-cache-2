500|$|In the {{parliament}} of April 1308, {{it was decided}} that Gaveston should be banned from the realm upon threat of excommunication. The king {{had no choice but to}} comply, and on 24 June, Gaveston left the country on appointment as Lieutenant of Ireland. The king immediately started plotting for his favourite's return. At {{the parliament}} of April 1309, he suggested a compromise in which certain of the earls' petitions would be met in exchange for Gaveston's return. The plan came to nothing, but [...] Edward had strengthened <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> the Stamford parliament in July later that year by receiving a papal annulment of the threat of excommunication. The king agreed to the so-called [...] "Statute of Stamford" [...] (which in essence was a reissue of the Articuli super Cartas that his father had signed in 1300), and Gaveston was allowed to return.|$|E

500|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{lips are}} thin and tightly pursed {{and his mouth}} is broad and down-turned, yet his {{features}} are those of a handsome man. Marcel Brion described him as appearing [...] "mild and thoughtful", an impression reinforced by the uncomplicated design of the painting. This view {{is reinforced by the}} relative drabness or simplicity of his clothes, which seem intended to convey a reserved, ascetic piousness. Dürer presents his father more like a low-ranking [...] ecclesiastic than a tradesman: a calm, considerate and straightforward man dressed up in his best, albeit modest, clothes. After his father's death in 1502, Dürer wrote that Albrecht the Elder [...] "passed his life in great toil and stern hard labour, having nothing for his support save what he earned with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> himself, his wife and his children... He underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities. But he won just praise from all who knew him... he was also of few words, and was a God-fearing man." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in the tournament, on 18 June 2012, Mario Balotelli scored {{his first}} goal {{in a major}} {{international}} tournament in a 2–0 victory against the Republic of Ireland. When he attempted to celebrate this goal, he was immediately halted by teammate Leonardo Bonucci, who covered Balotelli's mouth with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> fear that the striker would say something to [...] "get in trouble." [...] Balotelli had been dropped to the bench by Cesare Prandelli prior to the game due to his lack of ability shown in his previous group games, so when he was subbed on against Ireland fans didn't expect him to {{have much of an}} impact, and his celebration of his goal may have originally been directed towards the naysayers who believe he is bad for the team. Balotelli went on to start against England in the quarter-finals, his performance was described as wasteful but his effort was rated highly in a game where he missed multiple chances. He scored the first penalty taken in the shootout against his Manchester City teammate Joe Hart. On 28 June, Balotelli scored twice within the first 40 minutes in Italy's semi-final clash with Germany, as the Azzurri won 2–1 and progressed to the Euro 2012 final against European and World champions Spain. After scoring the second goal in that semi-final, he ripped off his shirt and stood motionless as he flexed his muscles, developing a famous celebration. Going into the final Balotelli said that, Manchester City's title success meant that failure in the Euros would not signal a personal failure this season. He also said that he was unfazed by the pressure he supposedly has on his shoulders going into the final, with new high expectations of him from his home supporters after his amazing performance against Germany.|$|E
500|$|After {{losing the}} Intercontinental Championship, Orton became {{the number one}} {{contender}} for the World Heavyweight Championship after winning a 20-man battle royal on July 26. At SummerSlam, Orton defeated Chris Benoit for the championship. Orton became the youngest world champion in WWE history {{at the age of}} 24. Benoit congratulated Orton after the match, shaking <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> showing the ability to [...] "be a man". The following night, after Orton successfully defended the championship against Benoit in a rematch, Evolution threw Orton a [...] celebration, only to reveal that they were not pleased with his new victory. While Batista had Orton propped on his shoulders in elation, Triple H gave him a pleased thumbs up and then abruptly changed it to a thumbs-down, which was followed by Batista's dropping Orton to the mat. Ric Flair and Batista attacked Orton in the ring as Triple H revealed his jealousy for Orton's title. He ordered Orton to hand over the championship, but he refused, spitting in Triple H's face and hitting him with the title belt. Orton's break-up with Evolution began a new storyline for him as a fan favorite when he continued to feud with his former stablemates. A month later, Orton lost his championship to Triple H at Unforgiven. Seeking revenge, Orton lashed out at Evolution members, catching them by surprise during a show by giving them a large cake as a make-up gift, which he came out of nowhere to beat and humiliate the group. At Taboo Tuesday, Orton defeated Ric Flair in a Steel Cage match. After this, Orton experienced another push, becoming General Manager of the Raw brand for a week following a match stipulation at Survivor Series where he picked up the win for his team by last pinning Triple H in a 4-on-4 Survivor Series match. He continued to feud with Triple H, using his authority to place his opponents at severe disadvantages during title defenses. Orton was granted another chance at the championship in January 2005, but lost a six-man championship Elimination Chamber match to Triple H at New Year's Revolution. On the January 10 Raw, Orton defeated Batista to earn a match against Triple H at the Royal Rumble for the World Heavyweight title. At the Royal Rumble, Triple H defeated Orton to retain the World title.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his last}} fight, in May 1971, a 36-year-old Cooper faced 21-year-old Joe Bugner, {{one of the}} biggest heavyweights in the world at the time, for the British, European, and Commonwealth belts. Referee Harry Gibbs awarded the fight to Bugner by the now {{abolished}} quarter of a point margin. An audience mainly composed of Cooper fans did not appreciate the innately cautious Bugner, and the decision was booed with commentator Harry Carpenter asking, [...] "How can they take away the man's titles like this?" [...] Cooper announced his retirement shortly afterwards. Cooper refused to speak to Gibbs for several years, but eventually agreed to shake <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> charity six months before Gibbs died.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] (as excerpted in Newsweek magazine), Bob Woodward of the Washington Post {{wrote that}} on March 16, 2006 Abizaid was in Washington {{to testify before}} the Senate Armed Services Committee. [...] "He painted a careful but upbeat picture of the {{situation}} in Iraq." [...] Subsequently, [...] "he went over to see Congressman John Murtha (D-Pa), the 73-year old veteran Marine who had introduced a resolution the previous November calling for the redeployment of troops from Iraq as soon as practicable." [...] Abizaid said he wanted to speak frankly, and [...] "according to Murtha, Abizaid raised <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> emphasis and held his thumb and forefinger a quarter of an inch from each other and said, [...] "We're that far apart." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to four deleted scenes, the DVD release includes an alternate ending, showing all {{the main characters}} (including Benny, who was not present in the other ending) except Angel standing in the positions where they were during the [...] "Seasons of Love" [...] opening, all standing {{in a line of}} spotlights, with Angel's spot empty. Later in the scene, she enters from the side and walks down the line to take her place, stopping as she passes Collins to take <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> a moment. Although this tableau is used in the finale of the musical, it was dropped from the film for fear that audiences may have wondered why Angel had returned or why the characters were lined up on stage again. In the commentary, Chris Columbus adds that he [...] "didn't want audiences to think that everything was okay and Angel was alive again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haley {{began his}} {{rock and roll}} career with what is now {{recognized}} as a rockabilly style in a cover of [...] "Rocket 88" [...] recorded for the Philadelphia-based Holiday Records label in 1951. It sold well and was followed in 1952 by a cover of a 1940s rhythm and blues song called [...] "Rock the Joint" [...] (this time for Holiday's sister company, Essex Records). Slap-back bass, one identifying characteristic of rockabilly, was used on the Comets' recordings of [...] "Rocket 88", [...] "Rock the Joint", [...] "Rock Around the Clock", and [...] "Shake, Rattle, and Roll". The bass guitarist would literally slap {{the back of the}} instrument with <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>for</b> an impromptu drum effect. [...] Slap-back had been used by bassist Al Rex, although to a lesser extent, on the Saddlemen's [...] "Yodel Your Blues Away". Slap-back bass was a necessity for the group, because in its early years (prior to the fall of 1952), it did not feature a stage drummer, so the bass provided percussion in addition to the bass line.|$|E
2500|$|One of Michigan's best scoring {{opportunities}} {{came on a}} punt from Penn quarterback Scott to Michigan end Victor Pattengill. [...] Pattengill raised <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> a fair catch at the Michigan 40-yard line, but was [...] "buried in the sod" [...] {{by several}} Penn players. [...] The field judge Beacham did not see Pattengill call for the fair catch and did not call interference. [...] Michigan protested, but the protest was overruled. [...] Under 1910 rules, the penalty would have given Michigan a free kick from the Penn 25-yard line. [...] On another occasion, Stanfield Wells caught a pass and ran 20 yards for {{what appeared to be}} a touchdown. [...] However, an official ruled that Wells had [...] "stepped outside" [...] and the play was called back. A third scoring opportunity was lost after a fumble by Penn. [...] Michigan's right tackle, Wheaton Cole, had the ball in front of him with a clear path ahead. [...] Cole was unable to grab the football and [...] "instead kicked it over the goal line where one of Mr. Penn's sons fell on it for a touchback that was a lifesaver to the Red and Blue hosts." ...|$|E

When people would ask him what he meant by these sticks, he was to tell them that God said that God would take the stick of Joseph, which was in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions, and put them together with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick in God's hand. Ezekiel was to hold the sticks in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> people to see, telling them that God said that God would gather the children of Israel from among the nations, wherever they had gone, bring them into their own land, and make them one nation with one king, no longer two nations with two kings. No longer would they defile themselves with idols or transgressions, but God would save them and cleanse them, so that they would be God's people, and God would be their God. David would be king over them, and they would have one shepherd and observe God's statutes. They and their children, and their children's children forever, would dwell in the land that God had given Jacob, where their fathers had dwelt, and David would be their prince forever. God would make an everlasting covenant of peace with them, multiply them, and set God's sanctuary in the midst of them forever. God's dwelling-place would be over them, God would be their God, and they would be God's people. And the nations would know that God sanctified Israel, when God's sanctuary would be in their midst forever.|$|E
