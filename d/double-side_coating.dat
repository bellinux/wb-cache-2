40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the characterization of}} silicon oxide (SiO 2) films on polyethersulfone (PES) substrates by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition for transparent barrier applications. The film properties, such as deposition rate, etch rate, roughness, and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), were found to increase as the plasma power increased from 10 to 120 W. As the pressure of chamber increases from 75 to 375 mbar, the deposition rate, etch rate, and roughness increase while the WVTR decreases. Under optimum conditions, the WVTR for PES can be reduced from a level of 50 g/m(2) /day (bare substrate) to 0. 31 g/m(2) /day after application of a 100 -nm-thick SiO 2 coating at 150 degreesC. A more efficient way to improve permeation of PES {{was carried out by}} using a <b>double-side</b> <b>coating</b> of a 100 -nm-thick SiO 2 film. It was found that the WVTR can be reduced to a level of 0. 1 g/m(2) /day The <b>double-side</b> <b>coating</b> on PES could contribute to the lower stress of oxide film, which greatly improves the WVTR data. These results indicate that the SiO 2 /PES barrier coatings have high potential for flexible organic light-emitting diode (OLED) applications. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|The {{accurate}} {{evaluation of}} the elastic modulus of ceramic coatings at high temperature (HT) is of high significance for industrial application, yet {{it is not easy}} to get the practical modulus at HT due to the difficulty of the deformation measurement and coating separation from the composite samples. This work presented a simple approach in which relative method was used twice to solve this problem indirectly. Given a single-face or double-face coated beam sample, the relative method was firstly used to determine the real mid-span deflection of the three-point bending piece at HT, and secondly to derive the analytical relation among the HT moduli of the coating, the coated and uncoated samples. Thus the HT modulus of the coatings on beam samples is determined uniquely via the measured HT moduli of the samples with and without coatings. For a ring sample (from tube with outer-side, inner-side, and <b>double-side</b> <b>coating),</b> the relative method was used firstly to determine the real compression deformation of a split ring sample at HT, secondly to derive the relationship among the slope of load-deformation curve of the coated ring, the HT modulus of the coating and substrate. Thus, the HT modulus of ceramic coatings can be evaluated by the substrate modulus and the load-deformation data of coated rings. Mathematic expressions of those calculations were derived for the beam and ring samples. CVD-SiC coatings on graphite substrate were selected as the testing samples, of which the measured modulus ranging from room temperature to 2100 °C demonstrated the validity and convenience of the relative method.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple and reproducible 2 -step self-assembly method for the fabrication of broadband, omnidirectional antireflection coating on glass substrate with 4 in. size. The glass surface has been modified to be positively charged, then the negatively charged nano silica is self-assembled to the glass substrate by electrostatic attraction. The nanostructure on the glass substrate reduces the reflection significantly, which results in enhanced transmittance. Transmittance as high as 97. 7 % at 499 nm has been obtained for a <b>double-side</b> <b>coated</b> glass substrate. Obvious reduction in weighted reflectance is still observed up to 60 ° incident angle. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{a process for}} {{fabricating}} nanoporous alumina anti-reflective coatings was developed. Anti-reflective coatings were designed for air-glass interface and soda-lime glass {{was used in the}} experiments. Alumina was deposited on glass by atomic layer deposition, and then transformed into nanoporous state by immersion in heated de-ionized water. The conditions for nanoporous alumina creation by de-ionized water treatment were investigated and the resulted structure was analysed with ellipsometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The transmittance of the coated glass was measured in a Cary 7000 spectrometer, showing excellent broadband and omnidirectional performance. The average transmittance for a visible range of spectrum of a <b>double-side</b> <b>coated</b> glass is up to 99. 3 % versus 91. 9 % for a non-coated glass. The transmittance for 70 ° incident light is 85. 6 % which is 13. 9 % higher than for pure glass...|$|R
40|$|Four {{commercial}} barrier coated boards (i. e., internally-sized uncoated board, one-side polyethylene <b>coated</b> board, <b>double-side</b> polyethylene <b>coated</b> board, and multilayer laminated board) {{were examined}} for biodegradation using a soil burial approach on a laboratory scale. It was {{observed that the}} base-boards were fully biodegradable {{in a matter of}} weeks or months, and the degradation process could be accelerated either by sample size modification or enrichment of the soil microbial population. Freezing pretreatment of boards or the fiber directionality of boards had no influence on the rate of degradation. The boards were also found to be recyclable following a simple procedure of re-slushing and screening. The base-boards became almost fully separated from the polyethylene coated material without any special pretreatment...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} cathode gas {{diffusion}} layer (GDL) with double-side microporous layer (MPL) coating {{on the performance}} of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) are tested under different relative humidity (RH) at air inlet. Standard commercial SGL ® 10 BA carbon paper is used as the substrate of GDL and it is coated with MPL {{on both sides of the}} paper with different carbon loadings and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) contents. Acetylene black is used as the carbon powder in the MPL composition. A single cell testing apparatus with adjustable RH at air inlet is constructed to measure the cell performance. The results show that the cell performance could be enhanced greatly under low air RH conditions by the employment of such a GDL with <b>double-side</b> MPL <b>coating.</b> The peak power density obtained at extremely low air RH condition may be increased more than 85 % in comparison with that of conventional GDL with single-side MPL coating. The optimal compositions of MPL on the surfaces facing to the catalyst layer and flow-channel plate are found to be 1. 2 mg/cm 2 and 0. 3 mg/c...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} concept {{and the results of}} the {{simulations}} of a new polarizer for the diffuse neutron scattering spectrometer DNS at MLZ. The concept of the polarizer is based on the idea of a bender made from the stack of the silicon wafers with a <b>double-side</b> supermirror polarizing <b>coating</b> and absorbing spacers in between. Owing to its compact design, such a system provides more free space for the arrangement of other instrument components. To reduce activation of the polarizer in the high intensity neutron beam of the DNS spectrometer we plan to use the Fe/Si supermirrors instead of currently used FeCoV/Ti:N ones. Using the VITESS simulation package we have performed simulations for horizontally focusing polarizing benders with different geometries in the combination with the double-focusing crystal monochromator of DNS. Neutron transmission and polarization efficiency as well as the effects of the focusing for convergent conventional C-benders and S-benders have been analyzed both for wedge-like and plane-parallel convergent geometries of the channels. The results of these simulations and the advantages/disadvantages of the various configurations are discussed...|$|R
