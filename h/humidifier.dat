5|$|In addition, {{like all}} Nepenthes, this plant needs a fairly humid {{environment}} to grow well. Values {{in the region}} of 75% R.H. are generally considered optimal, with increased humidity at night (~90% R.H.). However, N. rajah does tolerate fluctuations in humidity, especially when young, provided that the air does not become too dry (below 50% R.H.). Humidity can be easily controlled using an ultrasonic <b>humidifier</b> in conjunction with a humidistat.|$|E

50|$|Electronic <b>humidifiers</b> {{are also}} available, {{although}} {{usually reserved for}} very large humidors. A sensor measures the outside humidity and then activates a ventilator, which blows air over a humid sponge or water tank into the humidor. Once the preset humidity level has been reached the ventilator stops. This way electronic <b>humidifiers</b> can maintain a much more stable humidity level than passive <b>humidifiers.</b> Also they typically will activate an alarm to notify when the moisture supply needs refilling, to prevent humidity drops. The accuracy of electronic <b>humidifiers</b> depends primarily on the integrated type of sensor; the capacitive type are preferred.|$|R

2500|$|The bridge {{holds the}} strings above the cello and {{transfers}} their vibrations {{to the top}} of the instrument and the soundpost inside (see below). The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The bridge is usually positioned by the cross point of the [...] "f-hole" [...] (i.e., where the horizontal line occurs in the [...] "f"). The f-holes, named for their shape, are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument as part of the sound-production process. The f-holes also act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small length of rubber hose containing a water-soaked sponge, called a Dampit, is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a <b>humidifier.</b> This keeps the wood components of the cello from drying out.|$|E
2500|$|During Powell's {{tenure at}} the NGA, he has faced several challenges. In May 1994, the NGA learned that its painting, The Holy Family on the Steps, was a forgery and not the work of 17th-century French painter Nicolas Poussin. Powell was {{strongly}} criticized for not ordering the relabeling of the painting in a timely manner, and for mishandling the NGA's response to its critics. In December 1994, D.C. television station WJLA ran a three-part expos√© titled [...] "Gallery of Shame", in which the station revealed the content of a confidential report that criticized the NGA for severe lapses in maintenance, environmental control, and art storage. The report said that these conditions [...] "threaten {{the security of the}} collection" [...] and placed works of art [...] "at risk" [...] of [...] "serious damage." [...] The report documented a leaky roof, dripping skylights, flooded storerooms, and burst radiators that poured clouds of steam into galleries. In one case, a poorly maintained <b>humidifier</b> turned the varnish on John Singleton Copley's Watson and the Shark an opaque white. (The painting was restored with no damage.) [...] The report also strongly criticized the management structure at the museum, documented very low employee morale, and uncovered poor minority hiring practices. Powell attacked WJLA's report as [...] "hyperbole and exaggeration", and said that not a single work of art had been damaged. He also said that the NGA had been aware of the problems for several years, and that he already had a plan in place to implement the consultants' recommendations within 12 months.|$|E
40|$|Following {{the recent}} press release {{regarding}} the toxicity of the biocides mixed {{in the water}} of <b>humidifiers</b> {{as a cause of}} fatal pulmonary syndrome among pregnant women and young children in Korea [1], the use of <b>humidifiers</b> has became a public concern. There are few reports, however, on the use of <b>humidifiers</b> with children suffering from atopic dermatitis. Those children use <b>humidifiers</b> more frequently than healthy individuals, because their symptoms largely depend on the humidity in the environment, especially during winter in Korea. Therefore, they might be a risk group who are exposed to the biocides in the <b>humidifiers.</b> Parents of atopic dermatitis patients are more aware of controlling the relative humidity in the household environment.
