Our {{goal is to}} prove the following: Theorem 1. Let U ⊆ A d be a nonempty open subset. Then the prestack Map rat(X, U ⊆ A d) is acyclic (in other words, the map Map rat(X, U ⊆ A d) → Spec k induces an isomorphism on ℓ-adic homology. Before embarking on the proof of Theorem 1, let us give a rough idea of what is involved. By definition, Map rat(X, U ⊆ A n) is a full subcategory of the prestack Map rat(X, A n) of rational maps from X into A n. This latter prestack is the nth power of Map rat(X, A 1), which can be roughly described as “rational functions on X”. As such, it behaves like an infinite-dimensional affine space over Spec k. Consequently, Map rat(X, U ⊆ A n) behaves like an open subset of an infinite-dimensional affine space, which is complementary to the subspace Map rat(X, A n −U) consisting of rational maps from X into the closed subset A n −U ⊆ A n. The idea is that because A n −U has dimension smaller than n, the space of rational maps Map rat(X, A n −U) behaves {{as if it has}} infinite codimension in Map rat(X, A n), so that its removal does not change the homotopy type of Map rat(X, A n). Let <b>Fin</b> <b>s</b> denote the category whose objects are nonempty finite sets and whose morphisms are surjections. The construction (R, S, µ, γ) ↦ → S determines a fibration of categories ψ: Map rat(X, U ⊆ A n) → <b>Fin</b> <b>s.</b> Fo...|$|E

An estimate is presented of the thermal penetration length over which the temperature of a very long fin would decrease from its maximum value at the top to the ambient temperature of the fluid. The solution {{of the problem is}} shown to depend on two nondimensional parameters: the Prandtl number of the fluid and the ratio s of the thermal penetration length to the actual length of the fin.

J Strength Cond Res 28 (4) : 958 - 963, 2014 -Competitive swimmers regularly perform apnea series {{with or without}} fins {{as part of their}} training, but the ergogenic and metabolic repercussions of acute and chronic apnea have not been examined. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the cardiovascular, lactate, arterial oxygen saturation and hormonal responses to acute apnea in relation to performance in male swimmers. According to a randomized protocol, 15 national or regional competitive swimmers were monitored while performing four 100 -m freestyle trials, each consisting of four 25 -m segments with departure every 30 seconds at maximal speed in the following conditions: with normal frequency breathing with fins (F) and without <b>fins</b> (<b>S)</b> and with complete apnea for the four 25 -m segments with (FAp) and without fins (SAp). Heart rate (HR) was measured continuously and arterial oxygen saturation, blood, and saliva samples were assessed after 30 seconds, 3 minutes, and 10 minutes of recovery, respectively. Swimming performance was better with fins than without both with normal frequency breathing and apnea (p < 0. 001). Apnea induced no change in lactatemia, but a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation in both SAp and FAp (p < 0. 001) was noted and a decrease in HR and swimming performance in SAp (p < 0. 01). During apnea without fins, performance alteration was correlated with bradycardia (r = 0. 63) and arterial oxygen desaturation (r = - 0. 57). Saliva dehydroepiandrosterone was increased compared with basal values whatever the trial (p ≤ 0. 05), whereas no change was found in saliva cortisol or testosterone. Further studies are necessary to clarify the fin effect on HR and performance during apnea swimming...|$|R
