40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of linguistically and culturally diverse students in K- 12 classrooms, it is imperative that practitioners determine educational approaches that best serve these students. English language learners (ELLs) in particular face the dual challenge of mastering English and acquiring the academic skills and knowledge deemed essential for a sound and productive education. Researchers at CREDE have studied four programs that meet the diverse and complex needs of ELLs: (1) newcomer programs, (2) transitional bilingual education, (3) developmental bilingual education, and (4) two-way immersion. This brief will summarize these programs by highlighting specific features and conditions that will help practitioners determine which programs meet their needs, fulfill their goals, and match their resources. When starting a new program or assessing the effectiveness of an existing one, {{it is important to consider}} common characteristics of all programs. Successful programs maintain ongoing and guided parental involvement and professional development for specialized and mainstream teachers. They promote proficiency in both first and second languages for academic purposes, and they use assessment methods linked to instructional objectives to inform instructional planning and delivery. Effective programs also encompass developmentally appropriate curriculum and high standards for language acquisition and academic achievement, as well as strong leadership among classroom, school, and district personnel. All programs <b>implement</b> <b>sheltered</b> instruction (SI), an approach that integrates language and content instruction. SI serves as a means for making grade-level academic content more accessible to ELLs while at the same time promoting their English language development. Academic subjects are taught using English as the medium of instruction. SI highlights key language features and incorporates special strategies to make the content meaningful and comprehensible to ELLs. In some cases, SI is used as a program option for educating ELLs. When looking at the unique characteristics of the following alternatives, educators should remember that there is no one best program. Rather, these different approaches are all successful if implemented well...|$|R
40|$|Many {{school systems}} across the USA have <b>implemented</b> <b>sheltered</b> {{instruction}} observation protocol (SIOP) strategies {{to help their}} English language learners (ELLs) master core content while they learn English. Most studies have reported positive results from using SIOP strategies with ELLs. Elementary and middle school studies were available, but studies of SIOP implementation in a comprehensive high school were lacking. This action research project was initiated by teacher leaders (department chairs) and the school principal. It included a year of combined SIOP training and implementation. After the first academic year of utilizing SIOP school-wide, an anonymous electronic survey was used to collect information on teacher implementation, the teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of students 2 ̆ 7 success, and teacher plans for future use of the SIOP model. This study was implemented in a comprehensive {{high school in the}} Rocky Mountain region. The research questions were: To what degree, do teachers having received in-service training in SIOP, report implementing the various components of the program in their daily instruction? After one school year of implementing the SIOP model, what are teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions regarding the effectiveness of using the SIOP model with students? How does SIOP need (number of ELLs per class), class size, years of teaching experience, teaching subject, or prior English as a second language (ESL) training relate to a teacher 2 ̆ 7 s perception of SIOP effectiveness scale? Is the level of implementation related to the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of effectiveness? Do teachers plan to use the SIOP model in the future? Teachers reported a high degree of implementing SIOP strategies. They perceived the strategies improved student learning in most cases. There was no statistically significant relationship found between the degree of SIOP implementation and perceptions of the effectiveness of SIOP. Correlational analyses indicated that SIOP need (number or ELLS per class), class size, years of teaching experience, teaching subject, and prior ESL training did not affect the degree of implementation or perceptions of the effectiveness of the SIOP model in this comprehensive high school...|$|R

40|$|This {{case study}} {{examined}} the instructional leadership of principals as co-participants in professional learning with teachers in a rural school district in eastern North Carolina. Teacher and principal interviews were the basis of understanding if {{the design of a}} professional learning initiative influenced principals towards facilitation and co-participation with teachers during Project Chief Education Officer (CEO). The implementation of the Sheltered Instructional Observation Protocol (SIOP) in this small district was the basis for two years of intensive professional learning for teachers and principals as a method for improving the teaching of academic language throughout the district.   	Qualitative data for the case study was collected using structured interviews to examine the primary research question of "How did participation in Project Chief Education Officer (CEO) to <b>implement</b> the <b>Sheltered</b> Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) influence teacher perceptions of professional learning and the instructional leadership behaviors of principals" in the following contexts: (1) the teaching of academic language; (2) facilitation and participation in professional learning; (3) teacher and principal perceptions of instructional leadership. The case study also examined participant responses in the context of: (1) historical perspectives; (2) perceptions of current reality; (3) reflections regarding instructional leadership behaviors.   	Findings revealed that the personal and professional narratives of teachers reflected the influence of principal instructional leadership behaviors as facilitators and co-participants on instructional practices and teacher perceptions of instructional effectiveness. Teacher narratives revealed that the instructional leadership behaviors of visible presence, resource provider and observing or monitoring provided the basis for positive teacher perceptions about the instructional leadership of principals and its influence on their engagement in professional learning and teacher instructional behaviors.   Ed.

40|$|The {{accident}} at Chornobyl Unit 4 on April 26, 1986, {{resulted in a}} series of unprecedented scientific and technical challenges. The reactor building was damaged extensively. Following the accident, immediate action was needed to seal off the gaping crater created by the accident, which was a continuing source of airborne contamination. Under extreme conditions, a structure called the {open_quotes}Shelter{close_quotes} was built over the remains of the reactor building. The Shelter, which was quickly completed in November 1986, was meant to provide immediate but temporary containment. Now, 11 years later, there are significant concerns about its structural integrity and projected life expectancy. The United States and other participating G- 7 countries are supporting nuclear safety upgrade efforts in Eastern Europe with a primary focus on placing the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP) Unit 4 Shelter in a stable and environmentally acceptable condition. Application of remote systems technologies will play an important part in achieving the goals of this program. The G- 7 nations have agreed to support these efforts, including the identification and development of remote system technologies for fuel removal. However at this time they have taken a firm stance against funding actual fuel removal activities. The U. S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology requested that a needs assessment be performed to evaluate the requirements for applying remote systems, including robotics, at the Shelter.

40|$|UnrestrictedContrary {{to popular}} belief, most English Language Learners (ELLs) in the United States are native born, and this {{particular}} population is projected to make up 82 % of the total American population in year 2050 (NCELA, 2006). A large achievement gap between ELLs and English speakers, however, has been identified, especially in urban districts, where reading and ELL student achievements tend to be low (Goldenberg, 2010). Presently, most ELLs are taught to decode the language by analyzing and identifying linguistic elements out of context. As a result, learners are less engaged and more detached about learning a language independent of meaning and relevant content (Goodlad, 1984). This study examined the use of reading materials that positively influence the achievement and classroom participation of native Spanish speaking English language learners (ELLs). A reading intervention was <b>implemented</b> in a <b>sheltered</b> ESL 3 (an equivalent to ninth grade English) classroom in a southwest urban school. This intervention addressed {{the extent to which}} culturally relevant authentic materials that incorporate learner’s native language (L 1) increased student achievement and participation.

40|$|A {{study by}} the Rennie Center for Education Research and Policy finds that English {{language}} learners (ELLs), a rapidly growing percentage of the Commonwealth's student population, are qualifying for transition into mainstream classrooms at a much slower pace than originally expected. The report examines the evolution of policies and practices affecting ELLs since the passage of Question 2 in November 2002. Question 2 mandated English immersion as the primary means of instruction for most ELLs and compelled schools to expedite the transition of students to mainstream classes. While Question 2 sought to limit English learners' immersion experience to a "period not normally intended to exceed one school year," federal Civil Rights legislation trumped Question 2 and mandated that students could not be re-classified out of ELL status until they can "participate meaningfully" in English-only classes. The Rennie Center's report examines whether expectations for an expedited transition process have been met and explores {{the ways in which}} the state Department of Education and schools and districts have tried to make sense of the conflicting mandates on what constitutes an adequate amount of time for a student to become proficient in English. Data from the Massachusetts English Proficiency Assessment (MEPA), a test designed to gauge the progress of English language learners, shows that after one year of English immersion only 17 % of ELLs score at levels indicating they are ready to transition to mainstream classrooms. Among ELLs who have been in Massachusetts' schools for five or more years, only slightly more than half score at the transitioning level. The report also found that schools throughout Massachusetts have developed diverse ways of interpreting and <b>implementing</b> <b>sheltered</b> English immersion. At a time of national debate about the status of immigrants and sharp increases in the numbers of non-English speakers in cities and towns across the Commonwealth and nation, it is critical that public schools focus greater attention on the issue of how best to meet the needs of English language learners. The report cites that while ten years ago only slightly more than half the school districts in Massachusetts enrolled ELLs, today that proportion has soared to nearly three-quarters. The number of districts enrolling one hundred or more English language learners has risen 37 % in the past decade. As the number of English language learners continues to rise, their performance persistently lags far behind that of native English speakers. According to the Rennie Center's report, ELLs scored below the median at every grade level in every subject on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS). Further, ELLs are 57 % less likely than their native English-speaking peers to earn the competency determination needed to graduate from high school. Both the No Child Left Behind legislation and the Massachusetts Education Reform Act require schools to ensure that ELLs meet the same performance standards as their native English-speaking counterparts. According to report authors, "That we are so woefully far from that goal should be cause for alarm and action. " The Rennie Center's study seeks to shed light on this issue by providing an analysis of policies and practices affecting ELLs in Massachusetts over the past five years and examining the state role in promoting improved practice. The report includes case studies of three schools that are making significant strides with large populations of English language learners and highlights common elements that the three schools have utilized to successfully meet the needs of English language learners. For example, each school studied offered multiple types of programs to accommodate the needs of students at varying levels of English proficiency, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Case study schools also developed a staged transition process that provided vital support as students moved into mainstream classes. Next Steps at the State and District Levels In a series of recommended next steps, the report urges state policymakers to encourage flexibility and experimentation with innovative approaches to meet the needs of English language learners; offer opportunities for schools to share practices; get specific about when students should transition out of ELL status and to provide clear guidance to schools and districts; ensure a pipeline of leaders for ELL programs; require sheltered English immersion training in teacher preparation programs. And schools and districts to: consider staged transition processes; set goals and create incentives to get teachers trained; pool resources among districts with small ELL populations; and focus more attention on reaching out to communicate with and provide guidance for the families of ELLs.

40|$|Professional {{development}} for teachers {{is a complex}} and multifaceted endeavor and is becoming more so as popularity grows for standards-based education. Teachers generally report feeling pressure to cover the curriculum at nearly any cost. For English language learners, the cost is greater than usual as teachers often inadvertently pay less attention to the language needs of these students in content courses. The project described in this report was designed {{with the belief that}} teacher professional growth can best be fostered through sustained collaborative inquiry between teachers and researchers. It has set out to incorporate what we know about quality professional development with the special features needed {{to meet the needs of}} English language learners. The purpose of the research project was to develop an explicit model of sheltered instruction that teachers could use to improve the academic success of their LEP students. The project has defined a model of sheltered instruction that is based on the research of best practices, as well as on the experiences of participating teachers and researchers who collaborated in developing the observation tool being utilized in the study. The tool, the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP), provides concrete examples of the features of sheltered instruction that can enhance and expand teachers’ instructional practice. In this project, the model was used to train middle school teachers to <b>implement</b> effective <b>sheltered</b> strategies in their classes in four large urban school districts (two on the east coast and two on the west coast). The project teachers use sheltered instruction in a variety of settings, such as traditional English as a second language (ESL) classes, content-based ESL classes, and sheltered content classes. English language learners represent 22 - 50 % of the total population at the project schools, and the proficiency levels of these students range from beginning to advanced. To date, this project has helped the participating teachers to expand their knowledge base. They have created learning communities in which they can discuss issues of real importance and set the pace for their own professional growth. Through discussion with more capable others, the teachers have had opportunities to increase their understanding of the subject matter — both the content and the language development topics — and they have explored new teaching and assessment strategies. For those untrained in ESL instruction, the project has provided a venue for learning about second language acquisition and for understanding the challenge English language learners face each day as they study multiple subjects through their non-native language...|$|R
40|$|Haiti {{was struck}} by a heavy {{earthquake}} in 2010 and international aid poured into the country. News reports in 2011 were not very positive about the results of post-disaster reconstruction: “The relief efforts are only putting Haiti on lifesupport instead of evolving into the next stage of development”. One of the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) involved in Haiti was Cordaid, <b>implementing</b> a ‘transitional <b>shelter</b> strategy’ to support the transformation of neighbourhoods from a state of life-support into a state of self-sustaining development. The strategy was implemented in both a rural and an urban area. The main feature of the strategy was the provision of structures that could be adapted from simple shelters to permanent houses. Since the results of the strategy were mixed and ambiguous, a comparative case study was conducted to evaluate the shelter strategy in both areas. The objective was to draw lessons about what has {{to be taken into account}} when formulating future urban shelter strategies. The case study is discussed in this article. The main finding from the case study is that producing the intended number of shelters within the financial and time budgets that were set (efficiency), was more difficult in the urban area than in the rural area. But the conditions for linking relief and development (effectiveness) are more favourable in the urban context. NGOs may achieve long-term (effective) results in the urban context when a lower efficiency can be justified. That is why NGOs need to engage in a debate about the extent to which they are able to focus on long-term shelter or housing strategies. The important element in the debate is communication with the donors who are often focused on short-term relief measures. However urban areas cannot be rebuilt with only short-term interventions. The link between relief and development has to be made by a process-orientated approach focusing on capacities of local participants.
