The entire university and its logistics moved to Sibiu. Cupcea remained in contact with his colleagues, publishing in Revista de Psihologie: in 1941, Constituția morfologică la bolnavii mintal ("The Morphological Built of the Mentally Ill"); in 1944, Încercarea unui sistem de psihopatologie constituțională evolutiv ("Sketching a System of Progressive Bodily Psychopathology"). He based these studies on the impact of health on intelligence, and the theories of Ernst Kretschmer, by examining the body types of university students, industrial workers and mental patients in relation to their intelligence quotient and state of mind, describing various correlations. A disciple of physician and eugenicist Iuliu Moldovan, he frequented ASTRA Society and published in its paper the 1941 tract Ce este Eugenia ("What Eugenics Is"). It discussed [...] "the improvement of the genetic dowry" [...] through both positive and negative measures. Quoting Moldovan and Francis Galton, Cupcea tried to delimit his field of interest from Nazi racial science (too radical) and euthenics (too mild), preferring Moldovan's term [...] "hygiene of the nation". At the time, he expressed himself as a supporter of strict biological determinism, and demanded the universal introduction of prenuptial examinations to filter out the <b>dysgenics.</b>|$|E

40|$|A new {{example of}} ``hybrid dysgenesis'' has been {{demonstrated}} in the F(1) progeny of crosses between two different strains of Drosophila virilis. The <b>dysgenic</b> traits were observed only in hybrids obtained when wild-type females (of the Batumi strain 9 from Georgia, USSR) were crossed to males from a marker strain (the long-established laboratory strain, strain 160, carrying recessive markers on all its autosomes). The phenomena observed include high frequencies {{of male and female}} sterility, male recombination, chromosomal nondisjunction, transmission ratio distortion and the appearance of numerous visible mutations at different loci in the progeny of <b>dysgenic</b> crosses. The sterility demonstrated in the present study {{is similar to that of}} P-M dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster and apparently results from underdevelopment of the gonads in both sexes, this phenomenon being sensitive to developmental temperature. However, in contrast to the P-M and I-R <b>dysgenic</b> systems in D. melanogaster, in D. virilis the highest level of sterility (95 - 98 %) occurs at 23 - 25 °. Several of the mutations isolated from the progeny of <b>dysgenic</b> crosses (e. g., singed) proved to be unstable and reverted to wild type.

Numerous small domains in the surface membrane of normal myotubes contain ordered arrays of intramembrane particles in groups of four (tetrads). The disposition of tetrads in the arrays is consistent with alternate positioning of tetrads relative to the underlying feet of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. <b>Dysgenic</b> myotubes have no arrays of tetrads. Some myotubes from successfully transfected cultures have arrays of tetrads with spacings equal {{to those found in}} normal myotubes. Thus the dihydropyridine receptor appears to be needed for the formation of tetrads and their association with the sarcoplasmic reticulum feet.

40|$|Muscular dysgenesis (mdg) is {{a lethal}} autosomal, {{recessive}} mutation of mice.

40|$|ABSTRACT The whole-cell patch-clamp {{technique}} {{was used to}} study voltagedependent calcium currents in primary cultures of myotubes and in freshly dissociated skeletal muscle from normal and <b>dysgenic</b> mice. In addition to the transient, dihydropyridine (DHP) -insensitive calcium current previously described, a maintained DHP-sensitive calcium current was found in <b>dysgenic</b> skeletal muscle. This current, here termed Ic~,t,, is largest in acutely dissociated fetal or neonatal <b>dysgenic</b> muscle and also in <b>dysgenic</b> myotubes grown on a substrate of killed fibroblasts. In <b>dysgenic</b> myotubes grown on untreated plastic culture dishes, Ic ~ is usually so small that it cannot be detected. In addition, Ic~ay, is apparently absent from normal skeletal muscle. From a holding potential of- 80 mV, Ic~.,a becomes apparent for test pulses to ~- 20 mV and peaks at ~ + 20 mV. The current activates rapidly (rise time ~ 5 ms at 20 ~ and with 10 mM Ca as charge cattier inactivates little {{or not at all}} during a 200 -ms test pulse. Thus, Ic~., ~ activates much faster than the slowly activating calcium current of normal skeletal muscle and does not display Ca-dependent inactivation like the cardiac L-type calcium current. Substituting Ba for Ca as the charge carrier doubles the size of Ic~. d ~ without altering its kinetics. Ic,.,a is ~ 75 % blocked by 100 nM (+) -PN 200 - 110 and is increased about threefold by 500 nM racemic Bay K 8644. The very high sensitivity of Ic~. ay, to these DHP compounds distinguishes it from neuronal L-type calcium current and from the calcium currents of normal skeletal muscle. Ic~. d ~ may represent a calcium channel that is normally not expressed in skeletal muscle, or a mutated form of the skeletal muscle slow calcium channel...|$|R

40|$|The {{dihydropyridine}} (DHP) receptor {{of normal}} skeletal muscle is hypothesized {{to function as}} the voltage sensor for excitation- contraction (E-C) coupling, and also as the calcium channel underlying a slowly activating, DHP-sensitive current (termed ICa-s). Skeletal muscle from mice with muscular dysgenesis lacks both E-C coupling and ICa-s. However, <b>dysgenic</b> skeletal muscle does express a small DHP- sensitive calcium current (termed ICa-dvs) which is kinetically and pharmacologically distinct from ICa-s. We have examined the ability of ICa-dys, or the DHP receptor underlying it, to couple depolarization and contraction. Under most conditions ICa-dys is small (approximately 1 pA/pF) and <b>dysgenic</b> myotubes do not contract in response to sarcolemmal depolarization. However, in the combined presence of the DHP agonist Bay K 8644 (1 microM) and elevated external calcium (10 mM), ICa-dys is strongly potentiated and some <b>dysgenic</b> myotubes contract in response to direct electrical stimulation.

40|$|One {{concern in}} the ongoing debate over the {{conservation}} status of mahogany has been the possibility that selective logging, {{as a form of}} negative phenotypic selection, might have led to deterioration in the genetic quality of populations. The incidence and degree of such ‘dysgenic’ effects is discussed, based on a consideration of mahogany logging practices, their expected genetic effects and empirical data on phenotypic selection in forest trees. Loggers have tended to avoid diseased, small, very large and poorly-formed individuals, and consequently logging has tended to increase the proportion of poor quality phenotypes relative to that before logging; in at least some conditions, selection differentials have been strongly negative. However, the upper limit for heritability of logger-selected traits in naturally-regenerated mahogany is probably no more than c. 0. 1. Consequently, and assuming relatively extreme but realistic negative selection differentials of 50 %, the maximum negative <b>dysgenic</b> response to a single logging-mediated phenotypic selection event is expected to be relatively small, i. e. [less-than-or-equal] 5 %. This expectation is consistent with the empirical information from mahogany and other taxa. The implications of any <b>dysgenic</b> effects depend very much on the use and the future of dysgenically-selected populations. In managed populations, <b>dysgenic</b> effects could be reversed through positive selection. In the case of exploited but currently unmanaged natural populations, <b>dysgenic</b> selection is primarily of importance insofar as it affects fitness.
