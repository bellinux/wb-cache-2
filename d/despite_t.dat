40|$|Efalizumab (anti-CD 11 a) {{interferes with}} LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 binding and {{inhibits}} several key steps in psoriasis pathogenesis. This study characterizes {{the effects of}} efalizumab on T-cell activation responses and expression of surface markers on human circulating psoriatic T cells during a therapeutic trial. Our data suggest that efalizumab may induce a unique type of T-cell hyporesponsiveness, directly induced by LFA- 1 binding, which is distinct from conventional anergy described in animal models. Direct activation of T cells through different activating receptors (CD 2, CD 3, CD 3 / 28) is reduced, <b>despite</b> <b>T</b> cells being fully viable. This hyporesponsiveness was spontaneously reversible after withdrawal of the drug, and by IL- 2 in vitro. In contrast {{to the state of}} anergy, Ca+ 2 release is intact during efalizumab binding. Furthermore, lymphocyte function-associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1) blockade resulted in an unexpected downregulation of a broad range of surface molecules, including the T-cell receptor complex, co-stimulatory molecules, and integrins unrelated to LFA- 1, both in the peripheral circulation and in diseased skin tissue. These observations provide evidence for the mechanism of action of efalizumab. The nature of this T-cell hyporesponsiveness suggests that T-cell responses may be reduced during efalizumab therapy, but are reversible after ceasing efalizumab treatment...|$|E

40|$|A {{great number}} of studies on {{scorpion}} venoms associate their effects to the autonomic nervous system, and few data are available about their action on {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). The aim of this work was to evaluate some central effects after intraperitoneal injection of Tityus serrulatus or T. bahiensis scorpion venoms. The hippocampal concentration of some neurotransmitters and their metabolites were determined. Electroencephalographic and behavioral observations were performed, and all brains were removed for histopathological analysis of hippocampal areas. Both venoms induced electrographic and behavioral alterations <b>despite</b> <b>T</b> bahiensis venom affects less the electrographic activity than T. serrulatus venom. Neurochemical analysis demonstrated no alteration in the extracellular levels of almost all the neurotransmitters evaluated, at least in the hippocampus, and no neuronal loss in this area was observed. Meanwhile, extracellular concentration of HVA increased up to 10 times in approximately 1 / 3 of the animals of both groups. Scorpion venoms seem to exert a small but important central effect.

40|$|The {{onset of}} acute graft-versus host disease (aGVHD) is {{accompanied}} by macrophage priming {{and the presence of}} bacteria derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the sera and organs of transplanted animals. Priming of macrophages occurs despite suppression of T cell function. We have investigated whether interleukin 12 (IL- 12) mediates the continued production of interferon gamma (IFN-$ gamma$) during the state of T cell immunosuppression accompanying aGVHD. AGVHD was induced in non-irradiated AxC 57 BL/ 6 mice by an injection of C 57 BL/ 6 lymphoid cells. <b>Despite</b> <b>T</b> cell immunosuppression, macrophages remained primed as shown by their expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and production of nitric oxide (NO) in response to exogenous LPS.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Hypothyroidism is {{associated}} with neurocognitive impairment. Sparse data suggest that treatment of hypothyroidism, resulting in a return to euthyroidism, {{may be associated with}} only partial recovery of overall neurocognitive functioning. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess neurocognitive functioning and well-being in euthyroid patients with primary hypothyroidism on adequate thyroxine (T 4) treatment. We also investigated whether serum TSH and thyroid antibodies are determinants of neurocognitive functioning and well-being. DESIGN: We assessed neurocognitive functioning and well-being in 141 patients with primary hypothyroidism. METHODS: Neurocognitive test results and scores on questionnaires measuring well-being of 141 patients were compared with the reference values for these tests as published and used in Dutch clinical neuropsychological practice. Assessment of neurocognitive functioning included tests for cognitive or psychomotor speed, attention, working memory as well as learning and memory. Well-being was measured with the Symptom Check List- 90 total score and the Rand 36 -item Health Survey subscales for 'mental health' and 'vitality'. RESULTS: Patients showed poor performance on various domains of neurocognitive functioning compared with mean standard reference values, especially on a complex attention task and on verbal memory tests. Levels of well-being were significantly lower for patients compared with those of the general population. Neither serum TSH nor thyroid antibodies were determinants of neurocognitive functioning and well-being. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that neurocognitive functioning as well as psychological well-being may not be completely restored in patients with hypothyroidism, <b>despite</b> <b>T</b> 4 treatmen...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Cutaneous {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (cSCC) {{is the most common}} human cancer with metastatic potential. <b>Despite</b> <b>T</b> cells accumulating around cSCCs, these tumors continue to grow and persist. To investigate reasons for failure of T cells to mount a protective response in cSCC, we focused on regulatory T cells (Tregs) as this suppressive population is well represented among the infiltrating lymphocytes. Experimental Design: Flow cytometry was conducted on cSCC lymphocytes and in vitro functional assays were performed using sorted tumoral T cells. Lymphocyte subsets in primary cSCCs were quantified immunohistochemically. Results: FOXP 3 + Tregs were more frequent in cSCCs than in peripheral blood (p+ (p= 0. 005, n= 10 tumors) and CD 8 + T cells (p= 0. 043, n= 9 tumors) and inhibited interferon-? secretion by tumoral effector T cells (p= 0. 0186, n= 11 tumors). The costimulatory molecule OX 40 was expressed predominantly on tumoral Tregs (p+ lymphocyte proliferation (p= 0. 0098, n= 10 tumors). Tregs and OX 40 + lymphocytes were more abundant in primary cSCCs which metastasized than in primary cSCCs which had not metastasized (n= 48 and n= 49 tumors respectively). Conclusions: Tregs in cSCCs suppress effector T cell responses and are associated with subsequent metastasis, suggesting a key role for Tregs in cSCC development and progression. OX 40 agonism reversed the suppressive effects of Tregs in vitro, suggesting that targeting OX 40 could benefit the subset of cSCC patients at high risk of metastasis...|$|E

40|$|Despite accumulating {{evidence}} that birds, in which females are the heterogametic sex, {{are able to}} manipulate primary offspring sex ratio, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Steroid hormones, which govern female reproduction and are also accumulated by the developing follicle could potentially affect primary sex ratio by differential follicle development in relation to future sex and meiotic drive, or by sex specific influence on oocyte abortion or fertilization. So far, experimental results on the involvement of maternal testosterone (T) in offspring sex manipulation are ambiguous. To investigate the effect of T on primary sex ratio and elucidate underlying mechanisms, we elevated circulating T levels in female homing pigeons (Columba livia). During {{the course of the}} experiment females produced three clutches‚Äîbefore and during T implantation, and one year after implant removal. Intriguingly, first eggs, but not second eggs of T females were significantly male biased relative to sham-implanted controls. One year after cessation of the treatment the male bias was still present, indicating long-term effects on female reproductive physiology. T treatment did not affect maternal body condition, nor was body condition correlated with offspring sex ratio. Our data on timing of oviposition, lack of infertile eggs, and yolk weight indicate a possible role for sex specific follicle abortion, perhaps in combination with meiotic drive. However, <b>despite</b> <b>T</b> treatment elevating maternal plasma levels, egg yolk T concentrations did not differ between treatment groups and did not vary with embryo sex, suggesting that yolk T is not involved in meiotic drive. ...|$|E
