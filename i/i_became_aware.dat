Corder was a devotee of the works of Wagner, whose music was Bax's principal inspiration in his early years. He later observed, [...] "For a dozen years of my youth I wallowed in Wagner's music to the almost total exclusion – until <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> of Richard Strauss – of any other". Bax also discovered and privately studied the works of Debussy, whose music, like that of Strauss, was frowned on by the largely conservative faculty of the Academy.|$|E

2500|$|Waldman was a shocked {{member of}} the crowd on the street that {{witnessed}} the catastrophic Triangle Waist Company fire of 1911, an event which clearly always remained with him and served {{as one of the}} landmarks of his life. Waldman described the grim scene in his 1944 memoirs: [...] One Saturday afternoon in March of that year — March 25, to be precise — I was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old Astor Library... It was a raw, unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed. I was deeply engrossed in my book when <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> of fire engines racing past the building.

[...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.|$|E
