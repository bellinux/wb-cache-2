All starter, grower and finisher diets were formulated to have 21. 5, 20. 5 and 19 % CP and 3050, 3100 and 3150 kcal/kg metabolizable energy, respectively. Average daily gain and daily feed intake were recorded over 19 and 42 days. Results indicated that addition of the <b>guar</b> <b>meal</b> to rations did not reduce body weight, feed consumption and feed conversion ratio.

Guar gum residue is the presumptive anti-nutritive factor in <b>guar</b> <b>meal.</b> An in vitro procedure was developed to measure the impact of guar meals and endo-ß-mannanase (Hemicell) on feed viscosity. ß-® mannanase was added to diets containing 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10. 0 % germ and hull <b>guar</b> <b>meal</b> fractions. ß-mannanase was added into each diet at ten different concentrations ranging from 1 / 32 - 100 times the recommended dose (1. 09 x 10 units/kg). Feed samples were mixed with water and enzyme solution (1 : 55 w/v) and incubated. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged and supernatant viscosity measured. Supernatant viscosity increased {{in direct proportion to}} <b>guar</b> <b>meal</b> concentration. Hull fraction increased viscosity more than the germ fraction. ß-mannanase significantly reduced the viscosity of all diets except the 2. 5 % germ fraction diet. An inverse relationship was observed between enzyme concentration and sample viscosity from 0 to the recommended enzyme level. Enzyme concentrations exceeding the recommended level did not further reduce viscosity of feed supernatant. These results are consistent with feed viscosity as the basis of feed efficiency improvement with enzyme feeding. Increased viscosity with <b>guar</b> <b>meal</b> inclusion and reduced viscosity with enzyme inclusion is consistent with the hypothesis that feed viscosity is the anti-nutritive effect of <b>guar</b> <b>meal</b> feeding...|$|E

The gum increases intestinal viscosity while decreasing nutrient absorption. Four experiments examined effects of two <b>guar</b> <b>meal</b> fractions (hull and germ) and ?-mannanase on in vitro feed viscosity, and on in vivo growth performance and intestinal viscosity in chickens. In vitro feed viscosity was measured at several ?-mannanase concentrations in corn/soy diets containing 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0 % <b>guar</b> <b>meal.</b> The enzyme significantly reduced supernatant viscosity of extracts from <b>guar</b> <b>meal</b> containing feeds except for the 2. 5 % germ fraction diet. In Experiment 2, 360 day-old chicks were randomly fed diets containing 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 or 10. 0 % guar hull or germ fractions. At 20 days, three birds per replicate were weighed, and organs were excised and weighed. Intestinal contents from duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were pooled within replicate for intestinal viscosity determination. In Experiments 3 and 4, 324 day-old chicks were fed 0, 5. 0, or 7. 5 % guar germ fraction, or 0, 2. 5 %, and 5. 0 % hull fraction with ?-mannanase. Body weight and feed consumption were recorded weekly. At 21 days, three chicks per replicate were eviscerated, weighed, and digesta viscosity determined. The hull, but not the germ, fraction significantly depressed body weight. Feed conversion was not significantly affected until more than 7. 5 % guar germ fraction or 5. 0 % guar hull fraction was fed. Intestinal viscosity significantly increased at 7. 5 % germ and at 2. 5 % hull fractions. The recommended enzyme concentration added to the 7. 5 % germ fraction diet reduced ileal viscosity from 5. 05 to 2. 35 centipoise, and enzyme significantly reduced ileal viscosity, increased body weight, and improved feed conversion of hull fraction diets. In summary, up to 7. 5 % <b>guar</b> <b>meal</b> germ fraction was fed to chickens to three weeks of age without growth depression or increased feed conversion.

In the 2 nd experiment, young pullets were fed guar germ (GG) or GM at 0, 2. 5 or 5 % for 20 weeks. In the 1 st and 2 nd experiments, egg production and feed consumption were not affected by feeding up to 5 % guar by-products whereas feed efficiency was decreased by guar feeding. Feeding of GG or GM did not affect egg weight or shell quality, but decreased the egg yolk color and Haugh units. Guar increased absolute and relative liver weight, but did not affect the weights of the pancreas, spleen, or the incidence of fatty liver or liver hemorrhage. Feeding 10 % GM depressed feed consumption and increased body weight loss. Feeding 15 % GM severely depressed egg production followed by a recovery of production after returning to 0 % GM feeding. In the 3 rd and 4 th experiments, late phase laying hens were induced to molt by feed withdrawal (FW) or feeding 15 or 20 % GM with or without &# 946;-mannanase (Hemicell??). All hens except those fed 15 % GM with enzyme obtained a complete cessation of lay in 10 days.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} a database on in situ ruminal crude protein (CP) degradability characteristics of by-products from cereal grains, oilseeds and animal origin commonly fed to ruminants in Pakistan and South Asian Countries. The oilseed by-products were soybean meal, sunflower meal, mustard seed meal, cottonseed meal, decorticated and un-decorticated cottonseed cake, maize oil cake and mustard seed cake. The cereal grain by-products were corn gluten meal, corn gluten feed, <b>guar</b> <b>meal,</b> toria meal, rice meal, rice polishings, rice bran and wheat bran. The animal by-products were fish meal, feather meal, blood meal, and meat and bone meal. Four samples per feed were collected from different dairy farms (n= 1), local markets (n= 1), and agro-food industries (n= 2). Ruminal protein degradation characteristics of the feeds were determined using the in situ nylon bag technique where each feed was incubated in the rumen of 3 mature steers for 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h. There were large differences in instantly soluble (W) fraction, potentially rumen degradable (D) fraction, rate of degradation (kd) and effective degradability of crude protein (EDCP) among the by-product feeds. Among the oilseed by-products, mustard seed cake had the highest (...|$|E

Two hundred and seventy Bacillus species were isolated from the soil and tested for alpha amylase production. Of all the species tested, the Bacillus licheniformis GCB- 36 gave maximum production of alpha amylase (200 U/g/min, 65 U/ml/min) in both solid state and submerged fermentation media. This strain was selected as parental strain for the optimization of cultural conditions. Different agricultural by-products such as wheat bran, rice bran, oat bran, nee husk. sunflower meal, cotton seed meal, <b>guar</b> <b>meal,</b> rape-seed meal and soybean meal were tested for the production of alpha amylase using solid state fermentation conditions. Of all the substrates tested, wheat bran along with cotton seed meal-at the ratio of 7. 5 : 2. 5 was selected as basal medium. The production of alpha amylase following growth of the organism was found to be optimum (260 U/g/min) as the basal medium was moistened with phosphate buffer (0. 02 M) and incubated at 40 Â°C for 48 h.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine standardized ileal amino acid digestibility (SIAAD) of commonly used feed ingredients in poultry diets in Pakistan. These feed ingredients included corn, rice broken (RB), rice polishings (RP), wheat bran (WB), sunflower meal (SFM), cottonseed meal (CSM), <b>guar</b> <b>meal</b> (GM), soybean meal (SBM) from India and Argentine and fish meal (FM). The SIAAD of each ingredient was determined in triplicate using 21 -days-old broilers. Day-old male broiler chicks (Hubbard× Hubbard) were reared on corn-SBM based diet from 1 to 13 days and thereafter birds were fed experimental diets from day 14 to 21. Each diet was fed to 36 birds kept in six replicate cages, each cage had six birds. In cereals, the SIAAD of corn’s amino acid (AA) (90. 1 %) was similar (p> 0. 05) to RB (89. 0 %). Isoleucine (97. 8 %) and lysine (96. 9 %) were highly digestible AA in corn and RB, respectively. Among cereal-by products, WB’s SIAAD (76. 9 %) was same (p> 0. 05) as RP (71. 9 %). Arginine from WB (82. 5 %) and RP (83. 2 %) was highly digestible. However, threonine in WB (72. 7 %) and leucine in RP (69. 6 %) were the lowest digestible AAs. In plant protein meals, AAs from Argentine-SBM (85. 1 %) and Indian-SBM (83. 4 %) had higher (p 0. 05). The SBM from plant protein meals had higher (p< 0. 05) SIAAD than other studied feed ingredients. However, the GM had the lowest (p< 0. 05) SIAAD among protein meals...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} inclusion of roasted <b>guar</b> <b>meal,</b> also known as guar korma, as a partial replacement for deoiled soybean meal (SBM) in commercial broiler diets, on production performance and carcass traits of Cobb- 400 broiler chickens. Materials and Methods: 1600 one-day-old Cobb- 400 broiler chicks were randomly assigned into four dietary treatments, each with four replicates (n = 100 chicks per replicate). The diets were iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric and included the basal diets composed of maize and SBM (T 0), T 0 + â-mannanase (T 1) and the treatment diets in whichSBM was partially replaced (20 g/kg in pre-starter, 50 g/kg in starter and finisher) with guar korma (T 2) and T 2 + â-mannanase (T 3). Results: Live weight was unaffected by the dietary treatments (P > 0. 05). Guar korma increased feed intake {{when compared with the}} SBM fed groups (P = 0. 01). Feed conversion was better (P = 0. 01) when SBM was fed to the chickens irrespective of mannanase supplementation. As a consequence the performance index score was superior (P = 0. 04) in the SBM fed groups when compared to the guar korma fed groups. Across the diets, feed conversion was superior (P < 0. 05) in the T 1 group suggesting a beneficial effect of â-mannanase in the maize-SBM diet. Dressed yield showed a trend to improve (P= 0. 08) upon â-mannanasesupplementation. Conclusion: It was concluded that partial replacement of SBM with guar korma may not yield any substantial benefits in terms of performance and carcass traits and that supplementation of â-mannanase may also not be worthwhile in alleviating the negative effects of guar korma...|$|E
40|$|In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), {{and also}} in other fish species, certain plant protein {{ingredients}} can increase fecal water content creating a diarrhea-like condition which may impair gut function and reduce fish growth. The present study aimed to strengthen understanding of the underlying mechanisms by observing effects of various alternative plant protein sources when replacing fish meal on expression of genes encoding proteins playing key roles in regulation of water transport across the mucosa of the distal intestine (DI). A 48 -day feeding trial was conducted with five diets: A reference diet (FM) in which fish meal (72 %) was the only protein source; Diet SBMWG {{with a mix of}} soybean meal (30 %) and wheat gluten (22 %); Diet SPCPM with a mix of soy protein concentrate (30 %) and poultry meal (6 %); Diet GMWG with <b>guar</b> <b>meal</b> (30 %) and wheat gluten (14. 5 %); Diet PM with 58 % poultry meal. Compared to fish fed the FM reference diet, fish fed the soybean meal containing diet (SBMWG) showed signs of enteritis in the DI, increased fecal water content of DI chyme and higher plasma osmolality. Altered DI expression of a battery of genes encoding aquaporins, ion transporters, tight junction and adherens junction proteins suggested reduced transcellular transport of water as well as a tightening of the junction barrier in fish fed the SBMWG diet, which may explain the observed higher fecal water content and plasma osmolality. DI structure was not altered for fish fed the other experimental diets but alterations in target gene expression and fecal water content were observed, indicating that alterations in water transport components may take place without clear effects on intestinal structure...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{cholecystokinin}} (CCK) in {{the regulation}} of gastric emptying and pancreatic enzyme secretion was evaluated by infusing the CCK-receptor antagonist loxiglumide. Gastric emptying rates and pancreatic secretory outputs were measured in five healthy volunteers by the double-indicator perfusion technique using a multiple-lumen tube in the duodenum. Placebo or loxiglumide (22 mumol. kg- 1. h- 1) was infused throughout each experiment. Five hundred-milliliter liquid intragastric meals of (a) fat, protein, and glucose (Ensure; Abbott, Chicago, IL); (b) glucose, 20 g/dL; and (c) guar gum, 1. 1 g/dL, were given in random order. In addition, {{the effect of a}} physiologic CCK- 8 dose (20 pmol. kg- 1. h- 1) after an intragastric 500 -mL saline meal (0. 154 mol/L) was tested. Intravenous CCK- 8 induced a marked retardation of the gastric emptying rate of the saline solution (P less than 0. 05) while stimulating pancreatic secretory outputs; both effects were completely abolished by the infusion of loxiglumide. Loxiglumide markedly accelerated the gastric emptying rates (by approximately 40 %) and simultaneously diminished lipase (by approximately 75 %) and trypsin (by approximately 50 %) outputs of both the mixed meal (P less than 0. 01) and the pure glucose meal (P less than 0. 05). Additional experiments using gamma camera scintigraphy confirmed the accelerating effect of loxiglumide on gastric emptying of the mixed meal (P less than 0. 01). The gastric emptying rate of the <b>guar</b> <b>meal,</b> which did not release CCK, was not influenced by the infusion of loxiglumide. Loxiglumide distinctly augmented plasma CCK levels after the mixed (2. 6 times) and the pure glucose (2. 1 times) meals while markedly reducing (approximately 76 %) pancreatic polypeptide release (P less than 0. 02). It is concluded that endogeneous CCK exerts a major role {{in the regulation}} of both gastric liquid emptying and pancreatic secretion in humans...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate whether a preconditioning period, in which adult leghorn cockerels are allowed 3 weeks to adapt to diets containing relatively high levels of <b>guar</b> <b>meal</b> (GM) resulted in changes in digestive tract morphology and ecology. It was expected that these changes would result in increased utilization of GM as birds became acclimated to consuming it at high levels. In the 1 st experiment, 28 birds were fed diets containing 0, 6, 12, or 24 % GM. Consuming the 24 % GM diet resulted in decreased body weight, increased small intestine, liver, and pancreas weight, increased ceca and villus length, and increased severity of injury to the intestinal mucosa (P < 0. 05). In the 2 nd experiment, 28 cockerels were subjected to a partial cross-over experiment. Preconditioning to the 24 % GM diet resulted in decreased TMEn of GM, decreased body weight, and decreased absorptive capacity of the GI tract as evidenced by increased energy lost via the excreta (P < 0. 05). The 3 rd experiment evaluated how differences in endogenous energy losses (EEL) from 30 cockerels affected the TMEn content of GM in birds consuming 0, 6, or 12 % GM. Decreased EEL was observed in birds conditioned to 6 and 12 % GM relative to the control group (P < 0. 05). Further, decreased TMEn of GM was observed in birds consuming 6 % GM relative to those consuming the control diet (P < 0. 05). In the 4 th experiment, changes in cecal microbiota were evaluated in 24 cockerels consuming 0, 6, or 12 % dietary GM using {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} of amplified bacterial DNA sequences. Cecal microbiota of birds consuming 12 % GM was considerably different from the control group (similarity coefficient = 84 %) with an apparent decrease in the complexity of microbial communities. Results of these studies show that consuming 12 % dietary GM results in changes in the cecal microbial community which may be responsible for modest increases in the TMEn of GM when compared to 6 % dietary GM, which consistently resulted in decreased TMEn values of GM. Further, determining the TMEn value of GM appears to be highly dependent upon factors such as preconditioning diet and timeframe and innate physiological "thresholds" which seem to initiate or limit the maximum physiological response to preconditioning that the bird is capable of...|$|E
