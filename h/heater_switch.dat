5000|$|Although {{the general}} {{design of the}} {{aircraft}} was robust, with an airframe fatigue life of 7,200 hours, the cockpit ergonomics were less than perfect. An example of this was the cabin <b>heater</b> <b>switch</b> being mounted next to the fuel cock. Unfortunately, {{this led to the}} loss of at least four aircraft when the pilot inadvertently closed the fuel cock instead of switching off the cabin heater, causing the engine to shut down. The autorotational qualities of the Scout have also been described by some pilots as 'startling'. In service trials and testing were carried out by the AAC's Development Wing at Middle Wallop, Hampshire. A wide variety of weapons and equipment were evaluated, although many were never adopted. Amongst these were the 7.62mm General Electric Minigun and the two-inch rocket pod. The rocket pods were mounted either side of the central fuselage section on the multi-spar weapon booms and both smooth tube and fin-stabilised rockets were tested, although the accuracy was described as [...] "indifferent". Studies were also carried out for a pintle-mounted M2 Browning machine gun in place of the standard 7.62 GPMG, and the French AME.621 20mm cannon. Another was the installation of a Bendix R.100 lightweight weather and ground-mapping radar, which had a range of eight and forty miles. This was mounted behind the fibreglass nose access panel along with a small viewing screen in the cockpit. The radar antenna was moved further forward later in the development to improve downward scanning.|$|E

We {{have concentrated on}} 1 day of observation, lasting ~ 3. 8 h. The MORRO radar, with its much wider beam, observes one or more PMSE layers all the time while the VHF radar observes PMSEs in 69 % of the time. Statistically {{there is a clear}} difference between how the MORRO and the VHF radar backscatter reacts to the heater cycling (48 s heater on and 168 s heater off). While MORRO often reacts by having its backscatter level increased when the <b>heater</b> is <b>switched</b> on, as predicted by Scales and Chen (2008), the VHF radar nearly always sees the "normal" VHF overshoot behaviour with an initial rapid reduction of backscatter. However, in some heater cycles we do see a substantial recovery of the VHF backscatter after its initial reduction to levels several times above that just before the <b>heater</b> was <b>switched</b> on. For the MORRO radar a recovery during the heater-on phase is much more common. The reaction when the <b>heater</b> was <b>switched</b> off was a clear overshoot for nearly all VHF cases but less so for MORRO. A comparison of individual curves for the backscatter values as a function of time shows, at least for this particular day, that in high layers above ~ 85 km height, both radars see a reduction of the backscatter as the <b>heater</b> is <b>switched</b> on, with little recovery during the heater-on time. These variations are well described by present models. On the other hand, the backscatter in low layers at 81 – 82 km can be quite different, with modest or no reduction in backscatter as the <b>heater</b> is <b>switched</b> on, followed by a strong recovery for both radars to levels several times above that of the undisturbed PMSEs. This simultaneous, nearly identical behaviour at the two very different radar frequencies is not well described by present modelling...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that the ionospheric plasma {{response}} to high-power HF radio waves changes drastically as the heater frequency approaches harmonics of the electron gyrofrequency. These include changes in the spectrum of the stimulated electromagnetic emission, reduction in the anomalous absorption of low-power diagnostic waves propagating through the heated volume, and reduction in the large scale F-region heating. Theoretical models as well as previous experimental evidence point towards the absence of small-scale field-aligned plasma density irregularities at pump frequencies close to electron gyroharmonics as the main cause of these changes. Results presented in this paper are the first direct observations of the reduced striations at the 3 rd gyroharmonic made by the CUTLASS radar.

The main target for this system is to have it designed and implemented such that it is cost-effective. This project consists of two modules- one is the temperature monitoring and the other is the temperature controlling. The temperature sensor senses the temperature and the inbuilt ADC in the microcontroller produces corresponding analog signal which is further processed by the microcontroller and the temperature is displayed in the LCD. The user's temperature requirement is given in the form of a setpoint and the microcontroller then compares the ambient temperature against this setpoint and further necessiates the controlling action using relays.

40|$|International audienceThe ionospheric {{electron}} gas can be heated artificially {{by a powerful}} radio wave. According to our modeling, the maximum effect of this heating occurs in the D-region where the electron temperature can increase {{by a factor of}} ten. Ionospheric plasma parameters such as N e, T e and T i are measured by EISCAT incoherent scatter radar on a routine basis. However, in the D-region the incoherent scatter echo is very weak because of the low electron density. Moreover, the incoherent scatter spectrum from the D-region is of Lorentzian shape which gives less information than the spectrum from the E- and F-regions. These make EISCAT measurements in the D-region difficult. A combined EISCAT VHF-radar and heating experiment was carried out in November 1998 with the aim to measure the electron temperature increase due to heating.

40|$|The {{development}} of a novel combined "ultrasonic/thermal" with "ultrasonic multiple reflections" clamp-on meter for measuring a wide flowrate range of clean liquids in small diameter pipes is presented. Current existing flowmeters based on ultrasound cannot measure very low flowrates for single phase liquids. The ultrasonic/thermal technique can measure single phase flows in the range 0 to 0. 6 m s' in pipes with diameters as small as 15 mm. It can also detect and measure reverse flows. The minimum flowrate for the ultrasonic multiple reflection technique is about 0. 55 m s', and theoretically, the measurement accuracy increases with increased flow velocity. The ultrasonic/thermal technique {{is based on a}} heating element and transducer pair(s) which can be clamped to the outside of a pipe. With the <b>heaters</b> <b>switched</b> on, the changes in the temperature of the pipe and the liquid inside it result in changes in transit time. The flowrate can be therefore estimated by either the transit time difference across the pipe at the two symmetric locations with respect to the heater centre, or at one location with a heater off/on comparison. The latter approach was felt to be the promising for low flowrate measurements and therefore selected for the numerical and the experimental investigations. The multiple reflection technique was developed based on the conventional transit time flowmeter. This technique extended the measuring range of the flowmeter and provided cross calibration for the ultrasonic/thermal technique. A computer model was developed for the ultrasonic multiple reflection technique. However, there was insufficient experimental data to confirm the computer prediction. Results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the meter are presented. For vertical pipes an axisymmetric model was used, but the presence of buoyancy forces required the use of a 3 -D model for horizontal pipes. Temperature and velocity distributions and ultrasonic transit times have been computed and are presented. In order to overcome the problem of mode conversion and refraction at the pipe wall/transducer mounting interface, novel transducers and mounting blocks are presented. A prototype heater and ultrasonic transducer system together with electronics for signal generation and transit time measurement have been designed and constructed. A hydraulic system has also been designed and constructed for testing the developed clamp-on flowmeter.

40|$|International audienceThe EISCAT {{incoherent}} radar system, {{which is}} collocated with the EISCAT heating facility, {{is used to}} diagnose the ionosphere while heating experiments are conducted. In late September 2002, an experiment was performed in which the heater transmitted a 2 -min-on/ 2 -min-off cycle while its pointing direction was kept fixed and the UHF beam was cycled through five pointing directions. This UHF cycle was used for three heater beam-pointing directions. For field-aligned heater beam and UHF pointing, UHF data indicated a gradual decrease, with time, in the altitude at which enhanced ion-line scatter occurred. This {{was accompanied by a}} reduction in the intensity of the scatter. For field-aligned heater pointing and the UHF elevation angle of 6 ° in the field-aligned direction, a persistent high-amplitude signature was observed, which remained at a fairly constant altitude throughout the period that the <b>heater</b> remained <b>switched</b> on. Different time histories of the backscatter amplitude were observed in other UHF pointing directions, including the "ion-line overshoot", which is characterized by an increase and subsequent decrease in the heater-enhanced backscatter just after heater switch-on.
