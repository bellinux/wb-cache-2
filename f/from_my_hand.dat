If a town were overcome by besieging troops, all women of priestly stock found in it are ineligible , but if they had witnesses, even a slave, or even a bondswoman, these may be believed. But no man may be believed for himself. Rabbi Zechariah ben Hakatsab said, [...] "By this Temple, her hand did not stir <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> {{from the time the}} non-Jews entered Jerusalem until they went out." [...] They said to him: No man may give evidence of himself.|$|E
2500|$|In her {{introduction}} to the 2002 edition of I, Me, Mine, Olivia Harrison notes that it is her handwriting on the original song lyrics for [...] "Learning How to Love You", which appear on an airmail envelope reproduced in the book. [...] "I wrote {{the first line of}} lyrics down for him as he was working out the melody," [...] she writes. [...] "Then he took the pen <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> and wrote words that would later guide him back to the thoughts he wanted to express." [...] These lines became the first verse of what author Alan Clayson describes as a [...] "discreetly jazzy" [...] song about [...] "unconditional spiritual love": ...|$|E
2500|$|Eclipse {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Anne Rouyer of School Library Journal {{gave the}} novel a positive review and said that, [...] "Meyer knows what her fans want: thrills, chills, {{and a lot}} of romance, and she delivers on all counts." [...] Rouyer also thought that as in the two previous installments, [...] "it is Meyer's effective and intense portrayal of first love in all its urgency, passion, and confusion that drives the story along with the supernatural elements coming in a close second", and said that the [...] "injection of heightened sexual tension and sensuality that hasn't been present in the series before" [...] contributed well to the emotional atmosphere of the novel. However, she found that the werewolves' and vampires' histories slowed the book's pace and called the newborn army's story a [...] "convoluted add-in", while noting that they [...] "contribute in some way to Bella's epiphanies about her future." [...] Katie Trattner of Blogcritics praised the characters and their development throughout the novel, particularly the histories of Rosalie and Jasper—contradicting Rouyer—stating, [...] "The history that formed them and their reactions towards Bella become clear and the characters much more solid because of this knowledge. I think {{that is part of the}} appeal of these books—the fact that you do become so wrapped up in the characters, that they touch places deep inside yourself." [...] She commended Meyer for painting a good emotional image, as well as Bella's emotional growth, and went on to say that she [...] "writes so fluidly and propels the reader forward so effortlessly." [...] Selby Gibson-Boyce of Tulsa World wrote, [...] "I read without stopping until I finished. Meyer's book would not detach itself <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b> Exactly the same thing happened with Twilight and New Moon." [...] Publishers Weekly wrote, [...] "The legions of readers who are hooked on the romantic struggles of Bella and the vampire Edward will ecstatically devour this third installment of the story", while noting that, [...] "it's unlikely to win over any newcomers." [...] Kirkus Reviews concluded its review stating that the book's [...] "unsettling racially charged characterizations are offset by messages of overcoming difference and working together. Fans of Bella's angst-drenched love triangle will gobble this entry up, and the open-ended conclusion paves the way for Jake's story to come." ...|$|E
