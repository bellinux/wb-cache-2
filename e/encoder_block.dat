Presently, researchers are investigating per-formance and synthesis of controllers and channel coding schemes in networks.

40|$|Existing encoder {{rate control}} (ERC) {{solutions}} have two technical limitations that {{prevent them from}} being widely used in real-world applications. One is that encoder side infor- mation (ESI) is required to be generated which increases the complexity at the encoder. The other is that rate estimation is at the bit plane level which brings computation load and latency when there are many bit planes. To maintain a low-complexity encoder, we propose an ERC solution that combines an eff i cient <b>encoder</b> <b>block</b> mode decision (EBMD) for the distributed residual video coding (DRVC). The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) ESI is not required as our ERC {{is based on the}} analysis of the statistical characteristics of decoder SI (DSI) in DRVC; 2) a simple EBMD is introduced which only employs the value of the residual pixels at the encoder to classify blocks into Intra mode, Skip mode, and WZ mode; 3) an ERC solution using pseudo-random code scrambling is proposed to estimate the rate for all the WZ blocks at the frame level instead of the bit plane level, i. e., only one rate is estimated; and 4) a quantization-index estimation algorithm (QIEA) is introduced {{to solve the problem of}} rate underestimation. Our simulation results show that the proposed solution is not only low complex but also eff i cient in both the block mode decision and the rate estimation.

40|$|The {{mismatch}} between the {{rapid increase in}} resolution requirements and the slower increase in energy capacity demand more aggressive low-power circuit design techniques to maintain battery life of hand-held multimedia devices. As the operating voltage is lowered to reduce power consumption, the maximum operating frequency of the system must also decrease while the performance requirements remain constant. To meet these performance constraints imposed by the high resolution and complex functionality of video processing systems, novel techniques for increasing throughput are explored. In particular, the entropy coding functional block faces the most stringent requirements to deliver the necessary throughput due to its highly serial nature, especially to sustain real-time encoding. This thesis proposes parallel architectures for high-performance entropy coding for high-resolution, dual-standard video encoding. To demonstrate the most aggressive techniques for achieving standard reconfigurability, two markedly different video compression standards (H. 264 /AVC and VC- 1) are supported. Specifically, the entropy coder must process data generated from a quad full-HD (4096 x 2160 pixels per frame, the equivalent of four full-HD frames) video at a frame rate of 30 frames per second and perform lossless compression to generate an output bitstream. This block will be integrated into a dual-standard video encoder chip targeted for operation at 0. 6 V, which will be fabricated following the completion of this thesis. Parallelism, {{as well as other}} techniques applied at the syntax element or bit level, are used to achieve the overall throughput requirements. Three frames of video data are processed in parallel at the system level, and varying degrees of parallelism are employed within the entropy coding block for each standard.

30|$|In {{sequences}} {{with highly}} irregular motion content, blind motion estimation at the decoder, {{by means of}} MCI for example, fails to deliver adequate prediction quality. One technique to overcome this problem is to perform hash-based motion estimation at the decoder. Aaron et al. [28] proposed a hash code consisting of a coarsely sub-sampled and quantized version of each block in a Wyner-Ziv frame. The encoder performed a block-based decision whether to transmit the hash. For the blocks for which a hash code was sent, hash-based motion estimation was carried out at the decoder, while {{for the rest of}} the blocks, for which no hash was sent, the co-located block in the previous reconstructed frame was used as side information. In [29], several hash generation approaches--either in the pixel or in the transform domain--were investigated. It was shown that hash information formed by a quantized selection of low-frequency DCT bands per block was outperforming the other methods [29]. In [12], a block-based selection, based on the current frame to be coded and its future and past frames in hierarchical order, was performed at the <b>encoder.</b> <b>Blocks</b> for which MCI was foreseen to fail were low-quality H. 264 /AVC Intra encoded and transmitted to the decoder to assist MCI. The residual frame, given by the difference between all reconstructed intra coded blocks or the central luminance value (for non-hash blocks) and the corresponding blocks in the Wyner-Ziv frame, was formed and Wyner-Ziv encoded. In our previous study [30], we have introduced a hash-based DVC, where the auxiliary information conveyed to the decoder comprised a number of most significant bit-planes of the original Wyner-Ziv frames. Such a bit-plane-based hash facilitates accurate decoder-side motion estimation and advanced probabilistic motion compensation [31]. Transform-domain Wyner-Ziv encoding was applied on the remaining least significant bit-planes, defined as the difference of the original frame and the hash [31]. In [32], hash-based motion estimation was combined with side information refinement to further improve the compression performance at the expense of minimal structural decoding delay.|$|R
