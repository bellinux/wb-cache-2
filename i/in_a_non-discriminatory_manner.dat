This essay does not dispute the presence of such a subtext, but argues that that the film’s gay codings, rather than celebrating and encouraging homosexuality, invoke bigoted stereotypes, negative psychoanalytic categories and masochistic cinematic conventions. The film represents homosexuality <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ostensibly <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner,</b> but undermines this potential through a range of cultural prejudices and conventionalized conservative cinematic techniques.

50|$|Canada {{is one of}} {{the largest}} owners of fresh water and has for years been engaged in a legal dispute over its {{possession}} of the resource. In 1990 an American company named Sunbelt was invited by the government of British Columbia to invest in a water exporting operation. Due to setbacks, the contract never matured and Sunbelt sued the government of British Columbia for failing to meet its obligations. After years of battle the Canadian government declared in 1999 that water in its fresh state as those found in rivers and lakes contains no economic value, and is therefore outside the obligations of its trade agreement. In addition, the government cited article XI of GATT (G). This article allows for the conservation of a natural resource as long as the action taken by the government is done <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner.</b> Sunbelt however, disagreed with the applicability of this clause and claimed that Canada’s actions are in direct violation of several international trade agreements. Particularly, Sunbelt addressed Article XI of GATT which forbids a member nation from imposing measures other than taxes, levies and other charges on the export of its good. Likewise, Sunbelt argued that the water located in British Columbia belonged to US companies just as much as it belongs to Canadian companies. This argument is based on Article 11 of NAFTA known as the investment chapter. Once water is extracted from its natural state for whatever reason that same right must be given to foreign investors. Sunbelt argues that Canadian companies had such extractions in the past and therefore opened the door for foreign investors to come in and do likewise.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Conflict, {{poverty and}} HIV disproportionately affect people in sub-Saharan Africa. The {{manner in which}} governments, {{national}} and international organisations and the media report on the HIV epidemic in situations of conflict, post-conflict and reconstruction can have unintended and negative consequences for those affected populations. The media <b>in</b> particular has <b>a</b> huge influence on how the world observes and reacts to the HIV epidemic among conflict-affected and displaced populations. Discussion Three case studies focused on Sudan, Uganda and Guinea describe what the media reported and why the reports were incomplete, misleading or incorrect. The exploration of possible ways {{to ensure that the}} media do not unwittingly inflame delicate and complicated situations of HIV among conflict-affected and displaced populations is then undertaken using epidemiological and journalistic principles. The discussion is divided into four sections: 1) Avoid stigmatising statements and ensure a balanced view; 2) Avoid accurate but misleading statements; 3) Avoid inaccurate statements by clearly stating sources and verifying their credibility; and 4) Do not repeat data and conclusions from other news sources without checking their accuracy. The aim of this manuscript is to stimulate awareness and debate among persons and organisations working on HIV/AIDS as well as the media in order to improve dialogue and ultimately to reduce stigma and discrimination amongst an already vulnerable group – conflict-affected and displaced persons. Summary The media and humanitarian organisations have published misleading and inaccurate HIV data and statements on conflict-affected and displaced populations in Sudan, Uganda and Guinea. Given the unique characteristics of the HIV epidemic and conflict-affected and displaced populations, the media have a special obligation to report <b>in</b> <b>a</b> balanced and <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner</b> that may go beyond the accepted standards of journalism. The media may wish to have the HIV data and their interpretation reviewed by technical experts before going to press. Specific training for reporters and editors regarding ethical issues and basic epidemiological methods may help them to better understand the complexity of the situation and report more accurately; similar training for media watch groups and human rights organisations may improve the monitoring of such situations and possibly reduce misreporting and subsequent discrimination. More rigorous HIV biological and behavioural surveillance should be undertaken in situations of conflict and displacement and humanitarian guidelines should be integrated with guidance on media relations and reporting responsibilities of humanitarian agencies. Finally, humanitarian agencies must ensure the data they release are sound and that any biases are clearly stated. Improved communication with the media will help to ensure more accurate reporting and interpretation. </p...|$|R

40|$|The article {{analyses}} the compatibility {{of various}} regulatory mechanisms {{provided by the}} new Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) {{with the requirements of}} WTO law, in particular those included in the TBT and TRIPS Agreements. After introducing basic provisions of the directive and summarizing the concerns raised by some WTO Members during meetings of the TBT Committee and the TRIPS Council, the article discusses in more detail the merits of those claims. It finds that concerns expressed by the WTO Members are generally overstated, as most TPD provisions, except for the temporal menthol exception, are WTO-compatible. The article also notes that significance of its conclusions goes beyond the specific context of the EU measure. The TPD introduces many progressive regulatory solutions which, although not being entirely original, are still at the forefront of contemporary tobacco control policies and will be adopted in the future in other jurisdictions. On that basis, the article concludes that WTO law, while imposing certain standards, generally does not stand against genuine tobacco control policies that are adopted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner...</b>|$|E

The reform, though, kept two restrictions for judicial auctions only: i) new maximum fees, and ii) the obligation for judges to assign auctions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner</b> among the different registered auctioneers. Competition policy concerns were severely reduced since freedom of entry, and maximum legal fees were considered enough disciplinary mechanism to avoid monopolistic inefficiencies. Using a sample of 680 and 1300 judicial and private auctions respectively, we find that Courts assign the judicial auctions in a discretional manner, and that the assigned auctioneers charge fees which are substantially higher than those permitted by law. We test the hypothesis that the judicial auctions ’ design has additional costs and, consistent with the predictions of a simple model, that it is more likely for Courts to appoint the less efficient auctioneers. We conclude also that, as the model predicts, the net price received by creditors and debtors in judicial auctions are about 18 % to 33 % below those possible to obtain in private auctions, where freedom of entry and freedom to set prices exists...|$|E
40|$|International {{commerce}} facilitates abusive {{child labor}} when {{it offers a}} market for the goods produced through such practices. International trade sanctions are thus a logical avenue for confronting abusive child labor, by eliminating the commercial opportunities for such goods. However, {{it is not clear}} that domestic child labor sanctions would survive legal challenge under WTO law as currently interpreted. For international trade law to serve as a viable strategy for change, there must first be a clear theoretical and doctrinal case for the WTO-consistency of domestic child labor-based sanctions. In this chapter, we present this case, using the U. S. section 307 forced labor statute as an example. Relying on existing case law of GATT panels and the WTO Appellate Body, we demonstrate how a child labor sanction can be held consistent with the exceptions in GATT Article XX for measures protecting public morals, and measures protecting human life and health, provided it is implemented <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner.</b> By offering a strategy for guiding domestic trade sanctions through a WTO challenge, we suggest how the full power of international trade can be deployed in the service of vulnerable children, enabling WTO members to act affirmatively against child labor practices...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Nurses are {{challenged}} to thoughtfully analyze {{the balance of}} professional responsibility and risk, including moral obligation and options, in particular situations {{in order to preserve}} the ethical mandates of the profession. Nursing creates a relationship of trust between nurse and patient, with special duties for the nurse, including the responsibility to care for patients. The nurse has a moral obligation or duty to patients and is not at liberty to abandon patients in need of nursing care. ANA Position: The American Nurses Association (ANA) believes that nurses are obligated to care for patients <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner,</b> with respect for all individuals. The ANA also recognizes there may be limits to the personal risk of harm nurses can be expected to accept as an ethical duty. History/Previous Position Statements: Historically, nurses have given care to those in need, even at risk to their own health, life, or limb. Indeed, the suggested Code of 1926 proclaims “the most precious possession of this profession is the ideal of service, extending even to the sacrifice of life itself [...] . ” (Committee on Ethical Standards, 1926). Nursing history is replete with examples of nurses who have knowingly incurred great risk in order to care for those in need of nursing or to contribute to the advancement of health science. Contemporary nurses, too, knowingly place themselves at risk when providing care in war-torn areas, places of poverty and poor sanitation, and situations of natural or human-made disaster. Nurses also encounter personal risk when providing care to patients with known and unknown, communicable or infectious diseases, as well as in other dangerous situations...|$|E

40|$|ArticleThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides, {{among other}} things, that “everyone {{has the right}} to an {{adequate}} standard of living…including the right to housing. ” 1 This has been defined by the first Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as, “the right of every woman, man, youth and child to gain and sustain a safe and secure home and community in which to live in peace and dignity. ” 2 As with other Economic and Social Rights International Law requires the progressive realization of the right, to the maximum of the country’s available resources, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner.</b> Sadly, in many countries in the world, Kenya included, the gap between housing rights rhetoric and realization is extremely broad. A recent report on the right to housing under international law, prepared by the UN, opens by stating that the right to housing is a ‘fundamental human right’, and that it has been recognized by “over 100 constitutions”. 3 The reality however remains that despite this constitutional recognition and the central place of this right within the global legal system; well over a billion people are not adequately housed. Millions around the world live in life or health threatening conditions, in overcrowded slums and informal settlements, or in other conditions which do not uphold their human rights and their dignity. Further millions are forcibly evicted, or threatened with forced eviction, from their homes every year. 4 This begs the question, what is the value of recognition? Does it translate into actual justiciability for those whose rights are violated? And perhaps more importantly, how are these rights to be adjudicated, especially in developing countries like Kenya where governments neither have the resources nor the ability to provide housing for huge proportions of their populations who live in crippling poverty...|$|E
40|$|Establishment {{in foreign}} {{countries}} can be achieved through a subsidiary company or a permanent establishment. Profit of a subsidiary company is normally taxed {{in accordance with the}} law of the country of where it is established, since a subsidiary company constitutes a separate legal entity. A permanent establishment on the other hand is not a separate legal entity, therefore profit in a permanent establishment is usually added on to the company’s total profit and taxed in accordance with the law of the country of where the company is established. Establishing business activities {{in foreign countries}} do normally not create problems, unless the business is carried on in a low tax jurisdiction. If that is the case, unlimited opportunities are created for companies to circumvent domestic taxation by transferring profit to the low tax jurisdiction, which in turn decreases the domestic tax base. In Sweden this kind of circumvention is precluded by chapter 39 a ITA, in the meaning that a shareholder in a foreign company can be tax liable of low taxed profit in a foreign. The question that arises is whether chapter 39 a ITA infringes on freedom of establishment. The outcome in the analysis {{is that there is a}} likeliness that chapter 39 a ITA constitutes a restriction on the freedom of establishment. The escape provided in article 52 TFEU cannot justify the measure. Nor is it likely that the measure can be justified by the rule of reason. In the light of the assessment done in the analysis, it can be concluded that the chapter 39 a ITA is applied <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner,</b> satisfies a mandatory requirement (prevention of tax avoidance) and is regarded as appropriate in securing the achievement of the objectives.
