5|$|Freedom <b>from</b> <b>Fear</b> is {{the last}} of a series of four oil {{paintings}} entitled Four Freedoms, painted by Norman Rockwell. The works were inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State of the Union Address delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941; the speech itself is often called the Four Freedoms. The Four Freedoms theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings was printed in The Saturday Evening Post, accompanied by essays from noted writers, on four consecutive weeks in early 1943: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom <b>from</b> <b>Fear</b> (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government's Second War Bond Drive.|$|E
5|$|The Freedoms were {{published}} {{in a series of}} four full-color, full-page editions, each accompanied by an essay of the same title. The panels {{were published}} in successive weeks in the order corresponding to Roosevelt's speech: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6), and Freedom <b>from</b> <b>Fear</b> (March 13). For the authors of the accompanying essays, Hibbs had numerous options given the number of regular contributors to The Post.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hurricane}} of {{the season}} was observed on July11, when a schooner encountered heavy seas {{to the south of}} the Florida Panhandle. As the hurricane moved westward, it remained a short distance off the Gulf Coast of the United States, bringing strong winds to New Orleans on July12. High tides surrounded the lighthouse at Timbalier Bay for about 24hours, prompting the lighthouse keeper to resign from loneliness and <b>from</b> <b>fear</b> of the weather.|$|E

5|$|Freedom <b>from</b> <b>Fear</b> is {{the last}} of the {{well-known}} Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his State of the Union Address on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Benét. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information <b>from</b> <b>fear</b> of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March, a new {{compilation}} {{to accompany}} 2009's Somewhere Back in Time was announced. Entitled <b>From</b> <b>Fear</b> to Eternity, the original release date {{was set at}} 23 May but was later pushed back to 6 June. The double disc set covers the period 1990–2010 (the band's most recent eight studio albums), and, as on Somewhere Back in Time, live versions with Bruce Dickinson were included in place of original recordings which featured other vocalists, in this case Blaze Bayley.|$|E

5000|$|Other Advaitin Hindu texts {{resonate}} with the monist views of Adi Shankara. For example, Isa Upanishad, in hymn 1.5-7, states Ishvara is [...] "above everything, outside everything, beyond everything, yet also within everything"; he who knows himself as all beings and all beings as himself - he never becomes alarmed before anyone. He becomes free <b>from</b> <b>fears,</b> <b>from</b> delusions, from root cause of evil. He becomes pure, invulnerable, unified, free from evil, true to truth, liberated like Ishvara.|$|R
5|$|The city, which {{suffered}} from fires {{caused by the}} Pecheneg siege, surrendered upon seeing the main Polish army on August 14. The entering forces, led by Bolesław, were ceremonially welcomed by the local archbishop and Vladimir's family: On 14 August, the city received Boleslav and Sventipolk , its long-absent lord. Thereafter, through his favour, and <b>from</b> <b>fear</b> of us, the whole region was brought into submission. When they arrived, the archbishop of that city received them, at the church of St Sophia, with relics of the saints {{and other kinds of}} ceremonial apparatus.|$|E

Kennan Professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want is {{the third}} {{in a series of}} four oil {{paintings}} entitled Four Freedoms by Norman Rockwell. They were inspired by , known as Four Freedoms, delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941. In the early 1940s, Roosevelt's Four Freedoms themes were still vague and abstract to many, but the government used them to help boost patriotism. The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran in The Saturday Evening Post accompanied by essays from noted writers on four consecutive weeks: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6), and Freedom <b>from</b> <b>Fear</b> (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government War Bond Drive.|$|E

5|$|Freedom of Speech was {{the first}} of a series of four oil paintings, {{entitled}} Four Freedoms, painted by Norman Rockwell. The works were inspired by United States President, Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State of the Union Address, known as Four Freedoms, delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941. Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the United States Constitution were freedom of speech and freedom of worship. The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran in The Saturday Evening Post accompanied by essays from noted writers on four consecutive weeks: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom <b>from</b> <b>Fear</b> (March 13).

The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in The Saturday Evening Post, accompanied by essays from noted writers: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom <b>from</b> <b>Fear</b> (March 13). For the essay accompanying Freedom of Worship, Post editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author {{at the peak of his}} fame. At the time, Durant was in the midst of working on his ten-volume The Story of Civilization, coauthored with his wife, Ariel Durant. Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy. Eventually, the series of paintings became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government War Bond Drive.|$|E
5|$|In a {{press release}} {{regarding}} <b>From</b> <b>Fear</b> to Eternity, band manager Rod Smallwood revealed that Iron Maiden will release a new concert video to DVD in 2011, filmed in Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Argentina during The Final Frontier World Tour. On 17 January 2012, the band announced that the new release, entitled En Vivo!, based on footage from the Chile concert, will be made available worldwide on CD, LP, DVD and Blu-ray on 26 March, except the United States and Canada (where it was released on 27 March).

5|$|Nefarious covers human {{trafficking}} in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Interviews are interspersed with re-enactments. The film {{opens with a}} re-enactment of a girl being kidnapped by organized criminals. She is confined with other girls in a dark room, lit by a flickering lightbulb. Men order the girls to remove their clothes, and then examine them and shout commands and threats at them, causing them to cry <b>from</b> <b>fear.</b> One girl is dragged into another room. A victim of ordeals such as these, speaking in voiceover, explains that, in this situation, girls are often taken into a separate room to have their sexual performance tested. Identifying these events as taking place near Belgrade, Serbia, the film then tracks the fictional girls through Croatia to Amsterdam's red-light district De Wallen, and to sex markets in Berlin and Las Vegas. The film states that this slavery goes unnoticed in cities where prostitution is legal. Slaves are depicted in confinement, at their places of work, and as they are sold. Many of the girls are orphans, and all are either kidnapped or tricked into forced prostitution. Traffickers in the film use hard drugs, brainwashing and sexual and physical abuse to keep the girls under control.|$|E
