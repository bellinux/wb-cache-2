5|$|August 9, 1878: At {{least three}} tornadoes {{affected}} {{the state from}} a single storm system. The first touched down in South Kent, causing major damage but no injuries. The second, the Wallingford Tornado of 1878, touched down just outside Wallingford. A severe tornado, likely an F4, it smashed through {{the north side of}} town, completely destroying dozens of houses. At least 29 people were <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> town (likely 34), the most by any tornado event in Connecticut history. A third tornado moved through Durham and Killingsworth, unroofing houses but again causing no injuries.|$|E
5|$|The Kathy Kane {{version of}} Batwoman was {{restored}} to modern continuity by writer Grant Morrison in flashback sequences in various issues of his {{run on the}} Batman-related titles, most explicitly in Batman Incorporated #4 (August 2011). This issue reveals {{the origin of the}} original Batwoman in current DC Universe continuity; she is Bruce's aunt by marriage. After she was widowed, she and Bruce fought side by side and were lovers for a time until it appeared she was <b>killed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> time, she worked reluctantly {{as a member of the}} spy organisation Spyral, which had employed her to uncover Batman's identity. Her biological father was also revealed to be the Nazi scientist Otto Netz (Doctor Dedalus). In 2013, in Morrison's final Batman Incorporated issue, Morrison then reveals that Kathy is alive working as an assassin for Spyral. Kathy then makes a few fleeting appearances in Grayson (2014–2016), referred to primarily as Agent Zero. In Grayson #8, during a fraught encounter between Dick Grayson and acting Spyral head Mr Minos, Kathy shows up to assassinate him.|$|E

50|$|He {{made his}} feature film directorial debut in 1991 with New Jack City. This was {{followed}} by Posse in 1993, Panther in 1995 and Love <b>Kills</b> <b>in</b> 1998. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> period he also co-directed Gang in Blue with his father.|$|R
25|$|The {{names of}} several Civil War battles are carved on the monument's central granite pillar, as the memorial's {{original}} {{intent was to}} honor those <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> particular war. The inscriptions include the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Chickamauga, the Battle of Gettysburg, the Battle of Malvern Hill, the Battle of Petersburg and the Battle of the Wilderness.|$|E
25|$|In 1885, three Anglican Ugandans {{were killed}} and the {{arriving}} Archbishop of the Province of Eastern Equatorial Africa, James Hannington, together with his party were arrested, detained and later executed at the orders of the Kabaka. Joseph Mukasa, a Roman Catholic priest and {{an official of the}} Bugandan court, rebuked the deed and was arrested and beheaded. This was the precursor to the large scale persecutions and killings from 1886 to 1887 of Anglicans and Roman Catholics. Those who were <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> period are remembered as the Martyrs of Uganda.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, on 5 May, the Legion, {{along with}} the Polish unit under Miniewski, {{took part in the}} Battle of Krzykawka. In the first stage of the battle, the insurgents push the Russian troops back in close fighting; but {{subsequent}} Russian reinforcements turned the tide and the insurgents and their foreign allies suffered heavy casualties; both Miniewski and Nullo were <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> battle. Nullo was mortally injured leading the charge. Hit by a Cossack bullet while preparing (or leading) a charge (sources vary), he had only time to whisper, in Bergamo dialect: So' mort! (I'm dead). Several other Italians were killed in this battle, and some were taken prisoner and deported to Siberia, including the cornigliese Giovanni Rustici.|$|E

25|$|Other {{observers}} {{have criticized the}} thoroughness of the investigation, and the validity of its conclusions. The author James Baldwin, in his essay The Evidence of Things Not Seen (1985), raised questions about Williams' guilt. Members of his community {{and several of the}} victims' parents did not believe that Williams, the son of two professional teachers, could have killed so many. On May 6, 2005, DeKalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ordered the reopening of the murder cases of four boys <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> county between February and May 1981 that had been attributed to Williams. The announcement was welcomed by relatives of some victims, who said they believe the wrong man was blamed for many of the murders.|$|E
25|$|As a Letter of the Living {{he served}} as a {{prominent}} Bábí evangelist and leader. His travels and public preaching were instrumental in spreading the religion throughout Persia, allowing him to come into contact with many prominent clerics and government officials, including Bahá'u'lláh and Mohammad Shah Qajar. He is often mentioned in Bahá'í literature as a paragon of courage and spiritual excellence. He led the Bábí combatants at the Battle of Fort Shaykh Tabarsi, and was <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> battle on February 2, 1849. Mullá Husayn is regarded as a significant martyr in Bábism and the Bahá'í Faith and accorded a high spiritual station in both religions as the first to believe in the Báb and a prominent participant in the perceived fulfillment of many elements of Islamic eschatology.|$|E
25|$|Because Bernard's {{family had}} {{attachments}} to the monastery of Saint-Evroul-sur-Ouche, the monkish chronicler Orderic Vitalis of that foundation had special knowledge {{of him and}} his family, though this still does not reduce the general obscurity of his origins or his life when compared to the richer Marcher lords, like the great Roger of Montgomery. Bernard was the son of the minor and incompetent Norman baron Geoffrey de Neufmarché and Ada de Hugleville, and he was born at the castle of Le-Neuf-Marché-en-Lions on the frontier between Normandy and Beauvais. His ancestors on his mother's side had founded the town of Aufay south of Dieppe on the Scie, while his paternal grandfather, Turketil had served the young William II of Normandy as a guardian and was <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> capacity. On his mother's side he also descended from Richard II of Normandy.|$|E

25|$|The Lancashire Fusiliers War Memorial is a First World War {{memorial}} originally {{dedicated to}} members of the Lancashire Fusiliers <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> conflict, and located in Gallipoli Gardens in Bury, Greater Manchester (historically in Lancashire), in north-west England. It was unveiled in 1922, on the seventh anniversary of the landing at Cape Helles, part of the Gallipoli Campaign in which the regiment suffered particularly heavy casualties. Lutyens was commissioned in light of a family connection—his father and great uncle were officers in the Lancashire Fusiliers, a fact noted on a plaque nearby. He designed a tall, slender obelisk in Portland stone. The regiment's cap badge is carved near the top on the front and rear, surrounded by a laurel wreath, while its motto is inscribed further down and a dedication is inscribed on the base. Two painted stone flags hang from the sides.|$|E
500|$|Yet another {{incident}} {{prior to the}} execution of Malleolus is of relevance. Some 30 years before the times of Malleolus, [...] in the upheavals and riotings caused by the reform program urged on by Tiberius Gracchus, a man called Caius Villius, an ally of Gracchus, was condemned on some charge, and was shut up in a vessel or jar, to which serpents were added, and he was <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> manner.|$|E

500|$|The tornado then entered Oklahoma County {{and struck}} the {{southeast}} fringes of Oklahoma City, where it re-intensified to high-end F4 strength and {{two people were}} killed as a trucking company was completely destroyed. Shortly before it tracked into the county, patrons and employees at Crossroads Mall were evacuated to storage areas {{in the basement of}} the building. Numerous industrial buildings were leveled in this area of the city. A freight car, weighing [...] was thrown [...] The car bounced as it traveled, remaining airborne for [...] at a time. Multiple homes were also completely destroyed in southeast Oklahoma City, and one woman was <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> area. Crossing Southeast 44th Street into Del City, the tornado moved through the highly populated Del Aire housing addition, killing six people and damaging or destroying hundreds of homes, with many sustaining F3 to F4 damage. Seven people were killed as a direct result of the tornado in Del City, and hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Day of Defeat: Source {{is set in}} World War II, {{specifically}} the European Theatre in 1944. Players join the forces of either the United States Army or the German Wehrmacht and compete {{against each other in}} a variety of game modes. Players select from one of six classes to play as, each with its own role within the team. Player characters cannot take much damage, and in some circumstances can be killed by a single bullet, forcing players to make use of cover to stay alive. When a player character dies, that player starts a short countdown for reinforcements. When the timer runs out, the player and any friendly players <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> time respawn into the game at their insertion point as the next wave of troops. All weapons in the game have realistic limits to their use: machine guns must be deployed to maintain accurate fire or to be reloaded, rocket launchers must be shouldered to be aimed and fired, sniper rifles are most accurate when used with the scope and grenades not [...] "cooked off" [...] before release may be easily fled or even thrown back by the opposition.|$|E
500|$|Later {{that year}} Cros led his brigade, {{as part of}} the 1st Moroccan Infantry Division, at the Second Battle of Artois - an allied attempt to capture Vimy Ridge with an assault on a [...] wide stretch of the front. [...] Cros took {{particular}} care to inspire a keen esprit de corps in his men and {{on the eve of the}} attack told them: [...] "I am your father and you know that I love you as my children, if you want to show me that you love me in return, fight and kill lots of Boche". [...] At 10 AM on 9 May 1915 Cros' brigade advanced in conjunction with the division's 1st Brigade, a French Foreign Legion unit led by Colonel Pein. [...] The five-hour preliminary bombardment was largely ineffective and the division took heavy casualties in reaching the German lines, [...] distant. [...] However they managed to push the Germans out and some units even reached the villages of Vimy and Givenchy-en-Gohelle. [...] The next morning, hit by their own artillery and under German counter-attack, the French were forced to withdraw to their own lines in the course of which Cros was killed. [...] Cros was one of almost 2,000 men of the Moroccan division <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> action, as was fellow brigade commander Colonel Pein.|$|E

There are men—there are heroes there. You'll see familiar faces and favorites, but the heroines are in charge, by majority. It's just this is how their world evolved. They were competent. They were clever and they were the ones in charge because of their skills and they were the best fit for these roles and demands of their world.|$|E
