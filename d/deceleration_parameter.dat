40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{generalized}} second law of thermodynamics in the scope of the f(R,T) theory of gravity, with R and T representing the Ricci scalar and trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively.

Then, the generalized second law of thermodynamics is quantified and some relations for its obedience in f(R,T) gravity are presented.

50|$|This {{steady-state}} exponentially expanding spacetime {{is called}} a de Sitter space, and to sustain it {{there must be a}} cosmological constant, a vacuum energy proportional to Λ everywhere. In this case, the equation of state is p=−ρ. The physical conditions from one moment to the next are stable: the rate of expansion, called the Hubble parameter, is nearly constant, and the scale factor of the Universe is proportional to eHt. Inflation is often called a period of accelerated expansion because the distance between two fixed observers is increasing exponentially (i.e. at an accelerating rate as they move apart), while Λ can stay approximately constant (see <b>deceleration</b> <b>parameter).</b>|$|E
