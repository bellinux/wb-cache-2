Suction sampling was used to collect Araneae, Coleoptera, Hemiptera and Hymenoptera, with Araneae and Coleoptera also sampled with pitfall trapping. Univariate analyses found {{no significant differences in}} abundance and species density between treatments. However, with multivariate analysis there were significant differences in arthropod community structure between treatments in both experiments. Reducing nitrogen input and associated stocking rates, as targeted by agri-environment schemes, can significantly alter arthropod communities, but without increasing the number of species present. Other approaches that may be necessary to achieve substantial enhancement of sward arthropod biodiversity are suggested...|$|E

30|$|The {{downsizing}} of <b>grassland</b> livestock <b>husbandry</b> through privatization upsets {{the traditional}} way of livestock herding, causing numerous impacts on production structure and the environment. Constrained by the small and fragmented grassland size of individual owners, rotational grazing became less applicable and degradation is more possible (Zhang and Li 2008). The pastoral management system changed fundamentally; herdsmen’s consciousness of grassland ownership right was motivated and began to invest on construction, especially fences. Pastoral culture of mutual support within the community began to disintegrate, while market mechanisms began to penetrate into labor force (Da and Zheng 2010). As a side effect, grasslands were divided into pieces and livestock mobility was further lost (Williams et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|China has {{abundant}} grassland resources (approximately 400 million ha {{of natural}} grasslands), {{which account for}} 41. 7 % of China's total area. Grasslands are an important base for boosting the development of China's livestock husbandry economy and maintaining China's ecological security. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed data, this study developed a grassland vegetation growth index that ranked the magnitude of grassland vegetation growth indices across {{a wide variety of}} field experiments. This study applied the grassland vegetation growth index to conduct remote-sensing monitoring of the spatiotemporal status of China's grassland vegetation growth in 2008. We found that the vegetation growth of China's grassland was classified as 'good' in 2008. The areas of grassland with desirable vegetation growth accounted for 38. 47 % of China's monitored grassland areas, and the areas with less desirable vegetation growth accounted for 22. 85 %. Additionally, the good vegetation growth was stable within each 10 day study period in 2008. The vegetation growth reached a balance in early June. After early September, the proportion of grasslands with desirable vegetation growth declined, and the proportion of grasslands with balanced and less desirable growth increased. The regions with less desirable vegetation growth mainly included the middle and eastern regions of Inner Mongolia, the northern region of Xinjiang, and most parts of Heilongjiang. The regions with desirable vegetation growth were mainly distributed in the north of Tibet, the southwest of Qinghai, the west of Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Shanxi, and the northwest of Liaoning. The remote-sensing monitoring of the spatiotemporal patterns of China's grassland vegetation growth in the present study revealed the overall vegetation growth status of China's grassland on a broad scale. These findings could provide a helpful scientific basis for understanding China's grassland vegetation conditions and the management and regulation of <b>grassland</b> livestock <b>husbandry.</b> 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Grassland {{ecosystems}} can {{be found}} on every continent, except Antarctica thanks to their high tolerance and adaptability. Moreover the <b>grassland</b> based animal <b>husbandry</b> is an ancient and easy way for food production even in regions where other agricultural sectors can not be effective. On the other hand these ecosystems are not only valuable because of their role in food production. Grasslands take their share in carbon sequestration, erosion controlling and the conservation of biodiversity and that is why the European Union made strict rules about grassland management. In our experiment we tested two different types of compost - what are officially allowed in organic farming - on natural grassland in Hungary. Three rates of compost (10 t/ha, 20 t/ha, 30 t/ha) were tested on 3 m X 10 m experimental plots in four replication. Both type had four control plots too, this way we had 32 experimental plots. We measured the botanical composition in May and September, what was followed by harvesting and the measurement of the yield. Samples for laboratory analysis were also taken. Dry matter yield of the pasture showed positive responses to the rates of compost but the protein yield per unit area only grows until a certain point and then it drops down. Our results indicate that the application of these composts is a sustainable method of increasing the productivity of natural grasslands...|$|R
40|$|An {{outstanding}} part of {{the animal}} products {{are based on the}} grasslands, {{due to the fact that}} the grassland ecosystems can be found all over the globe. In places where economical and successful crop production cannot be managed, the <b>grassland</b> based animal <b>husbandry</b> can be an efficient way of food production. In addition, these ecosystems have an important role in carbon sequestration, and with their rich flora – and fauna connected to it – in conservation of biodiversity. The protection of nature, and the sustainable agriculture is getting more and more attention in the European Union, but, looking at the consumers’ needs, the production of healthy food cannot be neglected either. Because of these facts, the effects of two specific composts - which are officially authorized in organic farming, in Agri-environment Schemes and Natura 2000 programs – on grass yields and sward compositions were investigated in a field trial. The investigation took place in Hungary, on a natural grassland based on solonetz soil. Three rates of compost (10 t/ha, 20 t/ha, 30 t/ha) were tested on 3 m X 10 m experimental plots. Every treatment had four replications and both type of compost had four-four control plots too, this way 32 experimental plots were included in the investigations. The yield of the pasture was harvested two-times (in May and in September) and before cutting the plots, measurements on botanical compositions were made. Samples for laboratory analysis were also taken. Dry matter yield of pasture showed positive responses to the rates of composts. The increase in dry matter yield was partly due to some positive changes in sward composition. It means that the proportions of grass species with higher yield potential increased in ground cover of the sward without depressing out valuable native species of diverse natural grasslands. The research results indicate that the use of organic compost can be an efficient way to increase grass yields in a sustainable way...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of systemic modeling methods {{to understand the}} variation of natural capital and ecosystem services in response to economic activities has huge significance for sound decision-making also at local scale. This paper reports {{the results of an}} investigation performed on the grassland ecosystem in North Xinjiang. The Emergy Synthesis method introduced by H. T. Odum in the 1980 s was used to dynamically simulate the trend of grassland natural capital and its related ecosystem services. The simulation of natural capital was based on indexes of standing biomass, soil organic matter, soil nitrogen and soil water storages; ecosystem services were assessed by means of indexes of annual CO 2 uptake, O 2 release, forage supply as animal feed, food supply for human nutrition, and finally soil conservation. Results indicate that an upper limit of livestock carrying capacity in the region was reached in the year 1994; after that year the natural capital and main ecosystem services of the grassland ecosystem declined steadily. The emergy based currency equivalent value of the grassland ecosystem in terms of ecosystem services was higher than 87. 3 billion Yuan RMB/yr in 1990. Such a value declined to 62. 3 billion Yuan RMB/yr in 2010. Similarly, the total emergy based value of natural capital was about 331. 7 billion Yuan RMB in 1990 and dropped to 155. 6 billion Yuan RMB in 2010. According to the simulation model, the natural capital components such as biomass and soil stocks, the ecosystem services and the replacement value declined due to intensive herding and disturbance from human activities. Such trend is not sustainable because it exceeds the renewable carrying capacity of the area, but it is likely to continue until fundamental changes in human behavior and management of the <b>grassland</b> and animal <b>husbandry</b> occur or until the whole area is fully degraded. Social reasons prevent from simply decreasing the intensity of the livestock activities that provide living means to a large number of local farmers. As a consequence, the traditional low-productivity and environmental unfriendly grazing farming system should gradually be converted into a human-managed pasture based on farming higher productivity pasture crops in {{a small part of the}} local land, in order to decrease the grazing pressure on natural grassland of North Xinjiang. 2011...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} of conventional agriculture are characterised by commercial concentration, {{the production of}} market surpluses (in the industrialised countries), environmental pollution and subsidies. These problems all prompt {{the question of whether}} there are alternatives in the method of production. Based upon the aspect of sustainability, we would like to discuss to what extent ecological agriculture could be this alternative and if it could be implemented on a wide scale. At the present, ecological agriculture still plays a subordinate role in Germany. However, the changeover to ecological farming has been supported in the framework of the extensivation programmes of the European Community or the European Union {{since the end of the}} 1980 's. Unfortunately, the methods of marketing were not built up at the same time. The consequence of this is that there is sinking incentive for other enterprises to change their production over to the ecological production. As a result, it will hardly be possible to achieve the agricultural objective of reducing the agricultural surpluses by having the ecological enterprises produce lower production quantities (20 % to 30 % lower yields than in conventional farming). We can see that this difficulty arises out of the unit area development since the beginning of the 90 's: While the ecologically farmed area increased nine times from 44 000 hectares to more than 400 000 hectares from 1989 to 1998 (2, 2 % of the entire areas utilised for agriculture farmed by approximately 10 000 enterprises or 1, 9 % of all enterp rises), hardly any new sales pa ths have been opened up on the market. As a unit area comparison: nature reserves also occupy only approximately 2 % of the overall area throughout the nation (KÖPKE 1999) If modern technologies are applied, sales paths opened up and if the current demographic development continues, we can see that the potential for yield is definitely capable of feeding the population (Bechmann 1994). Of course, this is only true if the full genetic potential for performance of the cropping products is exhausted. However, this is where Kahnt (1996, page 209 f) sees here the limits to ecological agriculture both with commercial crops as well as with farm animals since neither the quantity nor the quality of required nutritive needs is available. Consequently, lower yield quantities on the economic side will be compensated by higher consumer prices (up to 40 % in comparison to products from conventional cropping). There are also limits resulting from the food requirements of a country under the conditions of the existing population growth, political objectives (autarchy), the potential that natural site condition have for performance and the technical potential for development. We may see one of the main reasons why ecological farming does not increase to the desired extent in the economic decisions made by the ente rprises. The features of an enterprise functioning ideally as an ecological enterprise is that one meaningfully rotates fruit and field between arable land, arable land not in use with legume farming and/ or a high proportion of <b>grasslands</b> with animal <b>husbandry.</b> The fact that it has a higher susceptibility towards being attacked by pests and diseases can also have the effect of lowering yield (Kahnt 1996, page 211). As a consequence, the question of whether ecological agriculture can be financed has great deal of significance. We cannot just make an undifferentiated and sweeping statement that ecological agriculture is the cure-all for conventional farming with its impact on the environment. There is no doubt that it is a promising alternative to conventional farming in certain limited areas. Rather, the question is how conventional agriculture can utilise the knowledge brought about by ecological agriculture to come closer to the overall objectives of utilising and forming a cultural landscape that is characterised by sustainability...|$|R
