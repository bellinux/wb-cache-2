40|$|Along {{with total}} {{radiation}} received, {{the proportion of}} <b>diffuse</b> to direct solar radiation can influence forest photosynthesis and carbon cycling. However, tropical <b>diffuse</b> radiation regimes are poorly described, and to date there are few or no site-based or regional <b>diffuse</b> radiation datasets. The relationship between cloud fraction and <b>diffuse</b> solar radiation was investigated using data from two sites in western and eastern Amazonia. Radiation regimes for <b>diffuse</b> and total radiation were characterised for each site, and the variation in clear sky <b>diffuse</b> radiation fraction between wet and dry season demonstrated and quantified, {{as well as the}} dependence of <b>diffuse</b> radiation on cloud amount. Using high frequency measurements of <b>diffuse</b> and total solar radiation data from the two sites, and estimated top of the canopy clear-sky radiation, a number of alternative models to predict <b>diffuse</b> radiation fraction from cloud fraction were formulated and tested. Results showed that cloud fraction can be approximated using the relationship between observed and calculated top of canopy radiation, after which <b>diffuse</b> radiation can then be predicted from cloud fraction. We also demonstrate that satellite cloud data (from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) can be used as inputs to the <b>diffuse</b> radiation model to provide estimates of annual and monthly <b>diffuse</b> radiation proportion.

5|$|Tunneling {{diffusion}} is {{a physical}} manifestation of the quantum tunneling effect involving particles tunneling across diffusion barriers. It can occur {{in the case of}} low <b>diffusing</b> particle mass and low Ediff, and has been observed in the case of hydrogen diffusion on tungsten and copper surfaces. The phenomenon is unique in that in the regime where the tunneling mechanism dominates, the diffusion rate is nearly temperature-independent.|$|E
5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in the early universe, making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, <b>diffusing</b> photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Like other crustaceans, malacostracans {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it {{supplies}} the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before <b>diffusing</b> back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus. Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli facing in different directions and able to distinguish between light and darkness.|$|E

5|$|The nuclear envelope, {{otherwise}} known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from <b>diffusing</b> freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E
5|$|Though general {{diffusion}} damping can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to photon dispersion, the term Silk damping {{applies only to}} damping of adiabatic models of baryonic matter, which is coupled to the <b>diffusing</b> photons, not dark matter, and diffuses with them. Silk damping is not as significant in models of cosmological development which posit early isocurvature fluctuations (i.e. fluctuations which do not require a constant ratio of baryons and photons). In this case, increases in baryon density do not require a corresponding increases in photon density, and the lower the photon density, the less diffusion there would be: the less diffusion, the less damping. Photon diffusion is not dependent on {{the causes of the}} initial fluctuations in the density of the universe.|$|E
5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from <b>diffusing.</b> The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E
40|$|The Rappaport {{classification}} of the non-Hodgkin's lymphomata {{was applied to}} 460 cases at the Princess Margaret Hospital. Statistically {{significant differences in the}} numerical incidence between the nodular and <b>diffuse</b> patterns was found for the entire series and for the lymphocytic, "histiocytic" and mixed cell types individually. All of the undifferentiated types were <b>diffuse.</b> These differences were sustained for the degrees of differentiation within the lymphocytic group. The "histiocytic" group was not subclassified by differentiation. The cell types differed in the numerical distribution of the patterns. The lymphocytics were predominantly <b>diffuse</b> but their nodular forms constituted a higher proportion of the nodular pattern than did their <b>diffuse</b> types of the <b>diffuse</b> group. More of the well differentiated lymphocytics were nodular than were <b>diffuse</b> and they formed a higher proportion of the nodular group than they did of the <b>diffuse.</b> On the other hand, the poorly differentiated lymphocytics were predominantly <b>diffuse</b> and these were less well represented in the nodular group than in the <b>diffuse</b> tumours. The intermediate differentiated types were usually <b>diffuse</b> but slightly better represented in the nodular group. Most tumours of the "histiocytic" type were <b>diffuse</b> and these constituted a higher proportion of <b>diffuse</b> than the nodular tumours. The mixed cell lesions were predominantly nodular and comprised a much higher proportion of nodular lesions than <b>diffuse.</b> No real differences were identified amongst the histological types according to age or sex distributions. The crude survival to 4 years differed significantly for the histological types. For the entire series and for each cellular type, the nodular patterns were superior to the <b>diffuse,</b> although, in the lymphocytic well differentiated types, pattern made no real difference to survival...|$|R

5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by <b>diffusing</b> from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have a very}} {{efficient}} system for <b>diffusing</b> oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand {{the pressure of the}} ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, due {{to further}} cuts in defence {{spending}} and an eagerness {{of the government}} to implement those recommendations that could assist in achieving this goal, units that were unable to meet attendance requirements were disbanded or amalgamated with others, thus further <b>diffusing</b> the community links units had established in their local areas and thus further impacting upon recruitment and retention. Further, {{the decision was made to}} abolish the old CMF divisions, as the role of the Army Reserve would no longer be to act as a skeleton force that would be filled out upon mobilisation, but rather a force that could provide individual sub-units of capability should the need arise to augment the Regular Army. Centralisation of training was also a result of the Millar Report; beforehand, recruit training had been an ad hoc process managed mainly by the units themselves. Other issues such as pay and conditions of service, protection of civilian employment and recruitment and retention were touched upon but remained largely unaddressed until more recently.|$|E

5|$|Spirometry {{measures}} {{the amount of}} airflow obstruction present and is generally carried out after {{the use of a}} bronchodilator, a medication to open up the airways. Two main components are measured to make the diagnosis: the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of a breath, and the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a single large breath. Normally, 75–80% of the FVC comes out in the first second and a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% in someone with symptoms of COPD defines a person as having the disease. Based on these measurements, spirometry would lead to over-diagnosis of COPD in the elderly. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria additionally require a FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted. People with COPD also exhibit a decrease in <b>diffusing</b> capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) due to decreased surface area in the alveoli, as well as damage to the capillary bed.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from <b>diffusing</b> into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E
5|$|The renewed {{blockade}} of Île de France was lifted in December 1795, and Elphinstone deployed {{most of his}} forces in the continued {{blockade of}} Colombo. In February a small squadron under Captain Alan Gardner attacked city and secured the total surrender of the remaining Batavian garrison on the island. In March word arrived at Madras of the Batavian attempt to recapture the Cape Colony and Elphinstone returned westwards with Monarch, followed by Stately, Echo and Rattlesnake. In the east, Rainier's force had some success, seizing the considerable clove stores at Amboyna on 16 February 1796 and the nutmeg and mace supplies of Banda Neira on 8 March. The value of these captures was significant: the captains involved each received £15,000. However, these successes were offset by the complicated political position Rainier discovered in the Dutch East Indies; he spent {{the entirety of the}} remainder of the year <b>diffusing</b> or defeating a series of uprisings by local rajahs and did not return to India until February 1797.|$|E
40|$|State space {{models with}} nonstationary {{processes}} and fixed regression effects require a state vector with <b>diffuse</b> initial conditions. Different likelihood functions can be adopted for {{the estimation of}} parameters in time series models with <b>diffuse</b> initial conditions. In this paper we consider profile, <b>diffuse</b> and marginal likelihood functions. The marginal likelihood {{is defined as the}} likelihood function of a transformation of the data vector. The transformation is not unique. The <b>diffuse</b> likelihood is a marginal likelihood for a specific data transformation that may depend on parameters. Therefore, the <b>diffuse</b> likelihood can not be used generally for parameter estimation. Our newly proposed marginal likelihood function is based on an orthonormal transformation that does not depend on parameters. Likelihood functions for state space models are evaluated using the Kalman filter. The <b>diffuse</b> Kalman filter is specifically designed for computing the <b>diffuse</b> likelihood function. We show that a modification of the <b>diffuse</b> Kalman filter is needed for the evaluation of our proposed marginal likelihood function. <b>Diffuse</b> and marginal likelihood functions have better small sample properties compared to the profile likelihood function for the estimation of parameters in linear time series models.
