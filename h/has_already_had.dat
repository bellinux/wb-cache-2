25|$|Anaerobic digesters were {{originally}} designed for operation using sewage sludge and manures. Sewage and manure are not, however, the material {{with the most}} potential for anaerobic digestion, as the biodegradable material <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> much of the energy content taken out by the animals that produced it. Therefore, many digesters operate with codigestion {{of two or more}} types of feedstock. For example, in a farm-based digester that uses dairy manure as the primary feedstock, the gas production may be significantly increased by adding a second feedstock, e.g., grass and corn (typical on-farm feedstock), or various organic byproducts, such as slaughterhouse waste, fats, oils and grease from restaurants, organic household waste, etc. (typical off-site feedstock).|$|E

Her best friend, Peris, <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> the operation and, motivated by {{her desire to}} see him, Tally sneaks across the river to New Pretty Town. There she meets Shay, another Ugly. They become friends and Shay teaches Tally how to ride a hoverboard. Shay also mentions rebelling against the operation. At first, Tally ignores the idea, but is forced {{to deal with it}} when Shay runs away a few days before their shared sixteenth birthday, leaving behind cryptic directions to her destination, a “renegade settlement” called the Smoke, where city runaways go to escape the operation.|$|E
25|$|Nikolai, {{initially}} {{delighted to}} have his son return home, slowly begins to feel uneasy, and a certain awkwardness in his regard, as it emerges that Arkady's views, much influenced by Bazarov, are radical and make his own beliefs feel dated. Nikolai has always tried to stay as current as possible, by doing things such as visiting his son at school so the two can stay as close as they are, but this in Nikolai's eyes has failed. To complicate this, the father has taken a servant, Fenechka, into his house {{to live with him}} and <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> a son by her. Arkady however is not troubled by the relationship: to the contrary, he openly celebrates the addition of a younger brother.|$|E
25|$|Evil businesswoman Angelica Nero {{intends to}} kill J.R. {{and his cousin}} Jack for double {{crossing}} her, but J.R. has her apprehended by the police. Unfortunately, Angelica <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> a bomb attached to Jack's car, which explodes with Jamie inside. After hearing this on the phone, J.R. runs {{out of his office}} to go to Jack's apartment. As he leaves the office, Sue Ellen arrives in the other elevator looking for him. As soon as she enters J.R.'s office, another bomb left by Angelica goes off, and the entire floor that houses Ewing Oil explodes, showering debris onto the street below. The scene then shifts to Pam in bed, the day after her marriage to Mark Graison. Pam wakes up to hear the shower running. Assuming it's Mark, she opens the shower door, only to find Bobby Ewing, alive and well. (In the Season Ten premiere, Bobby's death and all of Season Nine would be revealed as a dream that Pam was having).|$|E

The NREPP evaluation, which assigns quality ratings from 0 to 4 to certain criteria, examines reliability and validity of outcome measures used in the research, evidence for intervention fidelity (predictable use of the treatment in the same way every time), levels of missing data and attrition, potential confounding variables, and the appropriateness of statistical handling, including sample size.|$|E

2500|$|For decades β-blockers {{have been}} used in {{cardiovascular}} medicine. They have proved to reduce morbidity and mortality. In acute coronary syndrome, β-blockers have been recommended as a class I-A indication in clinical practice guidelines, because the treatment decreases the mortality rate. β-blockers, along with calcium channel blockers, reduce the workload of the heart and its oxygen requirement. β-blockers are sometimes used in a combination therapy to treat angina, if a β-blocker doesn't work well enough on its own. They are used as anti-arrhythmic drugs in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiac dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia. The treatment with β-blockers reduces the incidence of sudden heart failure when the patient <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> a myocardial infarction. The reason is probably because of their anti-arrhythmic effects and also anti-ischemic effects. [...] A β-blocker therapy is also useful in myocardial infarction, independent to heart failure. The therapy has been very helpful for high-risk patients. [...] All β-blockers are able to lower blood pressure and therefore are they the first choice of drugs for hypertension. But if they are used along with calcium channel blockers, β-blockers have more functionality. They also have an effect on cardiomyopathy, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and portal hypertension, to name a few.|$|E
