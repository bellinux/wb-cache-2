5|$|In {{spite of}} the earlier rupture in their relations, Maxentius was eager to present himself as his father's devoted son after his death. He began minting coins with his father's deified image, proclaiming his desire to avenge Maximian's death. Constantine {{initially}} presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311AD, however, he was spreading another version. According to this, after Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a eunuch in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>place</b> in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted. Along with using propaganda, Constantine instituted a damnatio memoriae on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image.|$|E

Ugolin stays only briefly to talk, as he is eager to get to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>place</b> farther up in the mountains. Here he throws himself into a project that—at first—he keeps secret from Papet. He eventually reveals that the project consists of growing carnations. Papet is at first skeptical, but he is convinced when the flowers get a good price at the local market. They decide the project is worthy of expansion, and together they go to see the neighboring farmer known as Pique-Bouffigue, to buy his land.|$|E
500|$|Following the disbandment of the AFC, McNamara {{transferred}} to the Australian Air Corps (AAC) in April 1920. He was not offered an appointment in the AAC initially, however, and secured one only after Captain Roy King protested the situation by giving up <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>place</b> in the new service in favour of McNamara, whom he described as [...] "this very good and gallant officer". McNamara was invested with his Victoria Cross by the Prince of Wales at Government House, Melbourne, on 26 May. He enlisted in the newly established Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1921. Ranked flying officer (honorary flight lieutenant), {{he was one of}} the original twenty-one officers on the Air Force's strength at its formation that March. Posted to RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne as Staff Officer Operations and Intelligence, McNamara was given command of No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS) at Point Cook in July 1922. He was promoted squadron leader in March 1924 and the following month married Hélène Bluntschli, a Belgian national he had met in Cairo during the war, at St Patrick's Cathedral; his best man was fellow officer Frank Lukis.|$|E
500|$|For the 1909 Varsity Match, Cunningham {{announced}} {{his choice of}} Poulton at a meeting on 2 December which Vassall was unable to attend. Cunningham sent him a letter by hand informing him of the decision. When the note returned undelivered, Cunningham hesitated, at which point Tarr offered to give up <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>place</b> for Poulton but Cunningham stuck to his initial selection. The game was played on 11 December, with Oxford at the start having the worse of it until one moment turned the game around: after the Oxford forwards got the ball back, Gotley, at scrum-half, sent the ball to Cunningham, who passed on to Tarr and he to his fellow centre Colin Gilray. He fed the ball to Poulton on the left wing still inside the Oxford half. Poulton then broke through the defence to score under the posts. With Oxford eight points ahead {{at the end of}} the first quarter, Tarr was forced off the field after breaking his collarbone making a tackle, and missed much of what was described by referee F.C. Potter-Irwin as [...] "the fastest and most spectacular Varsity Match he had ever witnessed". Oxford beat Cambridge 23–3, Poulton scoring five tries.|$|E

500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Pitchforks Ryan Dombal, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was [...] "a hedonistic {{exploration}} into a rich and famous American id", while Chris Martins from Spin {{said it was an}} alternately grandiose and eloquent production that [...] "owed as much to the artist's self-aggrandizing ego as to the voracious id that would destroy it publicly". Music writer Ann Powers interprets West's predominant theme on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy to be [...] "the crisis of the jet-lagged cosmopolitan ... the exhausted cry of one who's always new in town, chasing whatever goal or girl is in the room, fueled by consumer culture's relentless buzz, but finally left unsatisfied". Powers views the songs to work [...] "as pornographic boasts, romantic disaster stories, devil-haunted dark nights of the soul" [...] and perceives West's [...] "uncertainty about <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>place</b> in the world" [...] to be connected to the subject of race, stating [...] "The rootlessness West celebrates and despairs of on Fantasy belongs to someone who feels unwelcome everywhere. This isn't just a personal problem. It's the curse of what the author Michael Eric Dyson has called 'the exceptional black man', embraced for his talents but singled out for the color of his skin".|$|E
500|$|As A Game of Thrones begins, Tyrion is a witty, hedonistic curiosity, {{protected}} {{by his family}} status but still the object of subtle derision. He {{is perhaps the most}} intelligent member of his family but is consistently underestimated and marginalized. Tyrion embraces the advantages of being a Lannister {{but at the same time}} is all too aware of its negative aspects and <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>place</b> as the embarrassment of the family. Initially he is the one Lannister remotely sympathetic to the Starks but he is soon caught in the middle of the conflict between the two Houses. Taken prisoner and put on trial for his life, [...] "all of his skills at conniving must be brought to bear simply to stay alive". With the Starks and Lannisters fully at war, Tywin tasks Tyrion to manage affairs at King's Landing, recognizing that his son is intelligent and has inherited his skills with statecraft. In A Clash of Kings, Tyrion relishes his new power but finds that his sincere efforts to stabilize his nephew Joffrey's rule are being undermined and thwarted by the misguided and self-serving machinations of everyone around him. He plots to nullify the counterproductive whims of Joffrey and Cersei but the [...] "much-maligned dwarf" [...] finds himself [...] "teetering between order and disaster as he tries to keep the Lannisters from losing absolutely everything". Thomas M. Wagner calls it a [...] "defining moment" [...] when Tyrion comments that he is all that keeps chaos from overwhelming the family and population who both despise him. Roberta Johnson of Booklist likens Tyrion to the calculating title character of Robert Graves' I, Claudius.|$|E
