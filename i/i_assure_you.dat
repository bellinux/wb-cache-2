I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.|$|E

500|$|In 1949, Campbell {{also became}} {{interested}} in Dianetics. He wrote of L.

500|$|Some French {{officers}} {{felt the}} Montmorency defeat {{would be the}} last British attack; Vaudreuil wrote afterwards that [...] "I have no more anxiety about Quebec.

[...] He [...] predicted another attack would come within days. Others in the French camp felt the campaign was over.|$|E
500|$|As [...] "a male {{favourite}} to {{a virgin}} queen", Robert Dudley {{found himself in}} an unprecedented situation. His apartments at court were next to hers, and—perceived as knowing [...] "the Queen and her nature best of any man"—his influence was matched by few. Another side of such privileges was Elizabeth's possessiveness and jealousy. His company was essential for her well-being and for many years he was hardly allowed to leave. Sir Christopher Hatton reported a growing emergency when the Earl was away {{for a few weeks}} in 1578: [...] "This court wanteth your presence. Her majesty is unaccompanied and, <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you,</b> the chambers are almost empty." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive reviews, with Rodolfo Alchourrón's orchestral {{arrangement of}} [...] "Laura va" [...] universally acclaimed. According {{to the rock}} magazine Pelo, [...] "This album may be the synthesis of a new music emerging. A La Prensa review described it as [...] "a thin melancholy," [...] and it [...] " [...] its manifestation with the seriousness and depth of who wants to give a testimony of their world, a concern usually oblivious to young authors and performers."

500|$|Despite Joyce's revolutionary techniques, {{the author}} {{repeatedly}} {{emphasized that the}} book was neither random nor meaningless; with Ellmann quoting the author as having stated: [...] "I can justify every line of my book." [...] To Sisley Huddleston he stated [...] "critics who were most appreciative of Ulysses are complaining about my new work. They cannot understand it. Therefore {{they say it is}} meaningless. Now if it were meaningless it could be written quickly without thought, without pains, without erudition; but <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> that these 20 pages now before us [...] cost me twelve hundred hours and an enormous expense of spirit." [...] When the editor of Vanity Fair asked Joyce if the sketches in Work in Progress were consecutive and interrelated, Joyce replied [...] "It is all consecutive and interrelated." ...|$|E
500|$|Leicester's forces, {{small and}} seriously underfinanced from the outset, faced the most {{formidable}} army in Europe. Unity among their ranks was at risk by Leicester's and the other officers' quarrels with Sir John Norris, who had commanded previous English contingents in the Netherlands and was now the Earl's deputy. Elizabeth was angry that the war cost more than anticipated and for many months delayed sending money and troops. This not only forced Dudley to raise further funds on his own account, but much aggravated the soldiers' lot. [...] "They cannot get a penny; their credit is spent; they perish for want of victuals and clothing in great numbers ... <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> it will fret me to death ere long to see my soldiers {{in this case and}} cannot help them", Leicester wrote home.|$|E

500|$|... {{with the}} present frightfully low prices of iron and steel rails it is utterly {{impossible}} for us to advance wages at all... Our steel works, as everybody knows, are now idle because we have no work to do there. Until the reduction of ten per cent on the 10th of this month {{there has been no}} reduction in your wages for nearly a year, while during that time there has been a falling off in the prices we get for iron and steel of over twenty-five per cent. I think you ought to consider these things fully and reflect whether the little work we can give you is not better than no work at all. <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> when prices will warrant it we shall be very glad to pay wages in proportion.|$|E
500|$|On December 27, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt, a {{personal}} friend of Saint-Gaudens, wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie Mortier Shaw: [...] "I think {{the state of our}} coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness. [...] Would it be possible, without asking permission of Congress, to employ a man like Saint-Gaudens to give us a coinage which would have some beauty?" [...] Roosevelt had Mint Director George E. Roberts write to Saint-Gaudens, who replied, [...] "I am extremely interested in the matter of the new designs of the coinage... it will <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> give me great pleasure to assist in the procuring of good work." [...] Roosevelt caused the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign some of the coins which could be changed without the need for Congressional approval—the cent and the four gold coins. [...] No U.S. coin had ever been designed by anyone other than a Mint employee.|$|E

[...] Orbit joked about the matter, saying that the true cause of the glitch is that they [...] "were kidnapped by Aliens and actually spent a year on their ship making friends, doing shows, creating Alien music [...] Then we travelled back to 2:14 in the track, with just that glitch to show for it." [...] On January 25, 2014, Orbit hinted on Twitter that the glitch might be a fail of production held by the album's executive producer, will.i.am: [...] "Remember 'Glitchgate'? <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> all that there will.be.no more glitches".|$|E

500|$|Ernest's {{support of}} the Prussians in the Austro-Prussian War and later Franco Prussian War meant {{he was no longer}} the {{potential}} leader of a political movement; although it was true that {{he had been able to}} retain his duchies, it had come at a price. According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat, Ernest [...] "was increasingly lost in a whirl of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside". Ernest funneled his political thoughts into the private sphere, preferring to write covertly sponsored articles in the Coburg press that became increasingly embittered against England. In 1886, Ernest published Co-Regents and Foreign Influence in Germany, a pamphlet that greatly angered his family; though produced anonymously, no one doubted that it was written by Ernest. It attacked Vicky as a disloyal German that was too dependent on her mother, and declared that she had been too indiscreet in passing along confidential information during both war and peacetime. Queen Victoria was furious, writing to Vicky, [...] "What you told me of Uncle E and that pamphlet is simply monstrous. <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> that I felt great difficulty in writing to him for his birthday, but I wrote it as short and cool as I could consistently with civility". [...] "Dear Uncle Ernest does us all a great deal of harm by his odd ways and uncontrollable tongue with his very lively imagination".|$|E
