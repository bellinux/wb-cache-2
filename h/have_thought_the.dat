5|$|Maibaum may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it {{was originally}} intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{publicly}} disassociated {{himself from}} the Struggle Movement. However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he may <b>have</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>the</b> discontent against Kỳ was by then {{too much for him}} to control even if he had wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E

Pierre Macquer reworded his theory many times, and even though he is said to <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> theory of phlogiston was doomed, he stood by phlogiston and tried to make the theory work.|$|E

25|$|The text {{gives no}} {{apparent}} reason for the name in its literal meaning. Adam and his colleagues themselves seem to <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> name to derive from the legendary Amazons taken from classical Greek mythology. This is clearly said in the text itself to be their own thinking, even though Adam later in his publication seems to forget that and presents it as a common rumor originating from bishop Adalvard.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the radical}} anion is {{initially}} protonated determines {{the structure of}} the product. With an electron donor such as methoxy (MeO) or with an alkyl group, protonation has been thought by some investigators as being ortho (i.e. adjacent or 1,2) to the substituent. Other investigators <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> protonation is meta (1,3) to the substituent. Arthur Birch favored meta protonation. With electron withdrawing substituents, protonation has been thought to occur {{at the site of the}} substituent (ipso), or para (1,4). Again, there has been varied opinion. A. J. Birch's empirical rules say that for the donor substituents the final product has the maximum number of substituents on the final double bonds. For electron withdrawing groups the double bonds of the product avoid the substituents. The placement preference of groups in the mechanism and in the final product is termed regioselectivity.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculation}} of $24 also fails {{to recognize that}} the concepts of property trading and ownership held by the 17th-century Dutch and East Coast natives were both different from modern conceptions. Comparisons to modern land dealing distort the reality of what Minuit was trying to do. Both the Dutch and the Indians undoubtedly included intangibles along with any hard goods in their concept of the total transactional value. For Indians and Minuit alike, both sides felt they were getting far more than a mere 60 guilders. For instance, the natives most certainly would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> trade included the value of the Dutch as potential military allies against rival Indian nations—a 'good' that could not be valued in currency alone. In addition, the value of the sale to Dutch and Indians alike would have included the prospect of future trade.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} on the ring where the radical anion is initially protonated determines {{the structure of the}} product.

500|$|Other {{examples}} of [...] "Dad's Renaissance" [...] included a 1968 Off-Broadway production of Private Lives at the Theatre de Lys starring Elaine Stritch, Lee Bowman and Betsy von Furstenberg, {{and directed by}} Charles Nelson Reilly. Despite this impressive cast, Coward's popularity had risen so high that the theatre poster for the production used an Al Hirschfeld caricature of Coward (pictured) [...] instead of {{an image of the}} production or its stars. The illustration captures how Coward's image had changed by the 1960s: he was no longer seen as the smooth 1930s sophisticate, but as the doyen of the theatre. As The New Statesman wrote in 1964, [...] "Who would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> landmarks of the Sixties would include the emergence of Noël Coward as the grand old man of British drama? There he was one morning, flipping verbal tiddlywinks with reporters about [...] "Dad's Renaissance"; the next he was... beside Forster, T. S. Eliot and the OMs, demonstrably the greatest living English playwright." [...] Time wrote that [...] "in the 60s... his best work, with its inspired inconsequentiality, seemed to exert not only a period charm but charm, period." ...|$|E
500|$|After Aden's {{breakdown}} and {{admission to}} psychiatric care, Belle grows close to Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz). Tovey said Aden {{will always be}} [...] "the love of Belle's life", but she is traumatised by the previous events. Aden witnesses Belle kissing Angelo, which destroys their relationship. Belle is left unsure what to do because she sees Angelo has her [...] "safety net" [...] and Aden [...] "brings out the passion in her". She added that Angelo doesn't compare with her love for Aden, that her relationship with Aden was the [...] "most beautiful" [...] on the programme {{and that she would}} never escape her feelings for Aden. Aden later [...] "jumps on Belle" [...] and tells her they are in love and should be together. Tovey said Belle gets [...] "caught in the moment" [...] and they make love. Tovey was unhappy with the fact that Belle cheated, as she thought it was out of character. When Angelo finds out the truth, he publicly humiliates Belle. He later goes around to her home and becomes violent. Belle is later found badly beaten and although Angelo is not responsible, he gets the blame. Jacobz said the under the circumstances he would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> same. He added that Aden [...] "hates" [...] Angelo. After Angelo verbally abused Belle, Aden does not [...] "see eye to eye with Angelo" [...] and decides to testify as a witness against Angelo.|$|E

2500|$|The {{poems are}} {{generally}} considered to be incomplete fragments - although the reason for their incompleteness is disputed. As Hubbard explains, [...] "some have explained it as a result of mechanical accident in the transmission, while others <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> poems abbreviated by the poet himself [...] to avoid giving offense to an ever more suspicious Nero".|$|E
2500|$|Some critics <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> {{essays in}} The Spirit of the Age highly uneven in quality and {{somewhat}} hastily thrown together, at best [...] "a series of perceptive but disparate and impressionistic sketches of famous contemporaries".

No thesis is overtly stated, but some thoughts are developed consistently throughout.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{commentators}} <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> United States became arrogant, {{particularly after}} its victory in World War II. Critics such as Andrew Bacevich call on America {{to have a}} foreign policy [...] "rooted in humility and realism." [...] Foreign policy experts such as Zbigniew Brzezinski counsel a policy of self-restraint and not pressing every advantage, and listening to other nations. A government official called the U.S. policy in Iraq [...] "arrogant and stupid," [...] according to one report.|$|E
2500|$|Noted {{historian}} [...] Gordon Johnson {{commented that}} [...] "...Dyer's actions ran counter to Army regulations. These required that force should be constrained {{by what was}} reasonable to achieve an immediate objective; minimum, not maximum, force should be deployed. Moreover, proper warning had to be given. On April 13, 1919, as demonstrated by Collett, Dyer ignored this. While he may have believed the Raj was threatened, and may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> mob was out to attack him and his soldiers, this does not justify his cavalier abuse of procedure and his indifference to Indian suffering. In so behaving, he brought not only death to the innocent but also destroyed himself and undermined the empire in which he took so much pride.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first record}} {{to contain the}} word [...] "rockabilly" [...] in a song title was issued in November 1956 [...] "Rock a Billy Gal", {{although}} Johnny and Dorsey Burnette recorded [...] "Rock Billy Boogie" [...] for the Coral label on July 4, 1956. The song had been written and performed much earlier, and refer {{to the birth of}} Johnny's son Rocky and Dorsey's son Billy, who were born around the same time in 1953, and were firstborns for each of the brothers. The song was part of their repertoire in 1956 when they were living in New York City and performing with Gene Vincent. It's easy to understand how the New York audience might <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Burnettes were singing [...] "Rockabilly Boogie," [...] but they never would, because the term hillbilly was derogatory and would never have been used by the artists themselves. Rocky Burnette, who later would become a rockabilly artist himself, has stated on his website that the term rockabilly derives from that song. It's also interesting, that this song has been covered by hundreds of artists in the years since, and is always called [...] "Rockabilly Boogie".|$|E

2500|$|Todd Martens of Los Angeles Times {{stated that}} Odd Blood [...] "ultimately reveals that beneath all the weird sounds, tribal harmonies and otherworldly textures, Yeasayer {{are still a}} bunch of indie-rock sentimentalists", while Tim Chester of NME wrote that the album is [...] "a musical package holiday you can take vicariously". Although conceding that it [...] "should appeal {{to a lot of}} people", Pitchfork Media's Scott Plagenhoef was less {{receptive}} and suggested that the [...] "overfed production and search for direction" [...] often lead to [...] "a bit too much of not enough". Amanda Farah of Clash explained that Odd Blood is [...] "an unabashed pop record that anyone should be proud to play at full volume", while Paul Terefenko of NOW concluded, [...] "Who'd <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> psych-folk pile, already teetering on the brink of over-saturation, would peak with Yeasayer's second album?" [...] Odd Blood figured highly in several end-of-year best album lists for 2010, notably, at number five by American Songwriter, at number eight by Time and by Drowned in Sound, at number nine by One Thirty BPM, at number 11 by Under the Radar, at number 12 by Spin, at number 14 by The Guardian, and at number 15 by NME and Q.
