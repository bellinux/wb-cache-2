The approach uses a discrete probability function (DPF) method to infer the PDF of the local extinction coefficient from measurements of the PDFs of the path <b>integrated</b> <b>transmittance.</b> The local PDFs obtained using the method are compared with those obtained from direct intrusive measurements in propylene/air and ethylene/air diffusion flames. The results of this comparison are good...|$|E

For both the as-deposited and annealed films, (i) the electrical conductivity increased with increasing temperature and (ii) the variation of activation energy follows the island structure theory. The temperature co-efficient of resistance (T. C. R.) and Hall-effect measurements indicate that the sample is a n-type carrier. The optical spectra for both types of films were obtained in the wavelength range 0. 3 Indium selenide Electrical conductivity As-deposited Annealed Temperature <b>Integrated</b> <b>transmittance</b> Selective surface...|$|E
40|$|Total {{upwelling}} radiance {{at the top}} of {{the atmosphere}} is evaluated theoretically in the presence of clouds. The influence of cloud heights, thicknesses and different cloud covers on the upwelling radiance is also investigated. The characteristics of the two cloud types considered in this study closely correspond to altocumulus and cirrus with the cloud emissivity as a function of its liquid water (or ice) content. For calculation of the <b>integrated</b> <b>transmittance</b> of atmospheric gases such as, H 2 O, CO 2, O 3, and N 2 O, the Quasi Random Band (QRB) model approach is adopted. Results are obtained in three different spectral ranges and are compared with the clearsky radiance results. It is found that the difference between the clearsky and cloudy radiance increases with increasing cloud height and liquid water content. This difference also decreases as the surface temperature approaches the value of the cloud top temperature...|$|E

It predicts anisotropic diffusion, and a deflection of the diffuse energy flow in anisotropic slabs in the direction parallel to the slab. The <b>transmittance</b> <b>integrated</b> over all incoming and outgoing directions scales with the transport mean free path along the surface normal. The escape function in anisotropic dielectrics is no longer bell shaped. In this model anisotropy facilitates Anderson localization...|$|R
40|$|TixV 1 -xO 2 (0 <= x <= 1) {{thin films}} with {{different}} molar ratios of V/Ti were prepared on c-plane sapphire (0001) substrates by radio frequency magnetron sputtering. The microstructure and optical {{properties of the}} thin films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and UV-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectroscopy. The width of the optical band gap was calculated and the <b>integrated</b> solar <b>transmittance</b> of the films was characterized. As the content of titanium was increased, infrared regulation and thermal hysteresis were gradually reduced until they disappeared. The {{results show that the}} band gap of the thin films broadens as the content of titanium increases, causing the optical absorption edge to exhibit a blue shift. Conversely, the band gap narrows as the proportion of vanadium is increased, which causes a red shift of the optical absorption edge...|$|R
40|$|The {{simplified}} {{expression of}} the radiative transfer equation in the thermal IR spectrum are made for the fundamental formulation of the ε-T separation through the multispectral thermal IR sensor such as ASTER onboard EOS-aml will be launched at 1998. In the simplification, there are there approximations are made for {{the reduction of the}} unknown variables. The first approximation is the use of the spectrally <b>integrated</b> Planck function, <b>transmittance</b> and surface emissivity instead of the line-by-line radiative transfer process calculation. The second approximation is the reduction of the atmospheric radiation term into the product of total transmittance and the newly defined value named representative atmospheric radiation. And the third is the simplification of the total transmittance calculation {{on the basis of the}} assumption which water vapor is the only one absorber. From the numerical simulation based on the 4050 kinds of surface/atmosphere/observation conditions, the proposed simplified radiative transfer equation is sufficient for the ε-T separation...|$|R
40|$|The extinction-to-backscatter ratio (S(sub a)) is an {{important}} parameter used in {{the determination of the}} aerosol extinction and subsequently the optical depth from lidar backscatter measurements. We outline the algorithm used to determine Sa for the Cloud and Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Spaceborne Observations (CALIPSO) lidar. S(sub a) for the CALIPSO lidar will either be selected from a look-up table or calculated using the lidar measurements depending on the characteristics of aerosol layer. Whenever suitable lofted layers are encountered, S(sub a) is computed directly from the <b>integrated</b> backscatter and <b>transmittance.</b> In all other cases, the CALIPSO observables: the depolarization ratio, delta, the layer integrated attenuated backscatter, beta, and the mean layer total attenuated color ratio, gamma, together with the surface type, are used to aid in aerosol typing. Once the type is identified, a look-up-table developed primarily from worldwide observations, is used to determine the S(sub a) value. The CALIPSO aerosol models include desert dust, biomass burning, background, polluted continental, polluted dust, and marine aerosols...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric <b>transmittances</b> <b>integrated</b> over {{wavelength}} intervals corresponding approximately to the (15 - 0) through (4 - 0) Schumann-Runge {{bands of}} O 2 have been determined from EUV solar spectra (wavelengths between 1768 and 1948 A) photographed at seven altitudes between 102 and 76 km with a rocket-borne spectrograph having {{a resolution of}} 0. 07 A. The observed transmittances are compared with atmospheric transmittances predicted from three models of the O 2 absorption cross section. The predicted transmittances have also been used to derive column densities of atmospheric O 2 from the observations. The results are compared with values calculated from the U. S. Standard Atmosphere (1976) and with oxygen column densities determined by Prinz and Brueckner (1977) from EUV solar spectra of the Schumann-Runge continuum (wavelength below 1750 A) and of the H-Lyman alpha line (1216 A) recorded on the same films {{used in the present}} research. The comparisons test the utility of the models for studies of atmospheric photochemistry, suggest which models may be best for this purpose, and indicate how the models can be improved...|$|R
40|$|New, {{non-destructive}} sensing {{techniques for}} fast {{and more effective}} quality assessment {{of fruits and vegetables}} are needed to meet the ever-increasing consumer demand for better, more consistent and safer food products. Over the past 15 years, hyperspectral imaging has emerged as a new generation of sensing technology for non-destructive food quality and safety evaluation, because it integrates the major features of imaging and spectroscopy, thus enabling the acquisition of both spectral and spatial information from an object simultaneously. This paper first provides a brief overview of hyperspectral imaging configurations and common sensing modes used for food quality and safety evaluation. The paper is, however, focused on the three innovative hyperspectral imaging-based techniques or sensing platforms, i. e., spectral scattering, <b>integrated</b> reflectance and <b>transmittance,</b> and spatially-resolved spectroscopy, which have been developed in our laboratory for property and quality evaluation of fruits, vegetables and other food products. The basic principle and instrumentation of each technique are described, followed by the mathematical methods for processing and extracting critical information from the acquired data. Applications of these techniques for property and quality evaluation of fruits and vegetables are then presented. Finally, concluding remarks are given on future research needs to move forward these hyperspectral imaging techniques...|$|R
40|$|Spectral albedo and {{transmittance}} in {{the range}} 400 – 900 nm were measured on three separate dates on less than 15 cm thick new Arctic sea ice growing on Kongsfjorden, Svalbard at 78 : 9 °N, 11 : 9 °E. Inherent optical properties, including absorption coefficients of particulate and dissolved material, were obtained from ice samples and fed into a radiative transfer model, which was used to analyze spectral albedo and transmittance and to study the influence of clouds and snow on these. <b>Integrated</b> albedo and <b>transmittance</b> for photosynthetically active radiation (400 – 900 nm) were {{in the range}} 0. 17 – 0. 21 and 0. 77 – 0. 86, respectively. The average albedo and transmittance of the total solar radiation energy were 0. 16 and 0. 51, respectively. Values inferred from the model indicate that the ice contained possibly up to 40 % brine and only 0. 6 % bubbles. Angular redistribution of solar radiation by clouds and snow was found to influence both the wavelength-integrated value and the spectral shape of albedo and transmittance. In particular, local peaks and depressions in the spectral albedo and spectral transmittance were found for wavelengths within atmospheric absorption bands. Simulated and measured transmittance spectra were within 5 % {{for most of the}} wavelength range, but deviated up to 25 % in the vicinity of 800 nm, indicating the need for more optical laboratory measurements of pure ice, or improved modeling of brine optical properties in this near-infrared wavelength region...|$|R
