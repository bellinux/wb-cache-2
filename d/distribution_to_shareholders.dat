2500|$|CarMax is a {{used car}} auto superstore concept {{developed}} in 1991 at Circuit City by Austin Ligon, then Circuit City's Senior VP of Planning, and Rick Sharp, then Circuit City CEO. The goal of CarMax was to revolutionize used car retailing {{through a combination of}} large selection (400+ used cars at each store); low, no-haggle pricing; guaranteed quality; and a consumer-friendly shopping experience. The first location opened in Richmond, Virginia in September 1993. CarMax grew slowly for its first four years as the team refined the basic concept, then went public through an IPO as a [...] "tracking stock" [...] (KMX) of Circuit City in February 1997. The offering was managed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and raised more than $400mm for a 20% interest in the company, with Circuit City retaining the remaining 80% ownership. CarMax used the proceeds to repay Circuit City's initial $170mm investment in the company, then used the remainder to grow rapidly, adding 27 more stores from 1997 to 2000, and turning its first profit in FY2001. Circuit City sold a further 10% of its interest in CarMax in July 2001 for $140mm, with proceeds going to Circuit City. CarMax was spun off from Circuit City in a tax free <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>shareholders</b> in October 2002 to allow both companies to grow and be valued independently. The stock distribution provided Circuit City shareholders with KMX stock valued at over $1.2bn {{at the time of the}} spin off in 2002.|$|E

40|$|It is in {{the area}} of the {{regulation}} of a company's share capital and <b>distributions</b> <b>to</b> <b>shareholders</b> that the inherent conflict between creditors and shareholders, and the fragile balance among shareholders internally, intersect. The share capital of a company underlies its corporate structure and represents not only its initial own funds from which creditors can be paid, but also the relative equity interests of the shareholders. The balance between shareholders can be disturbed by capital reorganisations through increase, reduction or variation of share capital or through disproportionate contributions by, or <b>distributions</b> <b>to,</b> <b>shareholders.</b> Share repurchases are particularly risky in this regard. Creditor interests are affected when their prior right to payment is endangered by <b>distributions</b> <b>to</b> <b>shareholders.</b> This study analyses the South African Law relating to share capital and distributions against the background of a comparative study of the laws of England, New Zealand, Delaware and California, as well as the provisions of the American Model Business Corporations Act. Two main approaches to creditor protection are evident. The capital maintenance doctrine, which is followed in England and Delaware, protects creditors by emphasising the notional share capital of the company as a limit on distributions. In contrast, the solvency and liquidity approach focuses on the net assets of the company and on its ability to pay its debts. New Zealand, California and the Model Business Corporations Act represent this approach. Regulatory responses <b>to</b> <b>shareholder</b> protection range from insistence on compliance with procedural requirements to minimal statutory intervention in the internal affairs of companies, instead relying on general principles of fairness and good faith. There is little correlation between a particular system's approach to creditor protection on the one hand, and <b>to</b> <b>shareholder</b> protection on the other. England, New Zealand and South Africa prescribe specific formalities, while the American approach is more relaxed. South Africa is a hybrid system. Its transition from capital maintenance to solvency and liquidity has been incomplete and its protection of equity interests is relatively unsophisticated. A number of recommendations are made for an effective and coherent approach that will safeguard the interests of creditors and shareholders alike. School: LawLL. D...|$|R

40|$|The US Bankruptcy Code’s chapter 11 {{procedure}} is both {{in practice and}} conceptually the most important insolvency procedure worldwide. Many countries, including the Netherlands, look at Chapter 11 for inspiration in revising their own insolvency laws. Chapter 11 is, however, itself up for revision. On December 4, 2014, the American Bankruptcy Institute (ABI) issued breaking news for the restructuring and insolvency community in the USA when it presented its Final Report and Recommendations on the Reform of Chapter 11. This article discusses the most principled recommendations that will also be of the most relevance for legislatures and policy makers drawing inspiration from Chapter 11. First of all, the recommendation is discussed for introducing {{the figure of a}} so-called ‘estate neutral’ as a supplement to the debtor in possession model. Secondly, the introduction of significant restrictions on 363 sales; selling all or nearly of the assets. Restrictions deal both with timing and creditor involvement. As a third recommendation, we single out the introduction of a so-called ‘redemption option’. This option seeks to restore in part the balance between secured and unsecured creditors by giving ‘the immediate out of the money creditors’ a claim on encumbered assets equal to a redemption option. Finally, most novel and most interesting from a company law perspective, is the introduction of an Equity Retention Plan for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SME’s). The plan seeks {{to strike a balance between}} protecting the statutory order of distributions which would normally prevent a <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>shareholders</b> on the one hand and providing an incentive to shareholders necessary for the successful reorganisation of the company to remain involved on the other. This recommendation thereby provides an exception to the Absolute Priority rule, which usually has as the effect of wiping shareholders out in case of insolvency...|$|E
40|$|Capital {{maintenance}} rules {{are part of}} a legal capital regime that consists of rules on raising capital and rules on maintaining it. The function of these rules is the protection of the corporation’s creditors. This is evidenced by the fact that in public as well as private companies the provisions on legal capital are not open to disapplication or variation even with unanimous shareholder consent. Thus, providing the company with a minimum of funding and ensuring equal treatment of shareholders are mere reflexes of creditor protection or, at best, ancillary purposes of legal capital. Legal capital is part of a corporation’s equity. The key feature of equity is that it ranks behind the claims of other stakeholders in the distribution of a corporation’s assets. Consequently, equity will also be the first part of a corporation’s funds to be depleted by losses. Capital {{maintenance rules}} seek to enforce this order of priority of different groups of stakeholders by restricting distributions to shareholders. Such restrictions are not unique to legal systems that have adopted a legal capital regime. A prominent example of a statute that has eliminated mandatory legal capital is the Delaware General Corporation Law. § 154 DCGL leaves it up to the directors to decide whether any part of the consideration received by the corporation for its shares shall be attributed to capital. Thus, a Delaware corporation need not have any stated capital. This has significant impact on the funds available for <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>shareholders.</b> Pursuant to § 170 (a) DGCL dividends may only be paid out of surplus or, in the absence of surplus, out of net profits of the current or the preceding fiscal year. § 154 DGCL defines surplus as the excess of a corporation’s net assets over the amount of its capital, and net assets as the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities. A corporation without stated capital may, therefore, distribute all of its net assets to its shareholders and continue business without any equity on its balance sheet. This highlights the difference between the different approaches to creditor protection in Germany and the U. S. Both legal systems acknowledge the priority of creditors over shareholders in corporate distributions. However, German law seeks to give creditors additional comfort by requiring companies to raise and maintain additional layers of assets above and beyond those corresponding to the company’s liabilities that may not be depleted by way of distributions to shareholders. While private companies must merely raise and maintain their stated capital, public companies are required to raise and maintain additional equity accounts unavailable for distributions to shareholders such as the share premium account 1 and the legal reserve. 2 In recent years a number of objections have been raised against this concept of creditor protection. Critics argue that contractual arrangements are a more efficient means for protecting the interests of creditors. 3 Capital maintenance does not prevent creditors from negotiating for more stringent protection of their claims such as collateral or financial covenants. It does, however, provide a minimum standard of protection for the benefit of creditors who lack the commercial experience or the bargaining power or who, like tort victims, are simply unable to negotiate for contractual safeguards. Capital maintenance ensures that their protection against excessive distributions does not depend on large creditors who are free to waive covenants that, in effect, benefit all creditors in exchange for individual arrangements that work exclusively in their favour...|$|E

The {{results of this study}} suggest that, in periods in which the dividend tax penalty increases, firms are more likely to distribute funds <b>to</b> <b>shareholders</b> through share repurchases as opposed to dividends.

As managerial share ownership increases and the dividend tax penalty increases firms are more likely <b>to</b> make <b>distributions</b> <b>to</b> <b>shareholders</b> in the form of share repurchases. As aggregate institutional ownership increases and the dividend tax penalty increases, firms are neither more likely to repurchase shares nor more likely to distribute dividends. Division of the institutional ownership category indicates that institutions classified as mutual funds and investment advisors (brokers) have the strongest preference for share repurchases as the dividend tax penalty increases. In contrast, institutions classified as banks, insurance companies and other institutions have the smallest preference for share repurchases as the dividend tax penalty increases.
