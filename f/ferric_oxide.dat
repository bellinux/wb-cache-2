5|$|The uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho H2 {{increases}} with increasing temperature; thus rapidly condensed H2 contains {{large quantities of}} the high-energy ortho form that converts to the para form very slowly. The ortho/para ratio in condensed H2 is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the hydrogen liquid, leading to loss of liquefied material. Catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion, such as <b>ferric</b> <b>oxide,</b> activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, <b>ferric</b> <b>oxide</b> colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E

50|$|Red beds (or redbeds) are {{sedimentary}} rocks, {{which typically}} consist of sandstone, siltstone, and shale that are predominantly red in color {{due to the}} presence of <b>ferric</b> <b>oxides.</b> Frequently, these red-colored sedimentary strata locally contain thin beds of conglomerate, marl, limestone, or some combination of these sedimentary rocks.

25|$|For such iron-rich {{rocks to}} be {{deposited}} {{there would have}} to be anoxia in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as ferrous oxide) could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as <b>ferric</b> <b>oxide.</b> For the ocean to become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that the reappearance of BIF in the sedimentary record is a result of limited oxygen levels in an ocean sealed by sea-ice, while opponents suggest that the rarity of the BIF deposits may indicate that they formed in inland seas.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} crucial factors in {{successfully}} crystallising an artificial gemstone is obtaining highly pure starting material, with at least 99.9995% purity. In the case of manufacturing rubies or sapphires, this material is alumina. The presence of sodium impurities is especially undesirable, as it makes the crystal opaque. Depending on the desired colouration of the crystal, small quantities of various oxides are added, such as chromium oxide for a red ruby, or <b>ferric</b> <b>oxide</b> and titania for a blue sapphire. Other starting materials include titania for producing rutile, or titanyl double oxalate for producing strontium titanate. Alternatively, small, valueless crystals of the desired product can be used.|$|E
25|$|The {{process was}} {{designed}} {{primarily for the}} synthesis of rubies, which became the first gemstones to be synthetically produced, thanks {{to the efforts of}} Fremy and Verneuil. However, the Verneuil process could also be used for the production of other stones, including blue sapphire, which simply required <b>ferric</b> <b>oxide</b> to be substituted for chromium oxide, as well as more elaborate ones, such as star sapphires, where titania (titanium dioxide) was added and the boule was kept in the heat longer, allowing needles of rutile to crystallise within it. In 1947, the Linde Air Products division of Union Carbide pioneered the use of the Verneuil process for creating such star sapphires, until production was discontinued in 1974 due to overseas competition.|$|E
40|$|A {{hypothesis}} was proposed explaining clay decomposition and interlayering in acid, seasonally wet soils, {{under the influence}} of the periodic reduction and oxidation of iron. This process, termed ferrolysis, is as follows. In the wet season, reduction of <b>ferric</b> <b>oxides</b> produces dissolved ferrous iron, which displaces and mobilizes exchangeable bases. The bases (and dissolved ferrous iron) are partially removed by leaching. In the dry season, oxidation of exchangeable ferrous iron produces <b>ferric</b> <b>oxides</b> and exchangeable hydrogen leading to partial decomposition of the clay and release of aluminium and silica. Aluminium interlayers with trapped ferrous iron are formed in 2 : 1 clays by partial neutralization of exchangeable aluminium together with reduction of <b>ferric</b> <b>oxides</b> in the wet season; thus the cation exchange capacity decreases further. The implications of ferrolysis were tested by morphological, chemical and mineralogical analysis of several acid, seasonally wet soils from South-east Asia and different parts of Europe. The effects of various other processes, e. g. cheluviation and clay translocation, were also identified in some of these profiles. Until now, ferrolysis was not clearly distinguished from cheluviation (podzolization sensu stricto), clay translocation and desilication. Therefore, criteria are given to differentiate between the effects of these processes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChemical {{fraction}} {{plays an}} influential role in solubility and potential bioavailability of heavy metals in soils. Seasonally flooding and iron reduction are significant environmental processes of paddy soil. They {{may influence the}} fractionation of cooper (Cu) in paddy soil. In this study, an anaerobic incubation experiment was conducted to simulate the anaerobic environment of flooded paddy soil. The fractionations of native and spiked Cu in paddy soil were determined using a modified sequential extraction procedure (SEP) method. The effects of flooding time on Cu fractions were determined. The effects of ferrihydrite on Cu fractions were also investigated to understand the interaction between Cu contamination and iron reduction process. The {{results showed that the}} native Cu in soil were most in the residual and organic matter fractions, but the more available fractions, such as, the exchangeable and carbonates fractions occupied only a little proportion. After flooding, the native Cu in soil released from organic matter fraction and crystalloid <b>ferric</b> <b>oxides</b> fraction, and transferred to the easy extracted fractions, such as, amorphous <b>ferric</b> <b>oxides,</b> carbonates and exchangeable fractions. The spiked Cu was easily absorbed by carbonates and organic matter in soil, but after flooding, the two fractions transferred into <b>ferric</b> <b>oxides</b> fraction, especially amorphous <b>ferric</b> <b>oxides</b> fraction. Similar phenomena were observed after adding ferrihydrite in soil except for the disposal of added 400 mg/kg Cu. The process of iron reduction was inhibited significantly by Cu contamination and the inhibition of Cu contamination to iron reduction decreased after adding ferrihydrite. The transformation of Cu fractions had significant relation to the process of iron anaerobic reduction in paddy soil...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the Shroud may have been formed using a bas-relief sculpture. Researcher Jacques di Costanzo, noting that the Shroud image {{seems to have a}} three-dimensional quality, suggested that perhaps the image was formed using a three-dimensional object, such as a sculpture. While wrapping a cloth around a life-sized statue would result in a distorted image, placing a cloth over a bas-relief would result in an image like the one seen on the shroud. To demonstrate the plausibility of his hypothesis, Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over the bas-relief. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of <b>ferric</b> <b>oxide</b> and gelatine. The result was an image {{similar to that of the}} Shroud.

40|$|An Early Precambrian {{micaceous}} metaquartzite {{subjected to}} low to moderate metamorphism in the Isua area of Southwestern Greenland {{was derived from}} the erosion of preexisting rocks which were probably sialic in composition.

This rock contains no organic compounds besides traces of methane and no biologically significant elements associated with the graphite microstructures. Reaction of primitive methane with <b>ferric</b> <b>oxides</b> appears to have oxidized the methane to the vein graphite and reduced the <b>ferric</b> <b>oxides</b> to ferrous-ferric oxide (magnetite).

40|$|Respiratory {{processes}} in bacteria are remarkable {{because of their}} ability to use a variety of compounds, including insoluble minerals, as terminal electron acceptors.

Here we show that these mutants contain disruptions in a gene that is involved in the biosynthesis of menaquinone. During growth, the wild type releases a menaquinone-related redox-active small molecule into the medium that complements the mutants. This finding raises the possibility that electron transfer to a variety of oxidants, including poorly soluble minerals, may be mediated by microbially excreted quinones that have yet to be identified...|$|R

The reactors supplemented with ferric oxyhydroxide (R 2) and magnetite (R 3) showed significantly enhanced biomethanation performance {{compared with the}} control (R 1). The removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) after 30 days was 31. 9, 59. 3, and 82. 5 % in R 1, R 2, and R 3, respectively. The consumed COD was almost fully recovered as biogas in R 2 and R 3, while only 79 % was recovered in R 1. The total energy production as biogas was accordingly 32. 2, 71. 0, and 97. 7 kJ in R 1, R 2, and R 3, respectively. The reactors also differed in the acid formation profile with more propionate and butyrate found in R 1 and more acetate found in R 3. The enhanced biomethanation seems {{to be associated with}} variations in the bacterial community structure supposedly induced by the <b>ferric</b> <b>oxides</b> added. In contrast, no evident variation was observed in the archaeal community structure among the reactors. The potential electric syntrophy formed between Methanosaeta concilii-like methanogens and electroactive iron-reducing bacteria, particularly Trichococcus, was likely responsible for the enhanced performance. The stimulated growth of fermentative iron reducers may also have contributed by altering the metabolic characteristics of the bacterial communities to produce more favorable acidogenic products for methanogenesis. The overall results suggest the potential of biostimulation with (semi) conductive <b>ferric</b> <b>oxides</b> to enhance the rate and efficiency of the biomethanation of organic wastes.
