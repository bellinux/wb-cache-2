5|$|Many planned {{elements}} were never filmed, due to production time constraints. Moore <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> an extended battle {{scene in which}} Data would be electrocuted, and Wesley Crusher blown up in an explosion. Production of the episode ended on December 19.|$|E
5|$|After {{being open}} for {{little more than}} a year, the school failed in February 1737, gaining Johnson a {{reputation}} as a failed schoolmaster. He slowly abandoned his desire to teach to focus more on writing his first major work, the historical tragedy Irene. The play did not earn him the money he <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for,</b> though, until Garrick produced it in 1749.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Abdul Hamid II {{was overthrown}} during the Young Turk Revolution, which {{launched}} the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Armenians gained more {{seats in the}} 1908 parliament, but the reforms fell short of the greater autonomy that the ARF <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for.</b> The Adana massacre in 1909 also created antipathy between Armenians and Turks, and the ARF cut relations with the Young Turks in 1912.|$|E

5|$|In the 1st century BCE and {{the first}} half of that century, it was the Mediterranean port of the Nabateans, whose caravans arrived there from Petra or from Elath on the Red Sea. In 96 BCE, the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus besieged the city for a year. The inhabitants, who <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> help from the Nabatean king Aretas II, were killed and their city {{destroyed}} by Jannaeus when Aretas did not come to their aid.|$|E
5|$|Jackson was speculated as a {{potential}} candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004, but declined to run and instead became one of Barack Obama's early supporters. He endorsed Howard Dean for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, joining Al Gore in saying Dean was the most likely candidate in the primary to beat Bush. The endorsement was a bitter blow to the hopes of candidate Al Sharpton, who <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> endorsements from both Jackson and his father.|$|E
5|$|When the Chjeno-Piast coalition, which Piłsudski had {{strongly}} criticized, {{formed a}} new government, on 12–14 May 1926, Piłsudski returned {{to power in}} a coup d'état (the May Coup), supported by the Polish Socialist Party, Liberation, the Peasant Party, and even the Polish Communist Party. Piłsudski <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> a bloodless coup, but the government had refused to back down; 215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed, and over 900 persons had been wounded.|$|E

5|$|White Sox {{officials}} <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> a {{crowd of}} 20,000,about 5,000more than usual. Instead, at least 50,000—including {{tens of thousands of}} Dahl's adherents—packed the stadium, and thousands more continued to sneak in even after gates were closed. Many of the records were not collected by staff and were thrown like flying discs from the stands. After Dahl blew up the collected records, thousands of fans stormed the field and remained there until dispersed by riot police.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{was among}} the first to warn {{military}} leaders about the potential impact of nuclear energy, giving a lecture on the subject at the Navy Department on 18March 1939. The response fell short of what he <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for,</b> although the Navy agreed to provide $1,500 towards further research at Columbia. Later that year, Szilárd, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller sent the famous letter signed by Einstein to U.S. President Roosevelt, warning that Nazi Germany was likely to build an atomic bomb. In response, Roosevelt formed the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter.|$|E
5|$|Izzie {{was created}} by Grey's Anatomy {{producer}} Shonda Rhimes, with actress Katherine Heigl cast in the role. Heigl originally wanted to play Izzie as a brunette, but was requested to retain her natural blond for the part. Heigl's comprehension of medical procedures and terminology is slight; the actress explained that while she has an admiration for doctors, she is not as fascinated by medicine as other cast members. When Kate Walsh's character Addison Montgomery left Grey's Anatomy to launch the spin-off show Private Practice, Heigl disclosed that she <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> a spin-off for Izzie.|$|E

5|$|Leeds {{has limited}} {{examples}} of Brutalism, one such being the Leeds International Swimming Pool (designed by disgraced architect John Poulson). until {{the commencement of}} its demolition in Autumn 2009, following its closure in October 2007. The Leeds International Pool was not without its design flaws, the pool size was miscalculated and was less than an inch too narrow to qualify for Olympic Standard meaning that it never held the competitions the council <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> and it {{spent much of the}} 1960s closed while problems with its construction were rectified.|$|E
5|$|Operation Slapstick did {{not provide}} the {{diversion}} General Eisenhower <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for.</b> The decision by Heidrich not to oppose the landings was made without reference to Kesselring's headquarters. Heidrich had expected to be confronted by an overwhelming Allied force and had withdrawn his units north, although he endeavoured to delay the Allied advance where possible by ambushes and roadblocks. The German division went on to frustrate the Allied attempt to advance on Rome during the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Cambodian {{government}} was not informed of the incursion until it was already under way. The Cambodian leadership however welcomed the intervention against PAVN bases and the resulting weakening of PAVN military capabilities. The leadership <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> permanent US occupation of the PAVN sanctuaries because FANK and ARVN forces were unable to fill the vacuum in these territories following US withdrawal. It has been argued by some scholars that the incursion heated up {{the civil war and}} helped the insurgent Khmer Rouge gather recruits to their cause.|$|E

5|$|Then Lothair, who <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> the {{complete}} conquest of Sicily, gave Capua and Apulia from the Kingdom of Sicily to Roger's enemies. Innocent protested, claiming that Apulia fell under papal claims. Lothair turned north, but died while crossing the Alps on December 4, 1137. At the Second Council of the Lateran in April 1139, Innocent excommunicated Roger for maintaining a schismatic attitude. On March 22, 1139, at Galluccio, Roger's son RogerIII, Duke of Apulia ambushed the papal troops {{with a thousand}} knights and captured the pope. On March 25, 1139, Innocent was forced to acknowledge the kingship and possessions of Roger with the Treaty of Mignano.|$|E
5|$|Video game critics gave Spec Ops: The Line {{generally}} positive reviews. Praise {{focused on}} the narrative and its themes, while criticism was targeted at the online multiplayer mode and generic third person gameplay. Spec Ops: The Line was a commercial failure and did not garner the attention that distributor Take-Two Interactive <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for,</b> but it was awarded and nominated for several end-of-the-year accolades particularly for its story. Yager announced that {{there would not be}} a sequel to the game. The game was banned in the United Arab Emirates for its depiction of Dubai in a state of destruction.|$|E
5|$|A new Baroque {{building}} was constructed on {{site of the}} first Castellania by the same Grand Master, creating significant employment as Pinto <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for,</b> with works commencing in 1757. Throughout the course of construction, prisoners were held in a torre near Valletta's Porta Reale, probably the tower of Saint James Cavalier. The new Castellania was built to a design by the architect Francesco Zerafa, but he died before its completion, so he was substituted by the architect Giuseppe Bonici. Zerafa is accredited for the main design, and for the subjected building he has post mortem {{established himself as a}} respected architect. The edifice was completed in 1760, with its chapel being consecrated on 15 November of that year. As a general rule, buildings in Valletta were required to be ready within three-years period from start to completion. The prisoners were transferred to the new prison three days later, on 18 November 1760.|$|E
6000|$|First, of <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> yourselves.--I say {{first for}} yourselves, not because {{a man is}} right in being selfish, and caring only for his own soul, but because a man must care for his own soul first, if he ever intends to care for others; a man must <b>have</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> himself first, {{if he is to}} <b>have</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> others. He may stop there, and turn his {{religion}} into a selfish superstition, and spend his life in asking all day long, [...] "Shall I be saved, shall I be damned?" [...] or worse still, in chuckling over his own good fortune, and saying to himself, [...] "I shall be saved, whoever else is damned;" [...] but whether he ends there or not, he must begin there; begin by trying to get himself saved. For if he does not know what is right and good for himself, how can he tell what is right and good for others? If he wishes to bring his neighbours out of their sins, he must surely first have been brought out of his own sins, and so know what forgiveness and sanctification means. If he wishes to make others at peace with God, he must first be at peace with God himself, to know what God's peace is. If he wants to teach others their duty, he must first know his own duty, for all men's duty is one and the same. If he wishes to <b>have</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> the world, he must first <b>have</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> himself, for he is in the world, a part of it, and he must learn what blessings God intends for him, and they will teach him what blessings God has in store for the earth. Faith and hope, like charity, must begin at home. By learning the corruption of our own hearts, we learn the corruption of human nature. By learning what is the only medicine which can cure our own sick hearts, we learn what is the only medicine which can cure human nature. We learn by our own experience, that God is all- forgiving love; that His peace shines bright upon the soul which casts itself utterly on Jesus Christ the Lord for pardon, strength, and safety; that God's Spirit is ready and able to raise us out of all our sin, and sottishness, and weakness, and wilfulness, and selfishness, and renew us into quite new men, different characters from what we used to be; and so, by <b>having</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> ourselves, we learn step by step and year by year to <b>have</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> our friends, for our neighbours, and for the whole world.|$|R

5|$|Breckinridge {{was equally}} {{controversial}} in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning {{the office of}} Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document summarizing the contentions between the Old and New Schools. The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even some in the Old School camp <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> a more moderate course. The differences between the Old and New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in the Old School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of the Old School branch's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E
5|$|Having secured {{two quick}} and decisive {{victories}} over his opponents which greatly increased his reputation, Charles marched against the Saxon forces in early 1701. These were camped {{on the opposite}} bank of the Düna. The clash occurred {{in the battle of}} Düna, ending in another Swedish victory. However, the outcome was not as decisive as Charles <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for.</b> A large part of Augustus' army survived and marched into neutral Prussia. As a consequence, Charles was not able to capitalize on the previous Russian setback at Narva, but was forced to postpone the planned invasion. Instead he decided to chase the Saxon army into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where Augustus was also king. Thus far, technically, Poland-Lithuania had stayed neutral in the conflict since Augustus began the war with Sweden in his capacity as Elector of Saxony rather than as king of Poland. Charles' purpose was to remove Augustus from the Polish throne. The subsequent conflict became known as the Swedish invasion of Poland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of the campaign, Douglas finally began to receive some of the support she <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>for.</b> Boddy's paper {{endorsed}} her, while Truman praised her. Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign, spoke out on behalf of his wife, as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor. Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne. Another actor, Ronald Reagan, was among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this—30years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her.|$|E
