50|$|Securities {{financing}} is {{the ability}} to borrow or lend cash or securities against collateral. In securities financing, collateral comprises assets given as a guarantee by a borrower to secure a securities loan and subject to seizure in the event of default. Collateral management refers to the handling of all tasks related to the monitoring of <b>collateral</b> <b>posted</b> by a borrower to meet a financial obligation (optimisation, substitution, top-up, withdrawal, settlement instruction, reporting, processing of margin calls and returns, notification of corporate events, etc.).|$|R
40|$|A bank {{borrowing}} some money {{has to give}} some securities to the lender, which is called collateral. Different kinds of <b>collateral</b> can be <b>posted,</b> like cash in different currencies or a stock portfolio depending on {{the terms of the}} contract, which is called a Credit Support Annex (CSA). Those contracts specify eligible collateral, interest rate, frequency of <b>collateral</b> <b>posting,</b> minimum transfer amounts, etc. This guarantee reduces the counterparty risk associated with this type of transaction. If a CSA allows for posting cash in different currencies as collateral, then the party <b>posting</b> <b>collateral</b> can, now and at each future point in time, choose which currency to post. This choice leads to optionality that needs to be accounted for when valuing even the most basic of derivatives such as forwards or swaps. In this thesis, we deal with the valuation of embedded optionality in collateral contracts. We consider the case when <b>collateral</b> can be <b>posted</b> in two different currencies, which seems sufficient since collateral contracts are soon going to be simplified. This study is based on the conditional independence approach proposed by Piterbarg [8]. This method is compared to both Monte-Carlo simulation and finite- difference method. A practical application is finally presented with the example of a contract between Natixis and Barclays. ...|$|R

Fifty extracted and endodontically treated premolar teeth were used. The teeth were divided into five groups (n = 10) depending on the restorative technique (Groups 1 - 5).

Group 4 showed the highest average fracture resistance among the tested groups. The multi-post techniques (group 2 and 4) exhibited statistically higher fracture resistance compared to group 1. Regarding fracture patterns, there was no statistically significant difference between the tested groups. Within the limitations of this study, the application of multiple elastic or conventional FRC posts or a single elastic post in the same root canal is beneficial in terms of fracture resistance compared to a single conventional FRC post.

40|$|Sepsis is a {{worldwide}} health problem {{with an enormous}} economic burden and devastatingly high mortality rate. The pathophysiology and immune dysfunctions that occur during sepsis remain largely unknown, severely limiting current treatment options for sepsis. Both the innate and adaptive parts {{of the immune system}} are known {{to be involved in the}} dysfunctions that occur during sepsis. Over the last few years adenosine has been recognized as an endogenous mediator that alters both innate and adaptive immune responses. Adenosine receptors are largely expressed on many different immune cells and may serve to limit <b>excess</b> <b>collateral</b> damage in the setting of inflammation. In this study, the pharmacological effects of an A 2 A receptor antagonist on septic mice were examined using the CLP model of sepsis that results in a polymicrobial infection. Pharmacological inactivation of the A 2 A receptor significantly increased mortality in septic mice predicted to live in comparison to those given only vehicle. Treatment with the A 2 A receptor antagonist also increased expression of CD 40, part of a pathway well known for its roles in inflammation. Our data also showed increased monocyte MHCII expression after treatment with an adenosine antagonist. Our data support the role that A 2 A receptors are involved in the immune response to sepsis, and that these receptors may serve to damage <b>excess</b> <b>collateral</b> damage ensuing from the host immune response, and that additional studies on adenosine and its related purine nucleosides would be of use for better understanding of the immune dysfunctions that occur during sepsis and other diseases...|$|R

Counterparty risk mitigants include the variation margin (VM), tracking the mark-to-market of client portfolios, and the initial margin (IM) set as a cushion against gap risk, which is the risk of slippage between the portfolio and its variation margin during liquidation periods. The cost of funding cash collateral for the variation margin is known as funding valuation adjustment (FVA), while the cost of funding segregated <b>collateral</b> <b>posted</b> as initial margin is the margin valuation adjustment (MVA). Contra-liability counterparts of the FVA and the MVA arise as the FDA (funding debt adjustment) and the MDA (margin debt adjustment).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{introducing}} rigorous methods and formulas for bilateral counterparty risk credit valuation adjustment (CVA) on interest-rate portfolios. In doing so, we summarize the general arbitrage-free valuation framework for counterparty risk adjustments in presence of bilateral default risk, including the default of the investor. We illustrate the symmetry in the valuation and show that the adjustment involves a long position in a put option plus a short position in a call option, both with zero strike and written on the residual net present value of the contract at the relevant default times. We allow for correlation between the default times of the investor and counterparty, and for correlation of each with the underlying risk factor, namely interest rates. We also analyze the often neglected impact of credit spread volatility. We include close-out netting rules in our examples, although other agreements, such as periodic margining or <b>collateral</b> <b>posting,</b> are left for future work.

5000|$|Insurance companies: Corporations such as AIG provide {{insurance}} products called credit default swaps, which {{are intended to}} protect against credit defaults, {{in exchange for a}} premium or fee. They are required to post a certain amount of collateral (e.g., cash or other liquid assets) {{to be in a position}} to provide payments in the event of defaults. The amount of capital is based on the credit rating of the insurer. Due to uncertainty regarding the financial position of the insurance company and potential risk of default events, credit agencies may downgrade the insurer, which requires an immediate increase in the amount of <b>collateral</b> <b>posted.</b> This risk-downgrade-post cycle can be circular and destructive across multiple firms and was a factor in the AIG bailout. Further, many major banks insured their mortgage-backed assets with AIG. Had AIG been allowed to go bankrupt and not pay these banks what it owed them, these institutions could have failed, causing risk to the entire financial system. Since September 2008, the U.S. government has since stepped in with $150 billion in financial support for AIG, much of which flows through AIG to the banks.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} This paper investigates two conjectures from the theoretical literature on financial intermediation concerning the special role of banks in financing opaque {{and small business}} and thus fostering growth. The first is that more opaque firms borrow preferably from banks that should be better at collecting and processing soft information, i. e. small banks, banks that specialize in relationship-based lending, and banks that {{are close to the}} firm’s headquarters. The second is that the comparative advantage these banks have in screening and monitoring opaque borrowers should be reflected in the characteristics of the credit relationships they develop with such borrowers. The first step of the analysis consists of estimating the probability of a specific bank-firm matching, characterizing banks by size, specialization in small business lending and proximity. The second step estimates the effect of the bank-firm matching on the ratio of credit drawn from credit lines – an inverse measure of credit availability- and the amount of <b>collateral</b> <b>posted,</b> accounting for the non-randomness of the matching between banks and firms. The analysis is performed on very large data set of bank-firm credit relationships including virtually the universe of nonfinancial firms borrowing a positive quantity of credit from Italian banks in one year...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the sizable role of rehypothecation {{in the shadow}} banking system. Rehypothecation is the practice that allows <b>collateral</b> <b>posted</b> by, say, a hedge fund to its prime broker to be used again as collateral by that prime broker for its own funding. In the United Kingdom, such use of a customer’s assets by a prime broker can be for an unlimited amount of the customer’s assets while in the United States rehypothecation is capped. Incorporating estimates for rehypothecation (and the associated re-use of collateral) in the recent crisis indicates that the collapse in non-bank funding to banks was sizable. We show that the shadow banking system was at least 50 percent bigger than documented so far. We also provide estimates from the hedge fund industry for the - churning - factor or re-use of collateral.
