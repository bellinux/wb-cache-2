2500|$|After seeing Armie Hammer's {{performance}} in The Social Network (2010), Guadagnino [...] "fell in love" [...] {{with him and}} cultivated his passion for Hammer and the movies he made afterwards. The director {{found him to be}} a [...] "sophisticated actor, with a great range" [...] and had him in mind for the role of Oliver. Hammer, who expressed his interest in Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash, met with the director years before the film went into production. When Hammer got the script, he almost turned down the role because of the nudity that was originally in it. [...] "I did want to pass. It scared me," [...] he said. [...] "There’s a lot of stuff here that I’ve never done on film before. But there’s no way I can’t do this, mostly because <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> so much." [...] According to Guadagnino, Hammer was going to pass on the role through his agent, but then changed his mind {{at the end of their}} conversation. This is the third film that has Hammer playing a gay character, following Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar (2011) and Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait (2017).|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lowder {{was rather}} stiff for it. [...] "Yes; <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me.</b> I'm always scared--I may call it so--till I understand. What {{happiness}} is he talking about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Terribly glad {{your father}} keeps {{coming down on}} us, because <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> so I get desperate," [...] said Milt. [...] "Golly, I think I can hear the train. I, uh, Claire, Claire dear----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ella,' I said, 'I don't know {{anything}} rational or reasonable {{about any of}} it. It was all--all woman-work, and <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> horribly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Stick to your money, Maisie, for there's {{nothing more}} ghastly {{in the world}} than poverty in London. <b>It's</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me.</b> By Jove, <b>it</b> put the fear into me! And one oughtn't to be afraid of anything.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{lost the}} place; but that's my luck. I dreamed an ill dream last night, mother--or maybe I saw a ghost. Take it either way, <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> {{out of my}} senses, and I'm not my own man again yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I try to {{run away}} from mine sometimes, but I can't ever. It will come after me; and in the night <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me,</b> if it gets big and black," [...] said Will, looking behind him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, that isn't all! It isn't {{like the}} other quarrels we've had. When I think how I've felt toward you ever since, <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me.</b> There can't be {{anything}} sacred in our marriage unless we trust each other in everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|Haney {{insisted on}} smoking a cigar in the lobby. Bertha took her mother away to talk over the {{tremendous}} decision {{which was about}} to be thrust upon them. [...] "We want a house," [...] said she, decisively, [...] "but not a palace like that. What would we do with it? <b>It</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> up a tree to think of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "And I {{knew what}} I'd done and boy <b>it</b> liketa <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> to death." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "For {{five years}} after the two flops, I devoted myself to writing scripts," [...] Black continued. [...] "Finally in 1976, I decided to get back into {{directing}} through episodic television. The idea of <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> because I had started in the film business at the top with my own feature." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So Adrian {{was fixed}} {{to drink the}} King and Foxhunting, and study up the Native Army in India (I'd like to see 'em myself), till the British General had taught the male white {{citizens}} of Great Britain how to ride. Don't misunderstand me, Sir. I loved that General. After ten minutes I loved him, and I wanted to laugh at him; {{but at the same}} time, sitting there and hearing him talk about the centuries, I tell you, Sir, <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> cold! He admitted everything--he acknowledged the corn before you spoke--he was more pleased to hear that his men had been used to wipe the geldt with than I was when I knocked out Tom Reed's two lead- horses--and he sat back and blew smoke through his nose and matured his men like cigars and--he talked of the everlastin' centuries! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been frightened, certainly. And I {{wish you}} had been, too. I wish you wouldn't be so {{conceited}} about Ellen. <b>It</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> to see you so. Poor, sick thing, her looks are all gone! You must see that. And she doesn't dress like the girls he's used to. I know we've got her things in New York; but she doesn't wear them like a New-Yorker. I hope she isn't going in for MORE unhappiness!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, nothing wrong; but she's profoundly in {{love with}} him. I never have seen her {{so wrapped up in}} any one. She thinks of nothing else. <b>It</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> to see it, for I've studied him closely and I can't believe he feels the same toward her. His world is so {{different}} from ours. I don't know what to do or say. I fear she is in for a period of great unhappiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DON'T! <b>It</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> yet, {{to think}} of it. I repented of it the minute it was done; and I was even afraid to tell you lest your face might betray it to somebody. I didn't sleep any that night, for worrying. But {{after a few days}} I saw that no one was going to suspect me, and after that I got to feeling glad I did it. And I feel glad yet, Mary--glad through and through." ...|$|E
5000|$|Malcolm in the Middle {{finished}} its run on May 14, 2006. Ten days later, on May 24, Muniz {{appeared in}} the horror movie Stay Alive. He {{expressed a desire to}} leave traditional Hollywood film roles behind, saying: Growing up has never <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> until last year. I started thinking about getting older, being an adult, and <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me.</b> Hopefully things will work out in my career. If they don't, then it was never meant to be.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not? It's {{all very}} simple. We're creatures of our surroundings, aren't we? Now, {{sitting there in}} the dark to-night, {{it seemed to me that}} the people we think of as dead were all about <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> at first; but, really, isn't it the most comforting faith in the world? I've always liked the idea of the Indian's happy 'hunting-grounds'--and this is {{something}} like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{left him}} at once, for Porthos {{was but a}} little way behind me. The mystery of <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me,</b> but I armed {{promptly}} for battle. I engaged a boy to walk Porthos in Kensington Gardens, and gave him these instructions: [...] "Should you find yourself followed by a young woman wheeling a second-hand perambulator, instantly hand her over to the police on the charge of attempting to steal the dog." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{may be all}} talk. Well, anyhow, {{he wants}} to see you and talk it over; and oh, Bertie, it does seem a {{wonderful}} chance--and my heart's so bad to-day it seems as though I couldn't see to another meal! I don't want you to marry him if you don't want to--I'm not asking you to. You know I'm not. But he is a noble-looking man--and I get awfully discouraged sometimes. <b>It</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> to think of dying and leaving you without any security." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It does more, much more. <b>It</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me.</b> Come {{up and see}} the stuff. Taste it! Try it! It's {{the most}} amazing stuff on earth." [...] He gripped my arm and, walking at such a pace that he forced me into a trot, went {{shouting}} with me up the hill. A whole char-a-banc-ful of people turned and stared at us in unison after the manner of people in chars-a-banc. It {{was one of those}} hot, clear days that Folkestone sees so much of, every colour incredibly bright and every outline hard. There was a breeze, of course, but not so much breeze as sufficed under these conditions to keep me cool and dry. I panted for mercy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, take a rest! The man slaves harder every year. It {{used to be}} so that he'd take {{a little}} time off now and then; but I declare, he hardly ever seems to breathe now away from his office. And this year he says he doesn't intend to go down to Lapham, except to see after the works for a few days. I don't {{know what to do with}} the man any more! Seems as if the more money he got, the more he wanted to get. <b>It</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> to think what would happen to him if he lost it. I know one thing," [...] {{concluded}} Mrs. Lapham. [...] "He shall not go back to the office to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am," [...] {{answered}} Podge, and a spasm {{passed over}} his big yellow face. [...] "I'm always afraid of insomnia. That's {{the worst thing}} of all. The other night I went to bed about half-past ten, or twenty-five minutes after,--I forget which,--and I simply couldn't sleep. I couldn't. I read a magazine story, and I still couldn't; and I read another, and still I couldn't sleep. <b>It</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> bad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No!' Dick has flung {{back his}} head again. Confidentially, 'Father, I {{sometimes}} thought of it, but <b>it</b> rather <b>scared</b> <b>me!</b> I expect that is {{about how it was}} with her, too.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{earth is}} full of men who'd sell their souls for three hundred a year; and women come and talk, and borrow a five-pound note here and a ten-pound note there; and a woman has no {{conscience}} in a money debt. Stick to your money, Maisie, for there's nothing more ghastly {{in the world than}} poverty in London. <b>It's</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me.</b> By Jove, <b>it</b> put the fear into me! And one oughtn't to be afraid of anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jest {{to think}} of bein' that rich, Will!" [...] exclaimed Amanda Hatch to the storekeeper, as they stood in the little group which had {{gathered}} {{in front of the}} first citizen's new mansion. [...] "I own <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me.</b> Think how much that house must hev cost, and even them dogs," [...] said Amanda, staring at the mastiffs with awe. [...] "They tell me he has a grand piano from New York, and guests from Boston railroad presidents. I call Isaac Worthington to mind when he wahn't but a slip of a boy with a cough, runnin' after Cynthy Ware." [...] She glanced down at Cynthia with something of compassion. [...] "Just to think, child, he might have be'n your father!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope, Remington," [...] he went {{on after}} a pause, [...] "I didn't rag your other guests too much. I've a sort of feeling at moments--Remington, those chaps are so infernally not--not bloody. It's part of a man's duty {{sometimes}} at least to eat red beef and get drunk. How is he to understand government if he doesn't? <b>It</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> to think of your lot--by a sort of misapprehension--being in power. A kind of neuralgia in the head, by way of government. I don't understand where YOU come in. Those others--they've no lusts. Their ideal is anaemia. You and I, we had at least a lust to take hold of life and make something of it. They--they want to take hold of life and make nothing of it. They want to cut out all the stimulants. Just as though life was anything else but a reaction to stimulation!"...|$|E
5000|$|In 1962, {{the move}} became {{permanent}} and Adderley {{went on to}} become an all-NFL selection five times in the 1960s. Packers coach Vince Lombardi remarked, [...] "I was too stubborn to switch him to defense until I had to. Now when I think of what Adderley means to our defense, <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> to think of how I almost mishandled him." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an interview, Felix Buxton {{stated that}} the album Scars were {{all the things that}} the band had been through emotionally and physically. Felix told Rolling Stone Australia they named the album after he was mugged for his bicycle in Brixton, London in 2008. He revealed: [...] "I wasn't badly hurt, but <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It's</b> {{probably}} one of the scariest moments of my life. Scars are the things that stay with you and that incident definitely gave me one." ...|$|R
60|$|R. C. was {{dominated}} to do so, and presently the canoe drifted over {{where the line}} was stretched. That second ticklish moment passed. <b>It</b> had <b>scared</b> <b>me.</b> But I could not refrain from one sally.|$|R
5000|$|Throsby later {{recalled}} {{the death of}} her brother [...] "I was 17 when he died and I had one exam left in my HSC. I went to the exam and did all that stuff because I thought you had to keep on doing that stuff and I didn't stop... Those things affect you. I think <b>it</b> has made <b>me</b> <b>scared.</b> <b>It</b> made <b>me</b> <b>scared</b> to travel because he died when he was in Bangkok. <b>It</b> made <b>me</b> <b>scared</b> to get on a motorcycle, which I've never done. <b>It</b> made <b>me</b> <b>scared</b> when other people travel away from me." [...] After earning a B.A. degree (major in English) from the University of Sydney, Throsby worked at an art house video store for several years and travelled overseas, including living in Austin, Texas for six months.|$|R
5000|$|... "I Feel Like 2001 is 1981, {{with the}} {{super-fast}} advancement of technology, art damage, people doing lots of coke, all this nihilism. And <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me,</b> and I {{want to talk}} about that and what my identity as a human being is. So much of what was written about The Little Deaths was about our sexualities...I never got asked much beyond that...it got irritating...it was really boring." [...] From the March 2002 issue of MRR.|$|E
5000|$|She {{continued}} to release new music every year until 2000 with sporadic releases since then. Her most recent release came in 2008 when she {{teamed up with}} Miyuki Nakajima, co-composer of five of Kudo's late-80s hits, for a double a-side, Night Wing/ Yuki Gasa. Kudo said of their long-term working relationship, [...] "We are not that close. We have a nice distance. Sometimes when I hear her music, <b>it</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> but I especially like her passionate lyrics." ...|$|E
40|$|Titus Andronicus scares me. <b>It</b> <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> {{because it}} {{presents}} a world so far from what I hope our world is, but so close to what I fear our world is. It {{is a world of}} cruelty, of a perverse and violent logic driven by insatiable revenge. The challenge of the production was to create a clear and cruel world that forced the audience to deal with the reality of the horror of the events of the play. We sought to create a space where there was nowhere to hide, a harsh and unflattering lighting design that exposed rather than pleased the eye, a sound design that instilled a feeling of creeping horror. Through the style of acting, we strove to eliminate self-pity and lament from the emotional language of the play. Only in its final moments is the audience granted a kind of catharsis, when the young woman playing Young Lucius removes her boy's wig to reveal the actor, alone, weeping at the tragedy and the cruelty of the world that surrounds her. At my advisor's urging to challenge myself, I chose to take on a play that is largely devoid of the redemptive qualities of life. The world of Titus Andronicus is replete with cruelty and violence. It is a profane world, one driven by a perverse logic that perpetuates its hatred and barbaris...|$|E

It was 5 a.m. I was {{sitting in front of}} an abandoned apartment building at the corner of Lakewood and Jefferson. I was drinking vodka and Black Label beer. I heard a voice. The voice said, 'William Taylor, come forth.' I heard it as clear as we're talking now. <b>It</b> <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> to death. I jumped straight up in the air.
