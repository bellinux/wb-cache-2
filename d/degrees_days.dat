Euseius alatus DeLeon (Acari: Phytoseiidae) {{is one of}} the most common predators of tropical fruit trees in Brazil, feeding of pollen, mites and other small arthropods. This predator presents wide distribution, occurring from Rio Grande do Sul to Ceara. This work had as objective to evaluate the effect of temperature oil the development and reproduction of E. alatus, in addition to determining their thermal requirements. The study was accomplished at temperatures of 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 and 33 degrees C; relative humidity of 70 +/- 5 %; and 12 -h photophase. At these temperatures, the egg-adult period lasted 14. 0; 8. 1; 5. 5; 4. 9; 3. 8 and 3. 1 days, respectively.

They overcome the blind passage of long needles and all the related complications. There are many different devices available and because these are outpatient procedures, primary fixation {{plays an important role}} in the outcome. The objective is to evaluate the primary fixation of the various devices of attachment of the commercially available mini-slings through biomechanical tests. Materials and Methods: A total of 45 Wistar rats were divided in 3 groups of 15 rats each. They underwent 5 subcutaneous implantation of different mini slings and one polipropilene mesh (control), as follows: TVT-Secur (R) (Gynecare, USA), Type 1 polypropylene mesh (control); Ophira Mini Sling System (R) (Promedon, Argentina), Tissue Fixation System (R) (TFS PTY, Australia), Zipper Sling (R) and "T device" (Prosurg, USA). The abdominal wall was removed on bloc at different times after implant for biomechanical evaluation, which consisted in application of unidirectional force to the extremity of the fixation system or mesh, until it was completely removed from the tissue using a tension meter (Nexygen 3. 0 Universal Testing Machine - LLOYD Instruments). The force was measured in Newtons (N). Results: There was signifi cant difference in the resistance to extraction among the different fixation systems.

Four different main types of models were developed using the North American data, including either three 'baseline' climate variables (growing <b>degrees</b> <b>days,</b> temperature of the coldest month, water balance) or an extended set of seven climate variables, both averaged either over a 30 year time slice or a longer 90 year time slice. Ten different random selections of pseudo-absences were generated from the North American data, {{on the basis of}} which ten separate generalized additive models (GAMs) were developed for each main model type. All the 40 developed GAMs were applied first to North America and then transferred to whole Europe and Finland. All the models showed a statistically highly significant accuracy in the three study areas. Although the differences among the four main model types were only minor, the two extended model types showed on average statistically better performance than the two baseline models based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values, the amount of deviance explained by the models, resubstitution validation and four-fold cross-validation in North America. They also provided slightly more accurate predictions of climatically suitable area for Elodea canadensis in Finland both in 1961 – 1984 and 1985 – 2006. However, the projections from the individual extended models were more variable than projections from the baseline models. Thus model predictions based on a variety of predictor variables but only one selection of pseudoabsences may be subject to biases, and outputs from multiple models should be investigated to better account for uncertainties in modelling. Overall, our results suggest that more attention should be paid to the careful selection of predictor variables and the use of multiple pseudo-absence sets in the ecological niche modelling in order to increase the reliability of the projections of the range shifts of invasive species...|$|E

As fachadas ventiladas podem ser definidas como um sistema de revestimento {{exterior}} de edifícios, cuja principal característica é a existência de uma caixa-de-ar em movimento, resultante do afastamento entre a parede do edifício e o revestimento. O principal objectivo do presente estudo é analisar o sistema construtivo em três regiões climáticas de Portugal: Bragança, Ovar e Évora. Para tal recorreu-se a dois programas de simulação, o EnergyPlus e o DesignBuilder. Com base nos resultados obtidos pelo EnergyPlus calcularam-se os consumos em Aquecimento e Arrefecimento e os respectivos Graus Dias. Observando os resultados, conclui-se que de uma forma geral a utilização de fachadas ventiladas reduz os consumos em Aquecimento e Arrefecimento nas três regiões climáticas. No entanto, é na estação de Arrefecimento que se verifica uma redução mais acentuada. Observou-se ainda que a colocação de um damper nas aberturas melhorava significativamente a prestação do edifício na estação de Arrefecimento. ABSTRACT: With the {{new regulations}} {{in the area of}} energy consumption of buildings, {{it is very important to}} simulate the thermal behavior of these. There is still the necessity of create a new constructive solution, being one of them the use of ventilated facades. The ventilated facades can be defined as an outer cover system of buildings, whose main characteristic is the existence of an air cavity in movement, resultant of the breakaway between the wall of the building and the covering. The main subject of the present study its to analyze the constructive system in three climatic zones of Portugal: Bragança, Ovar and Évora. For that, we used two programs to do the simulation, the EnergyPlus and the DesignBuilder. Attempting to the results obtained from EnergyPlus, we calculated the consumptions in Heating and Cooling, and the respective <b>Degrees</b> <b>Days.</b> Observing the results, we conclude that the use of ventilated facades generally reduces the consumptions in Heating and Cooling in the three climatic regions. However, it is in the Cooling Season that the reduction is more accented. When we use a damper in the openings, this can significantly improve the installment of the building in the Cooling Season.

By using the above mentioned model, energy consumption for heating/cooling is analyzed in different locations, showing that for low <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> the inertia effect assumes a paramount importance, affecting the common linear behavior of the building consumption against the standard <b>degree</b> <b>days,</b> especially for cooling energy demand. Cooling energy demand at low cooling <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> (CDDs) is deeply analyzed, highlighting that in this situation other factors, such as solar irradiation, have an important role. To take into account these effects, a correction to CDD is proposed, demonstrating that by considering all the contributions the linear relationship between energy consumption and <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> is maintained...|$|R
40|$|Thermal units or <b>degree</b> <b>day</b> {{systems can}} both {{be used to}} {{quantify}} relationships between plants and air temperature. The Northern Fluminense region holds no tradition for irrigated papaya (Carica papaya L.) cropping and, {{because of the need}} for irrigation, it is important knowing its growth and development characteristics under these conditions. This study aimed to determine the relationship between growth rate of papaya plants and <b>degree</b> <b>days,</b> and its effect on crop productivity, under different irrigation levels. An experiment was set up with the cultivar "Improved Sunrise Soil 72 / 12 ", in a randomized blocks design, with seven irrigation water depths and three repetitions; crop growth and yield parameters were evaluated. There were significant correlations between water depths and <b>degree</b> <b>days.</b> Polynomial models of 2 nd and 3 rd order appropriately fitted the relationships <b>degree</b> <b>day</b> versus plant height, stem diameter, crown diameter and number of emitted leaves, for each water depth. Growth parameters related to <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> and to the applied treatments are indicative of yield potential. The total water depth that promoted the greatest fruit yield was 2, 937 mm...|$|R
40|$|Iowa {{has been}} {{steadily}} accumulating <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> ahead of schedule in 2012. Over the weekend, some parts of southern Iowa hit an important <b>degree</b> <b>day</b> benchmark for common stalk borer. About 10 percent of stalk borer larvae can begin moving to corn after accumulating 1, 300 to 1, 400 <b>degree</b> <b>days.</b> Part of southwestern and southeastern Iowa have reached that threshold and we recommend starting to scout this week in corn (Fig. 1). Central and northern Iowa should start scouting May 12 to May 18, if warm temperatures continue. This is about three weeks earlier than last year...|$|R
25|$|Compared with arctic timberlines, alpine timberlines {{may receive}} {{fewer than half}} of the number of <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> (>10°C) based on air {{temperature}} because solar radiation intensities are greater at alpine than at arctic timberlines. However, the number of <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> calculated from leaf temperatures may be very similar in the two kinds of timberlines.|$|R
