50|$|When a regent {{is removed}} from office by a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> {{incapacity}} and subsequently the incapacity ceases to exist, the regent can be restored to office by means <b>of</b> a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity. In that case upon the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity, a change of regent takes place, with {{the person who has}} a lower place in the order of succession ceasing to be the regent, and in his or her stead the person with a higher position in the order of succession, who had only ceased to be regent due to the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> incapacity, resuming the office of regent. The requirements for <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity regarding the regent are the same ones that are valid for a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity regarding the sovereign.|$|R

50|$|Sometimes, a state {{wishing to}} achieve {{independence}} from a dominating power will issue a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> independence; the earliest surviving example is Scotland's <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Arbroath in 1320, {{with the most}} recent example being Azawad's <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> independence in 2012. Declaring independence and attaining it however, are quite different. A well-known successful example is the U.S. <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence issued in 1776. The dates of established independence (or, less commonly, the commencement of revolution), are typically celebrated as a national holiday known as an independence day.|$|R

50|$|Prominent {{examples}} <b>of</b> {{a unilateral}} <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> independence other than Rhodesia's UDI in 1965 include {{that of the}} United States in 1776, the Irish <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence of 1919 by a revolutionary parliament, Katanga's <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> independence by Moise Tshombe in July 1960, the attempted secession of Biafra from Nigeria in 1967, the Bangladeshi <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> independence from Pakistan in 1970, the (internationally unrecognized) secession of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus from Cyprus in 1983, the Palestinian <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence from the Palestinian territories in 1988, {{and that of the}} Republic of Kosovo in 2008.

5|$|Jefferson's most {{immediate}} sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own {{draft of the}} preamble of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's draft <b>of</b> the Virginia <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Rights. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence. They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Rights, which formally ended the reign of King JamesII. During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Rights {{as a model of}} how to end the reign of an unjust king. The Scottish <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.|$|R

This {{was the first}} <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> inconsistency in New Zealand. It was appealed to the Court of Appeal which upheld the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> inconsistency. The Attorney-General argued that the Court had no jurisdiction to issue a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> inconsistency unless it was expressly authorised by legislation. The Court of Appeal called this a “bold argument” and concluded that “inconsistency between statutes {{is a question of}} interpretation…and it lies within the province of the courts."
