This paper studies how such collections of auctions aggregate into a multi-object auction market.

We then show that such an auction market is approximately efficient: specifically, its expected inefficiency is bounded above by the expected efficiency gain associated with adding one more bidder...|$|E

When multiple items are offered through <b>individual</b> <b>auctions,</b> a bidder wanting {{a bundle of}} items faces an exposure problem if the bidder places {{a high value on}} a combination of goods but a lowvalue on strict subsets of the desired collection.

Empirically, I find that even for the newer uniform-price auctions, the average price received by the Treasury is less than the price of the same securities in the concurrent secondary market, although this underpricing is reduced by half relative to the older mechanism. The auctions are modeled in a multi-unit common-value setting with a winner’s curse problem. Underpricing results in equilibrium for both auction formats, although to a greater degree for the discriminatory auction. In the context of the model, the equilibrium level of underpricing in an <b>individual</b> <b>auction</b> can be predicted from the summary statistics released by the Treasury after each auction.

This shill bidding is undesirable as it introduces inefficiencies within the market.

40|$|It {{is often}} of {{interest}} to recover derivatives of a sample of random functions from sparse and noise-contaminated measurements, especially when the dynamics of underlying processes is of interest.

We establish consistency results and demonstrate in simulations that the method is superior to alternative approaches (derivative estimation with random effects models based on B-spline bases, kernel smoothing, smoothing splines, or P-splines).

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} sequential auctions {{for private}} value objects using second-price sealed-bid rules. Now, the equilibrium bids for such auctions {{depend on the}} information uncertainty of the bidders. Specifically, there are three key auction parameters that the bidders could be uncertain about: the valuations of the objects for sale, the number of objects for sale, {{and the number of}} participating bidders. We analyse the bidding behaviour for each of these three sources of uncertainty. For each setting, we first find the equilibrium bidding strategies for the <b>individual</b> <b>auctions</b> that comprise a series. Then we analyze the effect of these uncertainties on the computational and economic properties of the equilibrium solution. The former analysis is essential if we want to use software agents to bid on our behalf. The latter is essential because both the auctioneer and the bidders want to know how these uncertainties affect their profits. Thus we compare the outcomes for these settings {{from the perspective of the}} bidders (i. e., in terms of their profits), from the perspective of the auctioneer (i. e., in terms of his revenue), and from a global perspective (i. e., in terms of auction efficiency). ...|$|E
40|$|In Benin, {{traditional}} parboiling {{is still}} widely practiced among rice processors, resulting in inferior grain quality. A new parboiler {{was introduced to}} improve the milling yield and intrinsic quality of local rice. We conducted Vickrey second price auctions to elicit rural Beninese consumers’ willingness to pay for rice obtained through the new parboiler and two locally innovated parboilers. The <b>individual</b> <b>auctions</b> were followed by a group discussion during which consensus was reached on socially acceptable prices. Relative to traditionally parboiled rice, consumers {{were willing to pay}} price premiums of 9 – 13 % for rice obtained through a local parboiler using a container of which the bottom is a perforated metal, 27 % for rice obtained through a local parboiler using wooden sticks {{at the bottom of the}} pot, and 25 – 34 % for rice parboiled through the improved parboiler. Bids were influenced by the presentation order of the products according to perceived quality. Bids were also higher when participants had been informed on the benefits of improved parboiling techniques, which is a crucial insight for developing marketing and communication strategies for this improved quality product. Group bids were not significantly different from individual bids which suggests that the latter are within the range of socially acceptable prices defined through group consensus. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{sequential}} auction {{problem is}} commonplace in open, electronic marketplaces such as eBay. This {{is the problem}} where a buyer has no dominant strategy in bidding across multiple auctions when the buyer would have a simple, truth-revealing strategy if there was but a single auction event. Our model allows for multiple, distinct goods and market dynamics with buyers and sellers that arrive over time. Sellers each bring a single unit of a good to the market while buyers can have values on bundles of goods. We model each <b>individual</b> <b>auction</b> as a second-price (Vickrey) auction and propose an options-based, proxied solution to provide price and winner-determination coordination across auctions. While still allowing for temporally uncoordinated market participation, this options-based approach solves the sequential auction problem and provides truthful bidding as a weakly dominant strategy for buyers. An empirical study suggests that this coordination can enable a significant efficiency and revenue improvement over the current eBay market design, and highlights the effect on performance of complex buyer valuations (buyers with substitutes and complements valuations) and varying the market liquidity...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{number of}} the {{cloud-based}} Internet applications demands for efficient resource and cost management. This paper proposes a real-time group auction system for the cloud instance market. The system is designed based on a combinatorial double auction, and its applicability and effectiveness are evaluated in terms of resource efficiency and monetary benefits to auction participants (e. g., cloud users and providers). The proposed auction system assists them to decide when and how providers allocate their resources to which users. Furthermore, we propose a distributed algorithm using a group formation game that determines which users and providers will trade resources by their cooperative decisions. To find how to allocate the resources, the utility optimization problem is formulated as a binary integer programming problem, and the nearly optimal solution is obtained by a heuristic algorithm with quadratic time complexity. In comparison studies, the proposed real-time group auction system with cooperation outperforms an <b>individual</b> <b>auction</b> {{in terms of the}} resource efficiency (e. g., the request acceptance rate for users and resource utilization for providers) and monetary benefits (e. g., average payments for users and total profits for providers) ...|$|R

40|$|Online {{markets are}} {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent and extend {{to a wide variety}} of areas such as e-commerce, Grid computing, recommender systems, and sensor networks. To date, much of the existing research has focused on the design and operation of <b>individual</b> <b>auctions</b> or exchanges for allocating goods and services. In practice, however, similar items are typically offered by multiple independent sellers that compete for buyers and set their own terms and conditions (such as their reserve price and the type and duration of the auction) within an institution that mediates between buyers and sellers. Examples of such institutions include eBay, Amazon and Yahoo!, where at any point in time multiple concurrent auctions with different settings are selling similar objects, resulting in strong competition 1. Given this competition, a key research question is how a seller should select their auction settings in order to best attract buyers and so increase their expected profits. In this paper, we consider this issue in terms of setting the seller’s reserve price (since the role of the reserve price has received attention in both single isolated auctions and also in cases where sellers compete). In particular, we extend the existing analysis by considering how sellers may improve their profit by shill bidding (i. e., bidding within their own auction as a means of setting an implicit reserve price).

40|$|The global {{art market}} has {{undergone}} a huge transition {{in the last decade}} leading to the creation of new art hedge funds, art mutual funds, and art online auction sites. The increasing interest in the overall art market has also helped popularize emerging art markets such as Indian contemporary art. In this paper we focus on simultaneous online auctions (SOA) for Indian contemporary art. SOAs sell high-value items in auctions that take place simultaneously and are different from popular <b>individual</b> <b>auctions</b> (e. g. eBay) in multiple ways and in particular in that they induce high levels of competition both within and between auctions. The SOA art marketplace has the promise of extremely high profits but also the risk of high losses if not monitored carefully. Forecasting price during an ongoing SOA is therefore important to auction house managers, who can make real-time decisions and intervene while an auction is in progress. We present a novel dynamic forecasting approach for predicting price in ongoing simultaneous online art auctions. Our model forecasts the price from the time of prediction until auction close and updates its prediction in real-time as the auction progresses based on newly arriving information and price dynamics. We find high predictive accuracy of the dynamic model for a data set of contemporary Indian art SOAs and compare its performance to more traditional approaches. We then investigate the source of the predictive power of price dynamics and find that dynamics capture bidder competition within and across auctions. The importance of this finding is both conceptual and practical: price dynamics are simple to compute at high accuracy, as they require information only from the focal auction and are therefore a parsimonious representation of different forms of within-auction and between-auction competition...|$|E
