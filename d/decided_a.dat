5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was <b>decided</b> <b>a</b> four-lane freeway {{would be the best}} decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E

After facing legal trouble and fines when he attempted to sell the text, Horse shelved it until playing Myst and 7th Guest in the mid-1990s, whereupon he <b>decided</b> <b>a</b> first person adventure game would {{be the best way to}} tell the manuscript's story.|$|E
5|$|For Halo 3, it was <b>decided</b> <b>a</b> new visual {{language}} for the Flood was needed. The task {{of developing the}} new Flood forms, organic Flood terrain, and other miscellaneous changes fell to Vic DeLeon, Bungie's Senior Environment Artist. With the addition of mutable forms in Halo 3, the only fictional constraint on the designer's imaginations was that the Flood altered the DNA of its victims by digesting.|$|E

Reginald also accompanied the king's daughter Matilda to Germany for her marriage to Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the site}} was {{considered}} for scheduling by English Heritage, because of its national importance as {{a good example of}} a late 20th-century power station. It was also important because of its use as a testing ground for various generating sizes, from which came success in the UK's electricity industry. However, by then the station's buildings were in poor condition {{and it would have been}} financially difficult to ensure their long term preservation. Instead, it was <b>decided</b> <b>a</b> comprehensive study and photographic record of the station would be commissioned.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{who should}} decide the corporation tax rate under {{the situation in}} which a local public good has a spillover effect and the central government cannot realize residents’ actual preference of the public good. This paper makes the following conclusions. When <b>a</b> local government <b>decides</b> the tax rate, it has an incentive to not only <b>decide</b> <b>an</b> inadequate tax rate because of the incentive to free-ride but also <b>an</b> incentive to <b>decide</b> <b>an</b> excessive tax rate because of the tax export effect. As such, because the incentive to <b>decide</b> <b>an</b> excessive tax rate is dominant, the local government <b>decides</b> <b>a</b> tax rate higher than the socially optimal one. With regard to the problem of who should decide the tax rate, this paper demonstrates the following: when the spillover effect is large (small), the local (central) government should decide the corporation tax rate. This result is unlike those in previous studies...|$|R
5|$|Operation Ferdinand formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. During early 1944 {{the main thrust of}} deceptions in the Middle Eastern theatre were contained under Operation Zeppelin (including its sub-plan Vendetta), which developed threats against Greece and Southern France, and Operation Royal Flush, which ran political deceptions against Spain and Turkey. On 14 June the Allies committed to a landing in Southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon (formerly Anvil). Royal Flush and Zeppelin were scaled back, to tone down the threat to France, and it was <b>decided</b> <b>a</b> new plan (Ferdinand) was required to cover the intended invasion.|$|E
5|$|The Patriots {{rivalry with}} the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts {{ran through the}} two clubs' tenure {{together}} in the AFC East (1970–2001). The two clubs clashed in several close games, such as on December 19, 1971, as a late Patriots touchdown <b>decided</b> <b>a</b> 21–17 New England win; on September 18, 1978, the Colts rallied to defeat the Patriots 34–27 on Monday Night Football on a virtual one-man scoring rampage by running back Joe Washington; on September 4, 1983, the Colts defeated the Patriots in overtime 29–23 in their final season in Baltimore. The Patriots defeated the Colts in back-to-back overtime games, 23–17 on December 8, 1991, and 37–34 on November 15, 1992.|$|E

5|$|With the Winter Olympics {{being held}} in Canada, the writers wanted an Olympic-themed episode that could air during the Games. The script was written by Rob LaZebnik, who {{considered}} having the plot revolve around Homer competing in four-man bobsled. However, he <b>decided</b> <b>a</b> curling episode would allow for the plot to revolve around Homer and Marge. In {{order to try to}} make the depiction of curling in the episode accurate, the writers visited a curling club and tried the sport themselves. They also consulted with a number of curlers. The episode was directed by Chuck Sheetz, while sportscaster Bob Costas guest-starred in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Despite his misgivings Berdyev kept Kinkladze in the team, {{where he}} was used as one of three {{offensive}} midfielders in a 4–2–3–1 formation. Kinkladze, with his technical style and inclination for improvisation, brought more variety to the attacking play of the team, {{in contrast to the}} restrained style of play that Berdyev favoured. He provided an assist in four consecutive matches. The most important of these was against Zenit St. Petersburg, in a match that <b>decided</b> <b>a</b> place in the following year's UEFA Cup. Subsequently, he received a recall to the Georgian national squad for friendlies against Bulgaria and Jordan. However, a muscle strain meant he missed both national team games and Rubin's final league match. He ended the 2005 season with seven assists and two goals in nine appearances for Rubin.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} Minsk in August 1941, Himmler {{witnessed}} an Einsatzgruppen mass execution first-hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men. By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care. He also <b>decided</b> <b>a</b> transition {{should be made to}} gassing the victims, especially the women and children, and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders. Gas vans, which had been used previously to kill mental patients, began to see service by all four main Einsatzgruppen from 1942. However, the gas vans were not popular with the Einsatzkommandos, because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma. Some of the early mass killings at extermination camps used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines, similar to the method used in gas vans, but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at Auschwitz using Zyklon B, a cyanide-based pesticide gas.|$|E

40|$|Karl Olivecrona {{maintains}} that courts necessarily create law when <b>deciding</b> <b>a</b> case. The reason, he explains, is that judges must evaluate issues of fact or law {{in order to}} <b>decide</b> <b>a</b> case, and that evaluations are not objective. I am not convinced by Olivecrona’s analysis, however. The problem is that Olivecrona uses the term ‘evaluation’ in a broad enough sense to cover not only evaluations, including moral evaluations, but also considerations that are not evaluations at all, and that therefore his claim that judges must evaluate issues of law or fact in order to <b>decide</b> <b>a</b> case is false. I begin with {{a consideration of the}} structure of Olivecrona’s argumentation in support of the claim that courts necessarily create law when <b>deciding</b> <b>a</b> case (Section 2), adding a few words about the distinction between law application and judicial law-making (Section 3). I then consider Olivecrona’s tacit assumption that the occurrence of non-objective judicial evaluations must lead to judicial law-making (Section 4), the central claim that courts must evaluate issues of fact or law in order to <b>decide</b> <b>a</b> case (Section 5), and Olivecrona’s meta-ethics (Section 6). Having done that, I consider and reject an alternative interpretation of Olivecrona’s confusing ideas about evaluations (Section 7). I state my conclusions in Section 8.

5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams {{was that they}} never {{seemed to have a}} dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would go a step further in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already <b>decided,</b> <b>a</b> habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Funeral (2004), which had been {{recorded}} in an attic studio known as Hotel2Tango, Arcade Fire <b>decided</b> <b>a</b> permanent recording location was necessary. Following their tour in support of Funeral, the band bought the Petite Église in Farnham, Quebec. Being used as a café {{at the time of}} purchase, the Petite Église had once been a church and a Masonic Temple. Once renovation of the church was complete, the band spent the latter half of 2006 recording a majority of the album there. Michael Pärt produced additional recordings in Budapest, recording the Budapest Film Orchestra and a military men's choir. Other sessions included one in New York, where the band recorded along the Hudson River to be near water.|$|E
