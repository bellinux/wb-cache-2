5|$|The fossa is a {{carnivore}} that hunts {{small to}} medium-sized animals. One of eight carnivorous species endemic to Madagascar, the fossa is the island's largest surviving endemic terrestrial mammal {{and the only}} predator capable of preying upon adults of all extant lemur species, the largest of which can weigh as much as 90percent {{of the weight of}} the average fossa. Although it is the predominant predator of lemurs, reports of its <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> demonstrate a wide variety of prey selectivity and specialization depending on habitat and season; diet does not vary by sex. While the fossa is thought to be a lemur specialist in Ranomafana National Park, its diet is more variable in other rain forest habitats.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E

Design, participants, setting and measurements: A risk factor questionnaire which contained a question about the <b>dietary</b> <b>habit</b> of adding salt to food was completed by 11742 community recruited older men between 1996 and 1999.

Variability in allometric trajectory patterns was compared to measures of adult disparity in each clade, and <b>dietary</b> <b>habit</b> among the examined species, which together encapsulated an ecomorphological breadth. Results indicate that the evolution of allometric trajectories in rodents is characterized by different features in sciurids com-pared with muroids and Ctenohystrica.

In contrast, a greater magni-tude of difference between trajectories and an increased variation in allometric coefficient values was evident for both Ctenohystrica and muroids. Ctenohys-trica and muroids achieved considerably higher adult disparities than sciurids, suggesting that conservatism in allometric trajectory modification may con-strain morphological diversity in rodents.

25|$|A {{key project}} {{is one that}} could radically {{change the way the}} medical {{profession}} is paid for services under Medicare and Medicaid. The current system, which is also the prime system used by medical insurers is known as fee-for-service because the medical practitioner is paid only for the performance of medical procedures which, it is argued means that doctors have a financial incentive to do more tests (which generates more income) which may not be in the patients' best long-term interest. The current system encourages medical interventions such as surgeries and prescribed medicines (all of which carry some risk for the patient but increase revenues for the medical care industry) and does not reward other activities such as encouraging behavioral changes such as modifying <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> and quitting smoking, or follow-ups regarding prescribed regimes which could have better outcomes for the patient at a lower cost. The current fee-for-service system also rewards bad hospitals for bad service.

Living environment was devided into three areas according to the geographical areas (Hokkaido-Tohoku-Hokuriku-Sanin, Kanto-Tokai-Kinki, and Sanyo-Shikoku-Kyushu), two community types according to an urban or an agricultural or fishing village, and four community sizes according to number of the population. Factors considered to contribute to a high level of ADL were evaluated. The results can be summarized as follows. 1. According to the geographical area, the independence rate (percentage of individuals who were competent for ADL) was significantly higher in Sanyo-Shikoku-Kyushu area than in Kanto-Tokai-Kinki area in all items examined (transferring, feeding, continence and bathing). Regional differences were observed in the state of living, state of medical care, social and cultural activities, and <b>dietary</b> <b>habit</b> since the age of 80 years, watching TV and an interest in health as social and cultural activites were related to high independence rates in areas such as Sanyo. 2.
