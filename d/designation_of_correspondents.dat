All the men and only one-quarter {{of the women were}} identified by name. Patronymic designations were typical for the majority of men and only used once as the <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> a woman. Some men were designated with their father’s patronymic. Almost all of the men’s patronymics had Slavic suffixes. Lithuanian suffixes in patronymics were used only three times. Some identifications of men included personal names from the <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> family members (mother, stepfather, father-in-law). Titles were more typically used to identify women than men. Titles of marital status and kinship dominated the <b>designations</b> <b>of</b> both sexes.
