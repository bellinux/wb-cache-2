25|$|Piper {{received}} numerous {{phone calls}} and apologies from Lynch. On 31 March 2008, {{two days after the}} initial attack, Lynch persuaded Piper to go to an internet cafe to read an email he had sent to her Facebook account. Lynch gave her details to Stefan Sylvestre, who identified her on Golders Green Road. Wearing a hoodie to obscure his identity, Sylvestre approached Piper, who thought he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> money, and then threw sulphuric acid at her face.|$|E
500|$|The {{next two}} seasons {{were just as}} {{disastrous}} for the team's reputation. Several players, including Wallace, Stoudamire, and Qyntel Woods, were cited for marijuana possession. Woods pleaded guilty to first-degree animal abuse for staging dog fights in his house, some involving his pit bull named Hollywood. Hollywood and Woods' other pit bull, Sugar, were confiscated, and Woods was given eighty hours of community service. He also agreed to donate $10,000 to the Oregon Humane Society. Wallace was suspended for seven games for threatening a referee. Zach Randolph and Patterson got in a fight during practice, with Randolph sucker punching his teammate in the eye, an injury which kept Patterson from making a meaningful contribution during the playoffs. When police came to Stoudamire's house {{to respond to a}} burglar alarm, they noticed the smell of marijuana, searched the premises, and found a pound of cannabis located in a crawlspace; the search was later declared illegal and charges in the matter were dropped. Guard Bonzi Wells famously told Sports Illustrated in a 2002 interview: [...] "We’re not really going to worry about what the hell (the fans) think about us. They really don’t matter to us. They can boo us everyday, but they’re still <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> our autographs if they see us on the street. That's why they’re fans, and we’re NBA players." [...] Wells was fined $50,000 by the Blazers for the statement.|$|E
500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'. Really miserable and down because I'm in the red, and the bills are coming in, poor old Lil [...] suffers as I don't want to get a rise. Not really true don't want to ask for a rise, fellows are having a pretty tough time as it is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Barresi: [...] "I {{called the}} editor at The Globe and I said, 'I have a tape, I'm {{on the way}} down town to hand it to the District Attorney.' And his words were, 'let us come with you.' And then I knew I had him. The next thought in my mind was I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> $30,000. You always ask for twice as much as what you hope to get. He put me on hold, and within less than a minute he came back and he said 'well, we can't give you thirty, we'll give you ten.' I said 'make if fifteen,' he said 'you have a deal.'" [...] Reporter: [...] "Could you see the {{headlines}} coming? Barresi: [...] "Oh yeah, sure, and I could see that money coming too." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Can't you--" [...] He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> a position--something {{easy with}} big pay--when {{he saw that}} such a request would make his {{telegram}} a lie.|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{looked up}} surprised, {{and was just}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> what <b>for.</b> But he {{perceived}} at once {{that he was in}} advance of his parents, and that he had consequently disobeyed his father's orders. He went away rather sullenly.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said Vittorio, smiling. He {{thought at}} first that Mr. George was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> some {{abatement}} on account of {{a portion of the}} party being young. [...] "No, sir; we don't charge any thing extra for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be afraid," [...] he said. [...] "I am {{not going}} to ask you any questions. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> any explanations. I think that we have passed all that. It is of the future I wanted to speak." ...|$|E
60|$|Carol herself {{would gladly}} have {{followed}} Mr. Ole Jenson, and migrated even to another Main Street; flight from familiar tedium to new tedium would {{have for a}} time the outer look and promise of adventure. She hinted to Kennicott of the probable medical advantages of Montana and Oregon. She {{knew that he was}} satisfied with Gopher Prairie, but it gave her vicarious hope to think of <b>going,</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> railroad folders at the station, to trace the maps with a restless forefinger.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a fact. I {{rang the}} bell, {{and was just}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the maid <b>for</b> 'Persian' when your Aunt Cynthia herself came through the hall and pounced on me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAR JAMES--You will be surprised, I am afraid, {{to see my}} handwriting. Pray don't suppose I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>for</b> money, or to reproach you {{for having}} sold me out of house and home when you {{forfeited}} your security, and I had to pay. I am willing and anxious to let by-gones be by-gones, and to forget the past.|$|R
6000|$|... "But what {{a lonely}} one!" [...] protested Ida. [...] "Why, there isn't another house in sight. I wonder {{who lives in}} it. Anyway, I'm <b>going</b> down <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> them <b>for</b> a drink of water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Silly girl!" [...] he declared. [...] "No, I {{am going}} to dine alone with her brother, the Count Sabatini. You see, I am private {{secretary}} now to a merchant prince, no longer a clerk in a wholesale provision merchant's office. We climb, my dear Ruth. Soon I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> a holiday, and then we'll make Isaac leave his beastly lecturing and scurrilous articles, and come away with us somewhere {{for a day or}} two. You would like a few days in the country, Ruth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> {{the same}} information,' said Mr. Neigh, {{determining}} the very longest hair in his beard to an infinitesimal nicety by drawing its lower portion through his fingers. 'I have quite forgotten--cannot keep people's names {{in my head}} at all; nor could my father either--nor any of my family--a very odd thing. But my old friend Mrs. Napper knows for certain.' And he turned to one {{of a small group}} of middle-aged persons near, who, instead of skimming the surface of things in general, like the rest of the company, were going into the very depths of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't bother about me," [...] Anne begged. [...] "What {{you want}} to do now is to tell Parkins to pack up your things and I'll come and see you off by the four o'clock train. Julien must wait outside for my future employer. What I really {{think is going to happen}} is that she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> my character. Julien, be merciful to me! Remember that above all things I have always been respectable. Remind her that if I were too {{intelligent}} I should probably rob her of her secrets or money or something. I am really a most machine-like person. Nature meant me to be secretary to a clever woman, and my handwriting--don't forget my handwriting. Nothing so clear or so rapid has ever been seen." ...|$|E
5000|$|It's {{not clearly}} stated who the ruler is. Izanami is called, [...] "The great deity of yomi" [...] {{towards the end}} of the story {{although}} in the beginning she was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> other deities <b>for</b> advice.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try if I {{can recover}} {{my place in}} your estimation," [...] I said. [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your pity <b>for</b> a man whose whole heart is yours, whose whole life is bound up in you." ...|$|R
2500|$|One {{important}} event {{before and during}} the festival are lion dances. Dances are performed by both non-professional children's groups and trained professional groups. Lion dance groups perform on the streets, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> houses <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> permission <b>to</b> perform for them. If the host consents, the [...] "lion" [...] will come in and start dancing as a blessing of luck and fortune for the home. In return, the host gives lucky money to show their gratitude.|$|R
60|$|After {{three days}} of {{successful}} washing, when {{it became apparent that}} a shed must be built, and that, if possible, some further labour must be hired, Mick said that he must go. 'I ain't earned nothing,' he said, 'because of that bout, and I ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> nothing, but I can't stand this any longer. I hope you'll make your fortins.' Then came the explanation. It was not possible, he said, that a regular miner, such as he was, should be a party to such a grand success without owning a share in it. He was quite aware that nothing belonged to him. He was working for wages and he had forfeited them. But he couldn't see the gold coming out under his hands in pailfuls and feel that none of it belonged to him. Then it was agreed {{that there should be no}} more talk of wages, and that each should have a third share in the concern. Very much was said on the matter of drink, in all of which Caldigate was clever enough to impose on his friend Dick the heavy responsibility of a mentor. A man who has once been induced to preach to another against a fault will feel himself somewhat constrained by his own sermons. Mick would make no promises; but declared his intention of trying very hard. 'If anybody'd knock me down as soon as I goes a yard off the claim, that'd be best.' And so they renewed their work, and at the end of six weeks from the commencement of their operations sold nine ounces of gold to the manager of the little branch bank which had already established itself at Ahalala. These were hardly 'pailfuls'; but gold is an article which adds fervour to the imagination and almost creates a power for romance.|$|E
5000|$|... "We’re {{not going}} to leave {{anything}} in the tank. I mean the boys, every single day, just find another level to go to, and today I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> everything, and of course I’ll deliver and I’ll find something else." ...|$|E
50|$|Greed: Keboja and Radule hatch {{a scheme}} to extract money from Diego Maradona by asking him to financially help them out with a fake health problem. However, {{the amount of money}} they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> keeps rising, side by side with their greed and plans for the future.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with David Letterman, on the Late Night with David Letterman in October 1987, Walsh, while intoxicated, was asked about whether the album's title had a background, to which Walsh immediately responded [...] "Yeah, a bum!, I saw a bum about a block away and I knew he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me <b>for</b> spare change, so I reach in - I'm all ready but he gets {{up to me and}} I say here, help yourself". He says [...] "I don't need money, ya got any gum?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} lunch with our things on," [...] said Mrs. Vervain, [...] "and then there needn't be any delay in starting. I {{thought we would}} have it here," [...] she added, as Nina and the house-servant {{appeared}} with trays of dishes and cups. [...] "So that we can start in a real picnicky spirit. I knew you'd think it a womanish lunch, Mr. Ferris--Don Ippolito likes what we do--and so I've provided you with a chicken salad; and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>for</b> a taste of it; I'm really hungry." ...|$|R
50|$|While on a {{business}} trip to Hong Kong, Se-young meets Seok-hoon and Hong-joo, and for her amusement, she makes them a dangerous offer to test their marriage: In exchange for paying off Seok-hoon's debts so that he could avoid <b>going</b> <b>to</b> jail, she <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> three days with him.|$|R

50|$|The United States Food and Drug Administration is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> {{electronic}} {{submission of}} raw data from animal studies using the Standard for Exchange of Non-clinical Data in future investigational new drug and biologic license application submissions. This is {{widely seen as}} a potential game changer for the toxicology discipline where data exchange and data mining of large data-sets is not the norm. It could allow for the automatic import to a database like the eTOX one.|$|E
50|$|During the hearing, Stempel's {{testimony}} {{fails to}} convince the committee. Both NBC network head Robert Kintner (Allan Rich) and Geritol executive Martin Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese) deny any knowledge of Twenty One being rigged. After being subpoenaed by Goodwin, Van Doren testifies before the committee and admits {{his role in the}} deception. After the hearing adjourns, he learns from reporters that he has been fired from Today and that Columbia's trustees are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> his resignation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was obliged," [...] she continued, [...] "to {{say that}} I {{was engaged to}} you, to save you from something--I don't know what.

6000|$|... 'I {{know all}} about it, Caldigate. I won't go to him at all. What's he to us? It ain't likely that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him <b>for</b> money <b>to</b> hold our tongues. Not a bit of it. You've had sixty {{thousand}} pounds out of that mine. The bank found twenty and took all the plant. There's forty gone. Will you share the loss? Give us twenty and we'll be off back to Australia by the first ship. And I'll take a wife back with me. You understand? I'll take a wife back with me. Then we shall be all square all round.' ...|$|R

"Dear Lanyon,--You {{are one of}} {{my oldest}} friends; and {{although}} we may have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at least on my side, any break in our affection.

Lanyon my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night, I am lost.
