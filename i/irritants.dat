5|$|Pulpitis (inflammation of the pulp) can be {{triggered}} by various stimuli (insults), including mechanical, thermal, chemical, and bacterial <b>irritants,</b> or rarely barometric changes and ionizing radiation. Common causes include tooth decay, dental trauma (such as a crack or fracture), or a filling with an imperfect seal.|$|E
5|$|As field dogs {{they are}} prone to minor {{injuries}} such as cuts and sprains, and, if inactive, obesity is a common problem as they will eat whenever food is available and rely on their owners to regulate their weight. When working or running free they {{are also likely to}} pick up parasites such as fleas, ticks, harvest mites, and tapeworms, and <b>irritants</b> such as grass seeds can become trapped in their eyes, soft ears, or paws.|$|E
2500|$|Capsaicin is {{a strong}} <b>irritant</b> {{requiring}} proper protective goggles, respirators, and proper hazardous material-handling procedures.

5|$|Germanium is {{not thought}} to be an {{essential}} element for any living organism. Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral toxicity. However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are nephrotoxic, and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with halogens and hydrogen are <b>irritants</b> and toxins.|$|E
5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these <b>irritants</b> causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.|$|E
5|$|Several {{barriers}} protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical, {{and biological}} barriers. The waxy cuticle of most leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin {{are examples of}} mechanical barriers that are {{the first line of}} defense against infection. However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs, intestines, and the genitourinary tract. In the lungs, coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other <b>irritants</b> from the respiratory tract. The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.|$|E

40|$|<b>Irritant</b> contact {{dermatitis}} {{is a result}} of activated innate immune response to various external stimuli and consists of complex interplay which involves skin barrier disruption, cellular changes, and release of proinflammatory mediators. In this review, we will focus on key cytokines and chemokines involved in the pathogenesis of <b>irritant</b> {{contact dermatitis}} and also contrast the differences between allergic contact dermatitis and <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis...|$|R

5|$|Some frogs, such as {{the poison}} dart frogs, are {{especially}} toxic. The native peoples of South America extract poison from these frogs to apply to their weapons for hunting, although few species are toxic enough {{to be used for}} this purpose. At least two non-poisonous frog species in tropical America (Eleutherodactylus gaigei and Lithodytes lineatus) mimic the colouration of dart poison frogs for self-protection. Some frogs obtain poisons from the ants and other arthropods they eat. Others, {{such as the}} Australian corroboree frogs (Pseudophryne corroboree and Pseudophryne pengilleyi), can synthesize the alkaloids themselves. The chemicals involved may be <b>irritants,</b> hallucinogens, convulsants, nerve poisons or vasoconstrictors. Many predators of frogs have become adapted to tolerate high levels of these poisons, but other creatures, including humans who handle the frogs, may be severely affected.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled <b>irritants.</b> Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{cytology}} in {{the diagnosis}} and differentiation of contact dermatitis of two mojor types-allergic and <b>irritant</b> is evaluated. Study in 10 cases of allergic contact dermatitis and 5 cases of <b>irritant</b> dermatitis revealed that lymphocytes were the predominant cells in cytologic smears in the allergic contact dermatitis.

40|$|Wood dust is an <b>irritant</b> {{substance}} {{and if it}} directly contact with the skin for a long time, it can cause workers exposed {{to the risk of}} <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the relationship between <b>irritant</b> substances exposure with <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis to sanding workers in PT X Jepara. The type and design of this study was an observational study using cross sectional approach. The instruments of this research are clinical examination by medical personnel, Personal Dust Sampler, questionnaires and observation. The population which used in this study were 139 with a sample of 60 sanding workers. The sampling technique that was use is proportionate stratified random sampling, and the data were analyzed using Chi Square test. The measurement results of respirable wood dust level showed the wood dust level exceed the Threshold Limit Value (TLV), which is 5 mg/m 3. The result of this study indicates there are 21, 7 % of workers who had <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis. Based on correlation test, researcher concluded that age is not associated with iritant contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 368), there is no correlation between years of service with the occurrence of <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 182), there is no correlation between personal hygiene with the occurrence of <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 689), and wood dust exposure is associated with iritant contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 005). Researcher suggested that workers need to wash their hands before and after working with hand soap, and the company need to educate workers the effect of wood dust exposure related to the occurrence of <b>irritant</b> contact dermatitis...|$|R
