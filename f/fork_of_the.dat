5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East <b>Fork</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing {{of this can be}} observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking a portion of the East <b>Fork</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, settler Galen Clark {{discovered}} the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia at Wawona, an indigenous encampment {{in what is}} now the southwestern part of the park.

50|$|Elkhorn Creek is an 18.3 mi stream {{running through}} several {{counties}} in central Kentucky in the United States. The stream drains {{an area of}} 499.5 sq mi. It derives {{its name from the}} shape, as seen on a map, of its main stem with its two primary forks. North Elkhorn Creek starts just east of Lexington and flows 75.4 mi through Fayette and Scott counties, and into Franklin County, where it meets the South Elkhorn at <b>the</b> <b>Forks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elkhorn east <b>of</b> Frankfort. South Elkhorn Creek begins in Fayette County, and flows 52.8 mi through Woodford, Scott and Franklin counties to reach <b>the</b> <b>Forks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elkhorn. South Elkhorn Creek defines the boundary between Scott and Woodford counties. Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Forks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elkhorn, the confluent waters flow north and empty into the Kentucky River north of Frankfort.|$|R
5|$|Considerable damage {{occurred}} as the tornado moved through Cordova. Buildings in downtown {{had already been}} damaged by an EF3 tornado earlier that morning and received further damage from this tornado. East of Cordova, the tornado crossed the Mulberry <b>Fork</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Warrior River three times (along with the Sipsey Fork once, just north of its confluence with the Mulberry Fork). It intensified further into a violent EF4 in northeastern Walker County, as it completely leveled a site-built home and obliterated two nearby mobile homes. South of Sipsey, additional homes and mobile homes were destroyed at EF2 to EF3 strength.|$|E
5|$|Flooding was worst {{along the}} Cheat River, where {{five of the}} six gauging {{stations}} set new discharge records.

At Rowlesburg, the Cheat River crested at , which remains the highest on record as of 2013. At Hendricks, the Dry <b>Fork</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cheat River had a peak flow of , more than twice the previous record.|$|E

5|$|Lincolnshire {{lies in a}} {{floodplain}} region, {{a consequence}} of the presence of the Des Plaines River and the proximity a <b>fork</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chicago River on the far east border. A third factor involves small Indian Creek, which runs north of Lincolnshire. The village participates in the National Flood Insurance Program, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) project, to alleviate a portion of the costs of flood damage that may overtax affected village residents. The village also implements the Community Rating System, a disaster readiness plan.|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the western}} banks of the north-flowing Red River of the North, in a flat region known as the Red River Valley, the city is prone to flooding. The Red River Flood of 1997 devastated the city. Originally called Les Grandes Fourches by French fur traders from Canada, who had long worked and lived in the region, {{steamboat}} captain Alexander Griggs platted a community after being forced to winter there. The Grand Forks post office was established in 1870; and the town was incorporated on February 22, 1881. The city was named for its location at the <b>fork</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red River and the Red Lake River.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals are {{associated}} with C.australis in healthy ecosystems. The most common epiphytes are ferns, astelias and orchids. Old trees often carry large clumps of the climbing fern Asplenium, and in moist places, filmy ferns and kidney ferns cling to the branches. Astelia species and Collospermum often establish in the main <b>fork</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, and one tree can host several species of native orchid. Other common epiphytes include Griselinia lucida, {{as well as a}} range of mosses, liverworts, lichens and fungi. Two fungus species which infect living tissue—Phanaerochaeta cordylines and Sphaeropsis cordylines—occur almost exclusively on C.australis.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1921, {{the upper}} Colorado River above the {{confluence}} with the Green River in Utah had assumed various names. Fathers Dominguez and Escalante named it Rio San Rafael in 1776. Through the mid-1800s, the river between Green River and the Gunnison River was most {{commonly known as}} the Grand River. The river above the junction with the Gunnison River, however, was known variously as the Bunkara River, the North <b>Fork</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand River, the Blue River, and the Grand River. The latter name did not become consistently applied until the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau slowly raised these {{formations}} {{much higher}} than where they were deposited. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the plateau.
