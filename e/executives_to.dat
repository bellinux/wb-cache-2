In 1993, his third wife Marjorie was part of a group that met with MLB <b>executives</b> <b>to</b> discuss race relations in baseball after allegations of racial slurs surfaced against Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott.

5|$|By {{incorporating}} R infused beats in {{the music}} and not including her image on the cover artwork, marketing for the song {{gave the impression of}} Madonna as a black artist. That impression did not last long as Madonna would later convince Sire <b>executives</b> <b>to</b> shoot a music video for the song. The low-budget video directed by Ed Steinberg showed Madonna and her friends in a club singing and dancing to the song. The video helped to further promote the song and Madonna as an artist.|$|E
5|$|Glimcher {{purchased}} the film {{rights to the}} novel in 1988, before hiring Cynthia Cidre to write the screenplay. Various studios rejected the film, and after an unsuccessful pre-production development at Universal Pictures, the project moved to Warner Bros., with Regency Enterprises and Le Studio Canal+ agreeing to co-finance the film. When Warner Bros. wanted Jeremy Irons and Ray Liotta in the lead roles, Glimcher had to convince <b>executives</b> <b>to</b> cast Assante and Banderas instead. Filming took place in Los Angeles, on sets recreating 1950s New York.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008 Juniper's first CEO, Scott Kriens, became {{chairman}} and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO.

Juniper also hired other former Microsoft <b>executives</b> <b>to</b> focus on the company's software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system. Juniper established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts.

The first album to contain vocals, That Healin' Feelin' (1970), was commercially unsuccessful and Silver had to insist on the support of Blue Note <b>executives</b> <b>to</b> continue releasing music of the same, new style. They agreed to a further two albums that contained vocals and Silver on an RMI electric keyboard; the three were later compiled as The United States of Mind, but were soon dropped from the catalog.|$|E
5|$|The film's budget {{climbed from}} an initial US$150 {{million to a}} then-record-breaking $207 million, making it {{at one point the}} most {{expensive}} film yet made. Universal only agreed to such an outlay after seeing a screening of the unfinished film, to which executives responded enthusiastically. Marketing and promotion costs were an estimated $60 million. The film's length also grew; originally set to be 135 minutes, it soon grew to 200, prompting Universal <b>executives</b> <b>to</b> fly to New Zealand to view a rough cut, but they liked it so their concerns were addressed.|$|E
5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other <b>executives</b> <b>to</b> {{go ahead with}} the Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line {{on the north side of}} the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, {{while writing}} for Carol, MacFarlane planned {{to develop the}} Larry shorts into a short film series for MADtv; however, the project was {{abandoned}} because the show did not possess a large enough budget to make any kind of animation. As development continued, the genre gradually shifted to a prime-time series, while the characters of Larry and Steve {{formed the basis for}} Peter and Brian, respectively. During the year, a Hanna-Barbera development executive introduced MacFarlane to alternative comedians Mike Darnell and Leslie Collins in an attempt to get Hanna-Barbera back into the prime-time business. The executives were unimpressed; a year later, MacFarlane contacted Collins at Fox; she arranged a meeting with him and the company <b>executives</b> <b>to</b> create a series based on the characters entitled Family Guy.|$|E
5|$|Legend of Mana was {{designed}} as a 2D game, despite the PlayStation's 3D-focus, as the console could not handle the full 3D world Ishii envisioned where one could interact with natural shaped objects. Kawazu initially let Ishii have a relaxed schedule and budget, as Ishii had a great number of ideas he wanted in the game, but when the project began to get out of control and out of time Kawazu tightened down the rest of the development schedule and convinced the Square <b>executives</b> <b>to</b> delay the game by two months—even though it had already been announced to the public—to allow it to be completed as Ishii envisioned. Kawazu has said that this experience taught him that his true skill in game development lay in working as a producer.|$|E
5|$|The Hollywood Reporter ran {{a front-page}} story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's {{practice}} of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs {{that could be done}} by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios to force RKO to shelve Kane. Many of those immigrants had fled Europe after the rise of fascism and feared losing the safe haven of the United States. Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by Nicholas Schenck, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's parent company, with an offer on the behalf of Louis B. Mayer and other Hollywood <b>executives</b> <b>to</b> RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative. Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that Kane would be released as scheduled, and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers. There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made. Welles agreed and cut the running time from 122 minutes to 119 minutes. The cuts satisfied the corporate lawyers.|$|E

5|$|The final {{incident}} occurred in 1998, when Alfonso Soriano {{was unable to}} leave the Hiroshima Toyo Carp due to contract restrictions. Soriano disliked the intense Japanese practice schedule, and the Carp denied him a salary increase from $45,000 (the league's minimum) to $180,000 per year. Like Nomo and Irabu, Soriano hired Nomura to help his situation. After first attempting to void Soriano's NPB contract by unsuccessfully arguing that the player was legally a minor when he signed it Nomura advised him, like Nomo, to retire from NPB and pursue a career in MLB. This prompted Carp <b>executives</b> <b>to</b> file an injunction against Soriano and send letters to MLB teams demanding that they cease all negotiations with him. NPB officials claimed that after the Nomo case they had privately amended the Player Contract to give NPB teams the right to prohibit a player from signing a new contract anywhere after voluntarily retiring. Since MLB officials were not consulted {{and they did not}} agree to any changes, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig declared that MLB would recognize Soriano as a free agent on July 13, 1998, and the Carp backed down. He signed a 5-year, $3.1million contract with the New York Yankees the same year.|$|E
5|$|Stewie rams a toy {{spaceship}} into Peter's ear, annoying him, so Peter throws Rupert {{into the}} basement. Stewie follows the bear, discovering an old television script that Brian wrote entitled What I Learned on Jefferson Street. Stewie tosses the script onto the kitchen table, prompting Lois to question {{what it is}} about. Brian suggests she read it and tell him what she thinks. Lois {{falls in love with}} it, and suggests he meet with network executives about producing the show. When Brian pitches it to CBS, the executives respond positively. While the initial casting session goes well, with Elijah Wood auditioning for the lead, the producers assigned by the executives also bring in James Woods, who performs the role in a more comedic fashion, winning over the executives. Brian's serious drama is turned into a sitcom, bringing in a live studio audience as well as a chimpanzee, and renaming it Class Holes. When Brian objects to the changes, the producers remind him of what he had tried to achieve for many years—his own television show—and threaten him with unemployment if he objects to those changes. Disappointed that Brian allowed the <b>executives</b> <b>to</b> change his show so dramatically, Lois demands that he stand up for himself and object to everything James Woods changed about the show. The producers, however, do not take kindly to Brian's desire to start over, so Brian quits in frustration. Brian reveals his disappointment that he no longer has his own television show, but Lois convinces him that it is his integrity that matters. Peter interrupts, with his own show appearing on the screen, entitled Bigger Jaws.|$|E
