In the most simple context, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. The two most common forms of filing cabinets are vertical files and lateral files. A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15 inches) of the cabinet. A lateral file cabinet has drawers that extend from the long side (various lengths) of the cabinet. These are also called side filers in Great Britain. There are also <b>shelf</b> <b>files,</b> which go on shelves.

The contribution of this research to literature and knowledge is that e-government has been able to reduce the environmental impact of papers, save cost, boost productivity, make information sharing easier, and generally help the environment...|$|R
