5|$|From Springville {{north to}} Salt Lake City, US-89 parallels—and for a {{distance}} overlaps—Interstate 15, following the old Arrowhead Trail, once {{the main highway}} from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, {{through a number of}} downtowns. Numerous state highways connect US-89 to I-15, including SR-77 in Springville, SR-114 in Provo, SR-52 in Orem, SR-180 and SR-145 in American Fork, and SR-73 in Lehi. In Provo, US-89 meets US-189, its only branch, which heads northeast through Provo Canyon to Heber City, connecting to I-80 and bypassing Salt Lake City. North of Lehi, US-89 merges with I-15 (at exit 282), which has been built on or near the old road through a gap in the Traverse Mountains (elevation 4800 feet/1500 m) into the Salt Lake Valley. The routes split in Draper, formerly with a direct interchange north of SR-71, but US-89 traffic must now exit at SR-71 (exit 291), turn east to Factory Outlet Drive, and follow this frontage road to the location of the former split. From <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to downtown Salt Lake City, US-89 is marked along State Street, a major northsouth street that ends at the Utah State Capitol. After passing through Sandy, Midvale, Murray, Millcreek Township, and South Salt Lake, State Street enters Salt Lake City at the intersection with SR-201 (2100 South).|$|E

25|$|Wherein it {{concerns}} states and rulers, Plato has made interesting arguments. For instance he asks which is better—a bad democracy or a country reigned by a tyrant. He {{argues that it}} is better to be ruled by a bad tyrant, than by a bad democracy (since <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> people are now responsible for such actions, rather than one individual committing many bad deeds.) This is emphasised within the Republic as Plato describes the event of mutiny on board a ship. Plato suggests the ship's crew to be in line with the democratic rule of many and the captain, although inhibited through ailments, the tyrant. Plato's description of this event is parallel to that of democracy within the state and the inherent problems that arise.|$|E
25|$|Modern mayflies have {{eliminated}} all the instars between imago and nymph, except the single instar called subimago, {{which is still}} not (at {{least not in the}} males) fully sexually mature. The other flying insects with incomplete metamorphosis (Exopterygota) have gone a little further and completed the trend; <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> immature structures of the animal from the last nymphal stage are completed at once in a single final moult. The more advanced insects with larvae and complete metamorphosis (Endopterygota) have gone even further. An interesting theory here is that the pupal stage is actually a strongly modified and extended stage of subimago, but so far it {{is nothing more than a}} theory. Interestingly enough there are some insects within the Exopterygota, thrips and whiteflies (Aleyrodidae), who have evolved pupae-like stages too.|$|E
500|$|Reger {{completed}} {{the composition of}} the psalm in May to August 1909. The work was published by Peters in Leipzig, first the vocal score with piano in September 1909, with the piano reduction prepared by Reger himself. The score and the parts appeared in December that year. The complete work was premiered simultaneously on 23 February 1910 in both Chemnitz and Breslau. In Chemnitz, Reger conducted the church choir of St. Lukas and the municipal orchestra (Städtische Kapelle), with Georg Stolz at the organ. In Breslau, [...] conducted the Sing-Akademie and the Orchester-Verein, with organist Max Ansorge. A reviewer wrote in the journal NMZ: [...] "" [...] (Still under the impression of what we heard and experienced, it is unspeakably difficult for me to express <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> deeply experienced, the sublime and divine of that hour.

2500|$|The matter {{composing}} the new {{hour was}} drawn {{from the office of}} Lauds; or rather Prime, as an office, was a repetition of part of Lauds, and added nothing to the ensemble of the psalmody, only Psalms 1, 57 (58), and 89 (90), which were formerly part of Lauds, were recited at this hour. Such at least was the original composition of Prime; but the monasteries which gradually adopted it in the East and in the West changed its constitution as they liked. It is impossible to describe <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> variations this office underwent in the different liturgies. We need only remark {{that one of the most}} characteristic features of Prime is the recitation of the famous symbol [...] "Quicumque vult salvus esse", called the Athanasian Creed, which has recently been the subject of much controversy in the Anglican Church. St. Benedict orders to be recited at Prime on Sundays four groups of eight verses of Ps. 118 (119); on week-days, three psalms, beginning with the first and continuing to Ps. 19 (20), taking three psalms each day (Ps. 9 (10) and 17 (18) being divided into two). In that way Prime is symmetrical, like the other Little Hours of the day. It resembles these also in composition, the psalmody being accompanied by a hymn, an antiphon, capitulum, versicle, and prayer. In the Roman Liturgy the office of Prime is not composed so symmetrically. Usually it consists of Ps. 53 (54), 107 (108), the first four groups of eight verses of Ps. 118 (119), and during the week Pss. 53 (54), 23 (24), 25 (26), 24 (25), 22 (23), and 21 (22). The capitulum and other elements are after the model of the Little Hours (cf. None). In the Anglican Church, the Office of Prime was lost in the publication of the Book of Common Prayer; however, the 1928 version of the Book of Common Prayer (which was accepted by the Church, but rejected by Parliament) restored Prime, with the instruction that it must be used in addition to (not instead of) Matins, and with the option of reciting the Athanasian Creed.|$|E
