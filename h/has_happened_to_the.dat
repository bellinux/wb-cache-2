5|$|At the {{appointed}} hour, Duchess appears at Ribby's {{door and the}} party begins. Distracted for a moment, Duchess does not see which oven Ribby opens to remove the pie. Duchess eats greedily, believing she is eating her ham and veal pie. She wonders what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patty-pan she put in her pie, and, not finding it under the crust, is convinced she has swallowed it. She sets up a howl; Ribby is perplexed and annoyed but leaves to find Dr. Maggoty, a magpie.|$|E
5|$|Arianna {{refuses to}} talk to anyone, however, so Layton and Luke {{continue}} to question the townspeople while Emmy goes to the Scotland Yard for information regarding Evan Barde's death. With the aid of Inspectors Chelmey and Grosky, she uncovers the records for the case before heading back to Misthallery to reunite with Layton and Luke. Inspector Grosky returns with her, hoping that his own influence will help convince the town's Chief of Police, Chief Jakes, to provide further information on the case. Regardless, Chief Jakes remains adamantly opposed to the investigation of Barde's death, and demands that Layton and company leave the town within 24 hours. Despite Jakes' threats, they visit Arianna {{to explain to her}} what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town and to her father. Arianna opens up to them, and proceeds to guide them to the nearby lake before playing the Specter's Flute, which causes a prehistoric aquatic creature named Loosha to rise from the lake.|$|E
5|$|Lexie's death devastates Meredith, who {{is still}} desperately trying to find her husband. Eventually, she and Shepherd reunite and they fix his hand as best as they can. Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware of what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other doctors. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents, which Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) are dreading. Avery makes the choice {{to take a job}} offer at Tulane Medical Center, and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his {{surgical}} internship in Los Angeles. After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died. As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to Boise. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out. In the closing monologue, Meredith repeats the opening to the speech that Webber gave in the pilot episode of the series.|$|E

25|$|The {{medical history}} is a {{longitudinal}} record of what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks. It gives the clinician a feel for what has happened before to the patient. As a result, it may often give clues to current disease state. It includes several subsets detailed below.|$|E
25|$|Set as {{a sequel}} to John Carpenter's 1982 film of the same name, the story focuses on Captain Blake, {{a member of a}} U.S. Special Forces team sent to the Antarctic outpost {{featured}} in the film to determine what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> research team. The game was endorsed by John Carpenter, who voices a character in an uncredited cameo.|$|E
25|$|On September 24, 2010, Jeff Zucker {{announced}} that he would step down as NBC Universal's CEO once the company's merger with Comcast was completed {{at the end of the}} year. After the deal was finalized, Steve Burke was named CEO of NBCUniversal and Robert Greenblatt replaced Jeff Gaspin as chairman of NBC Entertainment. In 2011, NBC was finally able to find a breakout hit in the midseason reality singing competition series The Voice. Otherwise, NBC had another tough season, with every single new fall program getting cancelled by season's end - the third time this <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> network after the fall of 1975, and the fall of 1983 - and the midseason legal drama Harry's Law being its only freshman scripted series to be renewed for the 2011–12 season. The network nearly completed its full conversion to an all-HD schedule (outside of the Saturday morning time slot leased by the Qubo consortium, which NBCUniversal would rescind its stake in the following year) on September 20, 2011, when Last Call with Carson Daly converted to the format with the premiere of its 11th season.|$|E
60|$|To Bert {{it was no}} {{more than}} the end of a series of disagreeable sensations.

For a long time he lay waiting apprehensively for the {{pitching}} and tossing and his qualms to return, and so, lying, boxed up in the locker, he presently fell asleep.|$|R

"One must note {{in passing}} that Amin al-Husseini's memoirs are an {{antidote}} against Holocaust denial: He {{knew that the}} genocide took place and boasted of having been perfectly aware of it from 1943 on.

2500|$|The next morning, in Demarion's house, {{he learns}} Demarion {{discovered}} a cave beneath the lighthouse, {{in which he}} heard [...] "a pulse, like the devil's heartbeat," [...] and saw light patterns appear on the walls. Later that night, Demarion tells Parker the island is called Fetch Rock, and the lighthouse {{has a reputation for}} being haunted. He also explains that several hours previously, a ship passed by the lighthouse and found it in darkness. Demarion is afraid something <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> three lighthouse keepers (Oliver Drake, Robert Shaw and James Woolfe), and asks Parker to go there to investigate.|$|E
2500|$|Picasso {{began the}} {{painting}} on 11 May 1937, {{working on a}} piece of unbleached muslin (349 cm x 776 cm). Since the work was so large, Picasso had to use a ladder and a long-handled brush to reach the furthest corners of the canvas. He spent over two months creating Guernica. He used only black and white paint to invoke the truth-telling authority of documentary photography. Yet his Cubist use of fragmented imagery makes his a poetic commentary, rather than strident propaganda. [...] "The protest is found in what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bodies, the hands, the soles of the feet, the horse's tongue, the mother's breasts, the eyes in the head—the imaginative equivalent of what happened to them in the flesh. We are made to feel their pain with our own eyes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Sonnet 25, for instance, a Marlovian {{interpretation}} would {{note that}} something unforeseen ("unlooked for") <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poet, which will deny him {{the chance to}} boast of [...] "public honour and proud titles", and {{which seems to have}} led to some enforced travel far away, possibly even overseas (26–28, 34, 50–51, 61). They would note that this going away seems to be a one-off event (48), and whatever it was, it is clearly also associated with his being [...] "in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes", his [...] "outcast state" [...] (29), and his [...] "blots" [...] and [...] "bewailed guilt" [...] (36). The poet also says that he has been [...] "made lame by fortune's dearest spite" [...] (37). Each one of these segments, along with many other throughout the Sonnets, might be seen by a Marlovian as reflecting some aspect of Marlowe's alleged faked death and subsequent life.|$|E
