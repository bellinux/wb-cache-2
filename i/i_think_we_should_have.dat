500|$|Though DeLonge {{hoped to}} retain the angst present in the band's past work, he wanted to [...] "deliver it in a package that's very modern, using {{instrumentations}} and formulas to launch you into different places with music that is not just three-chord pop-punk with riffs." [...] He later felt the album was not progressive as he had wished: [...] "I'm thinking, 'Why don't we do this? Why don't we create these landscapes?' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been pushing ourselves, and trying to push the genre forward." [...] Likewise, Barker felt DeLonge wanted their music to be derivative of groups such as U2 or Coldplay, commenting, [...] "For us, we were always like 'Blink is Blink, man. We want to sound like fucking Blink-182.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{urgency of}} {{negotiating}} a concession {{was made clear}} to Rhodes {{during a visit to}} London in June 1888, when he learned of the London syndicate's letter to Knutsford, and of their appointment of Maund. Rhodes now understood that the Matabeleland concession could still go elsewhere if he did not secure the document quickly. [...] "Someone has to get the country, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> the best chance," [...] Rhodes told Rothschild; [...] "I have always been afraid of the difficulty of dealing with the Matabele king. He is the only block to central Africa, as, once we have his territory, the rest is easy... the rest is simply a village system with separate headmen... I have faith in the country, and Africa is on the move. I think it is a second Cinderella." ...|$|E
500|$|November's {{first game}} {{was at the}} Mata Real against Paços de Ferreira. Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game {{a few minutes later}} for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I think we are on the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. For what we did in this competition <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> had more of a chance to go through, so for me football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|E

We were little kids." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2015, Eno {{endorsed}} Jeremy Corbyn's {{campaign in}} the Labour Party leadership election. He said: [...] "I don't think electability really {{is the most important}} thing. What's important is that someone changes the conversation and moves us off this small-minded agenda." [...] He wrote in The Guardian: [...] "By gathering this level of support Jeremy Corbyn has already shown that there is a strong nascent progressive movement in this country. He's shown the others in his party that there's a well of commitment for them to tap, if they have the will and the courage to do it. If nothing further happens with his campaign, that would be an undeniable and valuable contribution. I admit it: PM Corbyn is a long shot right now – but only four weeks ago bookies were giving 100-1 against him even becoming the candidate. Now it's 7-4 on. Things can change, and quickly. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> some faith and give it a try." ...|$|E

Their chief dependence, certainly, is on our national dissensions; but as this would probably fail them, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> seen some pretence for an invasion.
