50|$|The {{simplest}} actuator {{is purely}} mechanical, where linear motion {{in one direction}} gives rise to rotation.

40|$|In the new civil aircrafts, {{hydraulic}} {{flight control}} systems are {{being replaced by}} <b>electrically</b> <b>powered</b> controls. The main interests are a better flexibility {{and a decrease in}} maintenance costs. Though the electrical wiring will replace the hydraulic tubing, it is essential to limit as much as possible the amount of electrical wiring. In order to decrease the total wires length, it is proposed to use power line communications (PLC) technology for data transmission over a high voltage direct current (HVDC) network for flight control system (FCS). However, PLC for safety-critical avionic systems are rarely studied. This paper is the first step of a PLC physical layer development for aircraft FCS. In this paper, a parametric study for an OFDM PLC transmission between the control unit and the <b>electrically</b> <b>powered</b> <b>actuators</b> for FCS is developed. This study takes into account the channel characteristics, the electromagnetic compatibility, the hardware and the aeronautical constraints. The purpose is to define the frequency transmission bandwidth, the number of subcarriers and the maximum constellation size for the OFDM transmission...|$|R
40|$|This project {{addresses}} the actuation system architecture of future All-electric aircraft (AEA) with <b>electrically</b> <b>powered</b> <b>actuators</b> (EPA). Firstly, the information of EPAs is reviewed, {{and then an}} electro-hydrostatic actuator (EHA) and electro-mechanical actuator (EMA) are selected for further system research. The actuation system architecture of Boeing and Airbus is then presented as a conventional design where the new design concepts are also researched and the distributed architecture was proposed as another design trend. To find out which one is better, {{both of them are}} selected for further research. The easily available data makes the Flying Crane a better choice for the case study. Stall load, maximum rate and power are the main elements for electric <b>actuator</b> requirements and <b>power</b> consumption, weight, cost and safety are the most important aspects for civil aircraft actuation systems. The conventional and distributed flight actuation system design considered the redundancy of systems and actuators, and also the relationship of the power, control channel and actuator work mode. But only primary flight actuation control system specifications are calculated since this data has better precision and also the limited time has to be taken into consideration. Brief comparisons of the two system specifications demonstrate that the higher <b>power</b> <b>actuator</b> have has higher efficiency and distributed actuators could reduce the system weight through reduce the system redundancy with a power efficiency decline. The <b>electrically</b> <b>powered</b> actuation system for future aircraft design is a balance between actuator number, system weight and power consumption...|$|R
50|$|It {{features}} a fly-by-wire {{flight control system}} with sidestick controllers and flight envelope protection. Like other Airbus aircraft, the A400M has a full glass cockpit. Most of the aircraft systems are loosely based on those of the A380, but modified for the military mission. The hydraulic system has dual 3,000-psi channels powering the primary and secondary flight-control actuators, landing gear, wheel brakes, cargo door and optional hose-and-drogue refueling system. As with the A380, there is no third hydraulic system. Instead, there are two electrical systems; one is a set of dual-channel <b>electrically</b> <b>powered</b> hydraulic <b>actuators,</b> the other an array of electrically/hydraulically <b>powered</b> hybrid <b>actuators.</b> The dissimilar redundancy provides more protection against battle damage.|$|R
40|$|Functional brain {{exploration}} methodologies such as functional {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) are critical tools to study perceptual and cognitive processes. In order to develop complex and well-controlled fMRI paradigms, researchers are interested in using active interfaces with <b>electrically</b> <b>powered</b> <b>actuators</b> and sensors. Due to the particularity or the MR environment, safety and compatibility criteria have to be strictly followed to avoid risks to the subject under test, the operators or the environment, as well as to prevent artifacts in the images. This paper describes the design of an fMRI compatible mechatronic interface based on MR compatibility tests of materials and actuators. In particular, a statistical test is introduced to evaluate the presence of artifacts in the image sequences that could negatively affect the fMRI studies. The device with two degrees of freedom, allowing one translation with position-feedback along a horizontal axis and one rotation about a vertical axis linked to the translation, was realized to investigate the brain mechanisms of dynamic tactile perception tasks. It can be used to move and orient various objects below the finger for controlled tactile stimulation. The MR compatibility of the complete interface is shown using the statistical test as well as a functional study with a human subject...|$|R
50|$|Researchers of AlliedSignal {{initially}} {{demonstrated the}} possibility of <b>electrically</b> <b>powered</b> <b>actuators</b> fabricated by carbon nanotube sheets. They taped carbon nanotube sheets on two sides of a double sided scotch tape and applied potential on the nanotube sheets in a NaCl electrolyte solution. Nanotube sheets are used as electrolyte-filled electrodes of a super capacitor. Nanotube sheets are electrically charged by the double layer formation at the nanotube-electrolyte interface without any need of ion intercalation. Therefore, electrically driven actuators of nanotube sheets are superior to the conjugated polymer actuators which involve solid-state dopant diffusion and structural changes limiting rate, cycle life and energy conversion efficiencies. On the other hand, ferroelectric and electrostrictive materials are also very useful for direct energy conversion, but they require high operation voltages and ambient temperature of a limited range. Nanotube sheet actuators were shown to operate at low voltages (~1 Volts or less) and provide higher work densities per cycle than other alternative technologies. Later Baughman et al. showed that actuator response can be observed up to switching rates of 1 kHz and cycling the nanotube actuator at constant rate of 1 Hz for 140000 cycles decreases the stroke by ~33%. 0.75 MPa of stress were measured on the nanotube sheet actuators, which {{is greater than the}} maximum stress (0.3 MPa) that can be loaded on a human muscle.|$|R
