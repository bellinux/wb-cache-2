2500|$|Run-out is {{measured}} using {{a dial indicator}} on a fixed rigid base, with the tip perpendicular to the brake disc's face. It is typically measured about [...] from the outside diameter of the disc. The disc is spun. The difference between minimum and maximum value on the dial is called lateral run-out. Typical hub/disc assembly run-out specifications for passenger vehicles are around [...] Runout can be caused either by deformation of the disc itself or by runout in the underlying wheel hub face or by contamination between the disc surface and the underlying hub mounting surface. Determining {{the root cause of}} the indicator displacement (lateral runout) requires disassembly of the disc from the hub. Disc <b>face</b> <b>runout</b> due to hub <b>face</b> <b>runout</b> or contamination will typically have a period of 1 minimum and 1 maximum per revolution of the brake disc.|$|E
40|$|Steady-state {{and dynamic}} {{performance}} of a gas-lubricated, self-acting face seal was determined using numerical methods based on a variable grid, finite-difference, time-transient procedure. Results were obtained for a gas turbine main shaft seal operating at 206. 9 newton per square centimeter (300 psi) sealed air pressure and 152. 4 meters per second (500 ft/sec) sliding velocity. Analysis of the seal dynamics revealed that {{the response of the}} seal nosepiece to runout of the seat face is markedly affected by secondary seal friction and by nosepiece inertia. The nosepiece response was determined for various levels of secondary seal friction and seat <b>face</b> <b>runout</b> magnitudes...|$|E
40|$|Self-acting seals are {{described}} in detail. The mathematical models for obtaining a seal force balance and the equilibrium operating film thickness are outlined. Particular attention is given to primary ring response (seal vibration) to rotating seat <b>face</b> <b>runout.</b> This response analysis reveals three different vibration models with secondary seal friction being an important parameter. Leakage flow inlet pressure drop and affects of axisymmetric sealing face deformations are discussed. Experimental data on self-acting face seals operating under simulated gas turbine conditions are given. Also a spiral groove seal design operated to 244 m/sec (800 ft/sec) is described...|$|E
5000|$|The four most {{commonly}} used workholding devices are the three-jaw chuck, the four-jaw chuck, the collet, and the faceplate. The three-jaw chuck is used to hold round or hex workpieces because the work is automatically centered. On these chucks the <b>runout</b> <b>faces</b> limitations; on late-model CNCs, it can be quite low if all conditions are excellent, but traditionally it is usually at least [...]001-.003 in (0.025-0.075 mm). The four-jaw chuck is used either to hold irregular shapes or to hold round or hex to extremely low runout (with time spent indicating and clamping each piece), in both cases because of its independent action on each jaw. The face plate is also used for irregular shapes. Collets combine self-centering chucking with low runout, but they involve higher costs.|$|R

Such parts as the workpiece material is soft, thin wall sleeve material, high precision, the rejection rate is relatively high in the actual production, the main reason is that the parts of high speed, large size, high precision, fixture design is not reasonable, precision caused by static part and dynamic accuracy after processing can not meet the cigarette equipment operation and cigarette process requirements...|$|R
40|$|Self-acting and {{hydrodynamic}} seals are described. The {{analytical procedures}} are outlined for obtaining a seal force balance and the operating film thickness. Particular attention {{is given to}} primary ring response (seal vibration) to rotating seat <b>face</b> <b>runout.</b> This response analysis revealed three different vibration modes. Proposed applications of self-acting seals in gas turbine engines and in rocket vehicle turbopumps are described. Also experimental data on self-acting face seals operating under simulated gas turbine conditions are given; these data show the feasibility of operating the seal at conditions of 345 newtons per square centimeter (500 psi) and 152 meters per second (500 ft/sec) sliding speed...|$|E
40|$|Machining {{processes}} are met with dimensional and geometrical variations in a product during machining operation. The {{amount of variation}} {{needs to be more}} strictly defined for accurately machined parts. Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) definition provides the precision required for allowing manufacturing of most economical parts. Crankshaft flange is required to be machined with higher degree of precision. If geometrical accuracies are not met the crankshaft-flywheel assembly will cause wear, unbalance and vibration, leading to poor functionality. The face of crankshaft flange is evaluated for geometric tolerances- flatness and runout. A two level three factor factorial model is designed and analyzed on Minitab 16 software to identify the most affecting machining parameter among speed, feed and depth of cut on face flatness and <b>face</b> <b>runout...</b>|$|E
