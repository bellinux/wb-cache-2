40|$|In this article, we {{will report}} an {{experimental}} evidence of enhanced LIBS emission upon replacing a Bulk-Based ZnO target by the corresponding Nano-Based target. The plasma was initiated via interaction of a Nd:YAG laser at the fundamental wavelength with both targets in open air {{under the same}} experimental conditions. The measurements show an enhanced emission from the Zn <b>I-lines</b> at the wavelengths of 328. 26, 330. 29, 334. 55, 468. 06, 472. 2, 481. 01, 636. 38 nm. The measurements were repeated at different delay times {{in the range from}} 1 to 5 μs at constant irradiation level and fixed gate time of 1 μs. The average enhancement over the different Zn <b>I-lines</b> was found increases exponentially up to 8 -fold with delay time. The electron density to each plasma was measured utilizing the Hα-line appeared in the emitted spectra from each plasma and was found to give similar values. The electron temperatures were measured via Boltzmann plot method utilizing the relative intensities of the Zn <b>I-lines</b> and were found to give very close values. Moreover, the relative population density of the ground state of the zinc atoms (relative concentration) was measured spectroscopically utilizing the Boltzmann plot method and was found to increase in a very similar trend to that of enhancement. The results of the spectroscopic analysis conclude that these signal enhancements {{can be attributed to the}} higher concentration of neutral atoms in the Nano-Based material plasma with respect to the corresponding Bulk-based ZnO material...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMicro-resonators (MR) {{have become}} a key element for {{integrated}} optical sensors due to their integration capability and their easy fabrication with low cost polymer materials. Nowadays, {{there is a growing}} need on MRs as highly sensitive and selective functions especially in the areas of food and health. The context of this work is to implement and study integrated micro-ring resonators devoted to sensing applications. They are fabricated by processing SU 8 polymer as core layer and PMATRIFE polymer as lower cladding layer. The refractive index of the polymers and of the waveguide structure {{as a function of the}} wavelength are presented. Using these results, a theoretical study of the coupling between ring and straight waveguides has been undertaken in order to define the MR design. Sub-micronic gaps of 0. 5 µm to 1 µm between the ring and the straight waveguides have been successfully achieved with UV (<b>i-lines)</b> photolithography. Different superstrates such as air, water and aqueous solutions with glucose at different concentrations have been studied. First results show a good normalized transmission contrast of 0. 98, a resonator quality factor around 1. 5 x 10 4 corresponding to a coupling ratio of 14. 7 % and ring propagation losses around 5 dB/cm. Preliminary sensing experiments have been performed for different concentrations of glucose; a sensitivity of 115 ± 8 nm/RIU at 1550 nm has been obtained with this couple of polymers...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} spectral model (NSM) {{that describes the}} equatorial oscillations in the zonal circulation, the Quasi-biennial Oscillations (QBO) and Semi-annual Oscillations (SAO). The oscillations are generated by the momentum deposition of small scale gravity waves (GW) described with the Doppler spread parameterization (DSP) of <b>I-lines.</b> We discuss here the GW mechanism {{and some of the}} conditions that are favorable for generating the QBO and SAG. Our model reproduces the salient features observed and leads to the following conclusions: (1) In 2 D, a QBO can be generated with a period of about 30 months, peak amplitude close to 20 m/s near 30 km, and downward propagation velocity of 1. 2 km/months, close to the observed values. The QBO phase reverses near 70 km and extends with significant amplitude into the upper mesosphere. (2) SAO amplitudes between 5 and 30 m/s are generated that peak at about 55 km with eastward phase during equinox. A second peak with opposite phase is produced above 70 km. (3) The computed oscillations depend on the rate of radiative cooling and on the chosen eddy viscosity that is tied in the DSP to the GW source but is uncertain to some degree. (4) GW filtering by the QBO at lower altitudes can account for the large variability in the SAO that is observed. The SAO in turn also affects the QBO, and under certain conditions the seasonal (semiannual) variations in the solar forcing can act as a pacemaker to seed and synchronize the QBO. (5) In a 3 D version of the model that computes also tides and planetary waves, the amplitudes of the SAG, and even the QBO, are significantly reduced compared to 2 D. The tides and planetary waves apparently absorb some of the GW momentum that otherwise in 2 D goes into the equatorial oscillations of the zonal circulation. (7) The QBO is also generated in 3 D with Kelvin and Rossby gravity waves that deposit momentum through nonlinear advection and radiative cooling. However, the wave amplitudes need to be carefully tuned in order to generate such an oscillation, in contrast to the GW mechanism which is robust. (C) 1999 COSPAR.

The panel uses a stacked bus system that protects the energized bus from accidental contact and the breaker can be easily installed using a flat blade screwdriver contacting only de-energized parts of the backplane of the panel. The design of the breakers and panel require that extra attention be paid to phase rotation, as the right (even-numbered) side of the panel will have the phases in a C-B-A configuration whereas the left (odd-numbered) side of the panel will have a more standard A-B-C arrangement.|$|E

Shortly after he began to work with glass, he won the Iittala competition in engraved glass and {{was hired by the}} company in 1951 (other sources mention the previous year) as a designer and director of exhibitions. He won his first Grand Prix at the 1954 Milan Triennale for his clear glass series, which also went to his already well-established colleague at Iittala, Tapio Wirkkala. In 1956, Sarpaneva embraced colored glass as he developed Iittala's new upscale i-linja (<b>i-line)</b> series of plates, bottles, and other objects. Radical for that time, his involvement extended to the design of the packaging and of Iittala's name with a prominent, white, lower-case letter i in a red circle as the new line's trademark, which the company then adopted as its universal logo through the 21st century. i-linja won him his second Grand Prix at the 1957 Milan Triennale, where he also received a Grand Prix for his design of the Finnish exhibition.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{waveguide}} cross-sectional {{shapes that}} deviate from rectangles or squares may cause significant loss of signal. In this study, a photolithography approach was adopted to fabricate waveguides on printed circuit boards, using photo-imageable polysiloxane as a waveguide material. The effects of <b>I-line</b> ultraviolet (UV) lamp exposure, 355 -nm Nd:YAG laser direct imaging, and 248 -nm excimer laser direct imaging on the cross-sectional shape of waveguides were investigated. For <b>I-line</b> UV lamp exposure, increasing the exposure time could cause {{changes in the}} tilt angle of the waveguides from negative (inverted trapezoid) to positive (trapezoid). To obtain rectangular waveguides, the optimum <b>I-line</b> UV lamp exposure time {{was found to be}} around 150 s. From the results for 355 -nm Nd:YAG laser direct imaging, the width and tilt angle of the waveguides varied with the energy density of the laser beam irradiating the core materials, being controlled by the repetition rate and focus. Lowering the laser energy density could produce waveguides with small widths and tilt angles. Excimer laser direct imaging at 248 nm was found to be unsuitable for waveguide patterning since the core materials could not be cured at this wavelength.

40|$|The {{inorganic}} {{antireflection coating}} (AR 3 -chromium oxide) commonly used on photomask blanks {{was designed to}} minimize flare in h-line (405 nm) lithography steppers. The reflection of light (flare) off this coating (air-photomask) increases with shorter exposure wavelengths. High levels of flare occur in 248 nm and 193 nm IC steppers due to reflections off of the photomask surface. The reflections (standing waves) in photomask resists also increase during exposure using lower wavelengths of light. Lithography simulations and photomask manufacturing trials have led to resist processes that can generate sub- 0. 30 micron resist features on photomasks with <b>I-line</b> optical pattern generators (ALTA 3500). Lower developer concentration, higher exposure doses and the minimization of standing waves by incorporating a post-exposure bake and / or organic antireflection coatings (ARC) maximizes resolution. High resolution photoresists show standing waves on photomasks fabricated with optical pattern generators. Low contrast resist processes show only small standing waves or in certain cases resist “footing. ” The use of organic antireflection coatings can minimize standing waves and allow the use of high contrast resist processes. ARCs reduce the swing ratio, which improves linewidth uniformity. ARCs also improve the adhesion of the resist to the photomask surface. Simulations reveal that the optimal ARC coating thickness is around 46 nm for typical <b>I-line</b> systems and around 50 nm for 257 nm non-chemically amplified photomask resists.

40|$|In the {{fabrication}} of microelectronic chips, microlithography {{is used to}} transfer a pattern of circuit geometry from mask to semiconductor wafer. An important step in this process is the deposition of a thin and uniform layer of photoresist (often called resist) on which the lithographic image is exposed. Typical photoresist layers are less than 1 gm thick with a variation of 5 A for advanced chips. Spin coating is the prevalent coating method to produce the required thickness and uniformity, but it typically wastes over 90 % of the photoresist applied.
