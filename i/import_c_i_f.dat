We employed monthly data of Turkey covering the years from 1996 : 01 to 2006 : 12 and forecasted the parameters by Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimation method. In order to find out whether there is a linear relationship among these series; we have checked each series whether are integrated at the same order or not. According to the ADF unit root test results, we have found that all the variables are integrated of order one, I(1), but shuttle trade. Besides we detected a case of multicollinearity among some of the expletory variables. Therefore we used first order autoregression model of shuttle trade. We have derived that, previous month's shuttle trade have positive impacts on the current level shuttle trade. We also used the same specification to indicate that the shuttle trade value increases in the months of fall and decreases in months of summer...|$|E

Twenty one patients were included in this study (16 men and 5 women, mean age 53, range 38 to 72). All treatments were maintained except loop diuretics.

40|$|In {{establishing}} {{the value of}} imports for tariff assessment, most countries apply duties either to the cost-insurance-freight (<b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.)</b> or the free-on-board (f. o. b.) value of the traded good. One effect of using the far more common <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.</b> base is to place a disproportinate burden on countries that have higher freight and insurance costs. Distant countries often not only pay higher transport costs, but are further penalized by disproportionate tariff costs that worsen their competitive disadvantage. The f. o. b. valuation procedure does not penalize exporters for their location, but applies a nominal tariff rate directly to the export costs of each country. Using cost information for six Latin American countries, this paper examines {{the influence of the}} two procedures on the level and incidence of tariff protection. It concludes that transport and insurance costs generally put developing countries at a disadvantage (compared to developed countries) on interregional trade and that the relatively high Latin American tariffs on <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.</b> prices further worsen their competitive position. To correct the bias against trade between developing countries, it is recommended that f. o. b. valuation procedures used by developed countries be adopted. This change would also reduce tariff barriers considerably.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{address the}} problem of visual recognition of non-rigid objects. I introduce the frame alignment approach to recognition and illustrate it in two types of non-rigid objects: contour textures and elongated flexible objects. Frame alignment is based on matching stored models to images and has three stages: first, a "frame curve" and a corresponding object are computed in the image. Second, the object is brought into correspondence with the model by aligning the model axis with the object axis; if the object is not rigid it is "unbent" achieving a canonical description for recognition. Finally, object and model are matched against each other. Rigid and elongated flexible objects are matched using all contour information. Contour textures are matched using filter outputs around the frame curve. The central contribution of this thesis is Curved Inertia Frames (<b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>F.),</b> a scheme for computing frame curves directly on the image. <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>F.</b> is the first algorithm which can c [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An object-based analysis-synthesis image {{sequence}} coder for transmission bit {{rates between}} 8 and 16 kbit/s is presented. Each moving object {{is described by}} three sets of parameters defining its shape, motion, and colour. Coding {{is based on the}} source model of flexible 2 -dimensional objects which move translationally in the image plane, as it has been used in an implementation for 64 kbit/s I S D N videophone by Hotter. In order to cut down the bit rate f rom 64 kbit/s to 8 kbit/s, Q <b>C</b> <b>I</b> <b>F</b> image resolution instead of <b>C</b> <b>I</b> <b>F</b> resolution is applied. Image analysis and coding of object parameters have been adapted to the reduced resolution and to the changed parameter statistics, respectively. I n addition to Hotter's coder, predictive coding is used for encoding polygons and splines to improve the coding efficiency of shapes. Vector quantization is applied instead of D C T for coding the luminance and chrominance parameters of the object textures. Uncovered background regions are encoded by applying adaptive prediction from either the neighbouring static background or a special background memory. Experi mental results, obtained by computer simulations, confirm that the presented coding algorithm is a promising scheme for the application at extremely low transmission bit rates. This is shown by comparing the picture qualities obtained with the presented algorithm and a block-based hybr id-DCT scheme corresponding to H. 261 /RM 8 at 11 kbit/s...|$|R

40|$|Because many {{developing}} countries fail to report trade statistics to the United Nations, {{there has been an}} interest in using partner-country data to fill these information gaps. The author used partner-country statistics for 30 developing countries to"estimate"actual (concealed) trade data and analyzed the magnitude of the resulting errors. The results indicate that partner-country data are unreliable even for estimating trade in broad aggregate product groups such as foodstuffs, fuels, or manufactures. Moreover, tests show that the reliability of partner-country statistics degenerates sharply as one moves to more finely distinguished trade categories (lower-level SITCs). Equally disturbing, about one-quarter of the partner-country comparisons take the wrong sign. That is, one country's reported free-on-board (f. o. b.) exports exceed the reported cost-insurance-freight (<b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.)</b> value of partners'imports. Aside from product composition, tests show that partner-country data are equally inaccurate for estimating the direction of trade. Why are partner-country data so unreliable for approximating"missing"data? Evidence shows: 1) problems in reporting or processing COMTRADE data; 2) valuation differences (f. o. b. versus <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.)</b> for <b>imports</b> and exports; 3) problems relating to entrepot trade, or exports originating in export processing zones; 4) problems associated with exchange-rate changes; 5) intentional or unintentional misclassification of products; 6) efforts to"conceal"trade data for proprietary reasons; and 7) financial incentives to purposely falsify trade data. The author concludes that efforts to improve the general quality, or availability, of trade statistics using partner-country data holds little or no promise, although this information may be useful in specific cases where the trade statistics of a certain country are known to incorporate major errors. Significant progress in ugrading the accuracy, and coverage, of trade statistics can be achieved only by improving each country's procedures for data collection.

The bacterium has to adhere to success and the aim of this study was to structurally characterize two different sialic acid dependent recognitions. The expression of binding specificities is dependent on growth conditions. Bacterial growth on solid media (agar plates) mediates expression of both specificities, while growth in liquid media (broth) mediates selective expression of recognition of polyglycosylceramides from human sources. A mixture of gangliosides isolated from human neutrophils was shown to contain the sialic acid binding epitope expressed only by solid grown bacteria. The recognized sequence was identified by a new approach of relating structural analysis and binding activity in mixtures of gangliosides. The ganglioside mixture was separated on TLC and blotted to membranes. The composition and saccharide sequence of up to seven-sugar gangliosides were obtained by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry after direct desorption from the membrane. The sialic acid linkage position was analysed by a membrane binding assay u s i n g t h e N e u A c a* 3 - s p e <b>c</b> <b>i</b> <b>f</b> <b>i</b> <b>c</b> l e <b>c</b> t <b>i</b> n <b>f</b> r o m M a a <b>c</b> k <b>i</b> a a m u r e n s i s a n d t h e N e u A c a* 6 - s p e <b>c</b> <b>i</b> <b>f</b> <b>i</b> <b>c</b> l e <b>c</b> t <b>i</b> n <b>f</b> r o m S a m b u c u s n i g r a.

The upper band contained 3 -linked sialic acid and was recognized by H. pylori, while the lower band, which was not recognized, contained 6 -linked sialic acid. The second sialic acid-containing epitope restricted to polyglycosylceramides fom human erythrocytes (blood group O) was partially characterized. A new way of molecular fingerprinting of these highly complex and microheterogeneous polyglycosylceramides was adopted based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In a separate study, polyglycosylceramides were peracetylated and subfractioned by anion exchange chromatography. Three subfractions were deacetylated, analysed by MALDI-TOF MS and 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Two-dimensional 1 H TOCSY-spectra of the mixtures showed that the first fraction contained 3 -linked sialic acid and the second and third fractions contained both 3 - and 6 -linked sialic acid. Only neutral species were present in the first acetylated fraction since it was eluted with solvent lacking salt. The presence of sialic acid in this fraction was explained by a selective lactonization under the conditions used for peracetylation. H. pylori recognized all three fractions, indicating that 3 -linked rather than 6 -linked sialic acid is essential for binding. ...|$|R
