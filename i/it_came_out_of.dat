5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the revolving speaker.|$|E
25|$|On September 25, 2008, Greater Atlanta Bar-B-Q (the only Metro Atlanta {{franchisee}} of Sonny's) {{filed for}} Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for ten locations, four {{of which were}} closed completely, raising concerns about another restaurant's viability after Metromedia Restaurant Group closed its Bennigan's and Steak and Ale restaurant chains. Yet as of {{the first week of}} June in 2009, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bankruptcy completing Chapter 11 requirements. On October 15, 2008, all three Sonny's locations in the greater Daytona Beach area, Florida were closed.|$|E
25|$|Until {{it became}} commercially viable, natural gas {{was often a}} nuisance. Dangerous to handle and {{hard to get to}} market, early oilmen despised it as a poor {{relation}} to its rich cousin crude oil. Although early processing procedures were able to remove water, in the 19th century discoveries were only developed if consumers could use the gas just as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ground. If the gas required further processing or needed to be piped a long distance to market, the producer shut in the well. Flares got rid of gas coming from oil wells.|$|E

25|$|Right {{after the}} Buddhist Lent, on 19 November 1541, the {{combined}} forces invaded, and by December drove Prome's forces behind the city's fortified walls. In April 1542, the Confederation armies led by King Thohanbwa {{came down with}} 16,000 troops but could not break through Toungoo lines. King Min Bin of Arakan too sent a 5,000-man army through the Padaung Pass across the Arakan Yoma range, and a 7000-man, 700-boat flotilla by the coast to break the siege. However, the Arakanese army as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the pass walked into a trap, and was completely wiped out by a 6000-strong Toungoo army led by Bayinnaung. The Arakanese navy had taken Pathein and Myaungmya but retreated after hearing the news of their army's defeat. Tabinshwehti was so pleased with Bayinnaung's victory over the Arakanese army that he appointed his deputy and childhood friend heir-apparent. Prome held out for about more month but its king Minkhaung surrendered on 19 May 1542.|$|E
25|$|This {{state of}} affairs persisted for several decades, until Michael K. Brett-Surman reexamined the {{pertinent}} material for his graduate studies in the 1970s and 1980s. He concluded that the type species of Anatosaurus, A. annectens, was actually a species of Edmontosaurus, and that A. copei was different enough to warrant its own genus. Although theses and dissertations are not regarded as official publications by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, which regulates the naming of organisms, his conclusions were known to other paleontologists, and were adopted by several popular works of the time. His replacement name, Anatotitan (Latin anas ("duck") and the Greek Titan, meaning large), was known and published as such in the popular literature by 1990. Formal publication of the name Anatotitan copei took place the same year, in an article co-written by Brett-Surman with Ralph Chapman (although the name is sometimes credited as Brett-Surman vide Chapman and Brett-Surman because <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Brett-Surman's work). Because the type species of Anatosaurus (A. annectens) was sunk into Edmontosaurus, the name Anatosaurus is abandoned as a junior synonym of Edmontosaurus.|$|E

The story, again, was fueled by Mulder's belief and emotional connection with this case. Another girl taken from her family. And, in a way, the little boy who is the conduit, who is also perhaps touched by the aliens, is essentially Mulder. These little touches the fans seem to respond to.

500|$|Parrs Wood, {{with about}} 2,000 pupils on its register, {{is much larger}} than the average, and is {{regularly}} over-subscribed in Year 7. In its 2007 inspection report by the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) the school was criticised for [...] "failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education", and for providing [...] "unsatisfactory" [...] value for money. However, in 2012 <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> special measures and Ofsted deemed it a [...] "satisfactory" [...] school with aspects of [...] "good teaching" [...] and [...] "good management". The Barlow RC High School is an average size secondary school, with about 1,000 pupils. It too is regularly over-subscribed. It was described in its October 2003 Ofsted report as [...] "a successful and effective school that is providing a good education for its pupils".|$|E

Eager to return to sea, he began agitating for a command and was promised the 80-gun [...] As she was not yet ready for sea, Nelson was instead given command of the 74-gun , to which he appointed Edward Berry as his flag captain. French activities in the Mediterranean theatre were raising concern among the Admiralty: Napoleon was gathering forces in Southern France but the destination of his army was unknown. Nelson and the Vanguard were to be dispatched to Cadiz to reinforce the fleet. On 28 March 1798, Nelson hoisted his flag and sailed to join Earl St Vincent. St Vincent sent him on to Toulon with a small force to reconnoitre French activities.|$|E

2500|$|Arizona is {{currently}} the most important producer of turquoise by value. Several mines exist in the state, two of them famous for their unique colour and quality and considered {{the best in the}} industry: the Sleeping Beauty Mine in Globe ceased turquoise mining in August 2012. The mine chose to send all ore to the crusher and to concentrate on copper production due to the rising price of copper on the world market. The price of natural untreated Sleeping Beauty turquoise has risen dramatically since the mine's closing. The Kingman Mine as of 2015 still operates alongside a copper mine outside of the city. Other mines include the Blue Bird mine, Castle Dome, and Ithaca Peak, but they are mostly inactive due to the high cost of operations and federal regulations [...] The Phelps Dodge Lavender Pit mine at Bisbee ceased operations in 1974 and never had a turquoise contractor. All Bisbee turquoise was [...] "lunch pail" [...] mined. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the copper ore mine in miners' lunch pails. Morenci and Turquoise Peak are either inactive or depleted.|$|E

Then I heard Ahmet Aga command with his own mouth for Trendafil to be impaled and burnt. The words he used were [...] "Shishak aor" [...] which is Turkish for [...] "to put on a skewer (as a shish kebab). After that, they took all the money he had, undressed him, gouged his eyes, pulled out his teeth and impaled him slowly on a stake, until <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his mouth. Then they roasted him while he was still alive. He lived for half-an-hour during this terrible scene. At the time, I was near Ahmet Aga with other Bulgarian women. We were surrounded by Bashi-Bozouk, who had us surrounded, and forced us to watch what was happening to Trendafil.“ One of her children, Vladimir, who was still a baby at his mother's breast, was impaled on a sword in front of her eyes. “At the time this was happening, Ahmet Aga's son took my child from my back and cut him to pieces, there in front of me.
