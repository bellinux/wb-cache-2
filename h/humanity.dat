5|$|The {{ending of}} Redemption varies {{depending}} upon on {{the quantity of}} <b>humanity</b> Christof has retained during the game. If the quantity is great, Christof reconciles with Anezka and turns her into a vampire, sparing her from death. If his <b>humanity</b> is moderate, he surrenders to Vukodlak and becomes a ghoul; Vukodlak betrays Christof and forces him to murder Anezka. A lesser quantity of <b>humanity</b> results in Christof killing Vukodlak by drinking his blood. Greatly empowered, Christof forsakes his <b>humanity,</b> murders Anezka, and revels in his new power.|$|E
5|$|After {{the five}} heroine's routes are completed, the story shifts to a setting amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where Kotarou {{encounters}} Kagari {{in a world}} after re-evolution, still on the Moon. Kotarou {{at this point is}} a unified entity of all the Kotarous from all timelines where <b>humanity</b> was destroyed and he has memories of these events. The Moon's Kagari is trying to research a way so the Earth and <b>humanity</b> are not destroyed, and Kotarou attempts to buy her time while fighting a hoard of familiars summoned by Sakura Kashima of Gaia whose resolve is to annihilate <b>humanity</b> by killing Kagari. Kotarou and the entire cast rejoin together to protect Kagari, who manages to finish her plan to allow the Earth and <b>humanity</b> to coexist by sending the Moon's life force back to Earth. In the past, the Earth had sent this energy to the Moon so life could continue. There is just enough energy and resources left for a final re-evolution.|$|E

5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, <b>humanity</b> is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with <b>humanity</b> in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as <b>humanity</b> could not become fully divine.|$|E
5|$|Even if {{an ancient}} and {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization wished to help <b>humanity,</b> humans could {{suffer from a}} loss of identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization. However, a friendly civilization may calibrate its contact with <b>humanity</b> {{in such a way}} as to minimize unintended consequences. Michael A. G. Michaud suggests that a friendly and advanced extraterrestrial civilization may even avoid all contact with an emerging intelligent species like <b>humanity,</b> to ensure that the less advanced civilization can develop naturally at its own pace; this is known as the zoo hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between <b>humanity</b> and extraterrestrials, high-information {{messages}} from an extraterrestrial civilization to <b>humanity</b> have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to <b>humanity</b> is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E

40|$|This book {{analyses}} and discusses {{the recent developments}} for assessing research quality in the <b>humanities</b> and related fields in the social sciences. Research assessments in the <b>humanities</b> are highly controversial and the evaluation of <b>humanities</b> research is delicate. While citation-based research performance indicators are widely used in the natural and life sciences, quantitative measures for research performance meet strong opposition in the <b>humanities.</b> This volume combines the presentation of state-of-the-art projects on research assessments in the <b>humanities</b> by <b>humanities</b> scholars themselves {{with a description of}} the evaluation of <b>humanities</b> research in practice presented by research funders. Bibliometric issues concerning <b>humanities</b> research complete the exhaustive analysis of <b>humanities</b> research assessment. The selection of authors is well-balanced between <b>humanities</b> scholars, research funders, and researchers on higher education. Hence, the edited volume succeeds in painting a comprehensive picture of research evaluation in the <b>humanities.</b> This book is valuable to university and science policy makers, university administrators, research evaluators, bibliometricians as well as <b>humanities</b> scholars who seek expert knowledge in research evaluation in the <b>humanities...</b>|$|R
50|$|Digital <b>humanities</b> {{have been}} criticized for not only {{ignoring}} traditional questions of lineage and history in the <b>humanities,</b> but lacking the fundamental cultural criticism that defines the <b>humanities.</b> However, {{it remains to be seen}} whether or not the <b>humanities</b> have to be tied to cultural criticism, per se, in order to be the <b>humanities.</b> The sciences see the Digital <b>Humanities</b> as a welcome improvement over the non-quantitative and repetitive historically popular methods of the <b>humanities</b> and social sciences.|$|R

5|$|Players are {{penalized for}} using certain vampiric {{abilities}} {{in front of}} witnesses; exposing their existence loses masquerade points, although additional masquerade points can be earned with quests and other actions. Violating the masquerade five times draws the ire of vampire hunters and loses the game. The player has <b>humanity</b> points, representing the vampire's <b>humanity.</b> Some actions cost <b>humanity</b> points; a low <b>humanity</b> score alters available dialog options to become more aggressive, and increases the chance of entering a frenzied state and embarking on a killing spree, when the vampire's blood is low. This frenzy can also be triggered by {{a large amount of}} damage. Like masquerade points, losing all <b>humanity</b> points ends the game, with the vampire becoming a mindless beast. Some areas, known as Elysium, prevent the use of Disciplines or weapons. Players can recruit a female ghoul, Heather, as a customizable servant who gives them blood, gifts, and money.|$|E

5|$|SETI {{researcher}} Carl Sagan {{believed that}} a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war {{to be able to}} avoid self-destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat <b>humanity</b> with dignity and respect, and <b>humanity,</b> with its relatively backward technology, would {{have no choice but to}} reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact <b>humanity</b> would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize <b>humanity,</b> much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between Digital <b>Humanities</b> and individual <b>humanities</b> disciplines {{is difficult to}} define given the uncertainties surrounding the definition of Digital <b>Humanities</b> itself. An examination of coverage within Digital <b>Humanities</b> journals narrows the range {{but at the same}} time emphasises that, while the focus of Digital <b>Humanities</b> might be textual, not all textually-oriented disciplines are equally represented. Trending terms also seem to suggest that Digital <b>Humanities</b> is more of a label of convenience, even for those disciplines most closely associated with Digital <b>Humanities.</b> From an archaeological perspective, a {{relationship between}} Digital Archaeology and Digital <b>Humanities</b> is largely absent and the evidence suggests that each is peripheral with respect to the other. Reasons for this situation are discussed, and the spatial expertise of Digital Archaeology is reviewed in relation to Digital <b>Humanities</b> concerns regarding the use of GIS.
