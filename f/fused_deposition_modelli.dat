40|$|Rapid {{prototyping}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} technologies in additive manufacturing. The layer-by-layer mechanism of rapid prototyping allows this technology to rapidly create and print complex geometries from three-dimensional models of any objects. <b>Fused</b> <b>deposition</b> modelling {{is one of the}} common processes in rapid prototyping, and its maturity has given birth to full-scale, commercial <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> modelling machines, as well as low-cost, <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> modelling machines, which are also referred to as three-dimensional printers. This work compares the effect of layer thickness during printing on the tensile and compressive strengths of samples, for commercial and low-cost <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> modelling machines. Standard samples based on ASTM D 638 and ASTM D 695 were prepared for the tensile and compressive tests, with layer thicknesses of 0. 3302 and 0. 2540 mm, using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene as the printing material. From the tensile tests, specimens prepared using low-cost <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> modelling managed to obtain only 41. 87 and 54. 69 % of the ultimate tensile strength of specimens prepared using commercial <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> modelling, for layer thicknesses of 0. 3302 and 0. 2540 mm. Meanwhile, from the compressive tests, specimens prepared using low-cost <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> modelling managed to obtain only 75. 55 and 73. 79 % of the ultimate compressive strength of specimens prepared using commercial <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> modelling, for the same layer thicknesses. Ultimately, low-cost <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> modelling still needs more improvement in order to give better results, compared to the currently available commercial-grade <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> modelling printers...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>Fused</b> <b>Deposition</b> Modeling {{as a small}} volume manufacturing process {{and a lack of}} explicit rules for improving the efficiency of this process bring necessity to the development of build guidelines. This work develops a proposed set of build guidelines for use in <b>Fused</b> <b>Deposition</b> Modeling (FDM). The guidelines are verified by the literature and experience, and validated by statistical analysis of quantitative FDM build data and qualitative review of example cases from student projects. The experimental data are obtained using the fabrication protocol for a Dimension SST <b>Fused</b> <b>Deposition</b> Modeling machine. Using simulation software known as Catalyst TM, build time and material volume characteristics of many components of varying size and complexity were calculated. Eventually, this area of research should result in a robust set of rules that can fundamentally reduce the costs associated with FDM and can assist its ascent as a feasible full-scale manufacturing process...|$|R

The material was prepared by mechanical blending using single screw extruder nanomixer of Polycaprolactone (PCL), Montmorillonite (MMT) and Hydroxyapatite (HA).
