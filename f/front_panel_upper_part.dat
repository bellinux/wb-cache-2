The walls of the first gallery have two superimposed series of reliefs; each consists of 120 <b>panels.</b> The <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> depicts the biography of the Buddha, while {{the lower part of}} the wall and also the balustrades in the first and the second galleries tell the story of the Buddha's former lives. The remaining panels are devoted to Sudhana's further wandering about his search, terminated by his attainment of the Perfect Wisdom.|$|R

60|$|Though {{daylight}} still {{prevailed in}} the rooms, the corridors were in a depth of shadow--chill, sad, and silent; {{and it was only}} by looking along them towards light spaces beyond that anything or anybody could be discerned therein. One of these light spots she found to be caused by a side-door with glass <b>panels</b> in the <b>upper</b> <b>part.</b> Elfride opened it, and found herself confronting a secondary or inner lawn, separated from the principal lawn front by a shrubbery.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} a 100.70 m-high {{structure}} {{situated at the}} western side of the fairground facing the main entrance. It has a diameter of 10.40 m at the base. The exterior of the tower is covered 2/3 of its height by aluminium composite <b>panel</b> and the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> by steel facia construction. It has two basement, one ground floor and 17 stories. Three elevators can lift up 63 visitors {{at the same time to}} the three-leaved peony-formed observation platform atop the tower.|$|R
50|$|Mabkhara (Arabic, مبخر or مبخرة) is a censer found {{across the}} Arab World and Turkey. The mabkhara was {{traditionally}} made from clay or soft stone (like the Somali Dabqaad). Most mabkhara have a square pedestal base with inward sloping sides which support a square cup with outward sloping sides. The wooden base is often carved out to form legs. The cup itself {{is lined with}} sheet metal. Older s were decorated with patterned combinations of soft metal pegs and brass tacks, often with mirrors in the <b>panels</b> of the <b>upper</b> <b>part.</b> The legs were ordinarily covered with sheet metal.|$|R
50|$|The stove {{was about}} 30 inches (76 cm) tall, {{with a box}} shape. The front was open, except for a {{decorative}} <b>panel</b> in the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the box. The back of the box was to be placed a few inches away from the flue (chimney). On the bottom panel there were several holes to allow the smoke to escape; these were connected to the chimney. The panels were bolted together with iron screws through pre-cast ears. Inside there was a small, thin rectangular prism that would force the smoke into the holes. The plates were all made from iron.|$|R

5000|$|King Friday's Castle - This {{is usually}} the first {{location}} seen in the Neighborhood as Trolley enters from a tunnel on its left side. Blue colored structure with XIII in gold on its front. There is a service entrance {{to the right of}} the castle. From 1968 to 1969, the original castle was a two-tier structure with two archways in each and one polygonal tower at the top. The gold XIII was on the <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> of the <b>upper</b> walkway. On February 27, 1969, the day before King Friday married Queen Sara, Lady Elaine used her boomerang and Handyman Negri played Brahms' Second Symphony on his guitar to magically change the old castle into a newer, larger castle as their wedding gift to the royal couple. This became the well-known castle used for the remainder of the series: three-tier structure with seven archways; two in the lower tier, three in the center, and one in each of the two round towers at the top. The gold XIII was now under the second tier's widest archway where King Friday and Queen Sara came out to greet visitors. The service entrance to the right remained intact and a carpeted exterior staircase was added to the left. A decorative waterfall/fountain was installed in front of the left side in 1971; King Friday would donate the waterfall to the people of Westwood many years later.|$|R
50|$|Q-Connector or ASUS Q-Connector, is an adapter, {{sometimes}} {{included with}} ASUS motherboards, which sits {{in between the}} motherboard <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> connectors and the <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> cables. The Q-Connector is marked with bigger text than the <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> connectors on the motherboard, as well as protruding from the motherboard, limiting obstruction from heatsinks and other connectors.|$|R

The second serial port {{is connected to the}} <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> circuit board.

5000|$|Intel {{warns that}} HDA dongles {{should be used}} with HDA motherboards: It is {{strongly}} recommended that motherboard designers only use Intel HD Audio analog <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> dongles with the Intel HD Audio analog <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> header {{to insure that the}} jack detection and dynamic re-tasking capability is preserved. Passive AC’97 analog <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> dongles (ones which leave the 5V Analog pin-7 line unconnected on the dongle) may be used with the Intel HD Audio analog <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> header. But note that the <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> jack detection and re-tasking functionality will be lost as the AC’97 jacks cannot support connection to the SENSE line. In addition, software must be aware that an AC’97 dongle is being used with an Intel HD Audio analog header since the software might need to dedicate codec ports that are connected to the header to meet the product’s intended functionality.|$|R
50|$|Early PDP-8 systems did {{not have}} an {{operating}} system, just a <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> and run and halt switches. Software development systems for the PDP-8 series began with the most basic <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> entry of raw binary machine code (booting entry).|$|R

50|$|The 21MX ran the HP RTE (Real Time) Operating System (OS).

When bootstrap ROMs enabled computers to start themselves without operator intervention in the late 1970s and early 1980s, most computers were built without a <b>front</b> switch <b>panel.</b> High-powered calculators, such as the HP 9830 based on ROM, {{were among the first}} computers to do away with <b>front</b> <b>panels,</b> and operators.|$|R
