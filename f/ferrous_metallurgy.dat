5|$|It {{was during}} his stay in Dnipropetrovsk {{that he met}} Leonid Brezhnev, a future leader of the Soviet Union. Tikhonov joined the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) in 1940 {{and by the end}} of the decade, had secured a job as a plant director. As a director, Tikhonov was able to show off his {{organisational}} skills; under his leadership the plant became the first in the region to reopen a hospital, organising dining rooms and restoring social clubs for workers caught up in the aftermath of the Eastern Front. Tikhonov was quickly promoted, and started working for the Ministry of <b>Ferrous</b> <b>Metallurgy</b> in the 1950s. Between 1955 and 1960 Tikhonov became a Deputy Minister of the Ministry of <b>Ferrous</b> <b>Metallurgy,</b> a member (and later chairman) of the Scientific Council of the Council of Ministers, and finally, a deputy chairman of the State Planning Committee. At the 22nd Party Congress Tikhonov was elected to the Central Committee as a non-voting member. At the 23rd party congress in 1966, Tikhonov was elected a member of the Central Committee. Tikhonov was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour award for his first time.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in <b>ferrous</b> <b>metallurgy</b> have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E

Many applications, practices, and devices associated or involved in metallurgy were established in ancient China, such as the innovation of the blast furnace, cast iron, hydraulic-powered trip hammers, and double acting piston bellows.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ferrous</b> <b>{{metallurgy}}</b> is the metallurgy of {{iron and}} its alloys. It began far back in prehistory. The earliest surviving iron artifacts, from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt, were made from meteoritic iron-nickel. It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began, {{but by the end}} of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being produced from iron ores from China to Sub-Saharan Africa. The use of wrought iron (worked iron) was known by the 1st millennium BC, and its spread marked the Iron Age. During the medieval period, means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron (in this context known as pig iron) using finery forges. For all these processes, charcoal was required as fuel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With the onging {{trend of}} {{reducing}} the weight of automotive parts, {{there is also an}} increasing trend in the use of light alloys. Recently, aluminum powder metallurgy {{has been the subject of}} great attention due to the combination of the lightweight characteristics of aluminium and the efficient material utilisation of the powder metallurgical process, which offer attractive benefits to potential end-users. Conventional press and sinter route of non-ferrous P/M products are based compaction at room temperature prior to the sintering cycle. However, warm compaction process has successfully provided increased density in <b>ferrous</b> powder <b>metallurgy</b> parts, which contributes to better mechanical properties and consequently overall performance of those parts. This study is aimed at exploring the use of warm compaction process to aluminium powder metallurgy. This paper presents a detailed study of the effect of warm compression and sintering conditions on the resultant microstructures and mechanical properties of Al-Cu-Mg-Si PM blend...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{lubricants}} during compaction {{is crucial}} and nowadays even more important, {{due to the}} increased number of PM parts with higher densities and/or challenging ejection conditions. The development of new lubricants for single compaction requires however an excellent understanding of the lubrication mechanisms and the behaviour of these new compounds. In this paper, {{the effect of the}} lubricant particle size distribution on the compaction and ejection behaviour, but also on the static and dynamic properties of <b>ferrous</b> powder <b>metallurgy</b> parts is studied. Indeed, as parts reach higher densities, the influence of {{the size and shape of}} pores become dominant on the mechanical performance and particularly fatigue resistance of the parts. Water atomized powder mixes containing different particles sizes of ethylene-bis-stearamide (EBS) lubricant were compacted both on a laboratory press and on an industrial mechanical press at higher speed rates. In addition to compressibility curves and static sintered mechanical properties, complete ejection curves and fatigue tests results are presented. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
