2500|$|Ethidium bromide is {{commonly}} used to detect nucleic acids in molecular biology laboratories. In the case of DNA this is usually double-stranded DNA from PCRs, restriction digests, etc. Single-stranded RNA can also be detected, since it usually folds back onto itself and thus provides local base pairing for the dye to intercalate. Detection typically involves a gel containing nucleic acids placed on or under a UV lamp. Since ultraviolet light is harmful to eyes and skin, gels stained with ethidium bromide are usually viewed indirectly using an enclosed camera, with the fluorescent images recorded as photographs. Where direct viewing is needed, the viewer's eyes and exposed skin should be protected. [...] In the laboratory the intercalating properties have long been used to minimize chromosomal condensation when a culture is exposed to mitotic arresting agents during harvest. The resulting slide preparations permit a <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>resolution,</b> and thus more confidence in determining structural integrity of chromosomes upon microscopic analysis.|$|R

Many of these were peptides, others contain non-amino acid constituents whose nature is yet unknown. As contrasted to previous reports, the present work indicates a major portion of the amino acids in insect hemolymph occur in bound form.

The possible significance of this reduction is discussed. Material containing bound C 14 glutamic acid was isolated from larval extracts and reinjected.

40|$|Abstract | Aromatic amines and azaarenes are {{successfully}} separated on both analytical {{scale and}} microbore packed columns via supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Because microbore columns {{can be used}} with commercial instruments that have density and pressure programming capability, higher sensitivity and resolution are obtained. Separation is compared with both reversed-phase and normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The SFC separation has a much <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>resolution,</b> and method development is easier than with HPLC modes. Flame-ionization (FID), ultraviolet (UV), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) on-line detectors are used for detection and identification. A comparison of restrictors indicates that an optimized separation also requires an optimized restrictor size because different restrictor sizes have different linear velocities. A retention mechanism study for these nitrogen-containing compounds with SFC shows that the elution order not only depends on basicity and steric hindrance, but also on the solubility of the solute in C O 2. The results show that lower density solubility is a major factor in elution order; however, at higher density, basicity and steric hindrance are more important...|$|R

40|$|From a {{strategic}} watershed planning perspective {{it is best}} that the reach specific instream flow requirements are determined with the <b>highest</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>resolution</b> throughout a watershed to guide the planning process. At a practical level however, reach specific instream flow assessments in even a moderate sized watershed become cost prohibitive and impractical given time and logistical constraints.

This paper presents research {{on the development of}} a procedure to estimate the instream flow requirements for specific reaches in the Nooksack river watershed (Washington state) based on the extrapolation of site-specific data collected and analyzed at a limited number of sites within the watershed. The research relies on the development of a GIS based stratification procedure to characterize drainages (and reaches) into homogenous strata based on hydrologic, geomorphologic, land use, biotic, and related watershed parameters by application of multivariate statistical data analysis techniques. Site-specific parameters are then extrapolated from measured to unmeasured streams within the same strata.

40|$|Abstract Background The multilocus variable-number {{tandem repeat}} (VNTR) {{analysis}} (MLVA) technique {{has been developed}} for fine typing of many bacterial species. The genomic sequences of Neisseria meningitidis strains Z 2491, MC 58 and FAM 18 have been available for searching potential VNTR loci by computer software. In this study, we developed and evaluated a MLVA method for molecular subtyping and phylogenetic analysis of N. meningitidis strains. Results A total of 12 VNTR loci were identified for subtyping and phylogenetic analysis of 100 N. meningitidis isolates, which had previously been characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing. The number of alleles ranges from 3 to 40 for the 12 VNTR loci; theoretically, the numbers of alleles can generate more than 5 × 10 11 MLVA types. In total, 93 MLVA types were identified in the 100 isolates, indicating that MLVA is powerful in discriminating N. meningitidis strains. In phylogenetic analysis with the minimal spanning tree method, clonal relationships, established with MLVA types, agreed well with those built with ST types. Conclusion Our study indicates that the MLVA method has a <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>resolution</b> than PFGE in discriminating N. meningitidis isolates and may be {{a useful tool for}} phylogenetic studies of strains evolving over different time scales. </p...|$|R
40|$|The DNA {{fingerprinting}} techniques, 16 S-restriction fragment length polymor-phism (16 S-RFLP), ribosomal {{intergenic spacer}} analysis (RISA) and repetitive extragenic palindrome PCR (Rep-PCR), {{were used for}} analyzing the bacterial communities of seven pulp and paper wastewater treatment systems. All three methods generate DNA fingerprints that can be compared using the computer-assisted program, Gelcompar©. Community similarity coefficients were based on quantitative determinations of both {{the positions of the}} DNA bands and the band intensities in order to compare the relative differences in the populations. Unique 16 S-RFLP DNA fingerprints were observed for each mill suggesting that individual mills contained phylogenetically different communities. However this method was not sensitive enough to detect differences within a mill treatment system from different locations or from different sampling times. The RISA method, which generated more complex fingerprints than 16 S-RFLP, could, for some mills, discern differences between samples. The Rep-PCR technique, however, showed the <b>highest</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>resolution</b> and pro-duced not only distinct patterns for each mill but also distinct fingerprints for the temporal and spatial samples from some of the treatment systems.

40|$|Motivation: Many {{biological}} networks, including transcriptional regulation, metabolism, and the absorbance {{spectra of}} metabolite mixtures, {{can be represented}} in a bipartite fashion. Key to understanding these bipartite networks are the network architecture and governing source signals. Such information is often implicitly imbedded in the data. Here we develop a technique, network component mapping (NCM), to deduce bipartite network connectivity and regulatory signals from data without any need for prior information. Results: We demonstrate the utility of our approach by analyzing UV-vis spectra from mixtures of metabolites and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. From UV-vis spectra, hidden mixing networks and pure component spectra (sources) were deduced to a <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>resolution</b> with our method than other current bipartite techniques. Analysis of S. cerevisiae gene expression from two separate environmental conditions (zinc and DTT treatment) yielded transcription networks consistent with ChIPchip derived network connectivity. Due to the <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> noise in gene expression data, the transcription network for many genes could not be inferred. However, with relatively clean expression data, our technique was able to deduce hidden transcription networks and instances of combinatorial regulation. These results suggest that NCM can deduce correct network connectivity from relatively accurate data. For noisy data, NCM yields the sparsest network capable of explaining the data. In addition, partial knowledge of the network topology {{can be incorporated into}} NCM as constraints. Availability: Algorithm available on request from the authors.
