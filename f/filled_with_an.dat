5|$|Ninety {{percent or}} more of {{smallpox}} cases among unvaccinated persons were of the ordinary type. In this form of the disease, by {{the second day of the}} rash the macules became raised papules. By the third or fourth day the papules <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> opalescent fluid to become vesicles. This fluid became opaque and turbid within 24â€“48 hours, giving them the appearance of pustules; however, the so-called pustules were filled with tissue debris, not pus.|$|E
5|$|Dense gases such as xenon and {{sulfur hexafluoride}} can be breathed safely when mixed {{with at least}} 20% oxygen. Xenon at 80% {{concentration}} along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia (and {{has been used for}} this, as discussed above). Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} lungs. There is, however, a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in a container, and a person who enters an area <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> odorless, colorless gas, may be asphyxiated without warning. Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.|$|E
5|$|The E-4 variant {{was fitted}} with {{external}} bomb racks also {{and the empty}} bomb bay space was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> 835L (221US gal) tank for aviation fuel and a further 115L (30US gal) oil tank. This increased the loaded weight but increased range to 1,800km (1,130mi). The modifications allowed the He 111 to perform both long- and short-range missions. The E-4's eight internal vertically aligned bomb racks could each carry a 250kg (550lb) bomb. The last E Variant, the He 111E-5, was powered by the Jumo 211A-3, and retained the 835L (221US gal) fuel tank {{on the port side}} of the bomb bay. Only a few of the E-4 and E-5 were built.|$|E

5|$|The Xel'Naga then {{discovered}} the Zerg, small parasitic larvae that could control the nervous systems of other species. The Xel'Naga {{saw this as}} purity of essence, and guided {{the evolution of the}} Zerg as well. However, the Zerg were animals, concerned only with self-preservation. To help further the Zerg as a species, the Xel'Naga created the Overmind, a central consciousness to organize the Zerg. They hid their existence from the Overmind, however. On becoming aware of their existence (after being <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> overriding directive it could not fight off), the Overmind attacked the Xel'Naga, infesting and destroying the greater whole of the race. In StarCraft II Wings of Liberty, Xel'Naga watchtowers provide vision in a large circular radius around the tower.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} other sauropods, the neck {{vertebrae}} are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck. The vertebral formula for the holotype of A.louisae is 15cervicals, 10dorsals, 5sacrals, and 82caudals. The caudal vertebra number may vary, even within species. The cervical vertebrae of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus are stouter and more robust than {{those of other}} diplodocids and {{were found to be}} most similar to Camarasaurus by Charles Whitney Gilmore. In addition, they support cervical ribs that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck, making the neck nearly triangular in cross-section. In Apatosaurus louisae, the atlas-axis complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated. Apatosaurus has ten dorsal ribs {{on either side of the}} body. The large neck was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. Apatosaurus, like its close relative Supersaurus, has tall neural spines, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid; it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips. Apatosaurus also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest. As in other diplodocids, the tail transformed into a whip-like structure towards the end.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{roughness}} of a metallized paper surface can cause many small air-filled bubbles between the dielectric and the metallization, decreasing the breakdown voltage of the capacitor. For this reason, larger film capacitors or power capacitors using paper as carrier of the electrodes usually are <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> insulating oil or gas, to displace the air bubbles {{for a higher}} breakdown voltage.|$|E
25|$|Film power {{capacitors}} mostly use {{polypropylene film}} as the dielectric. Other types include metallized paper capacitors (MP capacitors) and mixed dielectric film capacitors with polypropylene dielectrics. MP capacitors serve for cost applications and as field-free carrier electrodes (soggy foil capacitors) for high AC or high current pulse loads. Windings can be <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> insulating oil or with epoxy resin to reduce air bubbles, thereby preventing short circuits.|$|E

Anniversaries and other school events were magnets for persons of distinction. Senators, Indian commissioners, secretaries of the Interior, college presidents and noted clergymen were accustomed to presenting the diplomas or address the graduating class upon these occasions.

25|$|In 1802, William Cruickshank {{designed}} the first electric battery capable of mass production. Like Volta, Cruickshank arranged square copper plates, which he soldered at their ends, together with plates of zinc of equal size. These plates were placed {{into a long}} rectangular wooden box which was sealed with cement. Grooves inside the box held the metal plates in position. The box was then <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> electrolyte of brine, or watered down acid. This flooded design {{had the advantage of}} not drying out with use and provided more energy than Volta's arrangement, which used brine-soaked papers between the plates.|$|E

The National Stadium was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> estimated 40,000 spectators. A 31-gun salute was fired from the ramparts of the Purana Quila, adjacent to the National Stadium, in the honour of guests and participants of first Asian Games.
