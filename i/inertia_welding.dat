40|$|<b>Inertia</b> <b>welding</b> {{is widely}} used to join cylindrically shaped objects such as disks and shafts in turbine engines, turbochargers, etc. Flash control {{in many of these}} {{applications}} is not critical because the excess material is on external surfaces and can readily be removed by machining. Internal flash on hollow vessels, however, may be difficult or impossible to remove and may be either controlled by the use of flash traps or the part can be used as welded. Both internal flash and flash traps reduce internal volume and the conditions are not always acceptable. To address this short-coming, several innovative methods have been tested to determine their effect on flash control in <b>inertia</b> <b>welding</b> of hollow vessels.

40|$|In this study, a {{range of}} joining {{technologies}} has been investigated for creating attachments between refractory metal and Ni-based superalloys. Refractory materials of interest include Mo- 47 %Re, T- 111, and Ta- 10 %W. The Ni-based superalloys include Hastelloy X and MarM 247. During joining with conventional processes, these materials have potential for {{a range of}} solidification and intermetallic formation-related defects. For this study, three non-conventional joining technologies were evaluated. These included <b>inertia</b> <b>welding,</b> electro-spark deposition (ESD) welding, and magnetic pulse welding (MPW). The developed <b>inertia</b> <b>welding</b> practice closely paralleled that typically used for the refractory metals alloys. Metallographic investigations showed that forging during <b>inertia</b> <b>welding</b> occurred predominantly on the nickel base alloy side. It was also noted that at least some degree of forging on the refractory metal side of the joint was necessary to achieve consistent bonding. Both refractory metals were readily weldable to the Hastelloy X material. When bonding to the MarM 247, results were inconsistent. This was related to the higher forging temperatures of the MarM 247, and subsequent reduced deformation on that material during welding. ESD trials using a Hastelloy X filler were successful for all material combinations. ESD places down very thin (5 - to 10 - m) layers per pass, and interactions between the substrates and the fill were limited (at most) to that layer. For the refractory metals, the fill only appeared to wet the surface, with minimal dilution effects. Microstructures of the deposits showed high weld metal integrity with maximum porosity on the order of a few percent. Some limited success was also obtained with MPW. In these trials, only the T- 111 tubes were used. Joints were possible for the T- 111 tube to the Hastelloy X bar stock, but the stiffness of the tube (resisting collapse) necessitated the use of very high power levels. These power levels resulted in damage to the equipment (concentrator) during welding. It is of note that the joint made showed the typical wavy bond microstructure associated with magnetic pulse/explosion bond joints. Joints were not possible between the T- 111 tube and the MarM 247 bar stock. In this case, the MarM 247 shattered before sufficient impact forces could be developed for bonding...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{direction}} of the NASA-Glenn Research Center, the Edison Welding Institute (EWI) in Columbus, OH performed a series of non-fusion joining experiments to determine the feasibility of joining refractory metals or refractory metal alloys to Ni-based superalloys. Results, as reported by EWI, {{can be found in the}} project report for EWI Project 48819 GTH (Attachment A, at the end of this document), dated October 10, 2005. The three joining methods used in this investigation were <b>inertia</b> <b>welding,</b> magnetic pulse welding, and electro-spark deposition joining. Five materials were used in these experiments: Mo- 47 Re, T- 111, Hastelloy X, Mar M- 247 (coarse-grained, 0. 5 mm to several millimeter average grain size), and Mar M- 247 (fine-grained, approximately 50 {micro}m average grain size). Several iterative trials of each material combination with each joining method were performed to determine the best practice joining method. Mo- 47 Re was found to be joined easily to Hastelloy X via <b>inertia</b> <b>welding,</b> but <b>inertia</b> <b>welding</b> of the Mo-alloy to both Mar M- 247 alloys resulted in inconsistent joint strength and large reaction layers between the two metals. T- 111 was found to join well to Hastelloy X and coarse-grained Mar M- 247 via <b>inertia</b> <b>welding,</b> but joining to fine-grained Mar M- 247 resulted in low joint strength. Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) was only successful in joining T- 111 tubing to Hastelloy X bar stock. The joint integrity and reaction layer between the metals were found to be acceptable. This single joining trial, however, caused damage to the electromagnetic concentrators used in this process. Subsequent design efforts to eliminate the problem resulted in a loss of power imparted to the accelerating work piece, and results could not be reproduced. Welding trials of Mar M- 247 to T- 111 resulted in catastrophic failure of the bar stock, even at lower power. Electro-spark deposition joining of Mo- 47 Re, in which the deposited material was Hastelloy X, did not have a noticeable reaction layer. T- 111 was found to have a small reaction layer at the interface with deposited Hastelloy X. Mar M- 247 had a reaction layer larger than T- 111. Hastelloy X joined well with a substrate of the same alloy, and throughout the experiments was found to have a density of {approx} 99 %, based on metallographic observations of porosity in the deposit. Of the three joining methods tested, inertial welding of bar stock appears to be the most mature at this time. MPW may be an attractive alternative due to the potential for high bond integrity, similar to that seen in explosion bonding. However, all three joining methods used in this work will require adaptation in order to join piping and tubing. Further investigations into the change in mechanical properties of these joints with time, temperature, irradiation, and the use of interlayers between the two materials must also be performed...|$|E

The {{results indicate that the}} heating rate during the <b>inertia</b> <b>welding</b> process decreases gradually. The temperature distribution in the radial direction of weldment is uneven and the temperature rises gradually with the increase of distance from the center. But the relation between the temperature and distance is nonlinear. In the axial direction, the shorter the distance from the initial friction surface is, the bigger the rate of temperature increment becomes and the higher the peak temperature and the temperature gradient are. Meanwhile, the longer the distance from the initial friction surface is, the later the peak temperature appears and the longer the delay time gets.

40|$|A high γ' volume {{fraction}} Ni-base superalloy (RR 1000) {{has been studied}} and its microstructural and mechanical response to the <b>inertia</b> <b>welding</b> process assessed. The bond line microstructure has been characterised in terms of process parameters and associated modelled temperature distributions. The high temperature mechanical behaviour has been interrogated via sustained load crack growth testing in air and vacuum. The weld microstructure is characterised by a uni-modal distribution of ultrafine γ' and a meta-dynamically recrystallised grain structure. The recrystallised grain size {{is determined by the}} width of the shear zone and the associated deformation behaviour, which varies with process parameter selection. Of particular importance is the welding pressure, which controls the upset rate, thereby limiting the shear zone width. A restricted shear zone can be related to increases in the peak bond line temperature and cooling rate. The high temperature crack growth behaviour is controlled by grain boundary oxide formation and crack tip stress state. In inertia welded RR 1000 this stress state is governed by the reprecipitated γ'. The steady state crack growth rate increases with temperature, which is due to an increased rate of oxide formation. Near threshold growth behaviour is also dependent on localised microstructural features. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the base {{material}} microstructure {{on the development of}} residual stresses across the <b>weld</b> line in <b>inertia</b> friction <b>welds</b> (IFWs) of high-strength nickel-base superalloy RR 1000 was studied using neutron diffraction. A comparison was carried out between tubular IFW specimens generated from RR 1000 heat treated below (fine grain (FG) structure) and above (coarse grain (CG) structure) the γ′-solvus. Residual stresses were mapped in the as-welded (AW) condition and, after a postweld heat treatment (PWHT), optimized for maximum alloy strength. The highest tensile stresses were generally found in the hoop direction at the weld line near the inner diameter of the tubular-shaped specimens. A comparison between the residual stresses generated in FG and CG RR 1000 suggests that the starting microstructure has little influence on the maximum residual stresses generated in the weld even though different levels of energy must be input to achieve a successful weld in each case. The residual stresses in the postweld heat treated samples were about 35 pct less than for the AW condition. Despite the fact that the high-temperature properties of the two parent microstructures are different, no significant differences in terms of stress relief were found between the FG and CG RR 1000 IFWs. Since the actual weld microstructures of FG and CG RR 1000 <b>inertia</b> <b>welds</b> are very similar, the results suggest that it is the weld microstructure and its associated high-temperature properties rather than the parent material that affects the overall weld stress distribution and its subsequent stress relief. ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the <b>inertia</b> <b>welding</b> {{process was}} studied by both an FEM model and three {{analytical}} models. The thermal analysis {{shows that there}} is a steep temperature gradient near the mating surface, which is the cause for the existence of a band of high hydrostatic stress near the weld line. The holding effect of this high static stress is the reason for the presence of the very soft material at the welding interface. The models were used to predict the displacement of the weld line (upset) with a lambda model to describe the constitutive relation of IN 718 at high temperature. The results from the different models are in broad agreement. The shear stress induced by friction at the interface is found to enlarge the upset value; its effect {{must be taken into account}} if the upset is to be predicted accurately.

40|$|The <b>inertia</b> <b>welding</b> (IW) of Ti 64 was {{examined}} {{in terms of}} the microstructure and mechanical properties. The microstructure from two smalls scale inertia welded rings was observed using SEM. These microstructures were assessed in both the Hoop and Radial directions. Mechanical testing including micro-hardness, mechanical threshold and crack propagation testing, fracture toughness, tensile testing and low cycle testing was evaluated. The results show that the microstructures of both IW and LFW Ti 64 are very similar with various weld zones being observed. The micro-hardness is far superior in the weld zone to that of the parent material. The most significant controlling parameter of the microstructure is the cooling rate. The Tensile properties of both IW and LFW Ti 64 are superior to that of the parent and failure will not occur within the weld, although the LCF behaviour was not as favourable in IW. Crack growth rate is slower in the hoop direction than radial direction although this trend is reversed at increased temperature due to a switch from transgranular to intergranular crack growth. This work suggests that IW of Ti 64 shows promise, although further work is required on larger scale welds before the manufacture of fan disks made from IW Ti 64 can be substantiated. ...|$|E

Alloys such as RR 1000 are being trialled as they perform better at higher temperatures than current nickel-based superalloys. To achieve weight savings, <b>inertia</b> <b>welding</b> is being trialled for turbine discs but current post weld heat treatments reduce fatigue life. In this investigation, a number of novel post weld heat treatments were trialled aimed at improving post weld microstructure and fatigue properties. Extensive microstructural characterisation and mechanical testing {{were used to assess}} the effect of these treatments on both parent and weld materials. Post weld heat treatment (PWHT) was found to have a great effect on the size and distribution of γ' and carbides, particularly when a PWHT temperature of 980 ºC or above was used. The effect of this microstructural change on the hardness of the weld and parent material has also been characterised. Extensive total life fatigue testing was carried out at 650 ºC. It was found that failure can occur in both the parent and weld material, although it is deduced that the yield stress of the weld needs to be surpassed to see weld failure (plasticity in the weld). Increasing dwell time at peak load reduced the life of these components. Two mechanisms for crack growth were observed with initiation either at the surface or at a large Hf rich particle subsurface. Oxidation was found to have a large effect on both initiation and growth of fatigue cracks. By introducing a sharp pre-fatigue crack into samples, static load testing was used to determine a threshold value of K (stress intensity factor) for growth and growth rates were plotted at different K values.

We have designed an experiment to examine this model. In our experiment, two blocks made from a high glass transition temperature (Tg) epoxy are joined together with a thin, lower Tg epoxy interlayer. If the temperature of the specimen is held below the Tg of the low temperature epoxy, then the interlayer compliance ratio across the interface can be changed by varying the temperature.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the difference in microstructure and high temperature fatigue behaviour between three RR 1000 to IN 718 <b>inertia</b> friction <b>welds</b> and to provide further understanding of the <b>inertia</b> friction <b>welding</b> process. Between the three welds no significant differences in the weld microstructures were found. Also high temperature fatigue crack growth tests within 0. 3 mm of the weld interface, showed no difference in crack growth rate due to the three different sets of welding parameters. The cracks were found to propagate from RR 1000 through the weld interface into IN 718 passing a 10 - 30 mm wide zone, allowing higher crack growth rates. Fractographic studies have shown that these higher crack growth rates are caused by a higher tendency to intergranular cracking. In the present welds a semi-solid weld contact layer of 10 - 30 mm thickness developed, being an intermediate alloy of varying composition of the two base materials. In the surrounding material constitutional liquation of NbC particles in IN 718 and of primary γ′ in RR 1000 occurred. Similar welding process characteristics during the final second of the three welding cycles resulted in the observed similar weld microstructure and high temperature fatigue properties.

The resultant welds were compared to the parent in both the as-welded and post weld heat treated condition (640 °C / 2 hours). The mechanical properties of later welds were evaluated at three different temperatures and R ratios. Welding at process parameters within a defined window has produced welds with satisfactory mechanical properties. These welds are harder than the parent in both the as welded and Post Weld Heat Treated (PWHT) conditions. Post Weld Heat Treating of these welds at 640 °C for two hours results in the re-precipitation of secondary α throughout the Central Weld Zone and Heat Affected Zone, leading to a local microhardness increase. The weld is deduced to be more resistant to fatigue crack initiation than the parent material, with all low cycle fatigue samples failing in the parent. The fatigue crack growth resistance of welded and parent samples was comparable at all temperatures tested, with no effects of dwell observed. However, a static (intergranular) mode of failure at room temperature caused rapid acceleration of crack growth at higher ∆K values as the peak value of K approaches the fracture toughness. Hence, the onset of final failure in fatigue crack growth tests is strongly dependent on the R ratio, but at lower ∆K values, crack growth rates are independent of R ratio...|$|R
40|$|Prior to the {{restructuring}} of the Prometheus Program, the NRPCT was tasked with delivering a nuclear space reactor. Potential NRPCT nuclear space reactor designs for the Prometheus Project required dissimilar materials to be in {{contact with each other}} while operating at extreme temperatures under irradiation. As a result of the high reactor core temperatures, refractory metals were the primary candidates for many of the reactor structural and cladding components. They included the tantalum-base alloys ASTAR- 811 C and Ta- 10 W, the niobium-base alloy FS- 85, and the molybdenum base alloys Moly 41 - 47. 5 Rhenium. The refractory metals were to be joined to candidate nickel base alloys such as Haynes 230, Alloy 617, or Nimonic PE 16 either within the core if the nickel-base alloys were ultimately selected to form the outer core barrel, or at a location exterior to the core if the nickel-base alloys were limited to components exterior to the core. To support the need for dissimilar metal joints in the Prometheus Project, a co-extrusion experiment was proposed. There are several potential methods for the formation of dissimilar metal joints, including explosive bonding, friction stir welding, plasma spray, <b>inertia</b> <b>welding,</b> HIP, and co-extrusion. Most of these joining methods are not viable options because they result in the immediate formation of brittle intermetallics. Upon cooling, intermetallics form in the weld fusion zone between the joined metals. Because brittle intermetallics do not form during the initial bonding process associated with HIP, co-extrusion, and explosive bonding, these three joining procedures are preferred for forming dissimilar metal joints. In reference to a Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory report done under a NASA sponsored program, joints that were fabricated between similar materials via explosive bonding had strengths that were directly affected by the width of the diffusion barrier. It was determined that the diffusion zone should not exceed a critical thickness (0. 0005 in.). A diffusion barrier that exceeded this thickness would likely fail. The joint fabrication method must therefore mechanically bond the two materials causing little or no interdiffusion upon formation. Co-extrusion fits this description since it forms a mechanical joint between two materials by using heat and pressure. The two materials to be extruded are first assembled and sealed within a co-extrusion billet which is subsequently heated and then extruded through a die. For a production application, once the joint is formed, it is dejacketed to remove the outer canister. The remaining piece consists of two materials bonded together with a thin diffusion barrier. Therefore, the long-term stability of the joint is determined primarily by the kinetics of interdiffusion reaction between the two materials. An experimental design for co-extrusion of refractory metals and nickel-based superalloys was developed to evaluate this joining process and determine the long-term stability of the joints...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} project was to develop materials enabling joining technologies for use in forward looking heat-exchanger fabrication in Brayton cycle HIPPS, IGCC, FutureGen concepts capable of operating at temperatures in excess of 1000 {degree}C as well as conventional technology upgrades via Ultra Super-Critical (USC) Rankine-cycle boilers capable of operating at 760 {degree}C (1400 F) / 38. 5 MPa (5500 psi) steam, while still using coal as the principal fossil fuel. The underlying mission in Rankine, Brayton or Brayton-Rankine, or IGCC combined cycle heat engine is a steady quest to improving operating efficiency while mitigating global environmental concerns. There has been a progressive move to higher overall cycle efficiencies, {{and in the case}} of fossil fuels this has accelerated recently in part because of concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, notably CO{sub 2 }. For a heat engine, the overall efficiency is closely related to the difference between the highest temperature in the cycle and the lowest temperature. In most cases, efficiency gains are prompted by an increase in the high temperature, and this in turn has led to increasing demands on the materials of construction used in the high temperature end of the systems. Our migration to new advanced Ni-base and Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) alloys poses significant fabrication challenges, as these materials are not readily weldable or the weld performs poorly in the high temperature creep regime. Thus the joining challenge is two-fold to a) devise appropriate joining methodologies for similar/dissimilar Ni-base and ODS alloys while b) preserving the near baseline creep performance in the welded region. Our program focus is on solid state joining of similar and dissimilar metals/alloys for heat exchanger components currently under consideration for the USC, HIPPS and IGCC power systems. The emphasis is to manipulate the joining methods and variables available to optimize joint creep performance compared to the base material creep performance. Similar and dissimilar butt joints were fabricated of MA 956, IN 740 alloys and using <b>inertia</b> <b>welding</b> techniques. We evaluated joining process details and heat treatments and its overall effect on creep response. Fixed and incrementally accelerated temperature creep tests were performed for similar and dissimilar joints and such incremental creep life data is compiled and reported. Long term MA 956 -MA 556 joint tests indicate a firm 2 Ksi creep stress threshold performance at 850 {degree}C with a maximum exposure of over 9725 hours recorded in the current program. A Larsen Miller Parameter (LMP) of 48. 50 for a 2 Ksi test at 850 {degree}C was further corroborated with tests at 2 Ksi stress at 900 {degree}C yielding a LMP= 48. 80. Despite this threshold the joints exhibit immense temperature sensitivity and fail promptly when test temperature raised above 900 {degree}C. In comparison the performance of dissimilar joints was inferior, perhaps dictated by the creep characteristics of the mating nickel-base alloys. We describe a parametric window of joint development, and post weld heat treatment (PWHT) in dissimilar joints with solid solution (IN 601, IN 617) and precipitate strengthened (IN 740) materials. Some concerns are evident regarding the diffusion of aluminum in dissimilar joints during high temperature recrystallization treatments. It is noted that aggressive treatments rapidly deplete the corrosion protecting aluminum reservoir in the vicinity of the joint interface. Subsequently, the impact of varying PWHT has been evaluated in the context on ensuing creep performance...|$|E

This model has been validated against experimental test welds of the material; this included process data such as upset and rotational velocity as well as thermal data collected during the process using embedded thermocouples. The as-welded residual stress from the FE model has been compared to experimental measurements taken on the welded component using the hole drilling technique. The effects of the solid-state phase transformations which occur in the steel are considered and the trends in the residual stress measurements were well replicated when compared to the experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Friction welding processes, such as {{friction}} stir <b>welding</b> (FSW) and <b>inertia</b> friction <b>welding</b> (IFW) {{are popular}} candidate procedures for joining engineering materials (including dissimilar pairs) for advanced applications. The advantages of friction welding include lack of large scale material melting, ability to join dissimilar materials, and relatively low propensity to introduce defects into the weld joint. For these reasons FSW and IFW {{have become the}} subjects {{of a number of}} studies aimed at optimising the joining operations to obtain improved joint strength and reduce distortion and residual stress. In the present study we used the diffraciton of high energy polychromatic synchrotron X-rays to measure interplanar lattice spacings and deduce nominal elastic strains in friction stir welds between dissimilar aluminium alloys AA 5083 and AA 6082, and in coupons from <b>inertia</b> friction <b>welds</b> between dissimilar nickel-base superalloys IN 718 and RR 1000. Energy-dispersive diffraction profiles were collected by two detectors mounted in the horizontal and vertical diffraction planes, providing information about lattice strains in two nearly perpendicular directions lying almost in the plane of the plate samples mounted perpendicularly to the incident beam. Two-dimensional maps of residual stresses in friction-welded joints were constructed. Apart from the 2 D mapping techniques, the sin²ψ method (transmission) was also used in the case of inertia friction-welded joint between nickel alloys. Comparison between the two results allowed the variation of the lattice parameter with the distance from the bond line to be deduced. It was found that friction welding of two dissimilar materials with significant strength mismatch may lead {{to the creation of a}} region of compressive stress in the vicinity of the bond line, in contrast with the behaviour observed for joints between similar materials.

40|$|A joining {{study of}} these steels was {{initiated}} {{to determine the}} feasibility of using ultrahigh carbon steels in structural applications. The high carbon content (1. 5 wt%) in these steels {{and the desire to}} maintain the superplastic microstructure limit the use of conventional arc-welding processes. We chose two solid-state joining processes: diffusion bonding and <b>inertia</b> friction <b>welding.</b> Preliminary results show that sound bonds can be obtained with tensile properties nearly equal to those of the base metal. Of three UHC steels bonded by both inertia-friction welding and diffusion- bonding processes, the one with the lowest aluminum content had the best overall properties.
