5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} began in October 2012 with film's lead cast. The film was shot in Goa, Mumbai and Cape Town. During the filming in South Africa, Shraddha Kapoor needed medical attention after <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> broken glass fragments during the scene {{in which she had}} to kneel on the floor and talk to her co-star Aditya Roy Kapoor. Aditya Roy Kapoor also received burns to his hand during the filming of the scene in which they light some Chinese lanterns in Cape Town.|$|E
5|$|The free kick {{following}} the intentional safety {{was returned to}} near midfield, and Davis passed for a first down. Following the second down, Davis was sacked for a loss, but then scrambled for a first down to the Tech 25-yard line. From there, however, Boston College's offense began to struggle. During the four plays that followed, the Eagles were able to gain just one yard and turned the ball over on downs again. The final Boston College play was a sack of Davis, and Virginia Tech proceeded to run out the clock by <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> the ball after taking the field on offense.|$|E
5|$|Jud Dunlevy {{kicked the}} ball, which {{traveled}} the regulation 10yards, but was recovered by Kansas. The Hokies, despite failing {{to recover the}} onside kick, still had a chance for another offensive possession if they stopped Kansas' offense short of a first down. Because the Hokies had two timeouts remaining, they could stop the clock after two Kansas plays, thus preserving time for a Virginia Tech offensive drive. An 11-yard pass by Todd Reesing netted Kansas a first down, however, and subsequent runs by the Jayhawks allowed Kansas to run out the clock despite the Virginia Tech timeouts. Kansas preserved its lead by <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> the ball inside the Virginia Tech 5-yard line on the final plays of the game, and the 2421 victory was celebrated as time ran out.|$|E
5000|$|Within the Latin Rite of Roman Catholicism, it was {{formerly}} the custom to <b>kneel</b> <b>on</b> the left knee only (genuflect) for persons of distinction (such as kings, the pope, bishops, etc.), to <b>kneel</b> <b>on</b> the right knee for the Eucharist, {{when it is}} in the tabernacle, and to <b>kneel</b> <b>on</b> both knees when the Eucharist was exposed.|$|R

5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
5|$|The mural {{painted on}} {{the dome of the}} apse (pictured right) depicts Jesus seated on a cloud, red and golden rays {{radiating}} out of his golden halo. God the Father, pictured as a white-bearded man with triangular halo, looks down from a cloud above Jesus. A dove with a white halo, representing the Holy Spirit, flies just below God, wings outstretched, completing the Trinity. Above Jesus fly four cherubim. Seated to Jesus' right is Mary, his mother, and to his left Saint John the Baptist. On the same cloud as Jesus, three angels flank on each side. Slightly below Jesus, Mary, and John, two more flanking angels are depicted <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> their own clouds and swinging censers. Under the entire scene, a banner displays Gloria in Excelsis Deo.|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} Shiva became popular in Central Asia through the Hephthalite Empire, and Kushan Empire. Shaivism was also popular in Sogdia and the Kingdom of Yutian as found {{from the wall}} {{painting}} from Penjikent on the river Zervashan. In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread ("Yajnopavita"). He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants are wearing Sogdian dress. A panel from Dandan Oilik shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with Shakti <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> her right thigh. Another site in the Taklamakan Desert depicts him with four legs, seated cross-legged on a cushioned seat supported by two bulls. It is also noted that Zoroastrian wind god Vayu-Vata took on the iconographic appearance of Shiva.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{illustrations}} of Auriga represent it as a chariot and its driver. The charioteer holds a goat {{over his left}} shoulder and has two kids under his left arm; he holds the reins to the chariot {{in his right hand}}. However, depictions of Auriga have been inconsistent over the years. The reins in his right hand have also been drawn as a whip, though Capella is almost always over his left shoulder and the Kids under his left arm. The 1488 atlas Hyginus deviated from this typical depiction by showing a four-wheeled cart driven by Auriga, who holds the reins of two oxen, a horse, and a zebra. Jacob Micyllus depicted Auriga in his Hyginus of 1535 as a charioteer with a two-wheeled cart, powered by two horses and two oxen. Arabic and Turkish depictions of Auriga varied wildly from those of the European Renaissance; one Turkish atlas depicted the stars of Auriga as a mule, called Mulus clitellatus by Johann Bayer. One unusual representation of Auriga, from 17th-century France, showed Auriga as Adam <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> the Milky Way, with a goat wrapped around his shoulders.|$|E
5|$|Van der Goes's is the {{earliest}} extant autographed version, {{and one of}} the most important. This panel was originally a diptych wing of which the accompanying panel of the Virgin and Child is lost, and was probably made for a guild. Luke is dressed in a heavy red robe, draws a preparatory sketch in silverpoint, and wears a melancholy expression. Building on van der Weyden's theme of the role, practice and craft of an artist, van der Goes places pieces of charcoal, a knife and the feathers of a small bird in front of the saint. The similarities to the van der Weyden are many and striking, and include the painting utensils, red robes, physician's cap and blue mantle. The figure has the same middle-aged facial type and his pose, <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> a green cushion, although reversed compared to van der Weyden's, is the same. Van der Goes's adaption both increased van der Weyden's standing in the eyes of the later artist's followers, and led to a new group of copies that were modelled on the later painting.|$|E
5|$|Martin and {{the landlady}} at 3 Swaton Road, Elizabeth Haynes, {{described}} Bury as a violent drunk. On 7 April 1888, Haynes caught Bury <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> his bride of five days {{threatening to cut}} her throat with a knife. Haynes subsequently evicted them, and Ellen sold one of six £100 shares in a railway company that she had inherited from a maiden aunt, Margaret Barren, to pay William's debt to Martin. William was re-employed by Martin, and the couple moved to 11 Blackthorn Street, close to Swaton Road. According to Martin, William was then suffering from venereal disease. In June, Ellen sold the remaining shares, and in August they moved to 3 Spanby Road, adjacent to where William stabled his horse. With {{the money from the}} shares, the couple had a week's holiday in Wolverhampton with a drinking friend of William's and Ellen bought new jewellery. William continued to assault his wife throughout the latter half of 1888. By the first week of December, Ellen's windfall was nearly spent, and William sold his horse and cart. In January the following year, he told his landlord at 3 Spanby Road that he was thinking of emigrating to Brisbane, Australia, and asked him to make two wooden crates for the journey. Instead, William and Ellen moved to Dundee in Scotland. Ellen was not keen to go and only did so after William lied that he had obtained a position in a jute factory there.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E

25|$|Having aroused {{the hostility}} {{of the local}} priests by making converts, Thomas fled to St. Thomas's Mount four miles (6km) {{southwest}} of Mylapore. He was supposedly followed by his persecutors, who transfixed him with a lance as he prayed, <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> a stone, AD 72. His body was brought to Mylapore and buried inside the church he had built there. The present Santhome Church is on this spot but is clearly of a much later date. The Acts of Thomas and oral traditions (only recorded in writing centuries later) provide weak and unreliable evidence.|$|E
25|$|At 12:35a.m., at 2112 North Foster Drive in {{the parking}} lot of Triple S Food Mart, Sterling was {{detained}} by Baton Rouge Police Department officers. This came after an anonymous caller reported that a man was threatening him and waving a handgun while in the process of selling CDs. The officers tased Sterling for resisting several times, then forced the heavy-set man to the hood of a sedan and then to the ground. Sterling was pinned to the ground by both officers; one <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> his chest and the other on his thigh, both attempting to control his arms.|$|E
25|$|Chest muscles.

The body posture of the woman exerts physical stresses upon the pectoralis major muscles and the pectoralis minor muscles, which cause the weight of the breasts to induce static and dynamic shear forces (when standing and when walking), compression forces (when lying supine), and tension forces (when <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> four limbs).|$|E

25|$|Kallinger {{was born}} Joseph Lee Brenner III at the Northern Liberties Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Joseph Lee Brenner, Jr. {{and his wife}} Judith. In December 1937, the child was placed in foster care after his father had {{abandoned}} his mother. On October 15, 1939, he was adopted by Austrian immigrants Stephen and Anna Kallinger. He was abused by both his adoptive parents so severely that, at age six, he suffered a hernia inflicted by his adoptive father. The punishments Kallinger endured included <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> jagged rocks, being locked inside closets, consuming excrement, committing self-injury, being burned with irons, being whipped with belts, and being starved. When he was nine, he was sexually assaulted {{by a group of}} neighborhood boys.|$|E
25|$|A sweep is a cross-batted {{front foot}} shot played {{to a low}} {{bouncing}} ball, usually from a slow bowler, by <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> one knee, bringing the head down {{in line with the}} ball and swinging the bat around in a horizontal arc near the pitch as the ball arrives, sweeping it around to the leg side, typically towards square leg or fine leg. A paddle sweep shot is a sweep shot in which the ball is deflected towards fine leg with a stationary or near-stationary bat extended horizontally towards the bowler, whereas the hard sweep shot is played towards square leg with the bat swung firmly in a horizontal arc. Typically the sweep shot will be played to a legside delivery, but it is also possible for a batsman to sweep the ball to the legside from outside off stump. Attempting to sweep a full straight delivery on the stumps is generally not recommended because of the risk of lbw.|$|E
25|$|He was {{recognized}} as an inspiring speaker. In August 1924, he {{was transferred to the}} Saint Bonaventure convent in Detroit, where he worked until 1945. During this time, he mostly served as the simple porter (or receptionist and doorkeeper). Each Wednesday afternoon, he conducted well-attended services for the sick, and through these services, he became known for his great compassion and the amazing results of his consultations with visitors. People considered him instrumental in cures and other blessings. He loved to kneel before the Eucharist in the quiet of the night; Father Benedict Groeschel once recalled visiting the convent on a warm night and being unable to sleep. Around 3:00am, Groeschel took a walk and arrived at the chapel where he put on two lights and saw Casey <b>kneeling</b> <b>on</b> the top step of the altar. Groeschel observed him for several moments and noted that Casey didn't move – Groeschel simply flicked the lights off to leave Casey to his prayer.|$|E
