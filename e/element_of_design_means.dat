The picture book, {{with its new}} diversity of subjects and genres, has now widened its audience to include adolescents. The study of the illustrators use <b>of</b> the artistic <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> in embellishing the narrative of the story allows students to gain {{a greater understanding of}} the aesthetic value of picture books. This understanding and interpretation of the illustrator's choices <b>of</b> artistic <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> may help students to increase their visual literacy. The researcher chose a qualitative research design for descriptive evidence <b>of</b> whether artistic <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> could help in portrayal of character. From a high school population of 75 ranging in age from 15 to 18 years, the participants were 18 students, 10 females and 8 males. Data were collected on students' participation in group discussions, monologues, dramatic role- plays, and reflective journal writing. The researcher concludes that participants used the illustrator's artistic <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>design</b> to portray a character in dramatic role-play.
