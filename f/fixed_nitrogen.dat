25|$|In {{addition}} to runoff from land, atmospheric <b>fixed</b> <b>nitrogen</b> {{can enter the}} open ocean. A study in 2008 found that this could account for around {{one third of the}} ocean's external (non-recycled) nitrogen supply, and up to 3% of the annual new marine biological production. It has been suggested that accumulating reactive nitrogen in the environment may prove as serious as putting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Ammonium {{is thought}} to be the {{preferred}} source of <b>fixed</b> <b>nitrogen</b> for phytoplankton because its assimilation does not involve a redox reaction and therefore requires little energy. Nitrate requires a redox reaction for assimilation but is more abundant so most phytoplankton have adapted to have the enzymes necessary to undertake this reduction (nitrate reductase). There are a few notable and well-known exceptions that include Prochlorococcus and some Synechococcus. These species can only take up nitrogen as ammonium.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability of}} Gleditsia to <b>fix</b> <b>nitrogen</b> is disputed. Many {{scientific}} sources clearly state that Gleditsia does not <b>fix</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> Some support this statement {{with the fact}} that Gleditsia does not form root nodules with symbiotic bacteria, the assumption being that without nodulation, no nitrogen fixation can occur. In contrast, many popular sources, permaculture publications in particular, claim that Gleditsia does <b>fix</b> <b>nitrogen</b> but by some other mechanism.|$|R

The stalks are erect and curved so as to appear combed. It grows directly on silicate rocks in dense clusters. It is found {{on the west coast}} of North America up to Alaska, and in eastern Eurasia.

2500|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{is an important}} process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N2 from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by phytoplankton as N2 so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by cyanobacteria. Without supplies of <b>fixed</b> <b>nitrogen</b> entering the marine cycle, the <b>fixed</b> <b>nitrogen</b> would be used up in about 2000 years. Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter. [...] Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the euphotic zone by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the euphotic zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone. Ammonification or Mineralization is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. Nitrification can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrate can {{be returned to the}} euphotic zone by vertical mixing and upwelling where it can be taken up by phytoplankton to continue the cycle. N2 can be returned to the atmosphere through denitrification.|$|E
50|$|Rhizobia are {{bacteria}} that <b>fix</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (diazotrophs) after becoming established inside root nodules of legumes (Fabaceae). In order to express genes for nitrogen fixation, rhizobia require a plant host; they cannot independently <b>fix</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> In general, they are Gram-negative, motile, non-sporulating rods.|$|R

50|$|The {{ability to}} <b>fix</b> <b>nitrogen</b> {{is present in}} the {{families}} listed below. They belong to the orders Cucurbitales, Fagales, and Rosales, which together with the Fabales form a clade of eurosids. The ability to <b>fix</b> <b>nitrogen</b> is not universally present in these families. For example, of 122 genera in the Rosaceae, only 4 genera are capable of <b>fixing</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> Fabales were the first lineage to branch off this nitrogen-fixing clade; thus, the ability to <b>fix</b> <b>nitrogen</b> may be plesiomorphic and subsequently lost in most descendants of the original nitrogen-fixing plant; however, {{it may be that the}} basic genetic and physiological requirements were present in an incipient state in the last common ancestors of all these plants, but only evolved to full function in some of them.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fixation}} {{of atmospheric}} nitrogen {{is a very}} energy-intensive process, as it involves breaking the very stable triple bond between the nitrogen atoms. The enzyme nitrogenase {{is one of the}} few enzymes that can catalyze the process. The enzyme occurs in Rhizobium bacteria. There are three components to its action: a molybdenum atom at the active site, iron–sulfur clusters that are involved in transporting the electrons needed to reduce the nitrogen, and an abundant energy source in the form of magnesium ATP. This last is provided by a symbiotic relationship between the bacteria and a host plant, often a legume. The relationship is symbiotic because the plant supplies the energy by photosynthesis and benefits by obtaining the <b>fixed</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> The reaction may be written symbolically as ...|$|E
2500|$|Nitrogen is {{an element}} {{required}} for growth by all biological systems. [...] While extremely common (80% by volume) in the atmosphere, dinitrogen gas (...) is generally biologically inaccessible due to its high activation energy. [...] Throughout all of nature, only specialized bacteria and Archaea are capable of nitrogen fixation, converting dinitrogen gas into ammonia (...) , which is easily assimilated by all organisms. [...] These prokaryotes, therefore, are very important ecologically and are often essential {{for the survival of}} entire ecosystems. [...] This is especially true in the ocean, where nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are often the only sources of <b>fixed</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> and in soils, where specialized symbioses exist between legumes and their nitrogen-fixing partners to provide the nitrogen needed by these plants for growth.|$|E
2500|$|Plants {{can absorb}} nitrate or {{ammonium}} {{from the soil}} via their root hairs. If nitrate is absorbed, it is first reduced to nitrite ions and then ammonium ions for incorporation into amino acids, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. In plants that have a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia, some nitrogen is assimilated {{in the form of}} ammonium ions directly from the nodules. It is now known that there is a more complex cycling of amino acids between Rhizobia bacteroids and plants. The plant provides amino acids to the bacteroids so ammonia assimilation is not required and the bacteroids pass amino acids (with the newly <b>fixed</b> <b>nitrogen)</b> back to the plant, thus forming an interdependent relationship. While many animals, fungi, and other heterotrophic organisms obtain nitrogen by ingestion of amino acids, nucleotides, and other small organic molecules, other heterotrophs (including many bacteria) are able to utilize inorganic compounds, such as ammonium as sole N sources. [...] Utilization of various N sources is carefully regulated in all organisms.|$|E

2500|$|Atmospheric {{nitrogen}} must be processed, or [...] "fixed", in a usable form to {{be taken}} up by plants. Between 5x1012 and 10x1012 g per year are fixed by lightning strikes, but most fixation is done by free-living or symbiotic bacteria known as diazotrophs. These bacteria have the nitrogenase enzyme that combines gaseous nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia, which is converted by the bacteria into other organic compounds. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo-nitrogenase, found {{in a wide variety}} of bacteria and some Archaea. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two-component enzyme that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups. An example of the free-living bacteria is Azotobacter. [...] Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Rhizobium usually live in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a mutualistic relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for carbohydrates. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such symbioses. Today, about 30% of the total <b>fixed</b> <b>nitrogen</b> is produced industrially using the Haber-Bosch process, which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source (natural gas or petroleum) into ammonia.|$|E
