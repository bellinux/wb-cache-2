In this context, the moment of and reason <b>for</b> <b>obsolescence</b> of a product is of particular importance for the customer {{satisfaction and}} repurchase decision. The reasons <b>for</b> <b>obsolescence</b> are manifold and usually unknown to the producing company. Besides product failures, a decrease in modern design, changing customer needs or new technologies available can cause obsolescence. This paper presents a study <b>for</b> investigating <b>obsolescence</b> from a customer perspective.

40|$|Obsolescence {{mitigation}} is {{an increasingly}} important aspect of large systems development & maintenance that has often only been considered once <b>obsolescence</b> is imminent. <b>For</b> long lifecycle systems, {{this has become a}} major concern as the lifecycles of the components that are encompassed within these systems are often far shorter - up to ten times shorter - than the overall system lifecycle. Many defense systems can be characterized in this manner and therefore require obsolescence mitigation approaches to ensure the continuing ability for the system to perform and evolve. Current system-level obsolescence mitigation practices make recommendations for designing new systems to slow the onset of obsolescence and make the system more flexible when change <b>for</b> <b>obsolescence</b> is required. However, currently fielded systems were often not designed with this in mind. Other obsolescence mitigation techniques focus only on the approach to mitigating component-level obsolescence locally without examining the impact of the change on the system as a whole. This thesis combines the recommended approaches <b>for</b> <b>obsolescence</b> mitigation, the experience and lessons learned <b>for</b> <b>obsolescence</b> mitigation on a real-world case study system gained from interviews with key subject matter experts, along with systems engineering techniques for dealing with engineering change in systems to develop a robust systems engineering and management approach <b>for</b> <b>obsolescence</b> in large complex systems. The thesis provides the reader with a flow chart and a clustered DSM of the tasks along with a checklist that could be used with this obsolescence engineering and management approach. by Jaime E.

5000|$|Decoupling {{modification}} {{is a tax}} terminology {{resulting from}} the federal tax law enacted March 9, 2002, which created a new tax deduction for [...] "bonus depreciation" [...] that threatened to cost states very large amounts of revenue.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} those who emphasise that {{designers}} and engineers need to plan <b>for</b> <b>obsolescence</b> are too conservative. Rather, in addition to planning <b>for</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> designers and engineers should also think carefully about {{what they could do}} in order delay obsolescence. They should so this by thinking about the design itself, thinking of ways in which products could be useful and appealing for longer before becoming obsolete, as well thinking about the wider context in terms of the marketing of products, and also the social and legal. The paper also considers objections that these suggestions are unrealistically idealistic, failing to recognise the economic realities. I respond to these objections appealing to research in advertising, psychology, cognitive linguistics, philosophy, history, and economics, as well as drawing on the Statement of Ethical Principles developed by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Engineering Council...|$|R

40|$|Recently, my {{claim that}} {{depreciation}} {{reported in the}} Japanese national accounts is underestimated by a substantial margin has been challenged by Dekle and Summers (NBER Working Paper No. 3690), {{on the ground that}} the implied depreciation rate (ratio of depreciation to the capital stock) is implausibly high. I argue in this rejoinder that Japan's high depreciation rate can be attributable to two factors. First, the <b>depreciation</b> rate <b>for</b> owner-occupied housing is much higher in Japan. Second, equipment capital (a component of the denominator in the depreciation rate) in the Japanese national accounts seems underestimated. Therefore, my estimate of the level of <b>depreciation</b> <b>for</b> Japan does not seem exaggerated. ...|$|R

It is rarely worth redeveloping a product to get around these issues since its overall functionality and price/performance ratio has usually been superseded by that time as well.|$|R

Using cross sectional survey of twenty-seven buildings in Golden Triangle area of Kuala Lumpur, the data collected were analysed using Frequency and Descriptive statistics to establish the rate of <b>depreciation</b> <b>for</b> green and conventional PBO buildings. Furthermore, the correlation and regression techniques {{were used to assess}} the significance of building categories and classifications in influencing the rental depreciation of PBO buildings. This study successfully identifies the average rate of depreciation within the dataset, with 46. 77 percent. In comparison of average depreciation rate between green office buildings and conventional, the rate was observed higher in conventional class as to contrast with green class PBO buildings. Results from the correlation analysis explain the age, building categories and classifications were strongly correlated to the rental depreciation. Lastly, regression results evidenced the building categories and classifications significantly predict the rental depreciation model in 2014...|$|R
