Other {{parts of the}} protocol specify the finial (the metal ornament on a flag pole) as diamond-shaped and colored in a yellow metal.

5|$|Described by Kartodikromo as an {{extended}} simile, Student Hidjo {{has been noted}} as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets. Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two are incompatible. This includes love, which is described in the novel as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find; the traditional view being that marriage <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for social mobility.|$|E
5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E

Bond would be identified as British upon its destruction, increasing the evidence against the British Government. Bond survives the predicted Afghan attack and plots an escape attempt, which sees Scarlett get away due to Bond surrendering himself as a diversion. In the morning he is taken aboard the aeroplane. Before the airliner can bomb the Soviets, {{with the aid of}} the airliner's pilot and Scarlett (who had been hiding on board), Bond regains control of the aeroplane and crashes it into a mountainside after parachuting to safety.|$|E
5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in the discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E
5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture with them that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders {{used for this purpose}} are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with the regulator pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of marine}} mammals by the Navy, even in {{accordance}} with the Navy's policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy's policy says that only positive reinforcement <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for {{in accordance with}} accepted standards in animal care. The inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals' natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of muzzles and other inhibitors, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers' control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are hauled in dry carriers, and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.|$|E
