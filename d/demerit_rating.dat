40|$|Background: Distal radius {{fractures}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} common fractures of skeletal system and because of the aging of population, its incidence is rising. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the close reduction and percutaneous pin fixation as a treatment option. Material and methods: 44 patients who were type 2 according to universal classification or type 2 or 3 according to Older classification studied for 3 years at 6 months period. Fractures reduced under general anesthesia with Image intensifier and fixed with 2 pins. Results evaluated radiologically in term of radial length, radial inclination and volar tilt and clinically by <b>demerit</b> point <b>rating</b> system. Results: Excellent results were achieved in 68 % of patients radiologically and in 84 % clinically by <b>Demerit</b> point <b>rating</b> system with no obvious deformity in wrist and no complication affected gross function of the patients. Conclusion: Putting the simplicity and minimal invasiveness of the operation and low complication rates, close reduction and percuteneous pin fixation is an appropriate way to treat distal metaphyseal radius fracture...|$|R
