Powered by a 105 hp (78 kW) Daimler engine, the 10 ft {{armoured}} box was initially {{fitted with a}} low Bullock caterpillar. A rotating top turret was planned with a 40 mm gun but abandoned due to weight problems, leaving the final vehicle unarmed and {{little more than a}} test-bed for the difficult track system. Difficulties with the commercial tracks supplied led to Tritton designing a completely new track system different from, and vastly more robust than, any other system then in use. The next design by Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson RNAS, a pre-war motor engineer, added a larger track frame to the hull of [...] "Little Willie". In order to achieve the demanded <b>gap</b> <b>clearance</b> a rhomboidal shape was chosen - stretching the form to improve the track footprint and climbing capacity. To keep a low centre of gravity the rotating turret design was dropped in favour of sponsons {{on the sides of the}} hull fitted with naval 6-pounder (57 mm) guns.

40|$|A {{study of}} engine oil {{consumption}} (OC) was conducted both theoretically and experimentally. It {{was found that}} oil blowing into the combustion chamber through the top ring gap (termed ‘reversed oil’) and oil returning to the crankcase through the oil ring gap (termed ‘blowby oil’) are important factors affecting OC. It was also observed that depending on the ring <b>gap</b> <b>clearance,</b> enlarged because of ring wear (for example the radial ring wear of 50 pm corresponds to a gap enlargement of roughly 0. 31 mm) or non-optimal ring <b>gap</b> <b>clearance</b> and inter-ring volume, the 2 nd land pressure can exceed cylinder pressure-leading to increasing reversed oil and consequently higher OC. The deterioration of OC with increasing operation has been traced to lowered oil-scraping capability with ring wear. This is true. However, the above-mentioned phenomenon {{can be considered as}} another reason for such OC.

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of laser welding {{technology has been}} considered to shipbuilding structure. However, when this technology is applied to primer-coated steel, good quality weld beads are not easily obtained. Because the primer-coated layer caused the spatter, humping bead and porosity which are {{main part of the}} welding defect attributed to the powerful vaporizing pressure of zinc. So we performed experiment with objectives of understanding spatter and porosity formation mechanism and producing sound weld beads in 6 t primer coated steels by a CO 2 CW laser. The effects of welding parameters; defocused distance, welding speed, coated thickness and coated position; were investigated in the bead shape and penetration depth on bead and lap welding. Alternative idea was suggested to suspend the welding defect by giving a reasonable <b>gap</b> <b>clearance</b> for primer coated thickness. The zinc of primer has a boiling point that is lower than melting point of steel. Zinc vapor builds up at the interface between the two sheets and this tends to deteriorate the quality of the weld by ejecting weld material from lap position or leaving porosity. Significant effects of primer coated position were lap side rather than surface. Therefore introducing a small <b>gap</b> <b>clearance</b> in the lap position, the zinc vapor could escape through it and sound weld beads can be acquired. In conclusion, formation and suspension mechanism of the welding defects was suggested by controlling the factors...|$|E

The different factors determining the extent of the leakage flow are thoroughly examined. Also, since the guide vane facing plate and the head covers are exposed to serious wear due to the presence of sand particles in a high accelerating flow, efficiency measurements of sand eroded and repaired turbines are presented. In addition, results from efficiency measurements of Francis turbines with different <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps</b> are included to underline the severity of the <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> between the covers and the guide vanes. The thesis presents a numerical approach to calculate the head covers deflection.

Furthermore, a discussion of the efficiency with respect to the design of the head covers is performed to describe the potential of increasing the hydraulic efficiency by altering the design method.

30|$|In general, {{lubrication}} is {{the most}} promising solution to reduce friction. However, lubrication becomes difficult when the dimensions of machine elements decrease from macro- to micro/nano-scale. For example, as {{the size of the}} machine elements shrinks from 1  mm to 1  μm, the surface area decreases by a factor of 106 whereas the volume decreases by a factor of 109, yielding the surface area-to-volume ratio of 103. Hence, surface forces such as adhesion and friction become significantly influential at such small scales. Further in miniaturized devices, the <b>gap</b> (<b>clearance)</b> between the elements is small (< 1  μm), which prohibits the use of conventional liquid and/or solid lubricants. For example, a drop of liquid lubricant will be in millimeter size and the size of solid lubricants such as graphite or MoS 2 is of the same order as the size of the miniaturized devices. In addition, retention of lubricants at the contact points between the moving elements could be a hurdle for further implementation. Thus, minimizing surface forces in miniaturized devices has remained a real challenge.|$|E
40|$|In Francis turbine, a small <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> {{between the}} guide vanes and the cover plates is usually {{required}} to pivot guide vanes {{as a part}} of governing system. Deflection of cover plates and erosion of mating surfaces causes this gap to increase from its design value. The <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> induces the secondary flow in the distributor system.

40|$|In gas turbines, {{the blades}} of axial turbine stages rotate in close {{proximity}} to a stationary peripheral wall. Differential expansion of the turbine wheel, blades, and the shroud causes variations {{in the size of the}} <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> between blade tip and stationary shroud. The necessity to tolerate this differential thermal expansion dictates that the <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> cannot be eliminated altogether, despite accurate engine machining. Pressure differences between the pressure and suction sides of a blade drives a flow through the <b>clearance</b> <b>gap.</b> This flow, the tip leakage flow, is detrimental to engine performance.

Single blade centrifugal pump impellers are the extreme example of impeller design, with gross deviation from conventional design practice. A time accurate three-dimensional viscous flow simulation is performed, using the multiple frames of reference sliding mesh technique, at different flow rates (q = Q/Qdesign = 0. 5 to 1. 5) and varying tip <b>gap</b> <b>clearances.</b> Time marching is controlled through the use of an implicit Second Order Backward Euler scheme with a physical timestep, corresponding to 6 ° impeller rotation.

The results obtained show quantitative agreement with physical test results in terms of global performance characteristics such as head developed and power consumption. One particular phenomenon highlighted in the results is the periodic pressure fluctuation due to interaction between impeller and volute. This is significantly exaggerated by the single blade impeller.

The hemolysis index for 50 -microm tip gap was found to be less than 200 -microm gap, despite increased shear rate.
