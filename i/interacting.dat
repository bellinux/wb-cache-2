50|$|Protein that {{attributes}} for CABP1 Gene is homodimer. It <b>interacts</b> with ITPR1, ITPR2 and ITPR3 via C-terminus. The binding is calcium {{dependent and}} the interaction correlates with calcium concentration. CABP1 also <b>interacts</b> with CACNA1A in the pre and post synaptic membranes via C-terminal calcium binding motif. It also <b>interacts</b> with CACNA1C via C-terminal C and IQ motifs.

5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an <b>interacting</b> photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level.

The emitted photon and the <b>interacting</b> photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.|$|E

40|$|AbstractROPs {{constitute}} {{a family of}} plant-specific, RHO-like small GTPases that serve as molecular switches {{in a wide range}} of signaling pathways. The activities of ROPs are regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). ROP 11, a member of the ROP GTPase family in Arabidopsis, is a negative regulator of multiple ABA responses. In this study, we show that ROPGEF 1 and ROPGEF 4 <b>interact</b> with ROP 11 on plasma membranes in guard cells. Furthermore, our analyses of ROPGEF 1 / 4 knockout mutants and overexpressing lines suggested that ROPGEF 1 and ROPGEF 4 are specific regulators of ROP 11 function in ABA-mediated stomatal closure.

5|$|In 1990, Andrew Strominger {{published}} a similar result which suggested that strongly <b>interacting</b> strings in ten dimensions {{might have an}} equivalent description in terms of weakly <b>interacting</b> five-dimensional branes. Initially, physicists were unable to prove this relationship for two important reasons. On the one hand, the Montonen–Olive duality was still unproven, and so Strominger's conjecture was even more tenuous. On the other hand, there were many technical {{issues related to the}} quantum properties of five-dimensional branes. The first of these problems was solved in 1993 when Ashoke Sen established that certain physical theories require the existence of objects with both electric and magnetic charge which were predicted by the work of Montonen and Olive.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories.

This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNel-like protein 1 (NELL- 1) is an osteoinductive {{molecule}} {{associated with}} premature calvarial suture closure.

NELL- 1 and APR 3 colocalized on the nuclear envelope of human osteoblasts. NELL- 1 significantly inhibited proliferation of osteoblasts co-transfected with APR 3 through further down-regulation of Cyclin D 1.
