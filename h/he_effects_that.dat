Then with a sudden spring he tore the baton out of the hand of one of his guardians, leaped upon the pedestal, and showered his blows upon the lovely marble woman. With a crack and a dull thud her right arm dropped to the ground. Another fierce blow and the left had followed. Flaccus danced and screamed with horror, while his servants dragged the raving iconoclast from his impassive victim. Domitian's brutal laughter echoed through the hall.|$|R

2500|$|Poplar {{was a very}} left-wing Labour council. Key was {{not among}} the most left-wing (he professed himself as a loyal subject of the King), but he was fully {{supportive}} of the campaign {{to improve the lives}} of the poor of the borough: in 1925 he was to write that most of the population [...] "live on the verge of destitution". <b>He</b> saw the <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> poverty had on the children at his school.

5000|$|He came up {{with this}} term while he was working on his [...] "two factor theory" [...] which states that both {{satisfaction}} (e.g. job satisfaction) and dissatisfaction are driven by separate factors that are completely independent of each other.

[...] Brandeis saw no reason why two essentially identical transactions should be treated differently for tax purposes.|$|R
