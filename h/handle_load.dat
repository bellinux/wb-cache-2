40|$|Obesity {{prevalence}} {{is increasing}} among the Portuguese workforce, similarly to other industrial countries. Obesity seems to negatively affect the individuals’ work capacity.

The participants were asked to go through 6 lifting trials with different occupational conditions and, for each task tested, they reported physical loading by using the Borg’ “Category Ratio- 10 ” (CR- 10) scale.

40|$|The user {{growth in}} Internet {{services}} for the past years has caused a need to re-think methods for user authentication, authorization and accounting for network providers.

This can be achieved by using loadbalancing, and there are both adaptive and non-adaptive methods of loadbalancing. This case study compares adaptive and non-adaptive loadbalancing for user authentication in terms of average throughput. To do this we set up a lab where we test two different load-balancing methods; a non-adaptive and a adaptive. The non-adaptive load balancing method is simple, only using a pool of servers to direct the load to in a round-robin way, whereas the adaptive load balancing method tries to direct the load using a calculation of the previous requests...|$|E
40|$|A {{multiprocessor}} {{virtual machine}} benefits its guest operating system in supporting scalable job throughput and request latency—useful properties in server consolidation where servers require {{several of the}} system processors for steady state or to <b>handle</b> <b>load</b> bursts. Typical operating systems, optimized for multiprocessor systems {{in their use of}} spin-locks for critical sections, can defeat flexible virtual machine scheduling due to lock-holder preemption and misbalanced load. The virtual machine must assist the guest operating system to avoid lock-holder preemption and to schedule jobs with knowledge of asymmetric processor allocation. We want to support a virtual machine environment with flexible scheduling policies, while maximizing guest performance. This paper presents solutions to avoid lock-holder preemption for both fully virtualized and paravirtualized environments. Experiments show that we can nearly eliminate the effects of lock-holder preemption. Furthermore, the paper presents a scheduler feedback mechanism that despite the presence of asymmetric processor allocation achieves optimal and fair load balancing in the guest operating system. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} pull-based data synchronization issues {{between a}} source and its replicas in P 2 P networks. Under continuous information change and lazy synchronization, these systems are highly susceptible to serving outdated content, which negatively affects their performance and user satisfaction. To understand these scenarios, we first introduce a novel model {{of interaction between}} two stochastic point processes – updates at the source and downloads at the replica – and derive {{the probability that a}} random query against the replica retrieves fresh content. Unlike prior work, we assume non-Poisson dy-namics and determine statistical properties of the replication process that make it perform better for a given download rate. The second half of the paper applies these results to several more difficult algorithms – cascaded replication, cooperative caching, and redundant querying from the clients. Surprisingly, we discover that optimal cooperation involves just a single peer and that redundant querying can hurt the ability of the system to <b>handle</b> <b>load</b> (i. e., may lead to lower scalability).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient noniterative method for distribution state estimation using conditional multivariate complex Gaussian distribution (CMCGD). In the proposed method, {{the mean and}} standard deviation (SD) of the state variables is obtained in one step considering load uncertainties, measurement errors, and load correlations. In this method, first the bus voltages, branch currents, and injection currents are represented by MCGD using direct load flow and a linear transformation. Then, the mean and SD of bus voltages, or other states, are calculated using CMCGD and estimation of variance method. The mean and SD of pseudo measurements, as well as spatial correlations between pseudo measurements, are modeled based on the historical data for different levels of load duration curve. The proposed method can <b>handle</b> <b>load</b> uncertainties without using time-consuming approaches such as Monte Carlo. Simulation results of two case studies, six-bus, and a realistic 747 -bus distribution network show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of speed, accuracy, and quality against the conventional approach...|$|E
