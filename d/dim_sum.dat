50|$|Hong Kong is a {{place with}} plenty of night life. In contrast, streets are almost empty from seven to eight in the morning. Most shops open at or after nine o'clock in the morning, where Cantonese {{restaurants}} open at about six or even earlier (restaurants in the Western District open at about 4:00am). The working class of Hong Kong usually have breakfast in these Cantonese restaurants in the early morning. They enjoy 一盅兩件 (Lit. One bowl with two pieces, meaning {{a cup of tea}} with two <b>Dim</b> <b>sums)</b> and they read newspapers in the morning before they go to work.

25|$|During the 1920s, {{as there}} were tough {{competitions}} between department stores in attracting more customers, the chef of each department store would invent a new <b>dim</b> <b>sum</b> or dessert weekly (每週美點) as an attraction, {{and that was when}} egg tarts first appeared in Guangzhou.

50|$|The game {{features}} a strong mix {{of fact and}} fiction from Chinese History and often exaggerates characters and their personalities, for example Lu Bu is portrayed as a virtually unbeatable, violent maniac.

The three kingdoms primarily involved, Shu, Wu and Wei, each sought power enough to overthrow the other two and unify China under their rule. Although the story in Dynasty Warriors is not perfect {{in the sense that it}} does not accurately follow the historical events, it has been changed to make the game more playable and less repetitive. For example, a number of the characters in the game died in the time frame that the game is set, but they still appear in later stages.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to estimate the genetic parameters of body condition score (BCS) in the first 3 lactations in Canadian Holstein dairy cattle using a multiple-lactation random regression animal model. Field staff from Valacta milk recording agency (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC, Canada) collected BCS from Quebec herds several times throughout each lactation. Approximately 32, 000, 20, 000, and 11, 000 first-, second-, and third-parity BCS were analyzed, respectively, from a total of 75 herds. Body condition score was a moderately heritable trait over the lactation for parity 1, 2, and 3, with average daily heritabilities of 0. 22, 0. 26, and 0. 30, respectively. Daily heritability ranged between 0. 14 and 0. 26, 0. 19 and 0. 28, and 0. 24 and 0. 33 for parity 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Genetic variance of BCS increased with days in milk within lactations. The low genetic variance in early lactation suggests that the evolution of the ability to mobilize tissue reserves in early lactation provided cattle with a major advantage, and is, therefore, somewhat conserved. The increasing genetic variance suggests that more genetic differences were related to how well cows recovered from the negative energy balance state. More specifically, increasing genetic variation as lactation progressed could be a reflection of genetic differences in the ability of cows to efficiently control the rate of mobilization of tissue reserves, which would not be crucial in early lactation. The shape of BCS curves was similar across parities. From first to third parity, differences included the progressively deeper nadir and faster rate of recovery of condition. Daily genetic correlations between parities were calculated from 5 to 305 <b>DIM,</b> and were <b>summed</b> and divided by 301 to obtain average daily genetic correlations. The average daily genetic correlations were 0. 84 between parity 1 and 2, 0. 83 between parity 1 and 3, and 0. 86 between parity 2 and 3. Although not 1, these genetic correlations are still strong, so much of the variation observed in BCS was controlled by the same genes for each of the first 3 lactations. If a genetic evaluation for BCS is developed, regular collection of first-lactation BCS records should be sufficient for genetic evaluation. Peer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|As the {{plantations}} of the Big Five expanded, {{the demand}} for labor grew, so the plantation owners hired immigrant workers, which included Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Filipinos, and Portuguese.

Bengalis make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including rôshogolla, chômchôm, kalojam and several kinds of sondesh. Pitha, a kind of sweet cake, bread or <b>dim</b> <b>sum</b> are specialties of winter season. Sweets like coconut-naru, til-naru, moa, and payesh are prepared during the festival of Lakshmi puja.

Other objects like Ba gua mirrors are still regularly used to deflect evil spirits, and buildings often lack any floor number that has a 4 in it, due to its similarity to the word for [...] "die" [...] in Cantonese.
