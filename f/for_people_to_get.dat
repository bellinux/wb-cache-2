This become the dominant route <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> from Stavanger to cities along the South Coast, as well as to Oslo. In addition to passengers, major cargo shipments included seasonal shipments of herring, as well as lumber from the surrounding areas.

Considered in determining value was the scarcity, time, sacrifice, and difficulties involved in getting the object.|$|E

The maintenance of airstrips is a Local Level Government responsibility, and many LLGs in the surrounding area are severely underfunded.|$|E
25|$|Lava {{flows in}} the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province {{are among the}} least hazardous, even though they can be {{enormously}} destructive to property in their path. This is because lava generally moves slowly enough <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of their way, though this {{is dependent on the}} viscosity of the lava. Lava flows typically have secondary hazards, including the destruction of buildings and ejection of volcanic gases. Forest fires started by lava flows are also a possibility in this part of Canada. The typical lava fountains in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province are commonly associated with lava flows, but these do not normally reach heights more than a few hundred metres. Therefore, the dangers caused by lava fountains are only adjacent to the erupting volcano.|$|E

Harvey Requested that a [...] "Good Roads" [...] meeting be held by the Commercial Club of Rogers; however, they {{did not feel that}} it was their meeting because, while fairly well attended, hardly any Rogers businessmen were present. Harvey assessed the project would cost Rogers $5,000 without their permission or consent, and this estimate was far less than what engineers advising the Rogers businessmen believed the cost would be. Ultimately the [...] "Great White Way" [...] project failed, and Harvey blamed the community of Rogers for lack of support.|$|E

Arnold did not assert that the objects were alien spacecraft, although he did say: [...] "being a natural-born American, if it's not made by our science or our Army Air Forces, I am inclined to believe it's of an extraterrestrial origin."

2500|$|At {{times in}} Egil's saga Egil {{comes across as}} a brute who often acts quickly and irrationally for no reason. He appears to be a shallow {{creature}} and in many instances the only time he appears to put much thought into anything is when he composes and recites poetry. Egil is in reality a man of many virtues which are central to his character. He values honor, loyalty, respect, and friendship above all other things. He takes it as a great personal insult when someone breaks any of these values and as a result he typically destroys that person either through physical force or through poetry. His reactions are usually on a grand scale {{to the point where they}} are often outrageous and entertaining. The value code by which Egil lived was the same as that of many Scandinavians at the time of the story's composition. The story is set in a time when many people were migrating, most notably from Norway to Iceland. [...] Life was harsh, particularly during the long, cold winters, when it was crucial <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along and work together. The character of Egil, despite his many flaws, is ultimately representative of the true Scandinavian spirit.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the main}} {{characteristics}} of Focus Groups are; Focus groups involve people {{in which there is}} a group of usually 4-10 members. The group size depends on the topic. It should be understood that the size should be small enough so that all the members get a chance to share their views and yet, large enough <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> different perspectives (Ogunbameru, 2003).Participants are homogenous and unfamiliar with each other which means that people who have similar ages, ethnic backgrounds, etc. this is because it will help the session very effectively as there won't be too many clashes. It should be noted that the group should not be too homogenous because some amount of heterogeneity is required to get useful information when it comes to recalling past events or religious groups (Ogunbameru, 2003).Focus groups are a data collection procedure where in, the main purpose is to determine the perception, feelings, and manner of thinking. These are not aimed to develop consensus or to arrive at some agreeable plan (Ogunbameru, 2003). Focus groups make use of Qualitative data, which means that the data is collected using qualitative tools, which requires very skilled people. This data provides a great insight into the phenomenological world of the members, taking into consideration the attitude, perceptions, and thoughts (Ogunbameru, 2003). [...] Focus groups have a focused discussion where in the leader maintains focus on a particular topic. This helps the discussion to stay on track as every member has different ideas to pool in about the same topic (Ogunbameru, 2003).|$|E

2500|$|... was {{released}} in 2002 and its expansion pack, , {{was released}} in 2003. The release of these two games brought with them {{a number of new}} features to the online service. The most significant feature to be added was probably the concept of Anonymous Matchmaking. This feature allowed a user who wanted to play a game to simply press a button and automatically be matched up with one or more other players who were similar in skill (based on ranking) and also wanted to play a game. This allowed <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into games quickly and easily. It also reduced win-trading, where two people would purposely win and lose games to artificially raise their rank on the ladder. The matchmaking concept was also expanded to team games in a feature called [...] "Arranged Teams". In an arranged team game, you could make a team with one or more friends, which was then anonymously matched up with another team of the same size and rank. However, a strategy was introduced on how to cheat the automated 'fair' matchups, called 'Abusing', simply by someone losing the Arranged Team Games intentionally with one ally so that with another ally (who wants to gain wins easily) won't find it difficult because the automatic matchups would put the two players up against relatively unskilled players. Automated tournaments were added in the expansion, where players would compete to be crowned tournament champion in a series of games played throughout the day. In addition to the new game styles, a slew of other features were added including selectable chatroom icons unlocked based on the player's number of wins, a friends list, and clan support.|$|E
