50|$|One of {{the earlier}} efforts to obtain better {{high-velocity}} performance involves placing a very shallow cup of copper alloy over {{the base of the}} bullet. This cup resembles a very short jacket, and is called a <b>gas</b> <b>check.</b> Cast bullets require a smaller diameter at the base to accept the <b>gas</b> <b>check.</b> Some <b>gas</b> <b>checks</b> are designed to crimp onto the base of the bullet, while others have a looser fit.|$|R
50|$|A <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> is {{a gasket}} type {{component}} of firearms ammunition. Gas checks are used when non-jacketed bullets {{are used in}} high pressure cartridges. The use of a <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> inhibits the buildup of lead in the barrel and improves accuracy.|$|R

5000|$|While most {{commercial}} cartridges {{operating at}} high pressure use jacketed bullets, <b>gas</b> <b>checked</b> bullets are popular with [...] "handloaders" [...] who can recycle lead to make cast bullets, and then must only {{pay for the}} <b>gas</b> <b>check.</b> Custom lead bullets, such as those for obsolete calibers, wildcat cartridges, or for special purposes, are easily made with inexpensive casting or swaging equipment. In contrast, manufacturing jacketed bullets requires far more expensive equipment to draw the jackets and swage in the core, so is generally limited to commercial ammunition producers. As a result, although {{it is possible for}} hobbyists to manufacture jacketed bullets, many of them take the easier option and use <b>gas</b> <b>checked</b> bullets instead.|$|R

5000|$|Later the {{rotation}} was effected by a cupped copper disc called an [...] "automatic gas-check" [...] {{attached to the}} base end of the projectile. The powder gas pressure expanded {{the rim of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> into the rifling grooves and prevented the escape of gas; it also firmly fixed the <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> to the projectile, thus causing it to rotate. A more regular and efficient action of the powder gas was thus ensured, with a corresponding greater range and an improvement in accuracy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} use of <b>gas</b> <b>checks</b> {{is in the}} [...]44 Magnum, [...]357 Magnum, and 10mm Auto which were {{developed}} from non-magnum cartridges by shooters such as Elmer Keith. By loading the large capacity cases designed for black powder with large charges of smokeless powder, velocities well in excess of 1000 ft/s (300 m/s) were produced from handguns for the first time. At these velocities and pressures traditional soft lead bullets would quickly foul the barrel with lead deposits, so <b>gas</b> <b>checked</b> bullets were used in these experimental cartridges.|$|R
2500|$|Such {{cast lead}} bullets, {{intended}} for use with a <b>gas</b> <b>check,</b> will have a reduced diameter {{at the rear of}} the cast lead bullet, onto which the <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> can be swaged using a lubricating/resizing press. [...] All cast lead bullets, whether with or without a <b>gas</b> <b>check,</b> must still be lubricated, to prevent leading of the rifling of the barrel. [...] A lubricating/resizing press, which is a special purpose bullet processing press, can be either a standalone press dedicated to lubricating and resizing bullets, or can be an add-on to a reloading press, at the option of the handloader. [...] Not all handloaders resize cast lead bullets, although all handloaders do lubricate cast lead bullets. [...] An option to using a lubricating press is simply to coat the bullets with bullet lube, which can be done either with a spray, in a tumbler, in a plastic bowel with a liquid lube, in a tray with melted bullet lube, or even with a manual lubricating process.|$|R
5000|$|... 46- and 70 cwt guns {{differed}} {{in number and}} type of rifling grooves so studded projectiles were only available for 46 cwt guns, and different automatic <b>gas</b> <b>checks</b> were required for studless projectiles.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} wadcutter types exist: HBWC (Hollow Base Wadcutter), DEWC (Double-ended wadcutters), BBWC (Beveled-Base Wadcutters), and SWC (Semi-Wadcutters). HBWC rounds are best used at only the lowest velocities, as by being hollow {{at the rear}} end, they can split under heavy loads. DEWC rounds are best suited for {{automatic}} press reloading uses, {{as they may be}} used when loaded with either end pointed forward. BBWC have been developed to permit easier bullet insertion into the case when reloading. SWC rounds were developed to permit them to be loaded in either semi-automatic pistols or revolvers, where the rounded bullet shape often works better with feed ramps on semi-automatic pistols, and they are often used for heavy loads intended either for hunting or for self-defense. Some SWC bullet designs have a smaller diameter rear end, making these bullets suitable for use with <b>gas</b> <b>checks.</b> Properly lubricated SWC bullets with <b>gas</b> <b>checks</b> are suitable for use at velocities exceeding 1700 ft/s (518 m/s), the <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> reducing leading within the bore.|$|R
50|$|The gun was {{the first}} British rifled muzzle-loader to {{dispense}} entirely with studs on shells to impart spin : its shells from the beginning had <b>gas</b> <b>checks</b> attached to their base which expanded and engaged with rifling on firing to impart spin to the shell.|$|R
50|$|The Mod 3 guns, Nos. 211-216, {{were the}} last new guns built, all other Mods were Mod 0, 2, or 3 guns that were modified. These guns were built with a new {{simplified}} design, no liner, five hoops, a locking ring, along with a screw-box liner and a different <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> seat.|$|R

50|$|The British {{subsequently}} {{developed a}} cup-type launcher {{to replace the}} rod-type rifle-grenade. In this design, a can-shaped launcher {{was attached to the}} muzzle of the rifle and a <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> disc was screwed onto the base of the grenade before the grenade was placed in the launcher. The safety pin could then be removed as the launcher cup kept the safety-spoon in place. The operator inserted the blank cartridge into the rifle before setting the stock, angled on the ground to absorb the recoil of the weapon. When the cartridge was fired it pushed the grenade out of the cup releasing the spoon. The cup-type launcher could launch the grenade about 200 yards. Lee-Enfield rifles equipped with the cup launcher were modified with copper wire wrapped around the stock, to prevent the wood from cracking under the increased recoil. If necessary, both the rod and the <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> grenade could be thrown as a standard hand-grenade.|$|R
5000|$|Palliser {{shot was}} made of cast iron, the head being chilled in casting to harden it, using {{composite}} molds with a metal, water-cooled portion for the head. At times there were defects that led to cracking in the projectiles, but these were overcome with time. Bronze studs were installed into {{the outside of the}} projectile so as to engage the rifling grooves in the gun barrel. The base had a hollow pocket but was not filled with powder or explosive: the cavity was necessitated by difficulties in casting large solid projectiles without their cracking when they cooled, because the nose and base of the projectiles cooled at different rates, and in fact a larger cavity facilitated a better-quality casting. The hole at the base was threaded to accept a copper <b>gas</b> <b>check.</b> This prevented propellant gases from blowing around the projectile, providing obturation as the driving band had yet to be perfected. Later designs did away with the studs on the projectile body, with the <b>gas</b> <b>checks</b> being set with grooves to impart spin to the projectile.|$|R
50|$|Gas {{checks are}} most {{commonly}} found {{in the form of}} a thin cup or disc made of a ductile metal. Copper, Zinc, Aluminum, and alloys such as brass have been used. A bullet designed to accept a <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> has a rebated base shank which permits attachment of the check without altering the maximum diameter of the bullet. The shallow cup-shaped check is mechanically attached to the reduced shank of the bullet by swaging.|$|R
50|$|Pulse oximetry {{measures}} solely hemoglobin saturation, not ventilation {{and is not}} {{a complete}} measure of respiratory sufficiency. It is not a substitute for blood <b>gases</b> <b>checked</b> in a laboratory, because it gives no indication of base deficit, carbon dioxide levels, blood pH, or bicarbonate (HCO3−) concentration. The metabolism of oxygen can be readily measured by monitoring expired CO2, but saturation figures give no information about blood oxygen content. Most of the oxygen in the blood is carried by hemoglobin; in severe anemia, the blood will carry less total oxygen, despite the hemoglobin being 100% saturated.|$|R
50|$|In 1878, the British {{adopted a}} copper 'gas-check' {{at the base}} of their studded {{projectiles}} and in 1879 tried a rotating <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> to replace the studs, leading to the 1881 automatic gas-check. This was soon followed by the Vavaseur copper driving band as part of the projectile. The driving band rotated the projectile, centred it in the bore and prevented gas escaping forwards. A driving band has to be soft but tough enough to prevent stripping by rotational and engraving stresses. Copper is generally most suitable but cupro nickel or gilding metal were also used.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{a simple}} approach, {{launching}} a rod grenade [...] "...placed an extreme amount of {{stress on the}} rifle barrel and the rifle itself, resulting in the need to dedicate specific rifles to the grenade launching role, as they quickly became useless as an accurate firearm. This led {{to the search for}} an alternative and resulted in the reappearance of the cup launcher during the latter years of World War I". After World War I, the rod-type rifle grenade was declared obsolete and the remaining Hales were replaced with <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> equipped Mills Bombs shot from a rifle via a cup launcher.|$|R

5000|$|Lead: Simple cast, extruded, swaged, or {{otherwise}} fabricated lead slugs are the simplest form of bullets. At speeds of greater than 300 m/s (1000 ft/s) (common in most handguns), lead is deposited in rifled bores at an ever-increasing rate. Alloying the lead {{with a small}} percentage of tin and/or antimony serves to reduce this effect, but grows less effective as velocities are increased. A cup made of harder metal, such as copper, placed {{at the base of the}} bullet and called a <b>gas</b> <b>check,</b> is often used to decrease lead deposits by protecting the rear of the bullet against melting when fired at higher pressures, but this too does not solve the problem at higher velocities.|$|R
50|$|High pressures, such {{as those}} {{commonly}} encountered in maximum loadings of magnum revolver cartridges or rifle cartridges, often result in significant problems when coupled with cast or swaged lead bullets. It was long thought that the high temperatures melted {{the base of the}} bullet, but this is no longer thought to be the case. Instead, the high pressures allow propellant gas to escape past the bullet, causing gas cutting, which increases lead deposits in the barrel and unbalances the bullet. A <b>gas</b> <b>check</b> provides a thin layer of harder but still malleable metal on the base of the bullet that obturates to provide a seal and prevents the propellant gas leakage that causes gas cutting, and help the bullet grip the rifling.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other common}} use of <b>gas</b> <b>checked</b> bullets is in {{obsolete}} military rifles. Many of these rifles used calibers that were {{unique to the}} rifle; low levels of commercial production and dwindling supplies of surplus ammunition quickly result in high ammunition prices. Many of these rifles use unusual bore diameters; for example, the [...]303 British and Soviet 7.62×54mmR use bore diameters larger than US [...]30/7.62 mm standard bullets, resulting in a much smaller supply of suitable bullets—often just a single {{full metal jacket bullet}} design in the weight used by the military loading. Custom made bullets also allow the bullet to be carefully sized to match the bore, which can vary considerably in surplus rifles, and provide both more accuracy and more flexibility. Gas checks allow these bullets to be pushed to higher velocities without undue fouling of the barrel and attendant problems.|$|R

50|$|Probably no {{invention}} {{connected with}} firearms has wrought such {{changes in the}} principle of gun construction as those effected by the “expansive cartridge case.” This invention has completely revolutionized the art of gun making, has been successfully applied to all descriptions of firearms, and has produced a new and important industry: that of cartridge manufacture. Its essential feature is preventing gas escaping the breech when the gun is fired, {{by means of an}} expansive cartridge case containing its own means of ignition. Previous to this invention shotguns and sporting rifles were loaded by means of powder flasks and shot bags or flasks, bullets, wads and copper caps, all carried separately. One of the earliest efficient modern cartridge cases was the pinfire cartridge, developed by French gunsmith Casimir Lefaucheux in 1836. It consisted of a thin weak shell made of brass and paper that expanded from the force of the explosion. This fit perfectly in the barrel, and thus formed an efficient <b>gas</b> <b>check.</b> A small percussion cap was placed {{in the middle of the}} base of the cartridge, and was ignited by means of a brass pin projecting from the side and struck by the hammer. This pin also afforded the means of extracting the cartridge case. This cartridge was introduced in England by Lang, of Cockspur Street, London, about 1845.|$|R
