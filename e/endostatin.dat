5000|$|<b>Endostatin</b> {{may prevent}} {{activity}} from certain metalloproteinase. [...] Several {{studies have focused}} on the downstream effects of <b>endostatin</b> reception. These studies have estimated that <b>endostatin</b> may significantly affect 12% of genes used by human endothelial cells. Although <b>endostatin</b> signaling may affect this vast number of genes, the downstream affects appear surprisingly limited. <b>Endostatin</b> reception seems to only affect angiogenesis that arrives from pathogenic sources, such as tumors. Processes associated with angiogenesis, such as wound healing and reproduction, are seemingly not affected by <b>endostatin.</b> The result is possible because pathogenic-derived angiogenesis usually involves signaling through integrins, which are directly affected by <b>endostatin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Endostatin</b> is {{currently}} being studied as part of cancer research. Prior results indicated that <b>endostatin</b> can be beneficial in combinations with other medicines, but <b>endostatin</b> alone gave no significant improvements in tumor/disease progression.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{this process}} by which <b>endostatin</b> works is not fully understood, it {{involves}} metalloproteases and endopeptidases that digest components of the extracellular matrix. Several similar endogeneous angiogenic factors are produced from matrix components in this fashion. For example, perlecan degradation can yield endorepellin which functions as an anti-angiogenic factor. Collectively, these products are thought to balance regulation between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors outside epithelial and endothelial layers. Among anti-angiogenesis inhibitors, <b>endostatin</b> has {{a wide range of}} anti-cancer spectrum targets, increasing its significance since synthetic inhibitors usually have single targets and struggle with toxicity. [...] <b>Endostatin</b> has several characteristics that may be advantageous to cancer therapy. First of all, endogenous <b>endostatin</b> has been described as “the least toxic anti-cancer drug in mice”. Furthermore, neither resistance nor toxicity to <b>endostatin</b> occur in humans [...] Also, <b>endostatin</b> has been estimated to affect 12% of the human genome. This reveals a broad spectrum of activity focused on preventing angiogenesis. This is very different from single-molecule therapies, and may change how cancer therapies are designed: drugs may be designed to target a wide range of genes instead of one particular protein. However, <b>endostatin</b> does not affect all tumors. For example, cancers that may have extreme pro-angiogenic activity through VEGF may overcome the anti-angiogenic effects of <b>endostatin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Human monomeric <b>endostatin</b> is a {{globular}} protein containing two disulfide bonds: Cys162−302 and Cys264−294. [...] It folds tightly, has a zinc binding domain at the N-terminus of the protein, {{and has a}} high affinity for heparin through an 11 arginine basic patch. [...] <b>Endostatin</b> also binds all heparan sulfate proteoglycans with low affinity. [...] Oligomeric <b>endostatin</b> (trimer or dimer) binds mainly with laminin of the basal lamina.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Endostatin</b> {{suppresses}} angiogenesis {{through many}} pathways affecting both cell viability and movement. <b>Endostatin</b> represses cell cycle control and anti-apoptosis genes in proliferating endothelial cells, resulting in cell death. [...] <b>Endostatin</b> blocks pro-angiogenic gene expression controlled by c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) by interfering with TNFα activation of JNK. [...] It reduces {{the growth of}} new cells by inhibiting cyclin D1. As a result, cells arrest during G1 phase and enter apoptosis. [...] Alteration of FGF signal transduction by <b>endostatin</b> inhibits the migration of endothelial cells through disruption of cell-matrix adhesions, cell-cell adhesions, and cytoskeletal reorganization. [...] By binding integrin α5β1 on endothelia cells it inhibits the signaling pathways of Ras and Raf kinases and decreases ERK-1 and p38 activity. [...] <b>Endostatin</b> binding and clustering of integrins causes co-localization with caveolin-1 and activates non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and mobility. [...] Other receptor interactions include the VEGF-R2/KDR/Flk-1 receptor on human umbilical vein endothelial cells.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Endostatin</b> is an {{endogenous}} inhibitor of angiogenesis.

[...] Collagen is a component of epithelial and endothelial basement membranes. <b>Endostatin,</b> as a fragment of collagen 18, demonstrates a role of the ECM in suppression of neoangiogenesis. [...] Pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors can also be created by proteolysis during coagulation cascades. [...] Endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis are present in both normal tissue and cancerous tissue. [...] Overall, <b>endostatin</b> down regulates many signaling cascades like ephrin, TNF-α, and NFκB signaling as well as coagulation and adhesion cascades. [...] Other collagen derived antiangiogenic factors include arresten, canstatin, tumstatin, α 6 collagen type IV antiangiogenic fragment, and restin.|$|E

50|$|In a Phase II {{clinical}} trial of <b>Endostatin,</b> 42 patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors or carcinoid tumors were treated. Of the 40 patients {{which could be}} evaluated for a radiologic response, none experienced partial response to therapy, as defined by World Health Organization criteria.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 Michael O"Reilly, {{working in}} the Folkman lab with Entremed funding, {{discovered}} the first endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin and then another, <b>endostatin.</b> Entremed began developing them and soon struck a collaboration with Bristol-Myers, which caught national interest and spurred further investment in angiogenesis inhibitors by other pharma companies.|$|E
5000|$|In a Phase I {{clinical}} trial of <b>Endostatin,</b> of the 19 patients treated, 12 were switched {{out of the}} trial by their physicians due to continued progression of their disease. [...] Two patients continued to be treated, and the remaining patients withdrew on their own. The trial, designed primarily to demonstrate safety, indeed showed that the drug was safe and well-tolerated (at the dosages used).|$|E
5000|$|Tumstatin is {{a protein}} {{fragment}} cleaved from collagen {{that serves as}} both an antiangiogenic and proapoptotic agent. It has similar function to canstatin, <b>endostatin,</b> restin, and arresten, which also affect angiogenesis. [...] Angiogenesis is the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing blood vessels, and is important in tumor growth and metastasis. Angiogenesis is stimulated by many growth factors, the most prevalent of which is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).|$|E
5000|$|Identification of pleural fluid {{biomarkers}} {{to distinguish}} malignant pleural effusions from other causes of exudative effusions would help diagnosis. Biomarkers {{that have been}} shown to be raised in malignant pleural effusions compared to benign disease include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), <b>endostatin,</b> matrix metalloproteinases and tumour markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen. [...] Pleural fluid mesothelin has a sensitivity of 71%, greater than that of cytology, and a specificity of 89% for the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma.|$|E
50|$|Tumstatin is a 28 kDa {{fragment}} cleaved from collagen type IV There are two subsegments of the peptide {{that are}} active; T3 peptide and T7 peptide. The structure {{is very similar}} to that of <b>endostatin,</b> which is cleaved from collagen XVIII. The two proteins share 14% amino acid identity, making them very similar in structure. It has been proven to inhibit many types of cells, including bovine endothelial cells, HeLa cells, endothelial cells, and Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cells.|$|E
50|$|A phase III {{clinical}} trial {{was carried out}} on 493 histology or cytology-confirmed stage IIIB and IV NSCLC patients with a life expectancy >3 months. Patients were treated with Endostar (rh-endostatin, YH-16), a recombinant <b>endostatin</b> product, in combination with vinorelbine and cisplatin (a standard chemotherapeutic regimen). The addition of Endostar to the standard chemotherapeutic regimen in these advanced NSCLC patients resulted in significant and clinically meaningful improvement in response rate, median time to progression, and clinical benefit rate compared with the chemotherapeutic regimen alone.|$|E
50|$|Angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) is an {{essential}} part of the formation of large tumour masses. Angiogenesis can be inhibited by the expression of several genes, which can be delivered to cancer cells in viral vectors, resulting in suppression of angiogenesis, and oxygen starvation in the tumour. The infection of cells with viruses containing the genes for angiostatin and <b>endostatin</b> synthesis inhibited tumour growth in mice. Enhanced antitumour activities have been demonstrated in a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding anti-angiogenic therapeutic antibody and with an HSV1716 variant expressing an inhibitor of angiogenesis.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{proteolytic}} fragments or {{domains of}} ECM proteins {{have been reported}} to exert positive or negative activity on angiogenesis. Native proteins which contain such domains with regulatory activity are normally inactive, most likely because they are cryptic segments hidden in the native protein structure. Angiostatin is a 38 kDa plasminogen fragment with angiogenesis inhibitor activity. Angiostatin fragments contain kringle domains which exert their inhibitory activity at several different levels; they inhibit endothelial cell migration and proliferation, increase apoptosis, and modulate the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). <b>Endostatin</b> is a 20 kDa fragment of collagen XVIII. The major role of <b>endostatin</b> is in its ability to potently inhibit endothelial cell migration and induce apoptosis. [...] These effects are mediated by interacting and interfering with various angiogenic related proteins such as integrins and serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. Numerous studies have demonstrated that tropoelastin, the soluble precursor of elastin, or proteolytic elastin fragments have diverse biological properties. Nackman et al. demonstrated that elastase generated elastin fragments mediate several characteristic features of aneurismal disease which correlated to angiogenesis. Osteonectin is a metal binding glycoprotein produced by many cell types including ECs. Lastly, endorepellin is a recently described inhibitor of angiogenesis derived from the carboxy terminus of perlecan. Nanomolar concentrations of endorepellin inhibits EC migration and angiogenesis in different in vitro and in vivo models by blocking EC adhesion to various substrate such as fibronectin and type I collagen.|$|E
50|$|Proteases {{not only}} {{facilitate}} angiogenesis, {{but they also}} have the ability to put the brakes on the process. One example of this is the processing of angiogenesis inhibitors by MMPs. As previously described, MMPs have been shown to cleave plasminogen and collagen XVIII into the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors angiostatin and <b>endostatin.</b> MMP-2 itself possesses anti-angiogenic properties that are independent of its catalytic domain. Interactions between integrin αvβ3 and MMP-2 on the EC cell surface may be necessary for MMP-2 activity during angiogenesis. The hemopexin like domain in the carboxy terminus of MMP-2 is able to block this interaction of active MMP-2 and integrin αvβ3 on the EC surface which lead to inhibition of MMP-2 activity.|$|E
50|$|Destruction of the ECM also modulates the {{signaling}} cascades {{controlled by}} the interaction of cell-surface receptors and the ECM, and it also reveals binding sites previously hidden, like the integrin alpha-v beta-3 (αVβ3) {{on the surface of}} melanoma cells can be ligated to rescue the cells from apoptosis after degradation of collagen. In addition, the degradation products may have downstream effects as well that can increase cancer cell tumorigenicity and can serve as potential biomarkers. ECM destruction also releases the cytokines and growth factors stored therein (for example, VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factors (IGF1 and IGF2), TGF-β, EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which can increase the growth of the tumor. Cleavage of ECM components can also release cytokines that inhibit tumorigenesis, such as degradation of certain types of collagen can form <b>endostatin,</b> restin, canstatin and tumstatin, which have antiangiogenic functions.|$|E
50|$|The use of cell {{encapsulated}} microcapsules {{towards the}} treatment of several forms of cancer has shown great potential. One approach undertaken by researchers is through the implantation of microcapsules containing genetically modified cytokine secreting cells. An example of this was demonstrated by Cirone et al. when genetically modified IL-2 cytokine secreting non-autologous mouse myoblasts implanted into mice showed a delay in the tumor growth with an increased rate of survival of the animals. However, the efficiency of this treatment was brief due to an immune response towards the implanted microcapsules. Another approach to cancer suppression is {{through the use of}} angiogenesis inhibitors to prevent the release of growth factors which lead to the spread of tumors. The effect of implanting microcapsules loaded with xenogenic cells genetically modified to secrete <b>endostatin,</b> an antiangiogenic drug which causes apoptosis in tumor cells, has been extensively studied. However, this method of local delivery of microcapsules was not feasible in {{the treatment of}} patients with many tumors or in metastasis cases and has led to recent studies involving systemic implantation of the capsules.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} recent methods that is being {{developed}} for the delivery of anti-angiogenesis factors to tumour regions in cancer sufferers is using genetically modified bacteria that are able to colonize solid tumors in vivo. This method involves genetically engineering bacterial species such as Clostridium, Bifidobacteria and Salmonella by adding the genes for anti-angiogenic factors such as <b>endostatin</b> or IP10 chemokine and removing any harmful virulence genes. A target can also be added to the outside of the bacteria so that they are sent to the correct organ in the body. The bacteria can then be injected into the patient and they will locate themselves to the tumor site, where they release a continual supply of the desired drugs in the vicinity of a growing cancer mass, preventing it from being able to gain access to oxygen and ultimately starving the cancer cells. This method has been shown to work both in vitro and in vivo in mice models, with very promising results. It is expected that this method will become commonplace for treatment of various cancer types in humans in the future.|$|E
40|$|<b>Endostatin</b> is a carboxyl-terminal {{proteolytic}} {{fragment of}} collagen XVIII and a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. The {{mechanism of action}} is unknown, but the crystal structure of <b>endostatin</b> predicts a prominent heparan sulfate binding site, suggesting that <b>endostatin</b> competitively inhibits heparin-binding angiogenic factors, such as {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (FGF- 2). The goal {{of the study was to}} map <b>endostatin</b> binding sites in intact human tissues and to determine whether this binding is heparan sulfate dependent. In situ binding was performed with recombinant epitope-tagged murine <b>endostatin.</b> <b>Endostatin</b> predominantly binds to blood vessels of different calibers in a saturable fashion. In addition, binding to some epithelial basement membranes is seen. The localization pattern is similar to that reported for collagen XVIII, endostatin’s parent molecule. In breast carcinomas, <b>endostatin</b> co-localizes largely with FGF- 2. In a surprising contrast to FGF- 2, <b>endostatin</b> binding is resistant to treatment with heparitinase, demonstrating that binding is not mediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Furthermore, FGF- 2 and heparin do not compete for <b>endostatin</b> binding, providing additional evidence for the discreteness of <b>endostatin</b> and FGF-binding sites...|$|E
