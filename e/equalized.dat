40|$|Parametrically tunable audio {{equalizers}} are conventionally realized using allpass digital lter networks. They {{consist of}} rst-order shelving lters and second-order <b>equalizing</b> lters. In this paper, ladder wave digital lters (WDFs) with parametrically tunable coecients are proposed as shelving and <b>equalizing</b> lters. Similar to the allpass realization, {{the transfer function}} power complementary property of WDFs is used to obtain ecient shelving and <b>equalizing</b> lters. However, unlike the allpass structures, the transfer function and the tunable parameters of the ladder WDF are derived from the analog lter equivalent of the digital shelving and <b>equalizing</b> lters. For the shelving WDF, the cut-o frequency and gain are tunable, while for the <b>equalizing</b> WDF, the tunable parameters are the center frequency, 3 -dB bandwidth and gain.

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and <b>equalized</b> risk levels. For example, if the price of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E

40|$|In the {{literature}} of blind equalization, algorithms developed for <b>equalizing</b> an SISO or SIMO channel fail sometimes when the channel condition is poor.

40|$|According to some {{political}} economists, equality of outcome and {{equality of opportunity}} are substitutable. Assuming that people wish to <b>equalize</b> their opportunities in life, their level of demand for <b>equalizing</b> outcomes depends on their perception of social mobility in their society. On the other hand, substitutability can be criticized because <b>equalizing</b> opportunities introduces higher risk for an individual's future rank in their society, and this causes yet more demand for <b>equalizing</b> outcomes.

40|$|The Dutch utility Nuon, in {{association}} with hardware supplier Locamation and software supplier Phase to Phase have developed a new innovative system to support the operation of Medium Voltage networks. <b>Equalizing</b> currents arise in MV networks when feeders, that are fed from different substations, are coupled. Especially in urban networks the <b>equalizing</b> currents can be significant and can be very dangerous for the people performing the manual switching operations. The described system is able to predict dynamic <b>equalizing</b> currents. Tests showed that the predicted <b>equalizing</b> current {{is very similar to}} the actual <b>equalizing</b> current. Based upon the predictions of the new system the operators can decide easily whether it is allowed to couple the MV feeders. Nuon has implemented the system for the city of Amsterdam. The system is momentarily operational and used by the operators. All the experience from this project will be used in Nuon’s new concept for substation automation in the upcoming refurbishment projects of secondary systems in Nuon’s MV installations.

Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively.
