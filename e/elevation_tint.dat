40|$|Integrating a color {{raster data}} layer, such as {{elevation}} tints, with a grayscale raster layer, {{such as a}} hillshade, is an important visualization function in cartography, remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS). A number of methods have traditionally been used to integrate these types of rasters. In one approach, the input rasters are combined into a new output raster by transforming the original data using, for example, an intensity, hue, saturation (IHS) transformation. Another approach {{involves the use of}} layer transpar-ency, in which one raster is transparently draped over the other. However, both these approaches distort the original colors, and layer transparency has the added problem that gradient detail in the hillshaded raster is suppressed. The optimal solution would be to integrate the color and grayscale rasters while retaining the fidel-ity of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a new technique, called the NAGI (No Alteration of Gradient or Intensity) fusion method, to integrate color and grayscale rasters in a manner that preserves the original colors from the color raster while retaining the apparent gradient from the grayscale raster. The NAGI fusion method does not require any code or programming, and no software extensions are required. It can be modified easily to suit the characteristics of the input rasters or the requirements for the output raster. It can be imple-mented using raster processing techniques introduced in ArcGIS 10. 0; however, the concepts described can be adapted for use with most cartography, GIS, or remote-sensing software. The method was tested with a variety of datasets, with rasters of varying resolutions, at a range of spa-tial extents, with diverse types of thematic content, and with different ArcGIS rendering methods, thus demonstrating the versatility and applicability of the NAGI fusion method Keywords cartography – DEM – <b>elevation</b> <b>tint</b> – gamma stretch – gradient – hillshade – intensity – linear stretch – NAGI fusion method – pan sharpening – simple mea...|$|E

50|$|Another {{familiar}} {{example of}} pseudo color is the encoding of <b>elevation</b> using hypsometric <b>tints</b> in physical relief maps, where negative values (below sea level) are usually represented by shades of blue, and positive values by greens and browns.|$|R
50|$|Hypsometric tints are colors used to {{indicate}} elevation, usually together with contour lines. They {{can be used}} to depict ranges of elevation as bands of color, usually in a graduated scheme, or as a color ramp applied to contour lines themselves. A typical scheme progresses from dark greens for lower elevations up through yellows/browns, and on to grays and white at the highest <b>elevations.</b> Hypsometric <b>tinting</b> of maps and globes is often accompanied by a similar method of bathymetric tinting to convey depth of oceans; lighter shades of blue represent shallower water such as the continental shelf and darker shades deeper regions.|$|R
