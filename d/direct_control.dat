40|$|The {{induction}} motors have {{wide range}} of applications for due to its well-known advantages like brushless structures, low costs and robust performances. Over the past years, many kind of control methods are proposed for the induction motors and <b>direct</b> torque <b>control</b> has gained huge importance inside of them due to fast dynamic torque responses and simple control structures. However, the <b>direct</b> torque <b>control</b> method has still some handicaps against the other control methods {{and most of the}} important of these handicaps is high torque ripple. This paper suggests a new approach, Fuzzy logic based space vector modulation, on the <b>direct</b> torque <b>controlled</b> induction motors and aim of the approach is to overcome high torque ripple disadvantages of conventional <b>direct</b> torque <b>control.</b> In order to test and compare the proposed <b>direct</b> torque <b>control</b> method with conventional <b>direct</b> torque <b>control</b> method simulations, in Matlab/Simulink,have been carried out in different working conditions.

40|$|In recent years, on {{the basis}} of static allocative {{efficiency}} properties economists have advocated the use of taxation as an economically efficient means of control to implement environmental protection policy. Environmental problems, however, do not always develop smoothly and gradually but are often characterized by infrequent serious crises that require rapid, but temporary, changes in the controlling mechanism. Tax policy is inappropriate for such crises, but <b>direct</b> <b>controls</b> can be implemented rapidly to handle such emergencies. Using simple stochastic models to represent the physical environment, we show that the pollution control policy which minimizes total social costs (stationary social costs plus short-term emergency costs) is a mixed policy in which taxes are used to control the long-run equilibrium level of pollution and <b>direct</b> <b>controls</b> are used in short-term emergencies to maintain the pollution at satisfactory level. We also show that although tax policy alone is not optimal, in some special circumstances, <b>direct</b> <b>controls</b> alone may be the optimal way to control pollution. ...|$|R
