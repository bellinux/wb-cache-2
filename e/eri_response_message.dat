40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to design an agent which provides efficient response to the caller when a call goes unanswered in smartphones. The agent provides <b>responses</b> through text <b>messages,</b> email etc stating the most likely reason {{as to why the}} callee is unable to answer a call. Responses are composed taking into consideration the importance of the present call and the situation the callee is in at the moment like driving, sleeping, at work etc. The agent makes decisons in the compostion of <b>response</b> <b>messages</b> based on the patterns it has come across in the learning environment. Initially the user helps the agent to compose <b>response</b> <b>messages.</b> The agent associates this message to the percept it recieves with respect to the environment the callee is in. The user may thereafter either choose to make to response system automatic or choose to recieve suggestions from the agent for <b>responses</b> <b>messages</b> and confirm what is to be sent to the caller.

This project investigates optimizing the final critical link between a mobile client and a stationary base station by compressing HTTP request and <b>response</b> <b>messages.</b> Using a split proxy design, compression of individual request messages reduces bandwidth by 26 % to 34 % across a variety of benchmark traces, and applying compression to <b>response</b> <b>messages</b> yields savings of 59 % to 82 % of the compressible data. Higher compression rates are achieved by using streaming compression algorithms to compress the streams of request and <b>response</b> <b>messages.</b> In this case, the bandwidth for requests sees an order of magnitude improvement, and the respons [...] ...|$|R
