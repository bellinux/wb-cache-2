500|$|In 2012, in an interview, Pusha T {{spoke on}} the {{inspiration}} behind the album title. [...] "Basically, I tried to pick a title that embodied who I am as an artist. I wanted people to understand like Pusha is everything that I really, really am. Actually, there is a line in 'Pain' where I say [...] "My name is my name," [...] that line comes from Marlo Stanfield from the series The Wire. It {{was one of the}} more prominent catch phrases that he said {{at the end of that}} series. He was basically saying, I am who I am, <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> my name I live this. I really felt that embodied my presence in the rap game." [...] Pusha T announced the new title of his album in November 2012, along with Spin reporting that his album had been pushed back until 2013. On March 19, 2013 Pusha T said that the album would include 13 songs and that he had already finished 11 of those songs.|$|E
500|$|Confronted by a Puritan {{friend with}} rumours about his [...] "ungodly life", Dudley defended himself in 1576: <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> {{the top of}} the hill, where ... the {{smallest}} slip seemeth a fall ... I may fall many ways and have more witnesses thereof than many others who perhaps be no saints neither ... for my faults ... they lie before Him who I have no doubt but will cancel them as I have been and shall be most heartily sorry for them. With Douglas Sheffield, a young widow of the Howard family, he had a serious relationship from about 1569. He explained to her that he could not marry, not even in order to beget a Dudley heir, without his [...] "utter overthrow": You must think it is some marvellous cause ... that forceth me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children, it resteth so now in myself; and yet such occasions is there ... as if I should marry I am sure never to have [...] favour". Although in this letter Leicester said he still loved her as he did at the beginning, he offered her his help to find another husband for reasons of respectability if she so wished. The affair continued and in 1574 [...] Douglas gave birth to a son, also called Robert Dudley.|$|E

[...] "I have a regular exercise routine {{founded on the}} Yogi method," [...] Elsie said, [...] "introduced to me by Anne Vanderbilt and her daughter, Princess Murat. <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> my head (and) I can turn cart wheels. Or I walk upside-down on my hands." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 2005, Usher became romantically {{involved}} with stylist Tameka Foster, whom he then married on August 3, 2007. Foster {{gave birth to}} Usher Raymond V later that year. Usher released his fifth studio album Here <b>I</b> <b>Stand</b> <b>on</b> May 13, 2008. It featured more mature, adult-oriented themes, influenced by his marriage to Foster; this thematic shift ultimately led to the album becoming less successful with fans and sales than his previous work. A {{year and a half}} later on June 12, 2009, following his marriage, Usher filed for divorce from Foster, with no initial reasoning. Once the divorce was finalized on November 8 that year, Usher explained that there was [...] "no reasonable hope of reconciliation" [...] and their marriage was [...] "irretrievably broken"; both Foster and Usher had been living separately since July 2008. The divorce was highly documented by the press.|$|E
2500|$|Marxism was {{the guiding}} {{philosophy}} throughout Stalin's adult life; according to Montefiore, it held a [...] "quasi-religious" [...] value for Stalin. During his early life, Marxism blended with Georgian nationalism as a core component of his outlook. In 1917, {{he wrote that}} [...] "there is dogmatic Marxism and there is creative Marxism. <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> the ground of the latter". Volkogonov however believed that Stalin's Marxism was shaped by his [...] "dogmatic turn of mind", suggesting that this had been instilled in the Soviet leader during his education in religious institutions. According to scholar Robert Service, Stalin's [...] "few innovations in ideology were crude, dubious developments of Marxism". Some of these derived from political expediency rather than any sincere intellectual commitment; Stalin would often turn to ideology post hoc to justify his decisions. Stalin referred to himself as a praktik, meaning {{that he was more}} of a practical revolutionary than a theoretician.|$|E
