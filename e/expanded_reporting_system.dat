40|$|Abstract. Safety <b>reporting</b> <b>systems,</b> e. g. Air Safety <b>Reporting</b> <b>Systems,</b> are {{extremely}} efficient components of well-functioning safety schemes. An Information Security <b>Reporting</b> <b>System</b> is badly needed, but good information security data {{is very difficult}} to gather and many barriers prevent making existing data available for scientific purposes. In the scarcity of real-cases, we argue that ‘Dynamic Stories’, i. e. the various narratives that can be derived from system dynamics models of the existing system dynamics studies of information security might help establish a Virtual Information Security <b>Reporting</b> <b>System.</b> We do have an interesting opportunity in our running study of information security risks in the transition to eOperations in the offshore oil & gas sector. Given the importance of security for eOperations and the huge stakes involved, it seems that an umbrella organization such as the Norwegian Oil Industry Association is a potential adopter of a Virtual Information Security <b>Reporting</b> <b>System.</b> Our paper formulates issues that need to be solved in order make our vision of such <b>reporting</b> <b>system</b> a tangible prospect. ...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{financial}} <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> have geared {{towards the}} single-bottom line reporting {{in the form}} of profitability. However, there are arguments that corporate <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> should not just dwell on a single-bottom line but should be reported upon on three elements comprising economic/financial, social and environmental elements that constitute the triple-bottom line. This study aimed at empirically researching on what current practices corporate business executives and financial managers deploy in their corporate financial <b>reporting</b> <b>systems.</b> The focus of the study was on the assessment of the relevance of either the single-bottom line or triple-bottom line <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> within an African framework.

40|$|International audienceIncident {{reporting}} {{is a very}} well-known technique in application domains such as air traffic management and health, where specialized users are trained to provide detailed information about problems. Incident <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> are indeed complex systems that include many actors including the users reporting incidents, user’s colleagues and neighbors, stakeholders, policymakers, <b>systems</b> integrations. Incident <b>report</b> <b>systems</b> might change (positively or negatively) the users’ environment in many ways. In recent years, this kind of technique has been also been used in crisis management such as the hurricane Katrina. However, {{despite the fact that}} incident <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> using mobile technology are becoming more common, little is known about its actual use by the general population and which factors affect the user experience when using such system. In this paper we discuss the use of incident <b>reporting</b> <b>system</b> in critical context of use.

40|$|Background: Incident {{reporting}} {{is widely used}} in both patient safety improvement programmes, and in research on patient safety. Objective: To identify the key requirements for incident <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> in primary care; to develop an Internet-based incident <b>reporting</b> and learning <b>system</b> for primary care. Methods: A literature review looking at the purpose, design and requirements of an incident <b>reporting</b> <b>system</b> (IRS) was used to update an existing incident <b>reporting</b> <b>system,</b> widely used in Germany. Then, an international expert panel with knowledge on IRS developed the criteria {{for the design of}} a new web-based incident <b>reporting</b> <b>system</b> for European primary care. A small demonstration project was used to create a web-based <b>reporting</b> <b>system,</b> to be made freely available for practitioners and researchers. The expert group compiled recommendations regarding the desirable features of an incident <b>reporting</b> <b>system</b> for European primary care. These features covered the purpose of reporting, who should be involved in reporting, the mode of reporting, design considerations, feedback mechanisms and preconditions necessary for the implementation of an IRS. Results: A freely available web-based reporting form was developed, based on these criteria. It can be modified for local contexts. Practitioners and researchers can use this system as a means of recording patient safety incidents in their locality {{and use it as a}} basis for learning from errors. Conclusion: The LINNEAUS collaboration has provided a freely available incident <b>reporting</b> <b>system</b> that can be modified for a local context and used throughout Europe...|$|R

40|$|Incident <b>reporting</b> <b>system</b> {{has been}} proved to be very {{effective}} method for monitoring safety performance and reducing accidents. When carried out effectively, the process generates invaluable safety data from which an organization can learn about past mistakes and take steps to prevent future recurrence. But with no standards, and also very little guidance from publicly available literature, there are lot of differences among existing incident <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> in the different process industries in Sweden. This study analyzed and compared the incident <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> of 8 sampled process industries in Sweden {{from the perspectives of}} an established criterion for designing and implementing efficient incident <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> through information gathered from mail survey, using questionnaire. Analysis of the results showed that none of the 8 companies met all the criteria required of an efficient incident <b>reporting</b> <b>system.</b> The incident <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> of each of the 8 companies met the requirements in one aspect or the other. One (1) company was found to meet most aspects of the criteria, (i. e. 5 aspects). These include: non provision of discipline: training: confidentiality: good feedback: and completion of a form by more than one person). Despite this, it could still not be proved that the incident <b>reporting</b> <b>system</b> of this company is the most efficient one to prevent accidents. The reason being that the company did not meet the entire requirement, and there were some aspects of the criteria it did not meet, but which were met by the other 7 companies. The research identified the need for further research which could lead to establish a unified and most efficient incident <b>reporting</b> <b>system</b> for the process industries in Sweden.
