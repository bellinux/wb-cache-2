50|$|Moffett Field, CA {{was home}} to a pilot scale PRB {{initiated}} by the U.S. Navy in 1995. The Moffett Field PRB used a funnel and <b>gate</b> <b>design,</b> with the funnel being composed of interlocking steel sheet piles, while the gate consisted of granular zero-valent iron. The primary contaminants were trichloroethene (TCE), cis-1,2 dichloroethene (cDCE), and perchloroethene (PCE). Data from quarterly monitoring, tracer testing, and iron cell coring {{have been used to}} determine the effectiveness of the site. Since the first sampling event in June 1996, concentrations of all chlorinated compounds have been reduced to either non-detect levels or below the maximum contaminant levels.|$|E
50|$|Clarke {{joined the}} Cub Scouts {{as soon as}} he was old enough and {{remained}} an active member of the Boy Scouts through his young adult life, earning the prestigious Wood Badge. Staying on as a troop leader as older men were drafted for World War II, Clarke was also a student at Loughborough then started his Diploma in Architecture at the University of Leicester. The first structure he designed during his studies as an architect was the 1st Nanpantan Troop's Headquarters still located on Nanpantan Road in Loughborough, UK. Clarke's father built the front gates still in use and welded the insignias into the <b>gate</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{answer came}} in 2004 with the cone design. These Air Gates measure 5 m across {{the base and}} [...]75 m at their tip. Inside the Air Gate a {{relatively}} high, and carefully monitored, pressure level is maintained {{with the use of}} powerful electrical, petrol-powered blowers that help keep the Air Gates steady even in windy conditions.Over the years the Air <b>Gate</b> <b>design</b> has developed and improved and today's Air Gates can withstand wind speeds of up to 60 km/h without being blown over. Their stability is further reinforced with 12 ground attachments, each strong enough to hold 1200 kg. For races over water, the Air Gates are secured to a floating barge which has stability anchors.|$|E
50|$|The Elmwood Cemetery Gates {{mark the}} east and north entrances to the Elmwood Cemetery in Sycamore, Illinois. The cast iron gates were likely built in 1865, the year the {{cemetery}} opened and the one emblazoned on the gates, though records of their construction have been lost. While cast iron was commonly used for building facades at the time, the gates are a rare example of its use in landscape architecture. The gates have a Serlian design with a wide central road entry and narrower pedestrian gates on either side; square columns separate the gates. An arch bearing the cemetery's name rises above the center entrance, while lintels span the side entrances; both the arch and the lintels feature ornamental designs. The Illinois Historic Structures Survey described the gates as the best extant example of iron cemetery <b>gate</b> <b>design</b> in the state.|$|E
50|$|The Fry Canyon {{site was}} {{selected}} in 1996 {{as a field}} demonstration site to assess the removal capabilities of PRBs for uranium. Laboratory experiments were conducted on three potential PRB materials (phosphate, zero-valent iron, and ferric iron) to determine uranium removal efficiencies and hydrologic properties. A PRB material from each class was selected for demonstration. The selected materials had satisfactory hydraulic conductivity, high U removal efficiency, and high compaction strengths. A funnel and <b>gate</b> <b>design</b> was used. The funnels channeled the groundwater into the PRB gates. During the first year, zero-valent iron had lowered U concentration by more than 99.9%, while the amount removed in both the phosphate and the ferric iron exceeded 70% {{for most of the}} measurements made. Mechanisms for removing uranium are similar to those for removing other inorganic contaminants, meaning that this study has wide applicability.|$|E

50|$|In 1971 GM restyled its Chevrolet {{full-size}} models; all full-size station wagons, {{including the}} Brookwood, received GM's clamshell rear gate assembly with power rear window. Unlike the door-gate assembly offered in 1969 and 1970, the clamshell <b>gate</b> <b>design</b> required raising {{the rear window}} up into {{the roof of the}} wagon, while the gate slid downward and under the cargo floor. GM offered an optional electric motor assist for the gate on its lower-priced models after consumer complaints about the weight of the gate and difficulty many had in manually lifting the gate into locking position.Midway through the 1971 model year, all full-sized station wagons, including Brookwoods, received the previously optional Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission as standard equipment. Despite the series' economy roots and entry-level positioning, virtually all previous Brookwoods have been built and sold with an automatic transmission.|$|E
5000|$|The Portland stone memorial, {{a square}} plan triumphal arch with four legs, is 69 feet, 4¼ inches (approximately 21m) tall, with large arched {{openings}} {{on the main}} axis to the northwest and southeast, with smaller lower arches to the northeast and southwest. The main axis is aligned with the sunrise on 11 November. The width, heights and depths of the arches are in simple 2:4:1 proportions: the larger arches are 18 ft wide, 36 ft tall and 9 ft deep; and the smaller arches are 12 ft wide, 24 ft tall and 6 ft deep. Stone wreaths carved in relief beside the arches encircle the inscribed dates [...] "MCM/ XIV" [...] (1914) and [...] "MCM/ XIX" [...] (1919). Above is a heavy attic, bearing {{the arms of the}} city of Leicester in relief carving, which is stepped back, and then topped by a low dome. The tetrapylon/quadrifons arch is similar to his later India <b>Gate</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that the Poly tones are not affected by the Contour settings. In reality the Poly tones can {{be affected by the}} Rise Time (attack) and Fall Time (decay) sliders. The Contour settings can only affect Polyphony while a key is pressed due to the Polyphonic <b>gate</b> <b>design.</b> When a key is released the polyphony tone for that key stops immediately. Therefore {{it is true that the}} Poly tones are not [...] "faded out" [...] by the Fall time (release) contour setting when a key is released. Similarly, the Poly tones are not [...] "held" [...] with the two VCOs when in [...] "Continuous" [...] (Hold or drone) mode. The rest of the modulation, including the sample-and-hold, will affect the Polyphonic Signal via the filter section. One thing to note however; the LFO cannot be used to modulate the pitch to create a vibrato of the Polyphony section. Against these limitations, the Polyphony is total, meaning all 32 keys can sound all at once.|$|E
