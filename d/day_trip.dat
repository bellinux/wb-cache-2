5|$|What Maisie Knew {{was filmed}} in New York for 35 days over seven {{weeks in the}} summer of 2011. It was shot on 35 mm film using an Arri camera. Filming took place in mainly Lower Manhattan, and scenes at the beach house were shot on Long Island. One scene {{featuring}} Maisie and Lincoln taking a <b>day</b> <b>trip</b> together was shot on the High Line. A scene in which Susanna performs at a concert was filmed at Webster Hall using a pre-recorded vocal track, a backing band and a small audience. According to McGehee and Siegel, a significant challenge during filming was the limited time with which they were able to work with Aprile each day due to her early bedtime. While shooting one of the film's final scenes wherein Susanna arrives at the beach house at night to pick up Maisie, Aprile fell asleep and could not be woken up; the shoot had to be postponed until two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her disappearance, {{according}} to her friends, Carol was feeling depressed. She had talked of tracing her biological parents, as she was adopted. On 17 July 1976, she went missing. Gordon claimed that she had left home for another man, and Carol had left their home in Leece twice before. It was for this reason, Gordon claimed, {{that he did not}} report her missing for six weeks. Carol was said to time her periods away from home to coincide with the school holidays. Gordon claimed that it wasn't until she didn't return in time to take up her job as a primary school teacher in September (the start of the school term) that he realised that there was a problem. At this time he reported her missing via his solicitor, and her family was informed. On the day she vanished, the family had been due to visit Blackpool on a <b>day</b> <b>trip.</b> However, Carol said she felt unwell and wanted to remain behind in bed. She was never seen alive again by her family. Gordon claimed he returned home to find Carol had left the house, leaving behind her wedding ring, {{and that there was no}} sign of a struggle. A missing persons enquiry was launched, but nothing came of it. This missing persons report was subsequently lost, and it was implied by some that it was because both Gordon and a senior police commander (who, by the time the article was published, had died) involved in the case were freemasons. This was rebutted by Sandra Lean, who, in No Smoke, claimed that Gordon had never been a freemason. At the time, police told Gordon that, should a body be found, he would be the main suspect.|$|E
30|$|The AR(1) {{time series}} {{estimates}} {{are consistent with}} the OLS regression’s 24  % estimated reduction in <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> after the second of the two border changes (January 2008). The average gap between the AR(1) forecasted path of <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> and the actual path of <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> is also 24  %, but only once we adjust the forecast downwards to better account for the sudden rise of homicides after 2008. Of course averages contain variations over time and that gap was estimated to be quite a bit larger by 2012 than it started in 2008 —it had become a nearly 40  % gap. Even larger gaps appear in Fig.  5 when we forecasted <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> beginning back in 2001 rather than 2008. The average gap between our (downwards adjusted) first prediction and the actual number of <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> was 47  % after 2008, but again the gap was rising and became 60  % by 2012. These are really very large effects so it is worth recalling that <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> fell some 20  % from 2000 to 2012 while international tourism to the interior of Mexico rose some 40  %. So the notion that <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> (and associated spending) might have been 60  % higher had there been no changes to border procedures should not be regarded as inherently implausible. 23 Growth of 60  % would still have paled in comparison to the sixfold increase in the value of international trade across the same period.|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The main aim of the United Kingdom Day Visits Survey, the Great Britain Day Visits Survey (GBDVS), and latterly the England Leisure Visits Survey (ELVS), is to measure the extent of participation in day visits, and to estimate the scale and value of visits taken. In particular the principal investigators {{are interested in the}} extent of participation in different kinds of <b>day</b> <b>trips,</b> how frequently particular types of trip are undertaken, and associated expenditure. The survey also seeks to provide information on a number of other trip details, such as activities undertaken, areas visited, time spent at the main destination, modes of transport, distance travelled, number of people involved and the trip party composition. Respondents to the survey are generally asked to recall trips taken within the past two weeks. The 1994 survey covered three main types of trip : home-based trips - trips made from home for leisure activities, which start and finish on the same day (i. e. do not include an overnight stay); visits made from home on business - <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> for business purposes for special or one-off purposes such as attending a conference for the day; holiday-based <b>trips</b> - <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> made from a holiday base in the UK, taken while staying away from home. Main Topics : The following information is included: record of all <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> from home in the last two weeks; record of all <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> from holiday base in the last two weeks; details of up to 7 most recent <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> from home in the last two weeks; details of up to 7 most recent <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> from holiday base in the last two weeks; details of up to 7 most recent <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> for business purposes in the last two weeks; details of recent <b>day</b> <b>trips</b> in the last 12 months to a town, seaside, countryside, wood, or river.

25|$|The Ōtsu incident, {{a failed}} {{assassination}} attempt on Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich of Russia (1868 – 1918, later Tsar Nicholas II), occurred on 11 May 1891. Nicholas, returning to Kyoto after a <b>day</b> <b>trip</b> to Lake Biwa, was attacked with a saber by Tsuda Sanzō (1855 – 1891), an escort policeman. Nicholas survived the assassination attempt, but the incident caused national outcry against Tsuda and {{was seen as}} a crisis in Japanese-Russian relations.|$|E
25|$|On 29 June 2011, a {{passenger}} {{had to be}} airlifted from Scillonian III by a rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose after complaining about severe chest pains. The <b>day</b> <b>trip</b> visitor had become unwell around 30 minutes out of Penzance, so a doctor travelling on board asked for the helicopter. The ferry retreated to a more sheltered part of the coast, near Mousehole, so the patient could be winched up without having {{to cope with the}} strong winds.|$|E

25|$|The bombing caused outrage both {{locally and}} internationally, spurred on the Northern Ireland peace process, and dealt a severe {{blow to the}} {{dissident}} republican campaign. The Real IRA denied the bomb was intended to kill civilians and apologised; it later declared a ceasefire shortly after. The victims included people from many backgrounds: Protestants, Catholics, a Mormon teenager, five other teenagers, six children, a mother pregnant with twins, two Spanish tourists, and others on a <b>day</b> <b>trip</b> from the Republic of Ireland. Both unionists and Irish nationalists were killed and injured.|$|E
25|$|The Zephyrettes {{were hired}} in Chicago, first by McPeek {{and later by}} her successor, Mary Lou Gordon. While the California Zephyr was jointly {{operated}} by the Burlington, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, and the Western Pacific Railroad, the Zephyrettes were technically Western Pacific employees and thus paid in San Francisco. At any one time, there were 10 or 11 Zephyrettes who were actively employed, with six in transit aboard trains (three heading in either direction) and two on layovers (one in San Francisco {{and the other in}} Chicago), and perhaps also an occasional trainee. A typical itinerary for a Zephyrette consisted of the two and a half <b>day</b> <b>trip</b> on the eastbound California Zephyr, a night layover at the Hilton Chicago, another two and a half <b>day</b> <b>trip</b> westbound, and then two and a half days off in San Francisco. Over the course of a month, a Zepyhrette would generally make three round trips. Some Zephyrettes worked other jobs while not aboard the California Zephyr: one, Rita Pelz, modeled for I. Magnin. The average tenure of employment for a Zephyrette was one and a half years, but some served much longer: Nellie O'Grady was already in her seventh year with the California Zephyr when she wrote about her experiences in the December 1955 issue of The Saturday Evening Post.|$|E
25|$|The {{assassination}} attempt occurred on , while Nicholas {{was returning to}} Kyoto after a <b>day</b> <b>trip</b> to Lake Biwa in Ōtsu, Shiga Prefecture. He was attacked by Tsuda Sanzō (1855–1891), one of his escorting policemen, who swung at the Tsesarevich's face with a sabre. The quick action of Nicholas's cousin, Prince George of Greece and Denmark, who parried the second blow with his cane, saved his life. Tsuda then attempted to flee, but two rickshaw drivers in Nicholas's entourage chased him down and pulled him to the ground. Nicholas was left with a 9 centimeter long scar {{on the right side}} of his forehead, but his wound was not life-threatening.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of December 6, 1958, Kenneth and Barbara Martin {{attended}} a Christmas party before returning to their home on Northeast 57th Avenue in the Roseway neighborhood of Northeast Portland, Oregon. The couple had made plans for a <b>day</b> <b>trip</b> into {{the country for the}} following day. In the late morning of December 7, Kenneth and Barbara left their home with their three daughters: Barbie, Susan, and Virginia, in their 1954 cream and red-colored Ford Country Squire station wagon. Barbie, the eldest daughter, was a freshman at Grant High School. The family's eldest son, Donald, then aged 28, was in the U.S. Navy and stationed in New York at the time.|$|E
