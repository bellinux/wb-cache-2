40|$|When {{applying}} the noise thermometer in industrial facilities considerable line lengths are occasionally required {{due to the}} positioning of the measuring points in the facility (e. g. high radiation level etc.). Since the noise thermometer developed at the KFA Jülich operates according to the comparison method the signal lines require that the measuring signal is transmitted undistorted in the frequency band used for the noise temperature measurements. For reasons of measuring time and measuring accuracy it is desirable to have as wide as possible a frequency band available for measurements. To this end sensor resistance and line arrangement must be specially matched to each other. Apart from the transmission {{characteristics of the line}} arrangement with respect to the measuring signals, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> <b>resistances</b> of the electronics as well as the parasitic noise voltages of the ohmic resistances of the lines, which canattain {{the same size as the}} sensor resistance or even greater, must also be taken into consideration in the case of long lines - although the correlation method is used (correlative errors of the line). Due to - the coupling of both line channels to the measuring resistance, these voltages can be overcoupled from one line channel to the other and are thus present at the two amplifier inputs in the form of correlated signals. Since in many applications (e. g. in nuclear reactors) the measuring sensor cannot be easily replaced, the value of the sensor resistance, as well as the selection of transmission lines with respect to good transmission characteristics of the whole arrangement and minimizing the correlative error terms, must already be optimized when designing a noise thermometerarrangement for the reasons mentioned above. The TRARAU computer program was developed for this purpose enabling the influences of the lines to be computed by taking into consideration all the effects occuring through the lines, such as transmission errors and correlative error terms. In order to check the accuracy of the TRARAU computer program a series of laboratory measurements were implemented enabling both the pure transmission behaviour of the line arrangement with respect to the measuring signal to be detected, as well as the overall line error. In all cases this resulted in a very good agreement of the measured values with the computed values. The transmission behaviour of noise thermometer arrangements occuring in practice were studied with the example of two reactor experiments. These were firstly an Na experiment in the Belgian BR 2 research reactor in Mol, and secondly the measurement of the primary coolant temperature in a power LWR (GKN - Gemeinschaftskernkraftwerk-Neckarwestheim). In both cases it was possible to demonstrate successfully the potential of the computer program TRARAU. As the parametric studies have shown, optimum matching over unlimited band widths is not feasible in principle. By reducing the upper band limit, however, the line error can practically always be kept sufficiently small. With good matching larger band widths can also be used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{temperature}} dependence of high-frequency noise characteristics for deep-submicrometer bulk and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFETs has been experimentally {{examined in this}} paper. With the downscaling of the channel length, our paper indicates that the power spectral density of the channel noise (Sid) of the bulk MOSFET becomes less sensitive to temperature due to the smaller degradation of the channel conductance at zero drain bias gd 0 as temperature rises. We also show that the SOI-specific floating-body and self-heating effects would result in higher white-noise gamma factor. Finally, for both the bulk and SOI MOSFETs, since transconductance gm significantly decreases as temperature increases, their minimum noise figure NFmin and <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> <b>resistance</b> Rn would degrade with increasing temperature.

40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} the problem of {{simultaneous}} signal and noise match at the input port of low noise amplifiers; feedback LNAs are considered because previous works show that they can achieve the simultaneous match condition. The investigation analyses the influence of both parallel and series feedback elements on the amplifier. Matrices are used to describe signal and noise parameters of each component of the model - parallel admittance, series impedance, active device. This approach allows the analysis {{to be applied to}} a wide range of networks, as long as noise and signal matrices are available. For this reason, the results are not limited to active devices in the microwave region of the spectrum but they are applicable to any linear 2 -port circuit. The noise parameters of feedback networks are investigated thoroughly. Analytical expressions are worked out as functions of the feedback immittances and have been used to support experimental evidence previously published. A duality property for feedback networks is pointed out; new circles for constant <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> <b>resistance</b> are devised; optimum values for the feedback impedance are determined; an investigation of a well-known noise model is carried out and its validity is extended. Based on the closed form expressions of the noise parameters, an original analytical procedure for the design of the optimum noise source reflection coefficient is presented. To the author's knowledge, no technique was available before. The design for simultaneous signal and noise match is now possible, because the input reflection coefficient can be set independently by properly choosing the load. Different devices are considered and their different behaviour is highlighted. A remarkable feature of the new design technique is to avoid the need of input matching when designing low noise amplifiers. Finally, experimental results are also presented and the performance of aI GHz single stage BJT LNA is shown. The fundamental achievement is that the noise figure of the LNA is equal to its minimum value within the measurement uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|Valuation {{of traffic}} noise {{abatement}} based on hedonic pricing {{models of the}} property market has traditionally measured the <b>noise</b> as the <b>equivalent,</b> or another average, level. What is not captured in such a noise indicator is the maximum noise level of a vehicle passage. In this study, we incorporate the maximum noise level in the hedonic model letting the property price depend on both the <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> level and the maximum noise level. Hedonic models for both rail and road noise are estimated. Data consists of characteristics of sold properties, property-specific noise calculation, and geographical variables. We use the hedonic approach to estimate the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for maximum noise abatement where we model the effect as the maximum noise level subtracted with the <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> level. Furthermore, we control for the <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> level in the estimations. The estimated results show that including the maximum noise level in the model has influence on the property prices, but only for rail and not for road. This means that for road we cannot reject the hypothesis that WTP for noise abatement {{is based on the}} <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> level only. For rail, on the other hand, we estimate the marginal WTP for the maximum noise level and {{it turns out to be}} substantial. Also, the marginal WTP for the <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> levels seems to be unaffected by the inclusion of the maximum noise level in the model.

40|$|The OLIMPO {{experiment}} is a 2. 6 m balloon-borne telescope, aimed at measuring the Sunyaev- Zeldovich effect in clusters of Galaxies. OLIMPO will carry out surveys in four frequency bands centered at 140, 220, 410 and 540 GHz. The detector system {{consists of four}} bolometer arrays and incorporates new detector technologies that are potential candidates for future space missions. One of these technologies is the Capacitively Coupled Cold-Electron Bolometer (CEB) with JFET readout. The JFET readout coupled to semiconductor-based high-impedence bolometers has been developed already for the BOOMERanG and Planck-HFI experiments. The CEB is a planar antenna-coupled superconductong detector with high sensitivity and high dynamic range. Here, we discuss a scheme to match the relatively moderate dynamic resistance of CEB (~ 1 kOhm) to the high <b>noise</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>resistance</b> of JFET (1 M&# 937;).

40|$|The {{internal}} noise {{present in a}} linear system can be quantified by the <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> method. By measuring the effect that applying external noise to the system’s input has on its output one can estimate the variance of this {{internal noise}}. By applying this simple “linear amplifier” model to the human visual system, one can entirely explain an observer’s detection performance {{by a combination of}} the internal noise variance and their efficiency relative to an ideal observer. Studies using this method rely on two crucial factors: firstly that the external noise in their stimuli behaves like the visual system’s internal noise in the dimension of interest, and secondly that the assumptions underlying their model are correct (e. g. linearity). Here we explore the effects of these two factors while applying the <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> method to investigate the contrast sensitivity function (CSF). We compare the results at 0. 5 and 6 c/deg from the <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> method against those we would expect based on pedestal masking data collected from the same observers. We find that the loss of sensitivity with increasing spatial frequency results from changes in the saturation constant of the gain control nonlinearity, and that this only masquerades as a change in internal <b>noise</b> under the <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> method. Part of the effect we find {{can be attributed to the}} optical transfer function of the eye. The remainder can be explained by either changes in effective input gain, divisive suppression, or a combination of the two. Given these effects the efficiency of our observers approaches the ideal level. We show the importance of considering these factors in <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> studies...|$|R

Quite interestingly, this <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> temperature of an ideal pn diode equals the actual temperatue of the diode.
