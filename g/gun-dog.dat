40|$|Abstract Objective Braque Français, type Pyrénées is a French {{hunting-dog}} breed whose origin is {{traced back}} to old pointing <b>gun-dogs</b> used to assist hunters in finding and retrieving game. This breed is popular in France, but seldom seen elsewhere. Despite the ancient background, the literature on its genetic characterization is surprisingly scarce. A recent study looked into the demography and inbreeding using pedigree records, but there is yet no report {{on the use of}} molecular markers in this breed. The aim of this work was to genotype a population of Braque Français, type Pyrénées dogs with the high-density SNP array to study the genomic diversity of the breed. Results The average observed (H_O) and expected (H_E) heterozygosity were 0. 371 (± 0. 142) and 0. 359 (± 0. 124). Effective population size (N_e) was 27. 5635 runs of homozygosity (ROH) were identified with average length of 2. 16 MB. A ROH shared by 75 % of the dogs was detected at the beginning of chromosome 22. Inbreeding coefficients from marker genotypes were in the range F_IS=[- 0. 127, 0. 172]. Inbreeding estimated from ROH (F_ROH) had mean 0. 112 (± 0. 023), with range [0. 0526, 0. 225]. These results show that the Braque Français, type Pyrénées breed is a relatively inbred population, but with still sufficient genetic variability for conservation and genetic improvement...|$|R
5000|$|English Setters were {{especially}} {{popular in the}} UK during the 1960s, 70s and 80s and registrations of puppies reached 1344 during 1974. In 2012, the Kennel Club listed the English Setter amongst the Vulnerable Native Breeds as only 234 puppies were registered. A decade earlier, in 2002, there were 568 English Setter puppies registered. However, during 2012 the number of English Setter puppies registered increased to 314, so the breed {{was moved to the}} Kennel Club's [...] "At Watch" [...] list, which is for breeds with registrations from 300-450. In 2015 registrations fell to 289 resulting in a return to the Vulnerable Native Breeds list for 2016. The breed is still fairly well represented in Italy, where it is popular as a working <b>gun-dog.</b> Even in Italy, however the breed is in sharp decline, going from 20,999 registrations in 2002, to 14510 registrations in 2011. In contrast, the American Kennel Club stated that 2011 was the [...] "year of the setters, with all four making big jumps over the past year". English Setters had previously ranked at 101 in 2010 but moved up to 87 in 2011, a position the breed maintained in 2012.|$|E
