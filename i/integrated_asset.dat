40|$|Asset {{valuation}} is {{an essential}} component of effective asset management. It is an important method to demonstrate proper management of public assets and effective utilization of government’s budgets. In addition, it allows agencies to demonstrate justifications of funds needed to preserve its assets. Asset valuation is used in standard reporting, depreciation schedules, auditor requirements and condition assessments. Several government regulatory bodies mandate agencies to report their Capital Tangible Assets’ (CTA) values within their annual statement. For example, the Canadian Public Sector Accounting Board (PSAB), the Governmental Accounting Standard Board (GASB) and the New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS) to name a few. <b>Integrating</b> <b>asset</b> valuation in asset management is imperative to manage assets in the most optimized cost-effective ways while maintaining or enhancing the value of these assets. Furthermore, the increased movement towards Public Private Partnerships (PPP) raises {{the question of how to}} identify the optimum or practical asset value criteria in performance based specifications that provide the required Level of Service (LOS). The objective of this paper is to present a research overview to develop an asset management methodology to <b>integrate</b> <b>asset</b> value and valuation concepts and techniques with performance measures, prediction models, life-cycle cost analysis, prioritization and optimization tools as well as decision-making tools of asset management state-of-the-practice...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Integrated</b> <b>Asset</b> Modelling (or IAM) is {{the generic}} term {{used in the}} oil {{industry}} for computer modelling of both the subsurface and the surface elements of a field development. Historically the reservoir has always been modelled separately from the surface network and the facilities. In order to capture the interaction between those two or more standalone models, several time consuming iterations were required. For example, a change in the water breakthrough leads to a change in the deliverability of the surface network which in turn leads to a production acceleration or deceleration in the reservoir. In order to go through this lengthy process more quickly the industry has slowly [...] been adopting a more integrated approach which captures the constraints imposed by the infrastructure on the network immediately.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} Aspen Technology will discuss {{some of the}} key success factors for a {{successful}} implementation of an optimiser, surveillance or planning system to an Oil & Gas Asset. Initially the Asset needs true buy in from members of all the differing disciplines, and a willingness to maintain their parts of the models used. To improve this buy in, the industry is finding that it helps to build the models using the favoured tool sets of the various discipline involved, which will naturally tend to be maintained. The use of standard, but disparate tool sets across engineering, financial and management disciplines requires the ability to integrate and communicate within the desired workflow. Recent advances in software engineering with the use of Microsoft. NET technology are making the dream of engineering modelling software and finance system collaboration a real possibility. The paper will review the requirements of <b>integrated</b> <b>asset</b> modelling systems and review some of the successes and failures of Operating Companies in achieving this dream.

Regionally <b>integrated</b> <b>asset</b> pricing on the African {{stock markets}} (ASMs) : {{evidence}} from the Fama-French model [...] Chapter 3. Are African stock markets globally integrated? [...] Chapter 4. The global financial crisis (GFC) {{and the importance of}} country and industry factors in African stock returns [...] Chapter 5. Conclusion and recommendations for future research. The three papers in this thesis investigate the degree of financial market integration, regionally <b>integrated</b> <b>asset</b> pricing, and the response of equity returns to domestic and global industry factors in a pooled sample of 11 African stock markets (ASMs). The impact of the global financial crisis (GFC) on these issues is also explored. Paper 1 explores regionally <b>integrated</b> <b>asset</b> pricing on the ASMs. By pooling securities across 11 ASMs, we show, using the Fama and French model, that asset pricing on the ASMs is not regionally integrated and that the ASMs show a lower level of integration with each other. Also, the model‘s mispricings are high for the absolute measures of size and book-to-market (BM) based models than for their relative counterparts. The evidence is unsupportive of regionally integrated African markets. Paper 2 focuses on whether the world, emerging, and African market factors are priced on the African capital markets. We rely on a multifactor asset pricing model with pre-specified risk factors to investigate the level of African market segmentation with the world and emerging markets. The finding supports the hypothesis of partially integrated African markets with the world and emerging markets. The evidence suggests a time-varying African market integration that appears to have increased in recent times. Paper 3 investigates the relevance of country and global industry factors in describing African equity returns. We show within a variance decomposition framework that industry effects are dominated by country influences on the ASMs, though the relevance of industry factors has increased in recent times. Also, we observe structural breaks around the GFC. The real sector appears to be the channel through which the GFC impacted on the global influence in African equity returns.

40|$|Business {{performance}} is contingent upon effective use {{and management of}} all resources to enhance competitive advantage. However, whilst the resource value of finance, human resources and technology is widely recognized, that of the supporting physical asset (i. e. building or real estate) that houses these resources is not obvious to many corporate managers who see building-related expenses as a drain on profit. Operational buildings are at the same time, a physical asset, a functional facility, {{as well as a}} business resource. Literature on the subject suggests a wide range of views which tended to polarize towards either the measurement of the physical (technical) performance or the financial (cost) performance. Contemporary resource management supports the view that building assets are an essential resource just as human resource, technology; finance and knowledge are business resources needed to achieve corporate objectives. An integrated resource management approach views an optimum real estate or facility solution as one which is derived from consideration of all corporate resources to meet business needs. In this respect, the prime focus in measuring operational building performance must be viewed {{in the context of the}} relationship of building assets in relation to their contributions to business outcomes. This is the premise upon which an <b>integrated</b> <b>asset</b> performance framework for performance of operational buildings has been developed.
