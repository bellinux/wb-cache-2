[...] “This legislation {{is the product of}} a grassroots effort by parents, instructors, school officials and caring communities,” he said. “Autism Spectrum Disorders are being diagnosed at an exploding rate. We have a responsibility to do <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> power to provide the best education for our children.” ...|$|E
500|$|The film's title {{refers to}} the biblical story of Jacob's Ladder, or {{the dream of a}} meeting place between Heaven and Earth (Genesis 28:12). Its little-known {{alternate}} title is Dante's Inferno, in a reference to Inferno by Dante Alighieri. Screenwriter and co-producer Bruce Joel Rubin perceived the film as a modern interpretation of the Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State, the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Rubin said: [...] "The inspiration in a sense is my entire spiritual upbringing. Once you have a meditative life you start to see that the world is really far different than what it appears to be. What appears to be finite is really couched in the infinite, and the infinite imbues <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> lives." [...] Before writing his scripts for Jacob's Ladder and Ghost, which too was released in 1990, the Jewish-born Rubin spent two years in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Nepal; previously, he has also written afterlife-themed Brainstorm and Deadly Friend. His original screenplay for Jacob's Ladder differs significantly at parts from the final film, especially towards the ending.|$|E
500|$|Tickets for the Best of Both Worlds Tour {{were selling}} out quite rapidly. Nevertheless, ticket {{scalping}} {{was one of}} the primary reasons for it. Many tickets were immediately found for purchase on secondary markets, such as eBay or StubHub, selling for well over the face value of the tickets. Broker prices ranged from $350 to $2,000 for the tickets originally sold for $29 to $66. The shortage of tickets for the tour became so pronounced it gained national attention, with parents frequently expressing their outrage, discontent, and disappointment on behalf of their children. Vice president of Ticketmaster, Joe Freeman commented, [...] "Hell hath no fury like the parent of a child throwing a tantrum. People who have been in this business for a long time are watching what's happening, and they say there hasn't been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis [...]" [...] In an instance, a girl was unable to undergo a surgery she needed due to monetary issues, so she sold her tickets to a show of the tour for enough money to pay for the surgery. Debra Rathwell, senior vice president of AEG Live said the tickets were priced and sold as fairly as possible and assured there as no conspiracy between those who handled the tour and brokers. [...] "We do <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> power to stop brokers from getting tickets, but it's impossible", she concluded. However, some brokers denied the allegations of purchasing most tickets for the shows. Brian Posey, owner of The Ticket Machine, an online broker based in East Lansing, Michigan, commented, [...] "I've never seen this as far as availability for any show. It's never been that hard to get tickets for us. You don't see seats anywhere. Parents shouldn't blame brokers for snapping up loads of tickets." [...] He continued to complain that the company was only able to purchase 28 tickets, while they usually averaged hundreds of tickets for hot tours.|$|E

The World Cup venue at Arica was named Estadio Carlos Dittborn in his honour and bears his name to this day. Even with these few and low-capacity stadiums Chile was able to meet the demand for seats as international travel to Chile, far-away for Europe, was minimal at the time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Everything</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>our</b> {{everyday}} lives: New discoveries, paradigms, styles, and technologies. Frequently, software systems success {{depends on}} how they can quickly adapt to requirement or environment evolution. Software architectures are abstract models at the highest level. As such, they should assume conceptual guidance on what parts of the system changed. However, many software architectures often evolve from an uncoordinated build-and-fix attitude. The result is opaque and not analyzable. We present in this paper a practical experience of using aspect oriented programming principles for managing software architecture specification evolution. Our approach aims at clarifying software architecture evolution steps. It extends software architecture abstract models for the specification and the analysis of new concern integration. ...|$|R
