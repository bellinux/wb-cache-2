5|$|Vrba {{moved to}} Canada in 1967, {{where he worked}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medical</b> Research Council of Canada from 1967 to 1973. He became a Canadian citizen in 1972. From 1973 to 1975 he was a {{research}} fellow at Harvard Medical School, focusing on cancer research, where, in 1974, he met his second wife, Robin Vrba. They married in 1975 and returned to Vancouver, where she became a real-estate agent and he an associate professor of pharmacology at the University of British Columbia. He worked there until the early 1990s, publishing over 50 research papers on the chemistry of the brain, diabetes and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Vrba's {{marriage}} ended {{around this}} time. In 1958 {{he received an}} invitation to an international conference in Israel, and while there he defected. He worked {{for the next two}} years at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. He said later that he could not continue to live in Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now in positions of power there. In 1960 he moved instead to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medical</b> Research Council.

5|$|As it {{was easier}} to raise money for medical purposes, {{particularly}} cancer treatment, than for nuclear physics, Lawrence encouraged the use of the cyclotron for medical research. Working with his brother John and Israel Lyon Chaikoff from the University of California's Physiology Department, Lawrence supported research into the use of radioactive isotopes for therapeutic purposes. Phosphorus-32 was easily produced in the cyclotron, and John used it to cure a woman afflicted with polycythemia vera, a blood disease. John used phosphorus-32 created in the 37-inch cyclotron in 1938 in tests on mice with leukemia. He found that the radioactive phosphorus concentrated in the fast-growing cancer cells. This then led to clinical trials on human patients. A 1948 evaluation of the therapy showed that remissions occurred under certain circumstances. Lawrence also had hoped <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> use of neutrons. The first cancer patient received neutron therapy from the 60-inch cyclotron on November 20. Chaikoff conducted trials on the use of radioactive isotopes as radioactive tracers to explore the mechanism of biochemical reactions.|$|E
5|$|Demobilisation also {{included}} establishing arrangements <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> care of ex-service personnel. After the war responsibility for medical treatment was gradually {{transferred from the}} services to the Repatriation Commission. The Army's hospitals were also transferred to the Commission, meeting its immediate need for facilities. It proved necessary to build new hospitals {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis and mental disorders, however as the specialised Army hospitals established for the treatment of these conditions were respectively unsatisfactory and had to be returned to the Government of New South Wales. The Department of Social Services was responsible for providing assistance to veterans with a disability not caused by their military service, and this led to the foundation of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to budget}} {{decreases}} and increased {{demands on the}} university, the UCF Board of Trustees, {{with the approval of}} the Board of Governors and the Florida Legislature, approved a 15% increase in tuition for the 2012–13 academic year. For the 2016-17 academic year, undergraduate tuition costs were $212.28 per credit hour for in-state students, and $748.89 per credit hour for out-of-state students. Graduate tuition costs were $369.65 per credit hour for in-state students, and $1,194.05 per credit hour for out-of-state students. Tuition <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> school is $25,490 for both in-state and out-of-state students. Estimated annual cost for undergraduate students is $17,295 for Florida residents, and $33,392 for non-Florida residents. Expected costs for graduate students are $22,072 for in-state students, and $38,878 for out-of-state students. About 8% of tuition fees are allocated to support the university's athletic programs.|$|E

5|$|He {{was awarded}} the Beit Memorial Fellowship by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator {{position}} and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be viruses. For this work he received a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1928 {{under the direction of}} Professor J. D. Ledingham and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medical</b> Research Council's System of Bacteriology. He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the Royal Society of Medicine in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the Fabian Society functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur archaeology and cycling through continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{tensions}} {{within the}} team and from publisher 2K Games continued during the development process. According to LeBreton, Levine was distrustful {{of some of the}} more egotistical newer hires and was often arguing with them to enforce his vision of BioShock. 2K Games was concerned with the growing budget for the title, and told Levine to market the title more as a first-person shooter rather than the first-person shooter/role player game hybrid they set out for. Near the targeted release date, Levine ordered the team into round-the-clock development, creating more strife in the team. Paul Hellquist, the game's lead designer, was often omitted from key design meetings, which he later recounted was due to his contrary nature to Levine, questioning several of his choices; he used his frustration to put into the design efforts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medical</b> Pavilion level that {{he was in charge of}} at that time. Near the anticipated completion date, 2K decided to give Irrational another three months to polish up the game, extending the current crunch time the studio was already under.|$|E
