40|$|The present {{essay is}} meant to provide some {{background}} {{on the evolution of}} the soil science community in Brazil, since its inception, to describe its current situation, and to outline a number of opportunities and challenges facing the discipline in decades to come. The origin of Brazilian agronomy dates {{back to the beginning of}} the 19 th century as a subdiscipline of botany, and its association with chemistry would later establish it as a science. In the middle of the 19 th century, agricultural chemistry was born as a result of this association, leading to the establishment of <b>edaphology,</b> a branch of Soil Science. Another branch of Soil Science, known as pedology, was established as an applied and scientific knowledge in Brazil during the middle of the 20 th century. During the same period, the Brazilian Soil Science Society (SBCS) was created, merging the knowledge of both branches and gathering all scientists involved. Twenty years after the SBCS foundation, the creation of Graduate Programs made Brazilian Soil Science enter the modern era, generating crucial knowledge to reach the current levels of agricultural productivity. Part of a community composed of 25 Soil Departments, 15 Graduate Programs and a great number of institutions that promote research and technology transfer, Brazilian soil scientists are responsible for developing solutions for sustainable development, by generating, adapting and transferring technology to the benefit of the country. The knowledge produced by SBCS members has been particularly significant for Brazil to achieve the status of most competitive tropical agriculture in the world.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of factors {{involved in a}} forest fire, such as the fire regime, {{the time of year}} in which the fire occurs in relation to the phase of the yearly development of the existing vegetation, the type of vegetation, its ability to adapt to fire conditions, its germinative characteristics, the post-fire weather conditions and even the microclimatic effects resulting from differences in aspect, makes it impossible to predict with absolute certainty the response ability of vegetation after a fire has occurred. Monitoring the post-fire evolution of forest systems affected by large fires helps fire management specialists to establish the most appropriate action for restoring the burned areas. The Forest Fires Monitoring Program for the Murcia Region, presented herein, has implemented the study of the effects of two large fires on the region’s forest ecosystems, namely Calasparra in 1991, which affected 800 ha, and Moratella in 1994, where 24, 000 ha were affected, 65 % of which were wooded area. Although the evolution of forest systems depends a great deal on the ecological conditions and the type of management implemented, the structure and constitution of the existing new population—that is, the regeneration—is one of the most decisive aspects. Using territorial information regarding land use, vegetation, relief, <b>edaphology,</b> etc., and basing data primarily on the 1999 National Forestry Inventory conducted in the Region of Murcia, the Program divides the territory into zones according to their current state of regeneration and examines the main indicators of the state of these areas. With the results obtained, the process can be characterized appropriately and used to plan measures aimed at restoration, conservation, and improvement of the vegetation cover, as well as other important measures to diminish erosion, such as stabilizing slopes and correcting torrential flow through hydraulic engineering, and protective measures against the risk of forest fires and the phytosanitary damages that inevitably result from a fire...|$|E
40|$|The runoff {{threshold}} (P 0) {{is one of}} the key parameters in {{the study}} of catchment hydrological response. It is fundamental in the analysis of rainfall-runoff conversion processes, for estimating water budgets and for describing the genesis of hortonian overland flow, as it provides information on the precipitation losses within the fluvial systems, from the start of the episode until runoff is produced. There are several methods for estimating this parameter. In the case of small semiarid and Mediterranean basins, complex models are not suitable due to the specific conditions of these environments as well as the quantity of data required for the models. In these environments, empirical methods have demonstrated to be more effective. One of the most used models in Spain is that developed by the US Soil Conservation Service (SCS) in 1972, and modified by Témez (1978, 1991). This is a simple, easy to apply model, which uses slope values, vegetation, land use and soil hydrological group data. In spite of the generalized application of the model and its multiple adaptations, there are still many uncertainties, mainly related to the soil hydrological groups which, together with land use, are the most sensitive variables in runoff threshold estimation. These uncertainties are especially important in small semiarid basins and Mediterranean ephemeral streams where soils are generally very heterogeneous, not well developed, highly dependent on underlying rock and have been heavily exploited. In order to improve runoff threshold estimation in semiarid environments, some authors have included detailed information about soils in the model but without improving the results significantly. Others have assigned the soil hydrological group directly from lithology, without considering soil type. This paper proposes some modifications to the SCS method related to the assignation of the soil hydrological group in order to improve runoff threshold estimation in Mediterranean basins. In these environments, hydrological behavior is highly determined by the strong interaction between geomorphological structure, lithology and <b>edaphology.</b> These three variables are combined at basin scale, in order to assign the soil hydrological group with the aim of using hidrogeomorphological interpretation to improve runoff threshold estimation. The method has been applied, using GIS, to several small basins located in the Mediterranean Spanish region. Although the estimation of runoff threshold using a GIS is a process which can be easily automated, the proposed modification requires the expert geomorphological knowledge of the catchment. Runoff thresholds obtained with this method are presented here. Although the results have to be checked with runoff threshold data obtained by water budget, so far they are consistent with the expected values for the study area from literature references...|$|E

Monitoring young stage growth started {{one and a half}} year after sowing by establishing 31 round sample plots of 300 m 2 under quality of site stratification criterion. Gathered data during four years were used to calculate the S. I. with the Schumacher and Korf equations. The return showed R² of 67. 2446 % for Schumacher, 67. 5393 % for Korf and (67, 4306 %) for Richard y Chapman, the paired sample comparison was not significantly different. The resulting S.

40|$|The city of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas, has {{historically}} presented processes landslides {{in the southern}} part of the valley, specifically in deposits of slope whose genesis is determined from La Mesa karst of Copoya, geological forms subjected to intense fracturing processes dissolution and erosion, giving as a result the breaking into large blocks. These are distributed in the margins of La Mesa being altered and destroyed by mechanical and chemical weathering, which generated smaller particles that rest on siltstones, shale and sandstones. This condition determines that the slopes are unstable by nature. A 1000 x 1000 m grid was constructed, corresponding to the canvass of the Mercator Transverse Universal Coordinate System (UTM) of the topographic map scale 1 : 50 000 (INEGI, 1984; INEGI, 2004; Lugo-Hubp, 1988). In each cell a centroid was generated to apply the interpolation process and draw isolines. For numerical variables such as drainage density and unevenness, defined ranges (number of equal intervals) were used by ArcMap software (version 9. 3). For the non-quantitative variables such as geology, <b>edaphology</b> and soil use and vegetation, the same AHP method was used, obtaining numerical values for the cartographic representation. In all three cases, the normalized values and a Consistency Index (CI) and Consistency Ratio (CR) (the latter according to the dimension of the matrix) were obtained, below 10 %, so that the weights are correct. In order to obtain information on the changes in the use of the ground, images of Google Earth of 2006, 2008 and 2010 were revised. Subsequently, a very high resolution orthophoto was added (pixel of 0. 2 m), obtained for cadastral purposes by Town Hall of Tuxtla Gutierrez between the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013. Finally, five layers of information are defined, one for each variable, and the final result overlaps with the events recorded in the last nine years (2006 to date), which shows that the areas classified as Very High Threat are the more susceptible to the occurrence of these events. It is to be expected that in time, the incidence of this type of phenomena is manifested in the levels of High and Very High Threat. Applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) developed by Saaty (1988), which consists of matrix analysis and involves value judgments. In this way the matrix of preference over the selected criteria was generated, obtaining the weighting of the five chosen variables. It was important the knowledge of the study area, the documentation and local studies generated to date, where the criteria of the specialists are taken up. The process was done in an Excel spreadsheet (2007 version), applying the corresponding formulas. Because only five variables and the size of the area (250 km 2) were handled, no specialized software was required. With the data obtained a table was created in which a column with the name of "Threat" was created, which corresponds to the sum of the parameters of the six criteria mentioned above. This is reflected in the Map of Threats by Mass Removal Processes. Thus, in the one the extreme values are included in a range from 0 to 1. The map of hazard by removing processes in mass or landslide (PRM), was developed from the heuristic combination of multi-criteria analysis method, and determined five levels of threat in the urban area, covering the following percentages: Very Low 5 %, Low 27. 1 %, Middle 39. 3 %, High 15. 3 % and Very High 13. 3 %, the latter being distributed mostly in slope deposits around La Mesa of Copoya, confirming their status as maximum hazard. For Tuxtla Gutierrez is estimated a population exposed about 62, 500 inhabitants (11. 6 % of the total) (537. 102 inhabitants in the urban area) who reside both {{in the southern part}} of the city and 30 rural towns settled on the flanks of La Mesa of Copoya; estimates about 28, 000 dwellings exposed grouped into 850 blocks. Current trends in the growth of the city, make evident the need to manage and regulate new buildings. Although the southern slope is determined unstable by nature, on the northern the housing complexes are changing the slope geometry sets, which can be a trigger for the occurrence of landslide in the short and medium term factor...|$|E
