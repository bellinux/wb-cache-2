5|$|Charles DeWitt Watts (September 21, 1917 – July 12, 2004) was an African American {{surgeon and}} activist <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> Watts {{was the first}} surgeon of African American ancestry in North Carolina. Earning his medical degree in 1943 from Howard University College, {{he was the first}} African American board {{certified}} surgeon to serve in North Carolina. After surgical training at Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C. in 1949, he moved to Durham, North Carolina in 1950 and established a clinic to provide access to medical services <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> Breaking the social customs of racial obstacles, he advocated for certification of African American medical students. He also became a member of many professional colleges including the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine and the American College of Surgeons. He served as chief of surgery at Durham's Lincoln Hospital and was later one of the key figures in converting it to the Lincoln Community Health Center, a low-priced clinic <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b>|$|E

5|$|In London, {{there was}} a great massing of the poor, and the Reformation {{threatened}} to eliminate some of the infrastructure used to provide <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> As a result, King Henry VIII consented to re-endow St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1544 and St. Thomas’ Hospital in 1552 on the condition that the citizens of London pay for their maintenance. However, the city was unable to raise enough revenue from voluntary contributions, so it instituted the first definite compulsory Poor Rate in 1547 which replaced Sunday collections in Church with a mandatory collection <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> In 1555, London became increasingly concerned with the number of poor who could work, but yet could not find work, so it established the first House of Correction (predecessor to the workhouse) in the King’s Palace at Bridewell where poor could receive shelter and work at cap-making, feather-bed making, and wire drawing.|$|E

50|$|Generally, it {{is assumed}} that value of {{marginal}} propensity to save <b>for</b> <b>the</b> richer is more than the marginal propensity to save <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorer.</b> If income increases for both parties by $1, then the propensity to save for a richer person would be more than that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorer</b> person.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{of poverty}} {{dynamics}} relying solely on household income-expenditure surveys can yield noisy results, overestimating transient poverty and underestimating persistence of poverty, especially <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest.</b> In this study, we {{make use of}} an approach that relies on community based change ranking to explore various directions and levels of change experienced by almost 6, 000 households living in over 100 communities. We find that changes are initial condition dependent and that improvement, even small ones are {{far less likely to}} happen over time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest.</b> Traps do seem to exist and matter <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest.</b> This suggests that intervention design <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> will have to be far more comprehensive including promotional, protective and transformative strategies to make a real dent on extreme poverty.

5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus {{taught that}} a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not {{anything}} in this life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes in opposition to other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E

His dream {{to build a}} school <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> which taught both English and Chinese (Hokkien, as Mandarin was not commonly used in Southeast Asia then) was fulfilled in 1885, when he built the Anglo-Chinese Free School for boys in some shophouses in Telok Ayer Street (not related to the Anglo-Chinese School founded a year later by Bishop W.F. Oldham). In 1923, it was renamed to Gan Eng Seng School (GESS) in his honour.|$|E

5|$|Conrad rebuilt and {{expanded}} Salzburg Cathedral {{and built the}} cathedral chapter house, and in 1140 he created the cathedral cemetery. He built hospitals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> of the city, and commenced construction of St. Peter's monastery where his former residence stood, moving to a new archbishop's residence nearer the cathedral. Conrad founded several monasteries and reformed others, a total of 17 in which {{the rule of the}} Augustinian Canons Regular prevailed. These included St. Zeno, Gurk, Reichersberg, Berchtesgaden, Baumburg, Gars am Inn, Au am Inn, Ranshofen, Höglwörth, Herrenchiemsee, Seckau and Suben. The archbishop supported the Benedictines.|$|E
5|$|During the Victorian {{expansion}} of Manchester, Didsbury {{developed as a}} prosperous settlement; a few mansions from the period still exist on Wilmslow Road between Didsbury village and Parrs Wood {{to the east and}} Withington to the north, but they have now been converted to nursing homes and offices. The opening of the Midland Railway line in 1880 contributed greatly to the rapid growth in the population of Didsbury, with stations at Didsbury and Withington and West Didsbury offering easy rail connections to Manchester Central. The line closed in 1967, although Didsbury station building remained standing until its demolition in the 1980s. The station clock and water fountain have survived, dedicated to local doctor and campaigner <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> Dr. J. Milson Rhodes.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1879-1880, {{extended}} periods of extreme cold affected the Netherlands. Permafrost and temperatures down to minus 16 degrees Celsius led to distress among the citizens of Delft. In response, Matthes founded the Vereeniging voor Armenzorg (Association to care <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor),</b> helping regardless of religious or political beliefs. She prompted her husband to launch a Wintersnood-Commissie, which was led by him, his brother-in-law Arnold Kerdijk, and CEO-to-be Gerard Knuttel.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian cuisine has ancient roots, with {{evidence}} that, for example, cheese {{has been made}} in Egypt since at least 3,000 BC. Ful medames, a stew of fava beans with oil and cumin, is popular in Egypt and has become widespread across the Arab world. Duqqa is a dip made of pounded herbs, hazelnuts and spices, eaten with bread. Kushari is a foreign-derived 19th century dish of rice, lentils and pasta, variously garnished; it began as food <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> but has become a national dish.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> hemp was {{the common}} item {{used to make}} clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of more modest means could wear wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{proposed}} that the U.S. dollar should have fractional coins using decimals, rather than eighths like the Spanish coinage. This innovation was originally suggested by Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris, with whom Hamilton corresponded after examining one of Morris's Nova Constellatio coins in 1783. He also desired the minting of small value coins, such as silver ten-cent and copper cent and half-cent pieces, for reducing {{the cost of living}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> One of his main objectives was for the general public to become accustomed to handling money on a frequent basis.|$|E

This paper compare returns differences between an integrated region that houses main growth centers and a less integrated region which remains cutoff from these centers by large rivers.

The magnitude of reduction is larger <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorer</b> households.
