Harlan later reported that Söderbaum was so upset by the entire affair that she considered fleeing back to her native Sweden to avoid having to play the part of Dorothea. In the end, however, she decided to stay and performed the role.|$|E

25|$|Often a poset {{comes with}} a natural {{candidate}} for a rank function; for instance if its elements are finite subsets of some base set B, one can take the number of elements of those subsets. Then the criterion <b>just</b> <b>given</b> can be more practical than the definition because it avoids mention of covers. For instance if B is itself a poset, and P consists of its finite lower sets (subsets for which with every one of its elements, all smaller elements {{are also in the}} subset), then the criterion is automatically satisfied, since for lower sets xnbsp&⊂nbsp&z there is always a maximal element of z that is absent from x, and it can be removed from z to form y.|$|E
