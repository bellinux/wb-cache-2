5|$|The Magazine of Natural History of 1829 {{expressed}} {{surprise at}} the long interval {{between the first and}} second editions, surmising that there were too few scientific readers in France, apart from those in Paris itself; it notes that while the first volume was little changed, the treatment of fish was considerably altered in volume II, while the section on the Articulata was greatly enlarged (to two volumes, IV and V) and written by M. Latreille. It also expressed the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be an English equivalent of Cuvier's work, given the popularity of natural history resulting from the works of Thomas Bewick (A History of British Birds 1797–1804) and George Montagu (Ornithological Dictionary, 1802). The same review covers Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville's Iconographie du Règne Animal de M. le Baron Cuvier, which offered illustrations of all Cuvier's genera (except for the birds).|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{garrison}} in {{the city}} were in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be relief relied on from nearby Venlo under Francisco Mendoza who had arrived with a force in late July. Mendoza went out {{with the aim of}} relieving Grave but soon discovered the significant size of the Dutch and English besieging force when the leading part of the Spanish column ran into strong positions and were repelled with loss. The city garrison on hearing the news of Mendoza close by at the same time made several unsuccessful sallies on the besieging army wasting men and supplies. This abruptly stopped when they heard news that the Mendoza's troops were forced to turn back to Venlo in late August; mutinies also played their part in the Spanish retreat.|$|E
500|$|Other writers, such as Mark Anthony Neal, have {{described}} these lyrical themes {{as a form}} of “brooding introspection”, disclosing the tortured dimensions of drug crime and its impressions on an adolescent Nas. Critic Sam Chennault wrote, [...] "Nas captures post-crack N.Y.C. in all its ruinous glory ... ealizing that drugs were both empowering and destructive, his lyrics alternately embrace and reject the idea of ghetto glamour". According to Steve Juon of RapReviews.com, Nas [...] "illustrates the Queensbridge trife life of his , {{while at the same time}} providing <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is something greater than money, guns and drugs." [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post described Nas's coming-of-age experience as [...] "balancing limitations and possibilities, distinguishing hurdles and springboards, and acknowledging his own growth from roughneck adolescent to a maturing adult who can respect and criticize the culture of violence that surrounds him.|$|E

500|$|Generally, Joseph's music gets airplay in {{the adult}} contemporary, smooth jazz, easy listening, and {{beautiful}} music radio formats, and while some is classified in the new age genre, he considers contemporary instrumental to fit his style of playing the best. [...] In discussing Rapture, John Blake of The Atlanta Journal notes that often new age music sounds as if it should be played in a supermarket. The songs can sound like musical cotton candy — soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. [...] "For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake." [...] "The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream." [...] Along the same line, Michael Debbage of Mainly Piano says that Rapture almost single-handedly gave a sense of <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was much more that the New Age genre could offer. [...] Cicily Janus remarks that, [...] "Although Bradley has been, at times, pigeon holed into an offshoot of jazz, his message through his music is universal in its appeal and soothing qualities." ...|$|E
500|$|The cast was {{receptive}} to the finale storyline. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, actor John Noble noted he liked how the story ultimately ended with having the two Walters [...] "perhaps negotiate a truce and put their minds together" [...] through a [...] "very inventive intervention by Peter, who basically took control of destiny and forced his two fathers to look {{each other in the}} eye, as if telling them: Sort it out, gentlemen.'" [...] He later noted, [...] "We finish [...] in a very dramatic place." [...] Joshua Jackson praised the role-reversal of his character with Walter's, [...] "You had Peter wracked with guilt over the circumstances tied to the decision he made [...] and clinging to <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> might be some way out. I can’t have made a cosmically bad decision! There must be some way to put this right! Which is fascinating, because that’s basically been Walter for as long as we’ve known him. So I loved how Peter ceases to be so stubborn when it comes to Walter, comes to understand him and even begins to see things the way he does." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C" [...] grade rating. She derided the show's need to place The X-Files logo in the teaser, but ultimately {{concluded that the}} episode was a [...] "decent [...] to recap". John Keegan from Critical Myth wrote that the episode [...] "ranks right in the mediocre range" [...] and awarded it a 5 out of 10. He noted, [...] "Overall, this episode did very little for me. I’m sure that the writing staff could {{have come up with}} something better than a bad sixth season plot when the idea of a humorous ninth season episode came to the table. Is there any <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> might be a truly memorable episode where Doggett is allowed to be amused?" [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five. The two argued that the entry was trying to [...] "be a 'Rain King' or a 'Terms of Endearment' and would like to recapture the sweet and charming feel of those early Season Six experiments." [...] However, they noted that because the show was in a different stage—Mulder and Scully were no longer the focus of the show's attention—that [...] "the same style falls flat on its face". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson complained that [...] "The X-Files is draining the trough of teenage angst again". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, felt that the teaser [...] "intrigues for a moment", but that the competing elements of [...] "quirky humour, body horror and teen love story quickly sink this disappointing outing." ...|$|E

[...] According to the US embassy translation it reads [...] "Tonight I am resigning in order to avoid a bloodbath. I accept to leave, with the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will be life and not death." [...] A slightly different translation was given by Albert Valdman, a linguistics professor and specialist in Haitian Creole at Indiana University in Bloomington, Ind.

2500|$|It then states: [...] "As regards {{children}} who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused him to say: 'Let the children come to me, do not hinder them,' allow us to <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is a way of}} salvation for {{children who}} have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism." [...] Merely stating that one can [...] "hope" [...] in a way of salvation other than baptism, the Church thus urgently reiterates its appeal to baptize infants, the only certain means to [...] "not prevent" [...] their [...] "coming to Christ" [...] for salvation.|$|E

2500|$|Later {{comments}} were more favourable of the Pope.

Malaysia’s Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said: [...] "I suppose we could accept this. We <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be no other statements that would anger Muslims." [...] Ali Bardakoğlu, the head of Turkey’s Religious Affairs Directorate said that Benedict’s [...] "expression of sadness {{is a sign that}} he would work for world peace." [...] Australian Muslim leader Ameer Ali said Australian Muslims must [...] "accept the Pope's apology" [...] over remarks that offended Islam and [...] "move on". Filipino Muslims expressed support for Pope Benedict's apology and blamed certain media outlets for increasing the tensions between Muslims and Catholics.|$|E
2500|$|Martial law, {{declared}} on Taiwan in May 1949, {{continued to}} be in effect after the central government relocated to Taiwan. It was not repealed until 1987, and {{was used as a}} way to suppress the political opposition in the intervening years. During the White Terror, as the period is known, 140,000 people were imprisoned or executed for being perceived as anti-KMT or pro-Communist. Many citizens were arrested, tortured, imprisoned and executed for their real or perceived link to the Communists. Since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite, an entire generation of political and social leaders was decimated. In 1998 law was passed to create the [...] "Compensation Foundation for Improper Verdicts" [...] which oversaw compensation to White Terror victims and families. President Ma Ying-jeou made an official apology in 2008, expressing <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will never be a tragedy similar to White Terror.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to tracking down and destroying any copy of Poems and Rhymes Around the World, the foursome {{hope to find}} a [...] "grimoire", a hypothesized spellbook that {{is the source of}} the culling spell. Streator wants to destroy it, believing that the knowledge contained in it is too dangerous, while the others in his group want to learn what other spells it contains—partly in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a spell to resurrect the dead. The group eventually abandons Oyster on the side of the highway after he assaults Helen in an attempt to learn the culling spell. Mona eventually figures out that the datebook Helen had been carrying throughout the trip is the grimoire they had been looking for, written in invisible ink. Helen had acquired it years earlier in the estate of the publisher of Poems and Rhymes Around the World whom she had killed with the culling spell as revenge for the deaths of her husband and child.|$|E

2500|$|Expanded Western {{sanctions}} in mid-March coursed through financial markets, hitting the business interests of some Russia's richest people. The Americans centred {{on the heart}} of Moscow's leadership, though the EU's initial list shied from targeting Putin's inner circle. As ratings agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor's downgraded Russia's credit outlook, Russian banks warned of a sanctions-induced recession, the country braced for capital outflows {{for the first three}} months of 2014 to reach $70 billion, more than the entirety of outflows for 2013, and Russian government-bond issues plummeted by three-quarters compared with the same period the previous year. Novatek, Russia's second-largest gas producer, saw $2.5bn in market value wiped out when its shares sank by nearly 10%, rendering Putin's close friend Gennady Timchenko, who has a 23% stake in the company, $575m poorer. [...] "I do <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is some serious diplomatic activity going on behind the scenes," [...] said one Russian banker, though others were more sanguine on the question of whether the sanctions would have any enduring effect, and Russians, top and bottom, seemed defiant.

When he and Kai Qi reconcile their friendship, he hopes their relationship will move beyond being just friends, but she comes clean that she has feelings for Ah Jie and only want to be friends, which he abides by.
