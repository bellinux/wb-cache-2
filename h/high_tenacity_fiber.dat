Inflatable structures provide a non-mechanical means for compact stowage and reliable deployment. This paper provides historical background on early examples of inflatable wings, including several early patents and the Goodyear Inflatoplane. A new approach to inflatable structures utilizes tubular spars manufactured by braiding <b>high</b> <b>tenacity</b> <b>fibers</b> over a thin gas barrier. Such structures can withstand high inflation pressures, which is the key to high strength before wrinkle onset. Reinforcement with high modulus fibers in the axial direction allows stiffness tailoring. The strength and stiffness equations for pressurized reinforced braided tubes are presented and discussed. These are considerably different than those found in the literature for woven fabric pressurized tubes. Examples are given of wing structures, wing deployment and actual flying configurations...|$|R

40|$|To {{develop a}} low cost fiber with the {{mechanical}} properties of spider silk: a tenacity of about 15 g/d and an elongation to break of about 20 % This project was initiated in March 1995 {{to develop a}} fiber that fills the gap between low priced industrial nylon or polyester (tenacity about 9 g/d) and <b>high</b> cost <b>high</b> <b>tenacity</b> reinforcement <b>fibers</b> (<b>tenacity</b> about 25 g/d) such as liquid crystalline or gel spun fibers.

40|$|In the {{composite}} industry for special purposes various textile materials can be apply, {{but in the}} technology of advanced composites dominate: glass, carbon, aramide and polyethylene fibers. Fiber reinforcement became dominant in many engineering applications due to the possibilities of designing various properties of composite materials by changing the arrangements of different fibers. But not all types of fibers {{can be used as}} reinforcement of textile composites. Fibers to be utilized in composites should have specific properties, such as high modulus of elasticity, high ultimate strength, uniform cross section, low variation of properties between individual fibers, and the ability to withstand fabrication without significant property loss. Textile composites are using high performance fibers such as glass, carbon/graphite, aromatic polyamides (aramides – Kevlar), polyesters (HM/HT PES), ceramic fibers, boron and silicon carbide fibers, etc. Textile composites are being widely used in advanced structures in many industrial applications as storage and transport structures (tanks, pipes, hoses, etc.), geotechnical, aerospace, automotive and marine industries. One application of great interest nowadays is the energy production management, {{especially when it comes to}} wind energy (wind mills). Also, high amounts of textile reinforced composites are used in the production of sporting goods and protective equipment. An interesting application is in civil buildings, as walls reinforcement. This is because they possess outstanding physical, thermal and favorable mechanical properties, particularly light weight, high stiffness and strength, good fatigue resistance, excellent corrosion resistance and dimensional stability and attractive reinforcing materials with low production cost and easy handing. In this review the main technical fibers used in textile composite: glass, carbon, aramids and <b>high</b> <b>tenacity</b> polyethylene <b>fibers</b> are discussed. They have superior mechanical characteristics so that can meet the specific demands of advanced composite applications. Each fiber has its own advantages and disadvantages. A comparison between reinforcing material properties is also shown. In terms of technology, all specific processes from textile industries may be used to produce complex structures, but, due to their characteristics and the material geometry that results, they lead to different behavior and recommend materials for various applications. The main production processes employed in textile reinforcements are weaving, braiding, knitting and non-woven production. The selection of a specific technological process takes into account its architectural capabilities, the material characteristics and behavior (dimensional stability, mechanic strength, drapability and formability, etc.), as well as its suitability for {{the composite}} processing and application.

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in carbon fiber-reinforced magnesium alloy composites (CF/MgAl-MMC) for lightweight applications. Especially in automotive and aerospace industries they offer outstanding mechanical properties combined with low density. Nevertheless, major obstacles in manufacturing of CF/MgAl-MMC are high reactivity and poor wettability of the carbon fibers with molten Mg-Al alloy. Often an undesired formation of carbides (e. g. Al 2 MgC 2 and Al 4 C 3) at the fiber-matrix interface is observed [1]. Another problem is the sensitivity of carbon fibers to the oxidation especially at temperatures of more than 400 °C [2]. In order to overcome the major obstacles an alumina protective coating is applied on carbon fiber-based textile preforms. 2 D-textile preforms are used which consist of <b>high</b> <b>tenacity</b> (HT) carbon <b>fibers.</b> Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed for coating of preforms. The ALD process is performed at a substrate temperature of 220 °C and a total pressure of 0. 5 kPa using the precursors trimethylaluminum (TMA) and ozone. SEM analysis revealed a conformal and uniform coating with a thickness of 30 ± 3 nm and a good adhesion on carbon fibers (Fig. 1). Structure and composition analysis of coated-alumina on planar graphite substrate has revealed an amorphous structure and stoichiometric alumina formation (Al/O atomic ratio ~ 0. 66). The influence of coating on the carbon fibers was investigated by measurement of the tensile strength with single filaments and by determination of the oxidation behavior using TGA analysis. Coated fibers with alumina show a small reduction of the tensile strength of approx. 20 %. The TGA results confirm an improvement of oxidation resistance of carbon fibers by alumina coating. The infiltration of the Al 2 O 3 -coated 2 D-textile preform was performed with Mg-Al alloy AZ 91 (9 wt. % Al) by gas pressure infiltration (GPI).
