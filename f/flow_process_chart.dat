40|$|In practice, way {{of supply}} of {{workplaces}} often affects production process realization. This {{is particularly true}} {{in the majority of}} small and medium enterprises in non-automotive sector, where production is functionally organized. Literature review confirms that production processes and their logistics support are organizationally and operationally connected to each other and in most cases even inseparable, performed by the same employees. The latter restricts efforts to determine the impact of supply on overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and on productivity in a broader sense. Assessed impact of supply on OEE indicator forms an excellent starting point for decision making and planning of investments in production and inbound logistics. Practice shows that investments in production machines prevail over investments in inbound logistics.

40|$|The {{research}} {{problem in this}} thesis {{is related to the}} sheet metal NC process and its requirements {{from the point of view}} of data transferring. The aim is to map the current state of sheet metal production of the company with its information flows, and to find the potential problems associated with it. The company is known to be implementing a new CAD design environment and the product information management system. In addition, the company’s intention is to introduce a new laser machine that will require new software to support nesting. This change has progressed to the point where the current process needs to be mapped and the related information flows identified. The research is limited to examining the sheet metal process from design to production, focusing on the programming department. The focus will be on identifying the information related to the programming department and in the stages of the production process where programming is associated. A qualitative case study, in which the interviews of the target persons have been conducted as semi-structured, is used as a research method. The knowledge of sheet metal production is expanded with a literature study that provides the basics needed to conduct a case study. For the basis of the case study, the <b>process</b> <b>flow</b> <b>charts</b> were developed based on the most important aspects of the sheet metal process of the company.
