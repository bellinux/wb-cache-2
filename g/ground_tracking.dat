5|$|AS-204 {{was to be}} {{the first}} manned test flight of the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) to Earth orbit, {{launched}} on a Saturn IB rocket. AS-204 was to test launch operations, <b>ground</b> <b>tracking</b> and control facilities and the performance of the Apollo-Saturn launch assembly and would have lasted up to two weeks, depending on how the spacecraft performed.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{announcement}} was made public on March 21, 1966. The two-week flight of Apollo 1 was not only to test the spacecraft systems, but also the <b>ground</b> <b>tracking</b> and control facilities. While Chaffee had monitored the manufacture of the Gemini spacecraft, he had not witnessed {{the building of the}} Apollo spacecraft. Three days after being selected for the Apollo 1 crew, he flew out to the North American Aviation Plant in Downey, California, to see it.|$|E
25|$|Tracking {{is where}} skydivers take a body {{position}} {{to achieve a}} high forward speed, allowing them to cover a great distance over the <b>ground.</b> <b>Tracking</b> is also used {{at the end of}} group jumps to achieve separation from other jumpers before parachute deployment. The tracking position involves sweeping the arms out {{to the side of the}} body and straightening the legs with the toes pointed.|$|E
50|$|A {{satellite}} whose {{orbital period}} is an integer {{fraction of a}} day (e.g., 24 hours, 12 hours, 8 hours, etc.) will follow roughly the same <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> every day. This <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> is shifted east or west depending on the longitude of the ascending node, which can vary over time due to perturbations of the orbit. If {{the period of the}} satellite is slightly longer than an integer fraction of a day, the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> will shift west over time; if it is slightly shorter, the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> will shift east.|$|R
30|$|The {{effects of}} {{satellite}} <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> changes of GRACE on monthly gravity field recoveries are investigated. In {{the case of}} a gravity field recovery using {{a relatively short period of}} a month or so, the variation of <b>ground</b> <b>tracks</b> affects the precision of the gravity field solutions. It is a serious problem when the solutions are employed for detecting temporal gravity changes which are almost at their detection limits. In this study, the recoveries of four-weekly gravity fields are simulated and the relation between the recovery precision and the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> is investigated. The result shows that the GRACE <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> of the year 2003 was in good condition for four-week gravity field recovery, but it will sometimes appear as worse cases as the orbit altitude decays. In those cases, the global standard deviations of geoid height errors will be about one order worse than the best case. From our simulation, <b>ground</b> <b>tracks</b> of around altitudes of 473, 448, 399, 350 and 337 km give insufficient spatial resolutions, even for gravity field recovery up to degree 30.|$|R

2500|$|The 20 {{unmanned}} flights used Little Joe, Redstone, and Atlas launch vehicles. They {{were used}} to develop the launch vehicles, launch escape system, spacecraft and tracking network. One flight of a Scout rocket attempted to launch an unmanned satellite for testing the <b>ground</b> <b>tracking</b> network, but failed to reach orbit. [...] The Little Joe program used seven airframes for eight flights, of which three were successful. The second Little Joe flight was named Little Joe 6, because it was inserted into the program after the first 5 airframes had been allocated.|$|E
2500|$|On November 5, 2002, {{a missile}} {{launched}} from a CIA-controlled Predator drone killed al-Qaeda members traveling {{in a remote}} area in Yemen. SAD/SOG paramilitary teams {{had been on the}} <b>ground</b> <b>tracking</b> their movements for months and called in this air strike. [...] One of those in the car was Ali Qaed Senyan al-Harthi, al-Qaeda's chief operative in Yemen and a suspect in the October 2000 bombing of the destroyer [...] Five other people, believed to be low-level al-Qaeda members, were also killed to include an American named Kamal Derwish. [...] Former Deputy U.S. Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz called it [...] "a very successful tactical operation" [...] and said [...] "such strikes are useful not only in killing terrorists but in forcing al-Qaeda to change its tactics".|$|E
2500|$|The first air–launch was {{performed}} on 25 July 1958 by NOTS research pilot William West, a career US Navy officer. The flight originated from China Lake's airstrip at Inyokern. The jet fighter was placed into a steep climb. The rocket released automatically at 41,000 feet, and three seconds later the first two HOTROCs ignited. The pilot was distracted during this time–the sudden release of weight had flipped his aircraft into a tumble. In mid–crisis, West {{looked up and saw}} what he thought was the vehicle exploding. He reported it that way, but John Nicolaides (director of the Navy's space program in Washington D.C.) later determined that the [...] "explosion" [...] was the plume from the rocket's motors as the exhaust expanded in the thin atmosphere. However, when ground control heard the report of the [...] "explosion", it ordered the <b>ground</b> <b>tracking</b> stations (approximately six in number) around the world to stand down. Thus only one station (at Christchurch NZ) remained on the air; it heard a beeping {{in the right place at}} the right time. However, the signal was not repeated, so the shot was declared a failure.|$|E

If the proper initial conditions are chosen that correspond to these Mean Elements, the orbit can also be propagated with the full gravity field and form another <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> repeat pattern. Further, if the effects of other perturbative forces are compensated for, such that the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> remains near this pattern, the central body effects can again be considered repetitive.

40|$|Science {{requirements}} for the GLAS mission demand that the laser altimeter be pointed to within 50 m of {{the location of the}} previous repeat <b>ground</b> <b>track.</b> The satellite will be flown in a repeat orbit of 182 days. Operationally, the required pointing information will be determined on the ground using the nominal <b>ground</b> <b>track,</b> to which pointing is desired, and the current propagated orbit of the satellite as inputs to the roll computation algorithm developed by CCAR. The roll profile will be used to generate a set of fit coefficients which can be uploaded on a daily basis and used by the on-board attitude control system. In addition, an algorithm has been developed for computation of the associated command quaternions which will be necessary when pointing at targets of opportunity. It may be desirable in the future to perform the roll calculation in an autonomous real-time mode on-board the spacecraft. GPS can provide near real-time tracking of the satellite, and the nominal <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> can be stored in the on-board computer. It will be necessary to choose the spacing of this nominal <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> to meet storage requirements in the on-board environment.

50|$|A {{satellite}} <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> may {{be thought}} of as a path along the Earth's surface which traces the movement of an imaginary line between the satellite and the center of the Earth.

50|$|The sole {{instrument}} on ICESat was the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), a space-based LIDAR. GLAS combined {{a precision}} surface LIDAR with a sensitive dual-wavelength cloud and aerosol LIDAR. The GLAS lasers emit infrared and visible laser pulses at 1064 and 532 nm wavelengths. As ICESat orbited, GLAS produces {{a series of}} approximately 70 m diameter laser spots that are separated by nearly 170 m along the spacecraft's <b>ground</b> <b>track.</b> During the commissioning phase of the mission, the ICESat was placed into an orbit which allowed the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> to repeat every 8 days. During August and September 2004, the satellite was maneuvered into a 91-day repeating <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> for the main portion of the mission.|$|R

This effect occurs because the satellite orbits more slowly than the speed at which the Earth rotates beneath it. Any satellite in a true retrograde orbit will always move from east to west along its <b>ground</b> <b>track,</b> regardless of the length of its orbital period.|$|R
