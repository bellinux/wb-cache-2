40|$|Arterial {{compliance}} as {{evaluated by}} three different <b>indices</b> (<b>pulse</b> wave velocity, pulse pressure stroke volume, and an exponential {{analysis of the}} diastolic pressure decay) {{was found to be}} abnormal in patients with established essential hypertension and particularly in elderly hypertensive patients. Two of the three indices reflected significantly impaired arterial compliance already in borderline hypertension. Age, systolic, and diastolic pressures evolved as independent determinants of pulse wave velocity. It is concluded that arterial compliance becomes impaired early in hypertensive cardiovascular disease at the time when arterial pressure is only to the borderline level. However, age per se seems to be the most predominant risk factor for systemic arterial disease...|$|R
50|$|Measurement of aortic PWV {{provides}} some of the strongest evidence concerning the prognostic significance of large artery stiffening. Increased aortic PWV has been shown to predict cardiovascular, and in some cases all cause, mortality in individuals with end stage renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and in the general population. However, at present, the role of measurement of PWV as a general clinical tool remains to be established. Devices are on the market that measure arterial stiffness parameters (augmentation <b>index,</b> <b>pulse</b> wave velocity). These include the Complior, CVProfilor, PeriScope, Hanbyul Meditech, Mobil-O-Graph NG, BP Plus (Pulsecor), PulsePen, BPLab Vasotens, Arteriograph, and SphygmoCor.|$|E
50|$|An {{incremental}} encoder works differently by providing an A and a B pulse output that provide no usable count information {{in their own}} right. Rather, the counting {{is done in the}} external electronics. The point where the counting begins depends on the counter in the external electronics and not on the position of the encoder. To provide useful position information, the encoder position must be referenced to the device to which it is attached, generally using an <b>index</b> <b>pulse.</b> The distinguishing feature of the {{incremental encoder}} is that it reports an incremental change in position of the encoder to the counting electronics.|$|E

30|$|The {{observation}} instrument {{measures the}} direction of particle arrival and propagation of electromagnetic waves synchronously with the satellite spin. Therefore, the spin <b>index</b> <b>pulse</b> (pulses notifying the timing when the sun sensor has detected the sun in each spin) should be distributed to each instrument. The MDP receives the spin <b>index</b> <b>pulse</b> from the bus part as a pulse by an RS 422 signal, a dedicated line. After the receipt, the MDP delivers the spin index pulses to each instrument using the TimeCode function with an error of 30  μs or less. The TimeCode used for the above synchronization of the time slot is distinguished by changing the identifier flag that is the empty bit of the time code in the RMAP regulation.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{synchronize}} the scientific {{data collected by}} multiple instruments, an <b>index</b> <b>pulse</b> (IP) was distributed to each instrument by the AOCP. An IP is normally generated from a Sun detection pulse generated by the SSAS in each spin, but when the satellite is {{in the shadow of}} the Earth, the IP generation mode must be changed to automated IP mode. However, the duration of the eclipse changes as the orbit is perturbed. When the apogee is in the Earth’s shadow, the eclipse lasts around 2  h, and the scientific observation mode is shifted to the degenerate mode in which several instruments are switched to standby mode to save electrical power.|$|E

In this work, a new methodology and a software prototype developed for this task are presented.

40|$|Yoga is {{a process}} of gaining control over the mind, as defined by Patanjali. Stress has been implicated as one of the major causes of {{essential}} obesity. Yoga works on every cell of the body. Yoga influences body as well as controls the stress in the individual. An index of the processing ability of central nervous system and a simple means of determining sensory-motor performance is referred to as reaction time (RT). It has been proclaimed that human performance including central neural processing is improved by yoga training. It improves cardio respiratory performance, balances autonomic nervous system, decreases pulse, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. To show the effects of yoga and pranayam on auditory and visual RT and on certain physiological parameters such as weight, body mass <b>index,</b> <b>pulse</b> rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure in normal and obesity men. This comparative type of study included 30 normal and 30 obesity. It was carried on subjects between 17 and 25 years of age. Auditory reaction time (ART) and visual reaction time (VRT) were studied in subjects with “Response Analyzer” reaction time apparatus. The physiological parameters such as weight, body mass <b>index,</b> <b>pulse</b> rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were measured. Parameters were measured in two sittings; on admission to yoga center and after six Weekes. Statistical software STATA Version 10. 0 was used for statistical analysis. Result: It was found that changes in the RT and physiological parameters were significant in normal students when compared with obesity individuals. Conclusion: Yoga is a helpful intervention in obesity students. Yoga and pranayama are more beneficial to obesity students.

The objective is to audit the use of uterotonics in the active management of {{the third and fourth}} stages of labor. Methods: Personal data, diagnostic clinical information, blood loss and uterotonics administered were extracted from a cohort of 634 consecutive parturient. Trend in Shock <b>Index</b> (<b>Pulse</b> Rate/Systolic Blood Pressure) and 48 hours hematocrit changes were computed and analyzed. Results: There were 422 vagina deliveries and 212 caesarean sections. Primiparous mothers were 141 (34. 2 %), while grand multiparous mothers were 14 (3. 4 %). The mean visually estimated postpartum blood loss 165. 9 ± 80 ml. There {{was no significant difference in}} the mean blood loss between the three parity groups of parturient [P = 0. 09]. Fourteen parturient (3. 44 %) had blood loss ≥ 500 ml. The value of Shock <b>Index</b> (<b>Pulse</b> Rate/Systolic Blood Pressure) in the study ranged between 0. 43 and 1. 38. Logistic regression analysis of the variables associated with the switch between the three regimens of uterotonic drugs, showed a significant positive correlation between VEBL and uterotonic drugs administered [Pearson correlation = 0. 130, P-value = 0. 008]. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between uterotonic drugs administered and Shock Index at 30 minutes and 2 hours postpartum. The correlation coefficient between VEBL and regimens of uterotonic drugs used was positive and significant (P = 0. 019). Conclusion: Visually estimated blood loss, with shock are the main Triggers involved in switching between uterotonic drugs regimens used in active management of PPH. Shock index calculation is vital in management decision. We advocate training of all birth attendants on VEBL. </p...|$|E

Comparison of the mean velocity in the MCA and the cortical convexity rCBF revealed relatively little hysteresis in their relationship from prior to after the occlusion. There was however, considerable variability in this relationship among patients. Both the rCBF and the velocity decreased substantially at occlusion hi three cases, neither changed very much in three.
