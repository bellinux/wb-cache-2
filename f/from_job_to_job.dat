Qualitative research approach with case study as the research strategy was implemented. Based on the story revealed from the respondents, this research explained that the grasshoppers individuals moved <b>from</b> one <b>job</b> <b>to</b> another because of motivational factors (such as financial, willing to learn, willing <b>to</b> search more challenging <b>jobs,</b> etc), basic need factors (self-fulfillment and a need to share), and supporting factors (such as networking, family support, etc).

Our findings suggest that work engagement mediates the relationships <b>from</b> affective commitment <b>to</b> <b>job</b> performance and intention <b>to</b> quit.

A lack of this network view prevents us from analyzing the ways people build their career, and competition among organizations for talent. For example, some job changes could be promotions, while others could just be lateral and even demotions. The network view is also crucial in studying how the competitions among jobs and organizations would eventually impact job creation and talent attraction.|$|R

Despite business success, after a few years, Corrigan decided to return to the West Coast.

While working as a clerk in the Freetown municipal government, a corruption scandal erupted, involving the misappropriations of funds and equipment by top government officials, including the mayor. In his pamphlet regarding municipal governance in Freetown, A Cloud of Doom, Wallace-Johnson took credit for exposing the corruption. His exact role in the affair is not known, but no Sierra Leoneans ever challenged the veracity of his claim. In the aftermath of the scandal, the British revoked Freetown's rights to complete municipal self-government, believing that Africans, no matter how educated they were, could not govern themselves.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Theophilus Akunna Wallace-Johnson (1894 – 10 May 1965) was a Sierra Leonean and British West African workers' leader, journalist, {{activist and}} politician.

After {{attending}} United Methodist Collegiate School for two years, he dropped out and {{took a job as}} an officer in the customs department in 1913. He was dismissed for helping organize a labour strike, but later reinstated to his position a year later. After resigning from his job, he enlisted as a clerk with the Carrier Corps during World War I. After being demobilised in 1920, Wallace-Johnson moved <b>from</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>job,</b> before settling as a clerk in the Freetown municipal government. He claimed to have exposed a corruption scandal, which resulted in the incarceration of top officials, including the mayor. After being fired from this job in 1926, he left Sierra Leone and became a sailor. He joined a national seamen union and it is believed that he also joined the Communist Party. In 1930, he helped form the first trade union in Nigeria and attended the International Trade Union Conference of Negro Workers in Hamburg, where he established a number of contacts. He published articles and edited the Negro Worker, a journal devoted to uniting black workers around the world. He travelled to Moscow, where he claimed to have attended classes on Marxism-Leninism theory, union organisation and political agitation.|$|E

We find that the relationship between firm size and firm growth is mediated by the industry conditions: In declining or low-growth industries smaller firms grow faster than larger ones but that relationship reverses for faster growing industries. This effect seems to be caused by a greater ability of larger firms to adapt to the economic climate. Small firms are always job creators while large firms switch <b>from</b> <b>job</b> destroyers <b>to</b> <b>job</b> creators as industry conditions improve. We also find that adapting firm growth to industry growth has impor- tant implications on firm survival.
