5|$|After {{completing}} his residency <b>in</b> <b>ophthalmology,</b> Paul moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky. He has held a state-issued medical license since moving there in 1993. He received {{his first job}} from John Downing of Downing McPeak Vision Centers, which brought him to Bowling Green after {{completing his}} residency. Paul worked for Downing {{for about five years}} before parting ways. Afterwards, he went to work at the Graves Gilbert Clinic, a private medical group in Bowling Green, for 10years before creating his own practice in a converted one-story house across the street from Downing's office. After his election to the U.S. Senate, he merged his practice with Downing's medical practice. Paul has faced two malpractice lawsuits between 1993 and 2010; he was cleared in one case while the other was settled for $50,000. His medical work has been praised by Downing and he has medical privileges at two Bowling Green hospitals. Paul specializes in cataract and glaucoma surgeries, LASIK procedures, and corneal transplants. As a member of the Bowling Green Noon Lions Club, Paul founded the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic in 2009 to help provide eye surgery and exams for those who cannot afford to pay. Paul won the Melvin Jones Fellow Award for Dedicated Humanitarian Services from the Lions Club International Foundation for his work establishing the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic.|$|E

40|$|Lasers are {{routinely}} used <b>in</b> veterinary <b>ophthalmology</b> {{for the treatment}} of a number of ophthalmic conditions and diseases. <b>In</b> veterinary <b>ophthalmology</b> gas lasers and semiconductor lasers are primarily used. The most common indications for the use of diode and carbon dioxide lasers are presented and discussed. Diode lasers are primarily used in the treatment of glaucoma, either by transscleral cyclophotocoagulation or by endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation. Other indications are various forms of retinal detachments, as well as pigmented neoplasms of the uvea. An emerging field <b>in</b> veterinary <b>ophthalmology</b> is photodynamic therapy of periocular tumors. Carbon dioxide lasers are used for pars plana vitrectomies and surgical excision of ocular tumors...|$|R

25|$|The terms blind (adjective) or {{to blind}} (transitive verb) {{when used in}} this sense are figurative {{extensions}} of the literal idea of blindfolding someone.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>ophthalmology,</b> {{binocular}} retinal birefringence {{screening of}} the Henle fibers (photoreceptor axons that go radially outward from the fovea) provides a reliable detection of strabismus and possibly also of anisometropic amblyopia. Furthermore, scanning laser polarimetry utilises the birefringence of the optic nerve fibre layer to indirectly quantify its thickness, which is of use in the assessment and monitoring of glaucoma.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{his three}} years as Beit Memorial Research Fellow, Hayreh had to decide whether to “go back to India and say good-bye to any serious {{ophthalmic}} research for lack of facilities and funds, or stay and try to make a career <b>in</b> British <b>ophthalmology.</b> [...] He decided to stay in England and pursued a career <b>in</b> research, clinical <b>ophthalmology</b> and teaching. After spending one year as a Senior House Officer at Birmingham & Midland Eye Hospital, Hayreh returned to the Institute of Ophthalmology, University of London, in 1965, this time as Lecturer <b>in</b> Clinical <b>Ophthalmology.</b> His research at this time dealt mostly with the in vivo blood supply of the optic nerve head and glaucoma.|$|R
25|$|Medical ultrasonography, {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI), confocal microscopy, and OCT are differently suited to morphological tissue imaging: while the first two have whole body but low resolution imaging capability (typically {{a fraction of a}} millimeter), the third one can provide images with resolutions well below 1 micrometer (i.e. sub-cellular), between 0 and 100 micrometers in depth, and the fourth can probe as deep as 500 micrometers, but with a lower (i.e. architectural) resolution (around 10 micrometers in lateral and a few micrometers in depth <b>in</b> <b>ophthalmology,</b> for instance, and 20 micrometers in lateral in endoscopy).|$|E
25|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography {{is one of}} a {{class of}} optical tomographic techniques. A relatively recent implementation of optical coherence tomography, frequency-domain optical coherence tomography, provides advantages in signal-to-noise ratio, permitting faster signal acquisition. Commercially available optical coherence tomography systems are employed in diverse applications, including art conservation and diagnostic medicine, notably <b>in</b> <b>ophthalmology</b> and optometry where {{it can be used to}} obtain detailed images from within the retina. Recently, it has also begun to be used in interventional cardiology to help diagnose coronary artery disease. It has also shown promise in dermatology to improve the diagnostic process.|$|E
25|$|Rizal first studied under Justiniano Aquino Cruz in Biñan, Laguna, {{before he}} was sent to Manila. As to his father's request, he took the {{entrance}} examination in Colegio de San Juan de Letran but he then enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila and graduated as one of the nine students in his class declared sobresaliente or outstanding. He continued his education at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila to obtain a land surveyor and assessor's degree, {{and at the same time}} at the University of Santo Tomas where he did take up a preparatory course in law. Upon learning that his mother was going blind, he decided to switch to medicine at the medical school of Santo Tomas specializing later <b>in</b> <b>ophthalmology.</b>|$|E

25|$|After the war, Schepens {{resumed his}} medical career at Moorfields. In 1947, he {{immigrated to the}} United States and became {{a fellow at the}} Harvard Medical School. Schepens is {{credited}} for creating the vitreo-retinal subspecialty <b>in</b> <b>ophthalmology.</b> In 1949, he established the world's first retina service and first retinal disease fellowship at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. He founded a research laboratory for the investigation of retinal disease, the Retina Foundation, in 1950. Now known as the Schepens Eye Research Institute , it is affiliated with Harvard and the Massachusetts General Hospital. It has grown from 6 staff initially to 200 as of 2006, and at that time was the largest independent eye research organization in the United States. In 2011, the institute combined with the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.|$|E

Australian representative sides toured England in 1886 and 1890, and Pope played {{in a number of}} matches for the teams. He graduated from the university in 1890 with a Doctorate of Medicine (specialising <b>in</b> <b>ophthalmology)</b> and fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, subsequently returning to Australia. For a period of 17 years, from 1894 to 1911, Pope worked at Sydney Hospital, firstly as honorary ophthalmic assistant, and then as honorary ophthalmic surgeon, later being appointed to the honorary consulting staff after his resignation in May 1911.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War Cronin {{served as}} a surgeon {{sub-lieutenant}} in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve before graduating from medical school. After the war he trained at various hospitals, including Bellahouston and Lightburn Hospitals in Glasgow, and the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin. He undertook general practice in a small village on the Clyde, Garelochhead, {{as well as in}} Tredegar, a mining town in South Wales. In 1924 he was appointed Medical Inspector of Mines for Great Britain, and his survey of medical regulations in collieries, and his reports on the correlation between coal dust inhalation and pulmonary disease, were published over the next few years. Cronin drew on his medical experience and his research on the occupational hazards of the mining industry for his later novels The Citadel, set in Wales, and The Stars Look Down, set in Northumberland. He subsequently moved to London, where he practised in Harley Street before opening his own thriving medical practice in Notting Hill. Cronin was also the medical officer for Whiteleys at this time and was becoming increasingly interested <b>in</b> <b>ophthalmology.</b>|$|E
