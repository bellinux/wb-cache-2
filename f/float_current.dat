40|$|In {{this paper}} a low voltage {{constant}} transconductance (gm) rail-to-rail {{input and output}} CMOS operational amplifier is presented. The rail-to-rail common mode input range is achieved by using an n-channel and a p-channel differential pair connected in parallel. The constant-gm is achieved by using additional input differential pairs which control the tail current of the input differential pairs dynamically. The floating class AB control circuit is shifted to summing circuit, which results in a noise and offset of the amplifier.

40|$|With {{the rise}} of the {{environmental}} concerns from combustion of fossil fuels, the demand for the alternative clean energy sources has increased. One of the alternatives is rechargeable batteries. Among many types of rechargeable batteries, lithium-ion batteries have been the most promising due to the high energy density and long lifespan. The current lithium-ion batteries, however, hold a drawback as they utilize organic electrolytes. The use of organic electrolytes not only raises safety and environmental concerns, but also results in a higher manufacturing cost than would be with aqueous electrolytes. Therefore, these issues can be solved by replacing the organic electrolytes with aqueous electrolytes. Among the many types of lithium-ion batteries with aqueous electrolytes, Rechargeable Hybrid Aqueous Battery (ReHAB) was selected in this project. ReHAB utilizes lithium manganese oxide (LiMn 2 O 4) as the cathode and zinc as the anode. LiMn 2 O 4 is a good candidate because tightly bounded lithium ions make LiMn 2 O 4 stable in air and water. Also, it shows a small volume variation between lithiated and non-lithiated states. Zinc metal was chosen because of its low redox potential, good reversibility, high over-potential for hydrogen evolution in acidic environment, large specific capacity, good corrosion resistance, and cost effectiveness. While ReHAB is free of the problems posed by organic electrolytes in traditional Li-ion batteries, the current ReHAB technology must be improved to perform competitively in market. More specifically regarding the zinc anode, there are issues of corrosion, dendrite formation, and hydrogen evolution. Therefore, the goal of this project was to synthesize novel zinc anodes via electroplating with additives (organic and inorganic) reported in literature to mitigate issues of corrosion, dendrite formation, and hydrogen evolution (side reactions). The selected organic additives were cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecyle sulfate (SDS), polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG), and thiourea; and the inorganic additives were indium (II) sulfate, tin (IV) oxide, and boric acid. Each anode was characterized by the following measurements to rate its performance: <b>float</b> <b>current,</b> corrosion current, cyclability, x-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscope. All the anodes created with the inorganic and almost all with the organic additives performed better than the commercial zinc anode. Among the organic additives tested, Zn-SDS performed the best, with the lowest <b>float</b> <b>current</b> and corrosion current measurements and the highest retention of 79 % {{at the end of its}} 1000 th cycle. Among the inorganic additives tested, each fared very similarity, with similar <b>float</b> <b>current</b> and corrosion rate, and retaining in average 78 % of the initial discharge capacity at the end of 1000 th cycle. Between the organic and inorganic additives, however, the XRD results suggested that in general the zinc deposition efficiencies may be lower for inorganic additives (and thus less favourable when scaling up for commercial production). If the lower current efficiency of inorganic additives (hinted by the XRD results) is verified to be true, then the organic additives that either performed better than or as well as the inorganic additives would be the better choice for the next generation of ReHAB...|$|E
40|$|The {{self-discharge}} phenomenon {{caused by}} side reactions such as corrosion, water decomposition and recombination is unavoidable in lead acid batteries. Self-discharge rates depend on several {{factors such as}} the state of charge, the temperature, grid alloys, etc. These rates are not equal between negative and positive electrodes and are independent of each other. In lead-acid batteries with antimony, the self-discharge rate of the negative electrode is several times stronger than the self-discharge rate of the positive electrode, depending mainly on the battery age and the antimony content in the alloy of the positive grid. In order to compensate for the self-discharge of lead-acid batteries, a current whose value exceeds the self-discharge of the negative electrode has to be supplied. This is traditionally achieved by applying a constant voltage whose value is slightly higher than the battery open circuit voltage. This is called “float charge”. It has to be kept in mind that the float polarization increases gas evolution rates at both electrodes. This float polarization voltage is adjusted to ensure that the battery is not under-charged. At typical float polarization voltages of the order of 120 mV/cell, batteries are permanently overcharged. The <b>float</b> <b>current</b> is then about 10 stronger than the self-discharge current at open circuit. In antimony-free lead-acid batteries, e. g. VRLA batteries, the self-discharge rate of the negative electrode is largely reduced and is about a half of the self-discharge rate of the positive electrode. The question is: are traditional float charges really suited to antimony-free lead-acid batteries? Experimental results say no. In this paper, a new method of maintaining th...|$|E

Overall, the standard ADF unit root test provides more supporting evidence in favor of RIP than the more powerful ADF-GLS test and the KPSS stationarity test, and the results {{do not seem to be}} sensitive to the choice of the base country.
