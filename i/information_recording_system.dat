40|$|BACKGROUND: Well-organized {{cervical}} screening {{has been}} shown to be effective in the reduction of both morbidity and mortality from cancer of the uterine cervix. In The Netherlands, the GP plays an important role in the cervical screening. The question is whether the general practices are able to organize an effective cervical cancer screening. OBJECTIVES: We explored the extent to which Dutch general practices adhere to organizational guidelines for effective population-based prevention of cervical cancer and which practice characteristics are important for this adherence. METHODS: A postal survey was conducted in a random sample of one-third of all 4758 Dutch general practices. Two sets of information were collected: practice characteristics and adherence to four organizational guidelines for effective cervical screening concerning inviting the women, monitoring attendance and sending reminders, organizing the taking of the smear and follow-up monitoring. RESULTS: A total of 1251 (79 %) general practices returned a questionnaire; 90 questionnaires were excluded from analyses owing to missing data. The 1161 practices were representative of the Netherlands. A minority of the practices adhered to the four guidelines (in total, ten recommendations). The presence of the practice characteristics 'a general practice-based inviting system', 'a high delegation index' (delegating many tasks to the assistants) and a 'computerized patient information recording system' were positively associated with the adherence to most of the guidelines. CONCLUSION: This study showed that most of the Dutch general practices are not yet ready to organize an effective cervical cancer screening system. A general practice-based inviting system, a high delegation index and a computerized patient <b>information</b> <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> proved to be important for the adherence to the guidelines. In order to organize a cervical screening programme to achieve optimal effectiveness, emphasis should be placed on the adherence to the four guidelines described in this study and on stimulating a general practice-based inviting system, delegation to the practice assistant and computerization...|$|E

40|$|The {{photochromic}} spirodihydroindolizine/betaine (DHI/B) {{system has}} been reinvestigated applying picosecond, microsecond, stationary absorption measurements, and NMR-kinetics. The first surprise was that the electronic structure of the betaines is quite different than commonly assumed. The photochemical ring-opening of DHIs to betaines is a conrotatory 1, 5 electrocyclic reaction, as picosecond absorption spectroscopy confirms. The (disrotatory) thermal ring-closing occurs from the cisoid betaine. The lifetime of the transoid betaine is 60 s at 300 K, whereas the lifetime of the cisoid isomer is {{of the order of}} 250 microseconds. According to these results, the electrocyclic back reaction of the betaines to the DHI is NOT rate determining, as previously thought, but the cisoid-transoid-isomerization of the betaine. Although the presence of a second nitrogen atom increases the photostability of the spirodihydroindolizine-pyridazine/betaine-system remarkably, the photochemical reaction mechanism appears to be exactly the same for spirodihydroindolizine-pyridazine/betaine-system. A nondestructive photoswitch or an <b>information</b> <b>recording</b> <b>systems</b> has been explored using styryl-quinolyldihydroindolizines. Both isomers DHI and betaine are fluorescent.

Universities are institutions where academic and administrative duties and procedures are intensely conducted. Many contemporary universities have <b>information</b> and <b>records</b> management <b>systems</b> within their own administrative structures. Our study aimed to determine the reasons for establishment of records management programs in universities. For that reason, the records and record processing at the Faculty of Letters of Hacettepe University (H. U. F. L.) were examined since the Faculty was chosen an example. As a result of these investigations it has been established that a comprehensive records management program was not implemented in H. U. F. L. and H. U. in general.

Method: the hospital <b>information</b> <b>system</b> <b>records</b> for conditions which are sensitive to ambulatory care, and for those which are not, were considered for analysis, taking the medical records as the gold standard. Through simple random sampling, a sample of 816 medical records was defined and selected {{by means of a}} list of random numbers using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Result: the sensitivity was 81. 89 %, specificity was 95. 19 %, the positive predictive value was 77. 61 % and the negative predictive value was 96. 27 %.
