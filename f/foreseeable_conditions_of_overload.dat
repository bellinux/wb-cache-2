40|$|Distributed rate-based {{real-time}} systems, such as {{process control}} and avionics mission computing systems, {{have traditionally been}} scheduled statically. Static schedul-ing provides assurance of schedulability prior to run-time and can be implemented with low run-time overhead.

As a consequence, processing resources are often under-utilized in the aver-age case, and the resulting systems are hard to adapt to meet new real-time processing requirements. Dynamic scheduling offers relief from the limitations of static scheduling. How-ever, dynamic scheduling often has a higher run-time cost because certain decisions are enforced on-line. Furthermore, under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>overload</b> tasks can be scheduled dynamically that may never be dispatched, or that upon dispatch would miss their dead-lines.

An obvious advantage is that more work can be done in a shorter amount of time and the system is therefore less likely to enter overload. More interestingly, we prove that the performance of systems using faster hardware improves dramatically over systems using slower hardware if overload does occur.

The sample is extracted with ethanol, water, or exposed to modified polyphenylene oxide (Tenax®) for fatty, non-fatty and dry food applications respectively. The water extracts are directly suitable for safety assessment using in vitro bioassays. The ethanol extracts of the paper/board and of the exposed Tenax,, require pre-concentration to give acceptable sensitivity. This is because the in vitro bioassays can tolerate {{only a small percentage of}} added organic solvent before the solvent itself inhibits. The extraction procedures have been selected such that they mimic the <b>foreseeable</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> use with foods and that they are also fully compatible with the battery of in vitro biological assays for the safety assessment of the total migrate. The application of the extraction protocols is illustrated by the results for one of the many paper/board samples provided by the BIOSAFEPAPER project industrial platform members. The assessment indicated that this sample should not be considered as suitable for use with fatty foodstuffs but was suitable for dry and non-fatty foods.

To characterize the bone remodeling the classical methods of histology and morphometry as well as immune histochemistry to reveal osteonectin, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, endothelial marker СD 31, matrix metalloproteinases MMP- 2, MMP- 9, and its tissue inhibitor TIMP- 1, were used with necessary morphometrics.

40|$|The zone of {{inhibition}} {{method to}} test the release of biocides from paper and board food contact materials was evaluated. The method tests the paper by placing a small specimen directly onto culture plates of Bacillus subtilis and Aspergillus niger. The principle is that any extractable biocide will diffuse from the paper into the surrounding nutrient medium and so inhibit growth of the microorganism in the vicinity. The test {{was found to have}} insufficient sensitivity for assuring food safety, where detection limits for migration at or below the mgl - 1 (parts per million) level are needed. Also, the test does not mimic the actual or <b>foreseeable</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> use since most paper/board materials are not intended for direct contact with an aqueous medium for up to 3 days at 30 °C (B. subtilis) or 25 °C (A. niger), which are the incubation conditions used. The sensitivity of the test was increased approximately 100 -fold by preparing a concentrated extract of the paper to be tested and applying this extract to the assay via a blank paper carrier. This was done using methanol as a good solvent for most biocides, as a proof of principle. Other solvents or food simulants could be used to mimic the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> use intended for the particular paper/board samples under examination, e. g. contact with dry, fatty, aqueous or acidic foods, hot or cold. Twenty-four plain (unconverted) paper and board samples and 100 food packaging samples were evaluated using the modified procedure. The results revealed that the method has been developed to the stage where background cytotoxic action of normal paper constituents gives a weak response. Unlike the original method, therefore, the modified method with its improved sensitivity and the facility to link with the intended food contact conditions may be considered a suitable bioassay screening test to complement chemical analysis of paper/board for composition and migration. © 2012 Crown Copyright...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of an individual’s work in a modern organization concerns the management of communication demands that he or she encounters on the job. Demands can be characterized as a communication load, which refers to “the rate and complexity of communication inputs an individual must process in a particular time frame.” Individuals in an organization can experience communication over-load and communication under- load which can affect their level of job satisfaction. Communication overload can occur when “an individual receives too many messages {{in a short period of}} time which can result in unprocessed information or when an individual faces more complex messages that are more difficult to process.” Due to this process, “given an individual’s style of work and motivation to complete a task, when more inputs exist than outputs, the individual perceives a <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>overload</b> which can be positively or negatively related to job satisfaction. In comparison, communication under load can occur when messages or inputs are sent below the individual’s ability to process them.” According to the ideas of communication over-load and under-load, if an individual does not receive enough input on the job or is unsuccessful in processing these inputs, the individual is more likely to become dissatisfied, aggravated, and unhappy with their work which leads to a low level of job satisfaction.|$|R
