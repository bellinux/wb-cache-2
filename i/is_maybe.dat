500|$|West's all-round {{game and}} {{attitude}} <b>is</b> <b>maybe</b> best expressed in his statistically most spectacular game: {{he once was}} credited with 44points (16 of 17 shots from the field, 12 of 12 free throw attempts) with 12rebounds, 12assists, and (unofficially counted) 10 blocked shots, thus scoring a non-official ultra-rare quadruple double. Instead of being proud, West merely commented: [...] "Defensively, from a team standpoint, I didn't feel I played very well. Very rarely was I satisfied with how I played." ...|$|E

"Some kind of {{artifice}} that Hollywood can provide, {{that is so}} {{wide and}} has a graphic story-line about {{it as well as}} some humor about it, and to show the beauty, the scariness, the sexiness and the loneliness that one's success can be, 'cause everybody's dreaming about Hollywood, no matter what. The expectation can be very dangerous, and maybe for somebody like Madonna, who might be at a point, to realize that to be on the top <b>is</b> <b>maybe</b> not that important. That's what I feel about the video." ...|$|E
500|$|A 2007 Vogue {{profile of}} Grant {{referred}} {{to him as a}} man with a [...] "professionally misanthropic mystique". Grant has expressed distaste for focus groups, market research, and emphasis on opening weekend box-office numbers, saying: [...] "It's so destructive to the filmmaking process. What was wrong with {{the way they used to}} release films, more slowly, let them build?" [...] The director Mike Newell has said: [...] "There is at least as much of Hugh that is charismatic, intellectual, and whose tongue <b>is</b> <b>maybe</b> too clever for its own good as there is of him that's gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy." [...] Filmmaker Paul Weitz said that Grant is funny and that [...] "he perceives flaws in himself and other people, and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless."

500|$|The {{clitoris}} of bonobos {{is larger}} and more externalized than in most mammals; Natalie Angier said that a young adolescent [...] "female bonobo <b>is</b> <b>maybe</b> half {{the weight of a}} human teenager, but her clitoris is three times bigger than the human equivalent, and visible enough to waggle unmistakably as she walks". Female bonobos often engage in the practice of genital-genital (GG) rubbing, which is the non-human form of tribadism that human females engage in. Ethologist Jonathan Balcombe stated that female bonobos rub their clitorises together rapidly for ten to twenty seconds, and this behavior, [...] "which may be repeated in rapid succession, is usually accompanied by grinding, shrieking, and clitoral engorgement"; he added that, on average, they engage in this practice [...] "about once every two hours", and as bonobos sometimes mate face-to-face, [...] "evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk has suggested that the position of the clitoris in bonobos and some other primates has evolved to maximize stimulation during sexual intercourse".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, eight teams participated, {{including}} Slovakia for {{the first}} time. The Canadian and American teams outscored opponents in the preliminary round by 41–2 and 31–1 margins, respectively. This brought on more criticism about uneven competition. IOC president Jacques Rogge said, [...] "There is a discrepancy there, everyone agrees with that. This <b>is</b> <b>maybe</b> the investment period in women's ice hockey. I would personally give them more time to grow {{but there must be}} a period of improvement. We cannot continue without improvement." [...] Swedish team coach Peter Elander said it is hard for other nations to compete {{because of a lack of}} funding and a smaller pool of players to choose from. He said, [...] "The finances for all teams have to be the same. ... If you want to have a close tournament in Sochi (for the 2014 Olympics), have (comparable) national programs in all countries." [...] Some critics suggested that a mercy rule be implemented to prevent such lopsided scores. René Fasel said the IIHF would consider adding one. Chinese team coach Hannu Saintula, whose team was defeated 12–1 by the Americans, and American coach Mark Johnson, did not favor the idea.|$|E
500|$|Kwame Opam at The Verge {{chose to}} examine rape {{and the nature}} of consent in the season. Comparing Jessica Jones to other {{television}} series that have depicted rape (Game of Thrones, Orange Is the New Black, and Outlander), Opam felt that [...] "since rape is one of the show’s core themes, we never need to see it... rape is a foundational part of the text, and its presence is constant. Even if it’s invisible, it’s always there." [...] He also felt the season took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means, especially in terms of power and consent, concluding, [...] "Jessica Jones moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating, rather than as spice for a story...Maybe we don’t need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it <b>is.</b> <b>Maybe</b> our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all." [...] The Guardians Lili Loofbourow also discussed the season's depiction of rape and consent, noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act, and saying, [...] "however exceptional Kilgrave’s power seems, the moral quagmire it produces is all too common. It’s the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault. It’s the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent. It’s the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays “of her own free will”. It’s the condition of...any person, really, who agrees, whatever the context, to consent to forgo consent in the future." [...] Loofbourow also discussed the character of Simpson, comparing his power-inducing red pill to the anti-feminist [...] "red pillers", and noting that his taking of the pills [...] "renders him not just dangerously delusional, but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill’s effects." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} positive reviews, although some critics {{complained that the}} series depicts teenagers unrealistically and stereotypically. Others criticised the excessive promotion of the show (specifically in the UK) and having relatively mediocre writing in comparison to other similarly themed shows. Actor Nicholas Hoult defended the extreme storylines, saying they would not reflect [...] "everyone's teenage life", adding [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>maybe</b> heightened for entertainment but {{all of it is}} believable." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the top of}} {{the band}} page is written [...] "4=1".

On the news page (also referred to as the [...] "Unspeakable Tidings"), the news are listed chronologically. However the dates are said to be written in the form corresponding to these in the Discordian calendar. These dates follow the [...] "DD/SS/YYYY" [...] form, as stated on the official website.

2500|$|A 14- to 15-letter-long name, {{composed}} of the three roots proved too cumbersome, {{and a lot of}} shortened versions appeared in habitual use.

It took some years until the known Russian spelling of this name finally settled.
