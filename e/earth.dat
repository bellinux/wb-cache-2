5|$|A {{subject of}} {{on-going}} {{research is the}} formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya. A working hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from <b>Earth</b> after a Mars-sized object, named Theia, impacted <b>Earth.</b> In this scenario, the mass of Theia was approximately 10% of that of <b>Earth,</b> it impacted <b>Earth</b> with a glancing blow, and some of its mass merged with <b>Earth.</b> Between approximately 4.1 and , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon, and by inference, to that of <b>Earth.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Earth</b> is {{the third}} planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, <b>Earth</b> formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, {{especially}} the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. <b>Earth</b> revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an <b>Earth</b> year. During this time, <b>Earth</b> rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{convenient}} {{to define the}} orientation of an ECI frame using the <b>Earth's</b> orbit plane and {{the orientation of the}} <b>Earth's</b> rotational axis in space. [...] The <b>Earth's</b> orbit plane is called the ecliptic, and it does not coincide with the <b>Earth's</b> equatorial plane. The angle between the <b>Earth's</b> equatorial plane and the ecliptic, ε, is called the obliquity of the ecliptic and ε ≈ 23.4°.|$|R
25|$|In {{electricity}} supply systems, an <b>earthing</b> (grounding) system defines the electrical {{potential of the}} conductors relative {{to that of the}} <b>Earth's</b> conductive surface. The choice of <b>earthing</b> system has implications for the safety and electromagnetic compatibility of the power supply. Regulations for <b>earthing</b> systems vary considerably between different countries.|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to find {{patterns}} in <b>Earth's</b> climate history, Lisiecki researches ocean sediment cores. The history of <b>Earth's</b> climate lies in the composition of ocean sediments as scientists are able to derive millions of years worth of information through the alignment of these sedimentary layers. Through these layers, Lisiecki found a connection between <b>earth’s</b> climate cycle and <b>earth’s</b> orbital cycle; assuming glaciation and orbital eccentricity are both on 100,000-year cycles, she found that stronger changes in <b>Earth’s</b> orbit correlated with weaker changes in glaciation. The correlation between the two consists of complicated relations as 3 different elements of <b>Earth's</b> orbit; eccentricity, tilt and precession, must be taken into consideration alongside <b>Earth's</b> convoluted climate system.|$|R

5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet <b>Earth)</b> {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and <b>Earth,</b> and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from <b>Earth</b> in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma {{held together by}} its own gravity. The nearest star to <b>Earth</b> is the Sun. Many other stars are {{visible to the naked}} eye from <b>Earth</b> during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from <b>Earth.</b> Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are in{{visible to the naked eye}} from <b>Earth.</b> Indeed, most are invisible from <b>Earth</b> even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E

50|$|Many {{factors can}} affect the {{appearance}} of the Moon during a lunar eclipse. The Moon's path through the <b>Earth's</b> umbra is important, but so too are the current conditions of the <b>Earth's</b> atmosphere. While the <b>Earth's</b> shadow blocks any direct light from striking the Moon during a lunar eclipse, some light is refracted through the <b>Earth's</b> atmosphere giving a Moon a red hue.|$|R
5|$|And {{left off}} <b>earth</b> to be enthroned above.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the <b>Earth</b> can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} the <b>Earth,</b> {{and it is this}} effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the <b>Earth</b> from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the <b>Earth,</b> so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the <b>Earth</b> than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Copernicus himself, {{the notion that}} the <b>Earth</b> rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also {{proposed}} that the <b>Earth</b> rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also proposed that the <b>Earth</b> rotates on its axis. Empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji (1403–1474).|$|E
50|$|An outer Earth-grazer {{asteroid}} is {{an asteroid}} which is normally beyond <b>Earth's</b> orbit, but which can {{get closer to}} the Sun than <b>Earth's</b> aphelion (1.0167 AU), but not closer than <b>Earth's</b> perihelion (0.9833 AU). In other words, the asteroid's perihelion is between <b>Earth's</b> perihelion and aphelion. Outer Earth-grazer asteroids are split between Amor and Apollo asteroids, depending on the definition used.|$|R
50|$|The early {{formation}} of the <b>Earth's</b> dense core could have caused superheating and rapid heat loss, and the heat loss rate would slow once the mantle solidified. Heat flow from the core is necessary for maintaining the convecting outer core and the geodynamo and <b>Earth's</b> magnetic field, therefore primordial heat from the core enabled <b>Earth's</b> atmosphere and thus helped retain <b>Earth's</b> liquid water.|$|R

5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of <b>Earth,</b> according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on <b>Earth.</b> However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of <b>Earth,</b> even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong as on <b>Earth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, {{but not as much}} as does the Moon's varying distance from <b>Earth.</b> When <b>Earth</b> approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when <b>Earth</b> approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon's {{orbit around}} <b>Earth</b> is {{inclined}} by about 5.145° (5° 9') to {{the orbit of}} <b>Earth</b> around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must be near {{the intersection of the}} two orbital planes. The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by <b>Earth,</b> is described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18years.|$|E
