40|$|<b>Extreme</b> <b>events</b> are an {{important}} theme in various areas of science because of their typically devastating effects on society and their scientific complexities. The latter is particularly true if the underlying dynamics {{does not lead to}} independent <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> as often observed in natural systems. Here, we focus on this case and consider stationary stochastic processes that are characterized by long-range memory and heavy-tailed distributions, often called fractional Lévy noise. While the size distribution of <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> is not affected by the long-range memory in the asymptotic limit and remains a Fréchet distribution, there are strong finite-size effects if the memory leads to persistence in the underlying dynamics. Moreover, we show that this persistence is also present in the <b>extreme</b> <b>events,</b> which allows one to make a time-dependent hazard assessment of future <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> based on events observed in the past. This has direct applications in the field of space weather as we discuss specifically for the case of the solar power influx into the magnetosphere.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how El Niño (EN) e La Niña (LN) episodes modify {{the frequency of}} <b>extreme</b> precipitation <b>events</b> in Brazil, {{and the reason for}} this modification. Gamma distributions were fit to precipitation in each day of the year, in the period 1956 - 2002, provided by stations all over Brazil. Daily precipitation data are then replaced by their respective percentiles. <b>Extreme</b> <b>events</b> are those with a three-day average percentile above 85. The number of <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> was computed for each month of each year. Years were classified as EN, LN and normal years, considering, according to the EN/LN cycle, that the year starts in August (year 0) and ends in July (year + 1). The mean frequency of <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> for each month, within each category of year, and the difference between these mean frequencies for EN and normal years, and for LN and normal years show that EN and LN episodes influence significantly the frequency of <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> in several regions in Brazil during certain periods. The relationships between large-scale atmospheric perturbations and variations in the frequency of <b>extreme</b> precipitation <b>events</b> are sought through composites of anomalous atmospheric fields during <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> in EN and LN episodes, in three regions in which there is significant change in the frequency of these events. The general features of those anomalous fields are similar, no matter if the <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> happen during EN or LN episodes or in normal years. They show the essential ingredients for much precipitation: moisture convergence and mechanisms for lifting the air to the condensation level. To understand why the frequency of <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> varies significantly between EN and LN episodes, we also formed composites of monthly atmospheric anomalous fields during those episodes. In the regions where the frequency of <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> increases (decreases) the anomaly composites during <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> show similarity (difference) with respect to the mean anomalies during EN or LN episodes. This indicates that the frequency of <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> increases (decreases) when the large-scale perturbations favor (hamper) the circulation anomalies associated with them in those regions. This also means that the behavior of the frequency of <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> is consistent with that of the monthly or seasonal total precipitation. The same conclusion can be reached through the correlation of sea surface temperature (SST) with the monthly precipitation series or the frequency of <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> for two regions in which these events had their frequency changed during EN and LN episodes. This correlation analysis was carried out to verify whether there is another mechanism responsible for <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> that does not work during other rainfall events. In general, the relationship between SST and monthly rainfall is similar to the relationship between SST and the frequency of <b>extreme</b> <b>events.</b> There are, however, some differences. For instance, in southern Brazil the frequency of <b>extreme</b> <b>events</b> is correlated both with SST anomalies in the Pacific Ocean (associated with EN/LN) and in the Atlantic Ocean, while the monthly rainfall is more strongly correlated with SST in the Pacific Ocean [...] Pages: 765 - 77...|$|R
