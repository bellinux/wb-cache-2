Exposure of the worms to cadmium led to the cellular activation process of MPII-cells (i. e. transformation of the nucleolus, development of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus), although MPII mRNA transcript Summary levels were unchanged. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of gut extracts revealed that MPII levels were increased after exposure to Cd, so it appears that this protein is synthesized as a response to Cd exposure without any new synthesis of mRNA.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Hemerythrins,</b> are the non-heme, diiron binding {{respiratory}} proteins of brachiopods, priapulids and sipunculans; {{they are}} also found in annelids and bacteria, where their functions have not been fully elucidated. Results A search for putative Hrs in the genomes of 43 archaea, 444 bacteria and 135 eukaryotes, revealed their presence in 3 archaea, 118 bacteria, several fungi, one apicomplexan, a heterolobosan, a cnidarian and several annelids. About a fourth of the Hr sequences were identified as N- or C-terminal domains of chimeric, chemotactic gene regulators. The function of the remaining single domain bacterial Hrs remains to be determined. In addition to oxygen transport, the possible functions in annelids have been proposed to include cadmium-binding, antibacterial action and immunoprotection. A Bayesian phylogenetic tree revealed a split into two clades, one encompassing archaea, bacteria and fungi, and the other comprising the remaining eukaryotes. The annelid and sipunculan Hrs share the same intron-exon structure, {{different from that of}} the cnidarian Hr. Conclusion The phylogenomic profile of Hrs demonstrated a limited occurrence in bacteria and archaea and a marked absence in the vast majority of multicellular organisms. Among the metazoa, Hrs have survived in a cnidarian and in a few protostome groups; hence, it appears that in metazoans the Hr gene was lost in deuterostome ancestor(s) after the radiata/bilateria split. Signal peptide sequences in several Hirudinea Hrs suggest for the first time, the possibility of extracellular localization. Since the α-helical bundle is likely to have been among the earliest protein folds, Hrs represent an ancient family of iron-binding proteins, whose primary function in bacteria may have been that of an oxygen sensor, enabling aerophilic or aerophobic responses. Although Hrs evolved to function as O 2 transporters in brachiopods, priapulids and sipunculans, their function in annelids remains to be elucidated. Overall Hrs exhibit a considerable lack of evolutionary success in metazoans. </p...|$|R
40|$|The two microaerophilic, Fe-oxidizing {{bacteria}} Sideroxydans ES- 1 and Gallionella ES- 2 have single circular chromosomes of 3. 00 and 3. 16 Mb that encode 3049 and 3006 genes, respectively. Multi-locus {{sequence analysis}} confirmed {{the relationship of}} these two organisms to one another, and indicated they may form a novel order, the Gallionellalaes, within the Betaproteobacteria. Both are adapted for chemolithoautotropy, including pathways for CO 2 -fixation, and electron transport pathways adapted for growth at low O 2 -levels, an important adaptation for growing on Fe(II). Both genomes contain Mto-genes implicated in iron-oxidation, {{as well as other}} genes that could be involved in Fe-oxidation. Nearly 10 % of their genomes are devoted to environmental sensing, signal transduction, and chemotaxis, consistent with their requirement for growing in narrow redox gradients of Fe(II) and O 2. There are important differences as well. Sideroxydans ES- 1 is more metabolically flexible, and can utilize reduced S-compounds, including thiosulfate, for lithotrophic growth. It has a suite of genes for nitrogen fixation. Gallionella ES- 2 contains additional gene clusters for exopolysaccharide production, and has more capacity to resist heavy metals. Both strains contain genes for <b>hemerythrins</b> and globins, but ES- 1 has an especially high numbers of these genes that may be involved in oxygen homeostasis, or storage. The two strains share homology with the marine FeOB Mariprofundus ferrooxydans PV- 1 in CO 2 fixation genes, and respiratory genes. In addition, ES- 1 shares a suite of 20 potentially redox active genes with PV- 1, as well as a large prophage. Combined these genetic, morphological, and physiological differences indicate that these are two novel species, Sideroxydans lithotrophicus ES- 1 T (ATCC 700298 T; JCM 14762; DSMZ 22444; NCMA B 100), and Gallionella capsiferriformans ES- 2 T (ATCC 700299 T; JCM 14763; DSMZ 22445; NCMA B 101) ...|$|R

This is surrounded by a ring of short tentacles that are used for feeding and in gas exchange. They are pink inside due to the presence of the pigment <b>hemerythrin</b> used in oxygen transport. The anus is on a small mound where the trunk and introvert join.

The anterior part of the trunk, into which the introvert retracts, is broader than the posterior part.|$|E
50|$|The {{prevalence}} of iron is apparently {{due to the}} large availability of Fe(II) in the initial evolution of living organisms, before the rise of photosynthesis {{and an increase in}} atmospheric oxygen levels which resulted in the precipitation of iron in the environment as Fe(OH). It has flexible redox properties because such properties are sensitive to ligand coordination, including geometry. Iron can be also used in enzymes due to its Lewis acid properties, for example in nitrile hydratase. Iron is frequently found in mononuclear sites in the reduced Fe(II) form, and functions in dioxygen activation; this function is used as a major mechanism adopted by living organisms to avoid the kinetic barrier hindering the transformation of organic compounds by O. Iron can be taken up selectively as ferredoxins, Fe-O-Fe (<b>hemerythrin</b> and ribonucleotide reductase), Fe (many oxidases), apart from iron porphyrin. Variation in the related proteins with any one of these chemical forms of iron has produced a wide range of enzymes. All of these arrangements are modified to function both in the sense of reactivity and the positioning of the protein in the cell. Iron can have various redox and spin states, and it can be held in many stereochemistries.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of oxygenic photosynthesis during Precambrian times entailed the diversification of strategies minimizing reactive oxygen species-associated damage. Four families of oxygen-carrier proteins (hemoglobin, <b>hemerythrin</b> {{and the two}} non-homologous families of arthropodan and molluscan hemocyanins) {{are known to have}} evolved independently the capacity to bind oxygen reversibly, providing cells with strategies to cope with the evolutionary pressure of oxygen accumulation. Oxygen-binding <b>hemerythrin</b> was first studied in marine invertebrates but further research {{has made it clear that}} it is present in the three domains of life, strongly suggesting that its origin predated the emergence of eukaryotes. Oxygen-binding hemerythrins are a monophyletic sub-group of the hemerythrin/HHE (histidine, histidine, glutamic acid) cation-binding domain. Oxygen-binding <b>hemerythrin</b> homologs were unambiguously identified in 367 / 2236 bacterial, 21 / 150 archaeal and 4 / 135 eukaryotic genomes. Overall, oxygen-binding <b>hemerythrin</b> homologues were found in the same proportion as single-domain and as long protein sequences. The associated functions of protein domains in long <b>hemerythrin</b> sequences can be classified in three major groups: signal transduction, phosphorelay response regulation, and protein binding. This suggests that in many organisms the reversible oxygen-binding capacity was incorporated in signaling pathways. A maximum-likelihood tree of oxygen-binding <b>hemerythrin</b> homologues revealed a complex evolutionary history in which lateral gene transfer, duplications and gene losses appear to have played an important role. <b>Hemerythrin</b> is an ancient protein domain with a complex evolutionary history. The distinctive iron-binding coordination site of oxygen-binding hemerythrins evolved first in prokaryotes, very likely prior to the divergence of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and spread into many bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic species.
