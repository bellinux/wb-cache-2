40|$|The call {{to access}} and {{preserve}} the state records that document crimes committed by the state during Guatemala’s civil war has become an archival imperative entangled with neoliberal human rights discourses of “truth, justice, and memory. ” 200, 000 {{people were killed and}} disappeared in Guatemala’s civil war including acts of genocide in which 85 % of massacres involved sexual violence committed against Mayan women. This dissertation argues that in an attempt to tell the official story of the civil war, American Human Rights organizations and academic institutions have constructed a normative identity whose humanity is attached to a scientific and evidentiary value as well as an archival status representing the materiality and institutionality of the record. Consequently, Human Rights discourses grounded in Western knowledges, in particular archival science and law, which prioritize the appearance of truth erase the material and epistemological experience of indigenous women during wartimes. As a result, the subjectivity that has surfaced on the record as most legible has mostly pertained to non-indigenous, middle class, urban, leftist men who were victims of enforced disappearance not genocide. This dissertation investigates this conflicting narrative that remembers a non-indigenous revolutionary masculine hero and grants him justice in human rights courtrooms simply because of a document attesting to his death. A main research question addressed in this project is why the promise of "truth and justice" under the name of human rights becomes a contentious site for gendered indigenous bodies? I conduct a discursive and rhetorical analysis of documentary film, declassified Guatemalan police and military records such as Operation Sofia, a military log known for “documenting the genocide” during rural counterinsurgencies executed by the military. I interrogate the ways in which racialized <b>feminicides</b> or the hyper-sexualized racial violence that has historically dehumanized indigenous women falls outside of discourses of vision constructed by Western positivist knowledges to reinscribe the ideal human right subject. I argue for alternative epistemological frames that recognize genocide as sexualized and gendered structures that have simultaneously produced racialized <b>feminicides</b> in order to disrupt the colonial structures of capitalism, patriarchy and heterosexuality. Ironically, these structures of power remain untouched by the dominant human rights discourse and its academic, NGO, and state collaborators that seek "truth and justice" in post-conflict Guatemala...|$|R
40|$|O ensaio examina o caso dos feminicídios que resultaram em pelo menos 300 mulheres assassinadas durante os últimos 11 anos em Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, na fronteira norte do México. Em todos esses anos, as autoridades apresentaram somente uns poucos suspeitos, sem nunca conseguir convencer a opinião pública de sua culpabilidade. Impunidade e proteção dos assassinos são evidentes tanto para a opinião pública local como para os observadores internacionais. Eu sugiro que o que é escrito no corpo das mulheres brutalmente assassinadas é a assinatura de um poder local e {{regional}} que também conta com tentáculos nacionais. Esses atos de violência aparentemente irracional enunciam, para além de qualquer dúvida, o poder discricionário de seus perpetradores e o controle que eles detêm sobre pessoas e recursos de seu território, selando e reforçando com isso um pacto de fraternidade.

Impunity and protection for the murderers are evident to local public opinion and to international observers. I argue that what is written on the body of the brutally murdered women is the signature of a local and regional power counting also with national connections. These acts of apparently irrational violence state beyond doubt the discretionary power of their perpetrators and the control they exert over the people and resources of their territory, thus sealing and reinforcing a pact of fraternity...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, with an {{increased}} rhythm and greater intensity, the so-called neoliberal violence has come to play a relevant role within the history of world societies. The Latin American institutional, political, social, and economic changes of the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s, especially those produced under dictatorships, contributed to create the conditions {{for the implementation of}} the processes of economic liberalization and global market as part of the concept of institutional modernization and cultural globalization that gave rise to the neoliberal mentality. In this context, neoliberalism becomes hegemonic as a mode of discourse and is incorporated into the way individuals interpret, live in, and understand the world. Its incorporation into world societies has motivated changes in the division of labor, changes in social relations, the dismantling of welfare necessities, increase in technology, and differentiation in the ways of life and thought, but more importantly, it has motivated the rise of new forms of contemporary violence which develop and nurture themselves from the political and economic opportunities that neoliberalism creates. This work will present a theoretical approach of the theme of neoliberalism and will concentrate its study on literary and cinematic representations of the theme of narcotraffic and the relation migration-feminicides as new forms of contemporary neoliberal violence in the context of Latin America with special interest in Mexico and Colombia. In this sense, the work of authors such as David Harvey, Hermann Herlinghaus, Ileana Rodriguez, Jean Franco, and others; will contribute to the analysis of the theme of violence in this study in ways that will support how violence has been used historically as a tool to perpetuate relationships of domination. Also, the literary and cinematic representations of the theme of neoliberal violence will be analyzed in the works of Fernando Vallejo (La virgen de los sicarios), Jorge Franco (Rosario Tijeras), Roberto Bolaño (2666), Orfa Alarcón (Perra Brava), Juan Pablo Villalobos (Fiesta en la madriguera), and Yuri Herrera (Los trabajos del reino) are analyzed in this work.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 What {{historical}} and political reality {{is reflected in}} the novels Gringo viejo and La frontera de cristal? What is revealed when the characters, plot, and setting of the novels are analyzed against research of the context of U. S. -Mexico relations? We begin to explore these questions by studying three periods crucial to U. S. -Mexico relations: the Mexican-American War, the Mexican Revolution, and the current, post-NAFTA situation. Then, we compare them to a literary analysis of the novels, illuminating our perspective of the social, economic, cultural, and political components of these three epochs. We discover, first of all, that relations between these countries have been marked by complexity and misunderstanding but that increased awareness of their framework is the initial step toward improving them. The two novels mentioned shed considerable light on the U. S. -Mexico social context particularly because Carlos Fuentes, the author, develops both Anglo and Mexican characters and creates a plot-line that emphasizes the interactions [...] highlighting similarities and differences [...] between them. Additionally, the border region itself serves as a sort of character in the novels and is personified as a powerful force that both divides and unites. Further exploration of the border region and its implications for the two countries as whole entities direct our study to their cultural formation, as influenced by Hispanic, pre-Reformation and Anglo, post-Reformation Europe; their economies, both licit and clandestine; their foreign policy origins and outcomes; the tragic femicidios (<b>feminicides)</b> in Ciudad Juárez; and the question of undocumented Mexican nationals immigrating to the United States. Carlos Fuentes garners significant credibility and is widely recognized as being uniquely positioned to consider these issues, having spent considerable time in both countries during his formative and subsequent years and having critiqued and written extensively on these two nations. While the relationship between Mexico and United States is complicated, treatment of its varying aspects in works of fiction—such as those of Fuentes, that reflect, to some degree, an historical reality—help us understand the nature of the dealings that take place between the two nations and ultimately move toward a more mature affiliation...|$|R

Since gangs typically make no effort to cover up crimes and leave bodies at the place of death, [...] "signs of torture," [...] as well as location of the body, [...] "serve as indicators of the existence of social cleansing," [...] according to Elizabeth Sanford. According to a study by the Human Rights Ombudsman, [...] "the increase in the number of women killed whose bodies bore marks of torture and other sadistic abuse accounted for 40 percent of the total increase in female murders in 2005." [...] Though female victims account for 10% of all homicides, over 18% of cadavers with signs of torture indicating social cleansing were female. [...] Furthermore, 2% of female victims of homicide are prostitutes, a common victim group of social cleansing efforts. Furthermore, young and destitute male gang members, especially those blamed for homicide of females, have been common victims of social cleansing.The most common form of killing, indicated by the 305 cadavers found in 2005, is strangulation. Other common methods included victims being beaten, shot in the head, bound by their hands and feet, and in the case of female victims, sexual abuse. Victims are abducted, taken to a different location, are tortured and killed, and finally have their body dumped in a different location.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the border}} city of Juarez Chihuahua, Mexico, over 1,500 young women have died {{over the past}} two decades. [...] " [...] When the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)was signed major {{corporations}} began the establishment of maquiladoras in Cd. Juarez. The maquiladoras generated job opportunities for men and women who began working inside and outside the factories. Maquiladora jobs were usually long shifts that ended late at night when women are vulnerable to sexual harassment, rape and death. Cd. Juarez then became the city where violence is at its highest peak because of the drug war and many other factors. Maquiladora women workers {{are not the only ones}} affected by the violence. The majority of those murdered and who disappeared are women and girls who work at local retail, students, teachers, and sex workers. Many people began calling this situation a <b>feminicide</b> because of the degree of violence and high numbers of dead women in Juarez. Nearly a decade since the first body was found dead and with signs of torture, the international human rights system responded to public demands for justice. In 2002, petitions against the state of Mexico were presented to the Inter-American Human Rights court (IAHRC). It took the court approximately seven years to come up with a verdict. In April 2009, the Inter-American Human Rights court ruled that the state of Mexico was accountable for the murders, ordering the government to pay the legal cost of the victims’ families, reopen investigations about the murder cases, and investigate those government officials who were once accused of obstructing justice.

40|$|The {{escalating}} {{number of}} violent female homicides committed by men {{over the last}} two decades has compelled many Latin American countries to classify (typify) the crime of gender-based homicide as “feminicide” (or “femicide”).

40|$|In {{the paper}} {{femicide}} is analyzed as a gender-based violence whose origin is in <b>feminicide.</b> <b>Feminicide</b> {{is a term}} which designates social, cultural and ideological construction which survives in the continuity of institutional weakness. Gender-based violence appears as a mixture of institutionalized misogyny, patriarchate and abolition of women`s rights as human rights. The paper starts from {{the assumption that the}} basis of <b>feminicide</b> is in the continuity of the culture of violence and ideological matrices which promote adversarial discourse toward women, where amplified social and cultural tensions move to the sphere of gender-based violence. Femicide, as a visible and manifest violence, derives from the invisible institutional structure in which violence is continual, cyclical and reproductive. The subject of this paper is the attempt to get an insight into the invisible background of femicide as a form of violence rooted in <b>feminicide.</b> Its aim is contextualization of femicide into the existing structure of violence, and an analysis of some aspects of its social and cultural origin...|$|E

Initially, these murders went unnoticed by the general public, unreported by mainstream press, and uninvestigated by authorities. Since the late 1990 's feminist scholars, journalists, activists, and artists have intervened to raise awareness about the violence and build a body of knowledge about the murders now termed a <b>feminicide.</b> Making use of analytical models from Michel Foucault, Uma Narayan and Chandra Mohanty, I apply a Foucaldian archaeological postcolonial feminist analysis to a sample of North American feminist texts on the <b>feminicide.</b> I reveal how discourses on victims problematically rely on, and implicitly support, sexist identities of women.
