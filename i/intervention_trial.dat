Conclusions There are several possible explanations why control group changes occur in <b>intervention</b> <b>trials</b> targeting other behaviours, but not for weight loss.

40|$|Objective: Over {{the last}} 15 years, {{a focus on}} early {{intervention}} in psychotic disorders has emerged. Initially, the early psychosis movement focused on timely recognition and phase-specific treatment of first-episode psychosis. However, early psychosis researchers suspected that pushing the point of intervention even further back to the prodromal phase of psychotic disorders may result in even better outcomes. This article reviews intervention research in the ultra-high-risk phase of psychotic disorders. Data sources: A literature search of <b>intervention</b> <b>trials</b> with ultra-high-risk cohorts published after 1980 was conducted on PubMed with the search terms prodrome and intervention. Study selection: All published <b>intervention</b> <b>trials</b> with ultra-high-risk cohorts. Data synthesis: The first generation of <b>intervention</b> <b>trials</b> indicated that both pharmacologic and psychological intervention strategies may be of value in terms of symptom reduction and delay or prevention of onset of threshold psychotic disorder. Conclusions: Further controlled <b>intervention</b> <b>trials</b> with larger sample sizes are {{required in order to}} confirm and extend these findings. We argue that the clinical staging model provides a framework for the rationale and design of such studies, with simpler, safer, and more benign interventions being better candidates for first-line treatment, while more complex and potentially harmful treatments should be reserved for those cases in which response has failed to occur. Recent evidence indicates that neuroprotective agents, such as essential fatty acids, may be a suitable form of intervention for the ultra-high-risk phase of psychotic disorders, with a positive risk-benefit balance. Ethical aspects have become more salient given the recently observed declining transition rate in ultra-highrisk samples.

40|$|Background Psychosocial and {{behavioral}} <b>interventions</b> <b>trials</b> targeting {{a broad range}} of complex social {{and behavioral}} problems such as smoking, obesity and family caregiving have proliferated in the past 30 years. At the same time the use of Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) to monitor the progress and quality of <b>intervention</b> <b>trials</b> and the safety of study participants has increased substantially. Most of the existing literature and guidelines for safety monitoring and reporting of adverse events focuses on medical interventions. Consequently, there is little guidance for investigators conducting social and behavior trials. Purpose This paper summarizes how issues associated with safety monitoring and adverse event reporting were handled in the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s Caregiver Health (REACH II) program, a multi-site randomized clinical trial, funded by the National Institutes on Aging (NIA) and the National Institutes of Nursing Research (NINR), that tested the efficacy of a multicomponent social/behavioral intervention for caregivers of persons with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease. Methods A task force was formed to define adverse events for the trial and protocols for reporting and resolving events that occurred. The task force conducted a review of existing polices and protocols for data and safety monitoring and adverse event reporting and identified potential risks particular to the study population. An informal survey regarding data and safety monitoring procedures with investigators on psychosocial <b>intervention</b> <b>trials</b> was also conducted. Results Two categories of events were defined for both caregivers and patients; adverse events and safety alerts. A distinction was also made between events detected at baseline assessment and those detected post-randomization. Standardized protocols were also developed for the reporting and resolution of events that occurred and training of study personnel. Results from the informal survey indicated wide variability in practices for data safety and monitoring across psychosocial <b>intervention</b> <b>trials.</b> Conclusions Overall, the REACH II experience demonstrates that existing guidelines regarding safety monitoring and adverse event reporting pose unique challenges for social/behavioral <b>intervention</b> <b>trials.</b> Challenges encountered in the REACH II program included defining and classifying adverse events, defining 2 ̆ 2 resolution 2 ̆ 2 of adverse events and attributing causes for events that occurred.

50|$|As for cataracts, two meta-analyses {{confirm a}} {{correlation}} between high serum concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin {{and a decrease in}} the risk of nuclear cataract, but not cortical or subcapsular cataract.

40|$|Purpose of Review: To {{critique}} {{the evidence}} from recent and ongoing obesity prevention interventions in the first 1000 days {{in order to identify}} evidence gaps and weaknesses, and to make suggestions for more informative future <b>intervention</b> <b>trials.</b> Recent Findings: Completed and ongoing <b>intervention</b> <b>trials</b> have had fairly modest effects, have been limited largely to high-income countries, and have used relatively short-term interventions and outcomes. Comparison of {{the evidence from}} completed prevention trials with the evidence from systematic reviews of behavioral risk factors shows that some life-course stages have been neglected (pre-conception and toddlerhood), and that interventions have neglected to target some important behavioral risk factors (maternal smoking during pregnancy, infant and child sleep). Finally, while obesity prevention interventions aim to modify body composition, few <b>intervention</b> <b>trials</b> have used body composition measures as outcomes, and this has limited their sensitivity to detect intervention effects. The new WHO Healthy Lifestyles Trajectory (HeLTI) initiative should address some of these weaknesses. Summary: Future early obesity prevention trials should be much more ambitious. They should, ideally: extend their interventions over the first 1000 days; have longer-term (childhood) outcomes, and improved outcome measures (body composition measures in addition to proxies for body composition such as the BMI for age); have greater emphasis on maternal smoking and child sleep; be global...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several recent {{physical}} activity <b>intervention</b> <b>trials</b> have reported {{physical activity}} improvements in control group participants. Explanations have been proposed, but not systematically investigated. Methods: A systematic review {{of physical activity}} <b>intervention</b> <b>trials</b> was conducted to investigate the frequency of meaningful improvements in physical activity among control group participants (increase of >= 60 minutes [4 MET. hours] of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week, or a 10 % increase {{in the proportion of}} participants meeting physical activity recommendations), and possible explanatory factors. Explanatory factors include aspects of behavioral measurement, participant characteristics, and control group treatment. Results: Eight (28 %) of 29 studies reviewed reported meaningful improvements in control group physical activity, most of which were of similar magnitude to improvements observed in the intervention group. A number of factors were related to meaningful control group improvements in physical activity, including the number of assessments, mode of measurement administration, screening to exclude active participants, and preexisting health status. Conclusions: Control group improvement in physical activity <b>intervention</b> <b>trials</b> is not uncommon and may be associated with behavioral measurement and participant characteristics. Associations observed in this review should be evaluated empirically in future research. Such studies may inform minimal contact approaches to physical activity promotion...|$|R
