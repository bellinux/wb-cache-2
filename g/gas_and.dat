40|$|ABSTRACT When {{the coal}} mine fire occurs, {{it is crucial}} to judge the fire {{combustion}} state by analyzing indicator <b>gases</b> concentration <b>and</b> changing trends of various gas ratios in order to formulate proper rescue measures. It's an effective methodology to estimate the changes of combustion state in coal mine fire accurately by the trends analysis of indicator <b>gases</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> ratios independent of the external environment disturbs, such as air leakage <b>and</b> inner <b>gases</b> injection. However, there are few experimental researches about the changing rules of indicator <b>gases</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> ratios at different combustion phases at present. Therefore, this paper has established a small-sized coal combustion experimental platform in confined space, on which the experimental studies on variation trends about indicator <b>gases</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> ratios of the whole combustion phases are conducted. The experiment results have shown that the coal combustion trends could be accurately estimated by analyzing the relationship between indicator <b>gases</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> ratios among different combustion phases. In the end of this paper, the conclusions are verified by a real coal mine fire disaster relief case, and the practical results are in agreement with the experimental analysis...|$|R
5|$|In 1823, Michael Faraday, then an {{assistant}} in Davy's lab, successfully liquefied chlorine {{and went on}} to liquefy all known gaseous elements, except for nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. Shortly after, in 1869, Irish chemist Thomas Andrews studied the phase transition from a liquid to a <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> coined the term critical point to describe the condition where a <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> a liquid were indistinguishable as phases, and Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals supplied the theoretical framework which allowed the prediction of critical behavior based on measurements at much higher temperatures. By 1908, James Dewar and Heike Kamerlingh Onnes were successfully able to liquefy hydrogen and then newly discovered helium, respectively.|$|E
