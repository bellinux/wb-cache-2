40|$|Objective Through the {{establishment}} of the model of mental fatigue which was induced by continuous mental workload, compare the changes in cognitive function before and after simulated flight and investigate the pattern of heart rate variability (HRV) during the period of simulated flight, thus providing the foundation of screening objective indices for monitoring mental fatigue. Methods A total of 30 participants were informed {{to take part in a}} simulated flight for 4 hours. They were arranged to complete the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and two cognitive tests, including psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and shifting attention test (SAT) before and after simulated flight severally. HRV was recorded continuously during the period of simulated flight. Results After simulated flight, the scores of SSS significantly increased (P< 0. 05) and mean reaction times to PVT and SAT were longer compared with presimulated flight (P< 0. 05). Heart rate (HR) and RMSSD considered as the time domain index of HRV showed significant difference during the period of simulated flight (F= 9. 81, F= 4. 75, respectively, both P< 0. 05). The results indicate that HR declined and RMSSD of HRV increased significantly, while no significant differences were found in other time domain component and the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> <b>component</b> of HRV. Conclusions The mean reaction times of cognitive tests are sensitive indices to monitor mental fatigue. However, when the time domain component and the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> <b>component</b> of HRV are applied into monitoring mental fatigue, there are still some limitations in different conditions.

40|$|The {{market share}} of wind energy is {{continuously}} increasing. The EU has set a target for 300 GW to be installed by 2030, after the first goal of 100 GW of installed power was achieved in 2008. This rapid growth drives new technological improvements which aim at increasing capacity, improving reliability and reducing the overall cost of wind turbines. The continuous demand for the increase in power output for new wind parks under strict cost constraints, the greater wind resource at elevation {{and the desire for}} fewer machines per Megawatt to reduce operations for both installation and maintenance has resulted in a demand for bigger machines. This so-called upscaling of turbines has caused a quick evolution in turbine size from the kilowatt to the multi-Megawatt range. These bigger machines require new simulation tools to better quantify the margins available in the design. Traditional safety factors are insufficient in this regard. As total system reliability depends upon the individual components reliability, wind turbine manufacturers demand high quality from their suppliers, a. o. gearbox manufacturers. In {{order to be able to}} guarantee a robust and reliable gearbox design, gearbox manufacturers are spending a lot of effort in the development of reliable calculation methods and simulation models. With increasing size of wind turbines, loads acting on the different components are no longer comparable to conventional stationary industrial applications. Loads acting on a wind turbine include aerodynamic loads at variable wind speeds, gravitational, inertial, operational loads (generator torque, loads induced by certain control actions like blade pitching, starting up, (emergency) braking or yawing). These loads are characterized by a high level of dynamics such as peak loads, load reversals, aero-elastic vibrations, etc. transferred towards the drive train. In general the belief has risen amongst gearbox manufacturers that some of the gearbox problems which have plagued modern wind power industry since its initial growth period may stem from a lack of understanding of the dynamic behavior of the drive train and the influence of the wind turbine on the drive train. Traditional aeroelastic codes, used for simulation of the mechanical loads acting on the wind turbine components, focus mainly on rotor loads and dynamic behaviour of the overall wind turbine, thereby yielding no insight in internal gearbox dynamics. Main concern for the gearbox manufacturer is the lack of insight in the drive train behaviour during various transient phenomena. In [1], Peeters suggested the multibody technique for realizing these dynamic load simulation models. Outputs of these multibody models are reactionforces and displacements at each subcomponent of the wind turbine gearbox. Traditionally flexibility within multibody models is represented using spring-damper systems. All gearbox subcomponents are considered rigid. However due to the increasing size ofthe wind turbines, flexibility within the drive train is becoming more and more of influence on overall wind turbine behavior under dynamic loading. Therefore these flexibilities need to be modeled accurately. The flexible multibody technique enables the modeling of the flexibility of the different drive train components in the model. This is achieved by representing drive train components, such as for example shafts and planet carrier using modally reduced finite element (FE) models [2]. Where Peeters mainly focused on the comparison of different modelling techniques, we focused on the detailed investigation of the influence of flexibility within these models. Besides structural flexibilities, special focus within this research was on the flexible modelling of gear meshing, given the importance of accurate gear mesh stiffness description for flexible internal and external gears. The dynamic coupling between the different gearbox subcomponents is particularly important in this regard. [1] J.

40|$|Abstract—Blind source {{separation}} (BSS) for convolutive mix-tures can {{be solved}} efficiently in the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain,</b> where in-dependent <b>component</b> analysis (ICA) is performed separately in each frequency bin. However, frequency-domain BSS involves a permutation problem: the permutation ambiguity of ICA in each frequency bin should be aligned so that a separated signal in the time-domain contains frequency components of the same source signal. This paper presents a robust and precise method for solving the permutation problem. It is based on two approaches: direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for sources and the interfrequency cor-relation of signal envelopes. We discuss the advantages and disad-vantages of the two approaches, and integrate them to exploit their respective advantages. Furthermore, by utilizing the harmonics of signals, we make the new method robust even for low frequen-cies where DOA estimation is inaccurate. We also present a new closed-form formula for estimating DOAs from a separation ma-trix obtained by ICA. Experimental results show that our method provided an almost perfect solution to the permutation problem for a case where two sources were mixed in a room whose rever-beration time was 300 ms.
