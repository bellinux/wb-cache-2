5|$|Flint {{and brown}} or yellow brick is used extensively, both for {{buildings}} within the conservation area and in associated {{structures such as}} boundary walls and pavements. Some <b>kerbs</b> are of granite, limestone and flint, while some high-quality Yorkstone paving slabs survive, along with some red-brick pavements.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Prix was contested by eleven {{teams with}} two drivers each. The teams (also known as constructors) were McLaren, Ferrari, Jordan, Jaguar, Williams, Benetton, Prost, Sauber, Arrows, Minardi and BAR. Tyre {{supplier}} Bridgestone brought two different tyre compounds to the race; the Soft and the Medium dry compound tyres. The A1-Ring underwent minor safety {{changes in the}} run-up to the race. The modifications were new <b>kerbs</b> placed across the track with flagstones inside the <b>kerbs</b> to prevent dust from accumulating on the circuit. An additional row of tyres were erected at all corners and were designed to increase absorption in the event of a collision.|$|E
5|$|The circuit {{passed its}} final {{inspection}} in May 2016 with FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting declaring his satisfaction that the circuit {{would be ready}} {{in time for the}} race. The circuit attracted some criticism from drivers who highlighted a lack of run-off in some corners and the tight pit entry positioned at one of the fastest points on the circuit. Following problems with loose <b>kerbs</b> in free practice, changes were made in turns 6 and 12, where the <b>kerbs</b> were replaced by painted markings on the track. Further revisions were made to the pit entry ahead of qualifying, extending the white line denoting the entry lane to allow drivers more time to react to cars entering the pit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kerbing</b> in Green Street between Charlotte and Helen Streets was {{commenced}} in December 1900 {{and completed}} in August 1901. <b>Kerbing</b> along Walker Street from the Commercial (now Cooktown) Hotel to {{the junction of}} Helen Street was constructed between November 1901 and March 1902. <b>Kerbing</b> along Hope Street commenced in June 1902. In January 1903 {{it was reported that}} <b>kerbing</b> and undertables were constructed in Helen Street between Walker and Hogg Streets and in November the same year the <b>kerbing</b> was continued in Hope Street to the corner of Pryde Street. In 1904 a culvert and <b>kerbing</b> was constructed in Adelaide Street and the Furneaux Street <b>kerbing</b> was constructed in 1905.|$|R
50|$|Sting {{operations}} in which undercover police wait for <b>kerb</b> crawlers to proposition them {{are a common}} method for tackling <b>kerb</b> crawling. <b>Kerb</b> crawling is illegal in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and India. Police may also collect licence-plate numbers of vehicles {{that appear to be}} <b>kerb</b> crawling and may contact their registered owners. In the United Kingdom, <b>kerb</b> crawling was not an arrestable offense until 2001.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{year in the}} autumn, {{in every}} {{constituent}} community, the traditional <b>Kerb</b> (kermis or fair), which have mostly been organized by youth for generations. In Michelbach the festival is called Hammelkerb, in Daisbach Klaa Frankfurter <b>Kerb,</b> in Hausen über Aar Häuser <b>Kerb,</b> in Panrod Panröder <b>Kerb</b> and in Kettenbach Schulweihkerb.|$|R
5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday, Sebastian Vettel set the fastest time, at 1:07.098, {{a little over}} a tenth of a second ahead of his {{teammate}} Räikkönen. Rosberg had the slowest time of the session, as he crashed out when his suspension broke after going over the <b>kerbs</b> at turn 2. His accident caused a ten-minute red flag period. His teammate Hamilton was third fastest, albeit running wide at turn 8 on one of his laps. Ricciardo was fourth fastest, half a second down on Vettel and one tenth of a second ahead of teammate Verstappen in fifth. Fernando Alonso, who lost parts of his bodywork when running over the <b>kerbs</b> late in the session, was tenth fastest, 1.2 seconds behind Vettel. Due to his crash, Mercedes had to change the gearbox on Rosberg's car, handing him a five-place grid penalty.|$|E
5|$|After the 2014 race {{had been}} held at a resurfaced circuit, causing the teams to fight with the soft tyre choice by Pirelli, speculations arose if drivers {{would be able to}} {{challenge}} the eleven-year old track record set by Rubens Barrichello in 2004. However, practice showed that lap times actually slowed due to changes to the <b>kerbs,</b> forcing the drivers {{to stay away from the}} insides of the corners. Pirelli chose the soft and medium compounds for the event.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, edging out Rosberg by almost seven-tenths of a second. Rosberg's running was limited as he coasted to a halt on track with twenty minutes of the session left to go due to losing drive. Ferrari was not {{competitive}} in eighth and thirteenth place for Vettel and Räikkönen respectively, with both cars suffering from problems with their energy recovery unit. The top five cars were powered by Mercedes, as Sergio Pérez led the charge behind Mercedes in third, ahead of Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg. Fernando Alonso managed eleventh place, but had to spend considerable time in the garage while his team worked on his car. Marcus Ericsson also had limited track time as a problem with his exhaust pipe forced him to miss {{the early part of}} the session. With loose <b>kerbs</b> detected during the GP2 qualifying session, drivers were instructed to stay clear of the <b>kerbs</b> at turn 6. Once more, many drivers had minor incidents on track, with some having to take to the run-off area at turn 3, while Gutiérrez touched the barrier at turn 8. Carlos Sainz Jr. spun at the first corner, but nevertheless finished the session in sixth, the fastest runner without a Mercedes power unit.|$|E
50|$|A <b>kerb</b> {{of large}} stones {{surround}} the cairn, and an inner <b>kerb</b> was revealed during excavation. Two {{stones of the}} inner <b>kerb</b> {{and one of the}} outer bear passage tomb art.|$|R

5|$|Modifications {{were made}} to the circuit from Mulsanne Corner to the Corvette Curves. The circuit was widened on the road {{connecting}} Mulsanne to Indianapolis, and again from Indianapolis to the Porsche Curves, although the <b>kerbs</b> remained in their previous locations. The first corner of the Porsche Curves had a larger run-off area on the outside while SAFER barriers had been installed on the inside wall. The Corvette corner also now featured a gravel run-off.|$|E
5|$|Engel was {{the fastest}} driver {{who was not}} issued with a penalty to not qualify within the top ten; his fastest time was eight-tenths of a second slower than Piquet's pole {{position}} lap. He was more than one-tenth of a second faster than 13th-placed qualifier Félix da Costa, who in turn, was nearly four-tenths ahead of débutant Carroll. The three drivers were followed by Sarrazin in 15th, and Evans in 16th; the latter struggled with cold brakes and tyres which prevented him from going faster. Ma's left-rear quarter was damaged when he contacted the barriers lining the circuit and qualified 17th. Jérôme d'Ambrosio struggled and was restricted to starting behind Ma. Di Grassi pushed hard and made a mistake at the chicane, making contact with the wall, and his front-left quarter was damaged, triggering red-flag conditions with three minutes left of the second group's running. He was restricted to starting 19th. Frijns completed the field and caused qualifying to be temporarily stopped when his car went airborne after hitting the <b>kerbs</b> at the chicane and collided with the barrier.|$|E
5|$|The Saturday morning {{practice}} session was 17minutes {{shorter than the}} scheduled 60minutes, due to Kovalainen's Renault having a suspected engine failure. The failure caused oil to be split on the track, this failure persisted during the race weekend. This resulted in a red flag period, from 10:33am until 10:50am local time. Hamilton led the practice with the fastest lap; with Räikkönen, Alonso and Massa posting the second, third and fourth fastest laps respectively. Sato finished the session with the fifth fastest lap in the Super Aguri car, outpacing the Honda works team {{for the second time}} during the race weekend. Toyota continued a disappointing race weekend, with the 14th and 16th fastest laps. Their suspension problems from the day before had not been resolved, and the two drivers were given instructions to avoid the <b>kerbs</b> at turn 8 to minimise further damage to the suspension. Red Bull came back with both of the two repaired cars entering the top ten.|$|E
50|$|At the Diamond Games, <b>Kerber</b> {{suffered}} a shocking straight sets loss to Francesca Schiavone in her opener. Following the loss, <b>Kerber</b> {{dropped out of}} the top 10 {{for the first time since}} 2012. At Dubai, <b>Kerber</b> lost to Flavia Pennetta in the third round in three sets. The following week in Doha, <b>Kerber</b> drew wild card Victoria Azarenka in the first round and lost in straight sets. In March, <b>Kerber</b> was seeded 13th in Indian Wells and received a first round bye. However, she fell to Sloane Stephens in her opening match. At the Miami Open, <b>Kerber</b> was once again the 13th seed and had a first round bye. She overcame British player Heather Watson in the second round to face Kuznetsova but lost in three sets.|$|R

After taking 2015-2016 as a gap year to focus on her gymnastics, she will be studying at Stanford. <b>Kerber</b> speaks English, Russian and French.|$|R
5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 15 July, eight teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 17–20 July {{to prepare for}} the upcoming German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. Ricardo Zonta set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz. Michael Schumacher lost control of the rear-end of his car at the Seconda Variante chicane, causing him to slide along the barriers and his car rested in the tyre barriers. Testing was suspended for one hour for the barriers to be repaired. Ferrari later found the crash occurred by a broken diffuser from riding on the <b>kerbs</b> which created a loss of downforce under braking. Michael Schumacher took a medical check and was declared fit to race. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the second day where it was held in wet weather conditions during the afternoon. Sauber and BAR went to Circuit Ricardo Tormo for three days where aerodyamic and set-up testing was undertaken. Coulthard was scheduled to join Wurz during the session but withdrew because of food poisoning. Irvine was quickest on the third and final days of testing. Arrows elected not to perform any testing and concentrated on work on aerodynamics at their headquarters at Leafield.|$|E
25|$|The {{street was}} {{originally}} paved with granite. By now, although the <b>kerbs</b> are generally still (probably Wicklow) granite, {{most of the}} paving stones have been replaced with concrete. The exception to this is the south-west corner in front of 53–54 which still has full granite paving.|$|E
25|$|Red taxi (urban) {{services}} {{are available to}} hire in Wan Chai. These can be pre-booked by telephone; however, hailing {{on the street is}} a more common way of getting a taxicab. Vehicles that carry a green plate at the front of their cars are able to carry passengers across the Victoria Harbour to Kowloon. There are, however, areas with restricted <b>kerbs</b> and designated pick-up and drop-off points in the area.|$|E
50|$|During the 1890s the Cooktown Municipal Council {{extended}} {{the work of}} <b>kerbing</b> and channelling the town's principal streets. In {{the second half of}} 1890 Thomas Pascoe was contracted to cut 500 yards of stone <b>kerbing</b> at 2/8 per yard, a standard price for this work, and in the same period he constructed a culvert in Hill street for £45. A council quarry in Hope Street was operating at this period. In the second half of 1891 Cleary, Brown & Smith were contracted to split and stack 500 yards of <b>kerbing</b> at 2/8 per yard. In October 1892 the Council voted a sum of £50 for work in Hope Street and 50 feet of <b>kerbing</b> was constructed along the southern side of Hogg Street from the corner of Hope Street. Early in 1893 two men were employed by the council to cut <b>kerbing</b> for future road works. By early April that year they had cut 159 yards of <b>kerbing</b> and 54 yards of pitching. Between mid-1894 and mid-1895, 271 yards of <b>kerbing</b> was constructed in upper Charlotte Street, and in November 1895 <b>kerbing</b> was constructed along the southern side of Green Street from Charlotte Street. Further <b>kerbing</b> along the eastern side of Charlotte Street, between Green and Furneaux Streets, was undertaken August-September 1896.|$|R
5000|$|Going {{into the}} final, <b>Kerber</b> and Williams had {{faced each other}} six times with Williams holding a 5 - 1 advantage. <b>Kerber</b> broke Williams in the third game of the first set with Williams {{breaking}} back to make it 3 - 3. <b>Kerber</b> immediately broke back and held serve to win the first set 6 - 4. Williams {{took advantage of the}} third of three break points in the fourth game of the second set, the remainder of the set going with serve, leveling the match at one set all. <b>Kerber</b> broke Williams in the second game of the final set, but Williams immediately broke back and held her own serve to level the deciding set at 2 - 2. Another break for <b>Kerber</b> saw her leading 5 - 2 but Williams broke back once again, taking the set to 5 - 4 to <b>Kerber.</b> A cross-court exchange described as [...] "breathtaking" [...] saw Williams hit the ball long, securing the title for <b>Kerber.</b>|$|R

25|$|Houses are {{a mixture}} of low scale {{dwellings}} set in gardens. The streetscape is generally open due to the low horizontal building forms and low or open style fencing. Buildings and homes are predominantly 1960s-1970s Housing Commission of Victoria homes made of conite, fibro rendering with some contemporary styling added by the renovation. Sealed roads have <b>kerbs</b> and footpaths {{on both sides of}} the street. Trees are medium to large and planted irregularly in streets. The approximate size of Frankston North is 5.2km2.|$|E
25|$|The circuit {{was also}} reprofiled slightly, {{including}} modifications to turns 1, 2, 3, 13 and 14 to aid overtaking, and also at turn 10 where high <b>kerbs</b> caused many accidents in 2008. The entrance and exit to the pit lane were also changed. The cars entered the pit lane before turn 22 while {{the most significant}} change was the exit of the pits with the cars now joining after turn 1. As a result, the total length of the circuit increased by 6 metres.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Allan Simonsen during the 2013 race, the ACO {{announced}} improvements to several sections of the circuit. Tertre Rouge was reprofiled and new barriers and tire walls were added at the corner's exit onto the Mulsanne Straight. Run-off areas in the Corvette corners were expanded, and Tecpro barriers were added behind the tire walls {{at the start of}} the Porsche corners. Large <b>kerbs</b> were added to the paved run-off at the second Ford chicane to deter cars from cutting the corner.|$|E

She had the {{opportunity}} to dethrone Serena Williams as the WTA world No. 1 if she won the title. <b>Kerber</b> defeated Kristina Mladenovic, Barbora Strýcová, Carla Suárez Navarro, and Simona Halep to reach the final, where she faced No. 15 seed Karolína Plíšková. She had defeated Plíšková in 2 finals last year, but Plíšková defeated <b>Kerber</b> this time. <b>Kerber</b> was, therefore, unable to unseat Williams at No. 1.|$|R

25|$|Jean-Éric Vergne was {{eliminated}} in Q1, out-qualified by the Caterhams of Heikki Kovalainen and Vitaly Petrov. Petrov was faster than his teammate {{for most of}} the Q1 session, but a late lap from Kovalinen — which included a bumpy ride across the <b>kerbs</b> at the final chicane — put him two-tenths of a second clear of the Russian. Pedro de la Rosa outqualified both Marussia cars by half a second, with teammate Narain Karthikeyan within a tenth of a second of Charles Pic, completing the final row of the grid. Sebastian Vettel was the fastest driver in the session.|$|E
25|$|Shared space schemes {{extend this}} {{principle}} further {{by removing the}} reliance on lane markings altogether, and also removing road signs and signals, allowing all road users to use {{any part of the}} road, and giving all road users equal priority and equal responsibility for each other's safety. Experiences where these schemes are in use show that road users, particularly motorists, undirected by signs, <b>kerbs,</b> or road markings, reduce their speed and establish eye contact with other users. Results from the thousands of such implementations worldwide all show casualty reductions and most also show reduced journey times. After the partial conversion of London's Kensington High Street to shared space, accidents decreased by 44% (the London average was 17%).|$|E
25|$|In {{an archaeological}} {{excavation}} {{of the road}} at {{the southern edge of}} Bourne (TF098193), where it ran across a margin between Kellaways clay and the argillaceous (clayey) Kellaways sand, {{it was found that the}} construction of the carriageway had been done by digging two parallel shallow trenches into the subsoil and over-filling them with gravel ballast so as to form <b>kerbs.</b> Coarse sand was used to form the carriageway between them. This was a skilful use of the available materials as south of Kate's Bridge, the road passes over such minerals but little but rather friable Cornbrash is available near the excavated site. Clearly, this part of the road was constructed from the south, northwards and the materials carried along it. However, further north, in the Long Hollow, cornbrash from Sapperton TF019239, seems to have been used (Lane p.23.) Again, the use is north of the source.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 2017 season, <b>Kerber</b> competed in the Brisbane International as the top seed. After {{receiving}} a first round bye, <b>Kerber</b> won her opening match against Ashleigh Barty in three sets but then lost to Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals. <b>Kerber</b> then competed at Apia International Sydney where she received a first round bye but proceeded to lose her opening match to Russian teenager Daria Kasatkina. After early lackluster performances, <b>Kerber</b> entered the Australian Open as the defending champion and top seed {{for the first time at}} a Grand Slam tournament. She faced Lesia Tsurenko in the first round and defeated her in three sets after squandering match point in the second set. <b>Kerber</b> then defeated compatriot Carina Witthöft in the second round and Kristýna Plíšková in the third round. <b>Kerber</b> then lost to Coco Vandeweghe in the fourth round winning only five games and ending her title defense. After Serena Williams won the tournament, she amassed enough points to take back her top ranking from <b>Kerber.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cooktown's early <b>kerb</b> and {{channelling}} {{is constructed}} of granite, a granular igneous rock composed mainly of feldspar (orthoclase) and quartz.
