Her voice had developed a throatiness because she could hear low tones better than high ones. From early 1957, Sullavan's hearing declined {{so much that she}} was becoming depressed and sleepless and often wandered about all night. She would often go to bed and stay there for days, her only words: [...] "Just let me be, please". Sullavan had kept her hearing problem largely hidden. On January 8, 1960 (one week after Sullavan's death), The New York Post reporter Nancy Seely wrote: [...] "The thunderous applause of a delighted audience—was it only a dim murmur over the years to Margaret Sullavan? Did the poised and confident mien of the beautiful actress mask a sick fear, night after night, that she'd miss an important cue?" [...] In addition to her <b>hearing</b> <b>defect,</b> Sullavan's children, Brooke, and in particular Bridget and Bill, often proved rebellious and contrary. As a result of the divorce from Hayward, the family fell apart. Sullavan felt that Hayward was trying to alienate their children from her. When the children went to California to visit their father they were so spoiled with expensive gifts that, when they returned to their mother in Connecticut, they were deeply discontented with what they saw as a staid lifestyle.|$|E

Kreutziger gave him back the cheque several times, assuring Harry that as an Aboriginal he would easily be able to get another license. Harry finally agreed to sell for $4,500, but then Kreutziger unilaterally reduced the price by $570, deducting the cost of conversion of the boat license from an [...] "AI" [...] license (available only to Aboriginal peoples) into an [...] "A" [...] license.

40|$|Approximately 10 % of the {{population}} worldwide suffers from hearing loss (HL) and about 60 % of persons with early onset HL have hereditary hearing loss due to genetic mutations. Highly efficient mutagenesis in mice with the chemical mutagen, ethylnitrosourea (ENU), associated with relevant phenotypic tools represents a powerful approach in producing mouse models for hearing impairment. A benefit of this strategy is to generate alleles to form a series revealing {{the full spectrum of}} gene function in vivo. It can also mimic the range of human mutations and polymorphisms for HL. In the course of a genome ENU mutagenesis program, we selected a new mouse model for <b>hearing</b> <b>defect</b> based on a dysmorphological screen. We identified by gene mapping the mutation responsible for this phenotype and characterized it at the histological level of the inner ear and evaluated the vestibule by following the recommendations of the standard operating procedures, IMPReSS. We have identified and characterized a new recessive allele of the otogelin gene, Otogvbd/vbd, due to a homozygous one base pair substitution at the splice donor site of intron 29.

40|$|Corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in modulating physiological and behavioral responses to stress. Its actions are mediated through two receptors, Crhr 1 and Crhr 2.

We generated Ucn-deficient mice using embryonic stem cell technology to determine its role in stress-induced behavioral and autonomic responses. Unlike Crhr 1 - or Crhr 2 -deficient mice, Ucn-deficient mice exhibit normal anxiety-like behavior as well as autonomic regulation in response to stress. However, the mutant mice display an impaired acoustic startle response that is not due to an obvious <b>hearing</b> <b>defect.</b> Thus, our results suggest that Ucn does not play an essential role in stress-induced behavioral and autonomic responses.
