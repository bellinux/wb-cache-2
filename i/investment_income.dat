Publications sold include books on conservation and genetics, livestock husbandry, farming operations and breed guides. In the 1998 fiscal year, the organization claimed slightly over US$308,000 in income, coming mainly from public donations and membership dues, but also including service revenue, <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> and sales of goods. By 2009, this amount had jumped to slightly more than US$440,000, mainly from donations, grants and service revenue, but also including <b>investment</b> <b>income.</b> In 1998, the organization claimed slightly over US$288,000 in expenses, allocated mainly to program services, but with just under US$30,000 stemming from management, fundraising and general expenses. By 2009, expenses stood at almost US$490,000, spent mostly on employee salaries, benefits and other compensation (which includes program service expenses), but with almost US$150,000 stemming from management, fundraising and general expenses.

5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth.

25|$|This {{shift to}} S-Corporations means that income {{previously}} not included on {{personal income tax}} returns appeared there during this change, as S-Corporation investors directly pay taxes on corporate profit {{regardless of whether it}} is distributed or not. Furthermore, Reynolds points out in the same literature that tax-deferred savings accounts grew substantially from the 1980s onward, so that <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> to these accounts was not included as personal income in the years which it accrued.
