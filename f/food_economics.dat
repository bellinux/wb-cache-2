40|$|While {{there is}} mixed {{evidence}} {{of the impact of}} food assistance programs on obesity, there is general agreement that the food-insecure are at higher risk of obesity and obesity-related diseases. Food assistance programs, originally designed to overcome a lack of available food, now need to confront a very different problem: how to provide for the food-insecure while encouraging healthy lifestyles. This paper examines the potential to address these competing needs using traditional economic policies (manipulating information or prices) versus policies engaging behavioral <b>economics</b> and psychology. <b>food</b> assistance, behavioral <b>economics,</b> <b>food</b> insecurity, obesity, Consumer/Household <b>Economics,</b> <b>Food</b> Security and Poverty, Health Economics and Policy,...|$|R

It was among the first publications to draw connections between the environment and such areas as <b>food,</b> <b>economics,</b> and health. Its work has included political coverage, including exclusive interviews with all of the candidates in the 2008 presidential election; a seven-week series on poverty and the environment; and influential climate and energy reporting. Grist earned Webby Awards in 2005 and 2006, an honor described by The New York Times as “the Oscars of the internet.” Utne gave Grist its Independent Press Award for Online Political Coverage in 2003 and 2005, citing its “rich mix of hard-hitting eco-political coverage, practical tips, hopeful tales, and rib-tickling whimsy.” In 2007, Grist published Wake Up and Smell the Planet: The Nonpompous, Nonpreachy Grist Guide to Greening Your Day, which won a silver medal at Independent Publisher Book Awards.|$|E

Findings from behavioral economics suggest innovative, low-cost {{ways to improve the}} diet quality of food stamp participants without restricting their freedom of choice.
