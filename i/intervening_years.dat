5|$|The {{critical}} {{perception of}} the film has shifted in the <b>intervening</b> <b>years,</b> which resulted in it being ranked 235th in Sight & Sounds prestigious decennial critics poll in 2012, and in 2015 sixty-two international film critics polled by the BBC voted it the 97th best American film.|$|E
5|$|Nine years earlier, Tchaikovsky had penned a {{ruthless}} dissection of The Five for Nadezhda von Meck. At that time, his feelings of personal isolation and professional insecurity {{had been at}} their strongest. In the nine <b>intervening</b> <b>years,</b> Mussorgsky and Borodin had both died, Balakirev had banished himself to the musical sidelines, and Cui's critical missives had lost much of their sting for Tchaikovsky. Rimsky-Korsakov {{was the only one}} left who was fully active as a composer, and much had changed in the <b>intervening</b> <b>years</b> between him and Tchaikovsky as a result of Rimsky-Korsakov's change in musical values. Tchaikovsky had also changed. More secure as a composer and less isolated personally than {{he had been in the}} past, Tchaikovsky enjoyed the company he now kept with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov, and found much to enjoy in their music.|$|E
50|$|In 1942 he {{had married}} the actress Georgia Lind (his second wife). The couple {{divorced}} shortly afterwards, but remarried in 1954. In the <b>intervening</b> <b>year</b> {{he was married to}} another actress Marina Ried. Both are buried in an ehrengrab in the Berlin Wilmersdorf cemetery.|$|R
50|$|Lar {{met with}} more luck at interprovincial {{level in the}} hurling code, however. He wore the No.4 jersey in three {{successive}} Railway Cup hurling finals, 1962-64, collecting winners medals in 1962 and 1964 but losing narrowly to Munster after a replay in the <b>intervening</b> <b>year’s</b> showpiece.|$|R
50|$|When Alec Motyer retired, George Carey was {{appointed}} to succeed him. However, Carey postponed taking up his new office for a year, in order to prepare his parish, St Nicholas, Durham, for the forthcoming vacancy. Joyce Baldwin {{was appointed}} Principal for a fixed-term to cover the <b>intervening</b> <b>year</b> until her own retirement.|$|R
5|$|At a {{rehearsal}} {{for one of}} these entertainments, Ages Ago (1869), the composer Frederic Clay introduced Gilbert to his friend, the young composer Arthur Sullivan. Two years later, Gilbert and Sullivan would write their first work together. Those two <b>intervening</b> <b>years</b> continued to shape Gilbert's theatrical style. He continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas Our Island Home (1870) and A Sensation Novel (1871), and the blank verse comedies The Princess (1870), The Palace of Truth (1870), and Pygmalion and Galatea (1871).|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Jacob Light and Horace Hodes {{proved that}} a {{filterable}} {{agent in the}} faeces of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours (livestock diarrhoea) in cattle. Three decades later, preserved samples of the agent were shown to be rotavirus. In the <b>intervening</b> <b>years,</b> a virus in mice was shown {{to be related to}} the virus causing scours. In 1973, Ruth Bishop and colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of an {{apprentice}} Shaper, a sect of mages who can create living creatures through force of will. The apprentice is cast away on Sucia, an island abandoned by the sect 200 years prior. The island contains groups of the Shapers' creations, who have formed their own ideologies regarding their creators in the <b>intervening</b> <b>years.</b> The primary motivation of the player is to escape the island and, in the process, deal with the forces working to steal the Shaper secrets abandoned on Sucia Isle.|$|E
50|$|The ladies {{event was}} won by 1960 Olympic bronze {{medalist}} Barbara Roles Pursley, {{who had been}} asked to come out of retirement; she had married and had a baby during the <b>intervening</b> <b>year.</b> She easily won the title with straight first-place ordinals after a poised and confident free skating performance that received an enthusiastic ovation from the crowd.|$|R
5000|$|In the <b>intervening</b> <b>year,</b> S.P.A.M. {{organizers}} {{had found}} a kindred spirit, show promoter and artist Marcus Da Anarchist, who organized [...] "Pyrate Punx Picnics" [...] out of San Francisco's Mission District. S.P.A.M. and the Pyrate Punx collaborated on the next campout, dubbing it [...] "Pirates vs. Geeks". John Geek and Marcus each booked half the bands.|$|R
40|$|Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Sarnoff Corporation (Sarnoff) are {{performing}} an integrated feasibility demonstration of Video Surveillance and Monitoring (VSAM). The {{objective is to}} develop a cooperative, multi-sensor video surveillance system that provides continuous coverage over battlefield areas. Significant achievements have been demonstrated during VSAM Demo I in November 1997, and in the <b>intervening</b> <b>year</b> leading up to Demo II in October 1998...|$|R
5|$|The Royal School {{declined}} between 1848 and 1850 {{after the}} Cooke family {{decided to leave}} {{and most of the}} students left school, married or continued their educations elsewhere. Not long after, Kaliokalani left school. Little is known about his life during the <b>intervening</b> <b>years.</b> He died at Lahaina in 1852, aged sixteen. The contemporary Hawaiian newspaper The Polynesian stated that he died on April 21 while later source stated that he died on April 2. A cause of death was not noted.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was formed}} by July 1, 1919 along two {{discontinuous}} sections of its current corridor. The gap was filled in by 1927, but a second break in the routing {{was created in the}} 1930s. This second interruption in the corridor was eliminated within a year. The various paths that M-46 has followed have been straightened over the <b>intervening</b> <b>years,</b> producing the modern corridor by the 1970s. Other changes have been made to the location of the western terminus in Muskegon, but it has remained fixed in its current location since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Various {{changes were}} made in the second edition. Some of the social {{commentary}} regarding the poor treatment of Native Americans by the government was toned down. The name of the Native tribe was changed from the Orteils Ficelés ("Tied Toes") to the Pieds Noirs ("Black Feet"). Perhaps because Al Capone's power had diminished in the <b>intervening</b> <b>years,</b> Hergé depicted Capone's scarred face in the 1945 version. He removed the reference to Mary Pikeford from the ceremonial dinner scene and deleted two Chinese hoodlums who tried to eat Snowy. References to Belgium were also removed, allowing the story to have a greater international appeal.|$|E
50|$|The club {{shared the}} NDC title in 1955, 1956 and 1958 {{they won the}} Enterprise Cup in 1955 and 1957 and were runners up the <b>intervening</b> <b>year.</b> By 1960 they had made two visits to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and had toured Uganda. Much of this early success was due to Hugh Steel, John Tanner and Owen Wheeler (a Scottish trialist with two English county caps).|$|R
50|$|Richard Colley (as he was christened), {{was born}} around 1690, {{the son of}} Henry Colley (died 1700) and Mary, {{daughter}} of Sir William Ussher. He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin with an BA in 1711 and an MA in 1714 and an N.F.P. on July 6, 1740 as Richard Colley. In the <b>intervening</b> <b>year</b> he held the office of Chamberlain of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland).|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} {{established}} by the Dongshin Educational Foundation. Governmental permission was received in 1992. The school admitted its first entering class in March 1993. It was known at that time as Yeoju Industrial Technical College, taking its present name two years later in 1995. The first international sisterhood relationship {{was established in the}} <b>intervening</b> <b>year</b> (1994), with Salt Lake Community College in the United States.|$|R
5|$|Disney {{announced}} their intentions to develop The Incredibles 2 in March 2014. Bird returned to direct {{and write the}} screenplay. Nelson, Hunter, Vowell, Jackson, and Bird will also return to voice their characters, while Dash will now be voiced by Huck Milner as Fox's voice had deepened in the <b>intervening</b> <b>years.</b> The film will follow immediately {{from the end of}} The Incredibles with the Parrs facing the Underminer. The film will focus on Holly Hunter's character, Elastigirl. Originally, The Incredibles 2 was to be released on June 21, 2019 as Pixar's next film after Toy Story 4. Due to delays on that title, Pixar swapped the releases, and currently The Incredibles 2 is set for release on June 15, 2018.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had long}} sought to regain {{contact with his}} old friend Zhang Chongren, {{with whom he had}} lost contact. He {{regularly}} asked any Chinese people that he met if they knew of Zhang, and in 1979 had some success when a staff member in a Brussels Chinese restaurant revealed that he was Zhang's godson. Hergé was thus able to re-establish contact with his old friend. The journalist Gérard Valet organised for Zhang to visit Brussels so that he and Hergé could be re-united. The event took place in March 1981, and was heavily publicised; Hergé however found the situation difficult, disliking the press attention and finding that he and Zhang had grown distant during the <b>intervening</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Galileo {{spacecraft}} {{arrived at}} Jupiter in 1995 after a six-year journey from Earth {{to follow up}} on the discoveries of the two Voyager probes and ground-based observations taken in the <b>intervening</b> <b>years.</b> Io's location within one of Jupiter's most intense radiation belts precluded a prolonged close flyby, but Galileo did pass close by shortly before entering orbit for its two-year, primary mission studying the Jovian system. Although no images were taken during the close flyby on 7 December 1995, the encounter did yield significant results, such as the discovery of a large iron core, similar to that found in the rocky planets of the inner Solar System.|$|E
50|$|These various {{histories}} {{have been}} used over the <b>intervening</b> 170 <b>years</b> as sources for new definitive interpretations.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} GSXR750 {{was introduced}} in 1985 but withheld from the United States due to tariff issues which would have imposed a 39.4 percent tax on each bike because it was over 700ccs. By waiting until 1986, Suzuki saved buyers money as the tax dropped to 24.4 percent. In the <b>intervening</b> <b>year,</b> Suzuki responded to European riders' complaints about the bike's stability by lengthening the swing arm by an inch.|$|R
5000|$|Because Shelter had no deal {{to release}} {{anything}} at the time, though, Fire was never released, {{and the final}} album was substantially altered, as the Twilley Band had recorded and produced at least another album's worth of material in the <b>intervening</b> <b>year.</b> Ultimately, {{only one of the}} Robin Cable-produced songs ("England") and three of the songs from Fire (also [...] "I'm On Fire" [...] and [...] "You Were So Warm") reached the original version of Sincerely.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} the strip ended in March 1995 Melchester were in dire straits, {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy, and their {{long-term}} future far from certain. When the strip returned in Match of the Day magazine in May 1997, much of the monthly comic's new continuity was ignored, although the basic thread of the club having struggled against relegation and being severely in debt was continued. It was revealed in the first strip that in the <b>intervening</b> <b>years,</b> while Rovers had managed to survive the threat of bankruptcy, a bribery scandal had caused a mass exodus of players and eventual relegation to Division One. Rocky, meanwhile, was playing for fierce local rivals Melborough, after a bitter falling-out with his father over a car accident in Italy in which his mother, Penny, had been killed. Roy, who had quit football as a result, was blamed by some (including his son) for the accident, even though he had no memory of it, and the precise circumstances surrounding the event were never resolved.|$|E
5|$|Kaniakapūpū ("the {{singing of}} the land shells"), known {{formerly}} as Luakaha ("place of relaxation"), is {{the ruins of the}} former summer palace of King Kamehameha III and Queen Kalama on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Built in the 1840s, and situated in the cool uplands of the Nuʻuanu Valley, it served as the king and queen's summer retreat after the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii moved from Lahaina to Honolulu in 1845. It was famous for being the site of a grand luau attended by an estimated ten thousand guests during the 1847 Hawaiian Sovereignty Restoration Day celebration. The palace had fallen into ruins by 1874; no records exist about its condition in the <b>intervening</b> <b>years.</b> Rediscovered in the 1950s, the site was cleared and efforts were made to stabilize the ruins from further damage by the elements and invasive plant growth. The site remains officially off-limits to the public and trespassers are subjected to citations, although the site is not regularly monitored.|$|E
5|$|No African American {{was awarded}} a Medal of Honor either during World War II or {{immediately}} afterwards {{with respect to their}} actions during that conflict. This changed in 1992 when a study conducted by Shaw University and commissioned by the U.S. Dept. of Defense and the United States Army asserted that systematic racial discrimination had been present in the criteria for awarding medals during the war. After an exhaustive review of files the study recommended that several of the Distinguished Service Crosses awarded to African Americans be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, more than fifty {{years after the end of}} the war, President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal to seven African American World War II veterans. Vernon Baker was the only living recipient—the other six men had been killed in action or died in the <b>intervening</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

5|$|Participation in the Crusades {{was also}} {{seen as a}} form of pilgrimage, and indeed the same Latin word, peregrinatio, was {{sometimes}} applied to both activities. While English participation in the First Crusade between 1095 and 1099 was limited, England played a prominent part in the Second, Third and Fifth Crusades over the next two centuries, with many crusaders leaving for the Levant during the <b>intervening</b> <b>years.</b> The idea of undertaking a pilgrimage to Jerusalem was not new in England, however, as the idea of religiously justified warfare went back to Anglo-Saxon times. Many of those who took up the Cross to go on a Crusade never actually left, often because the individual lacked sufficient funds to undertake the journey. Raising funds to travel typically involved crusaders selling or mortgaging their lands and possessions, which affected their families and, at times, considerably affected the economy as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The Barrier (later {{known as}} the Ross Ice Shelf) was sighted on 23 January, but the inlet had disappeared; the Barrier edge had changed {{significantly}} in the <b>intervening</b> <b>years,</b> and the section which had included the inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay, which Shackleton named the Bay of Whales after {{the large number of}} whales seen there. Shackleton was not prepared to risk wintering on a Barrier surface that might calve into the sea, so he turned the ship towards King Edward VII Land. After repeated efforts to approach this coast had failed, and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap the ship, Nimrod was forced to retreat. Shackleton's only choice now, other than abandonment of the expedition's goals, was to break the promise he had given to Scott. On 25 January he ordered the ship to head for McMurdo Sound.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporaneous}} chronicler Robert of Torigni, on {{the death}} of Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou in 1151 his second son, who was also called Geoffrey, inherited four castles. Robert did not specify which these were, but historian W. L. Warren speculated that Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau numbered amongst these castles {{as they were in the}} territory which may have been traditionally the inheritance of the second oldest son. Geoffrey rebelled against his older brother, Henry, in 1152. Henry negotiated with the castellans of the castles of Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau to surrender before laying siege to Château de Montsoreau. Following the loss of Montsoreau, Geoffrey surrendered to his brother. By 1156 Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau were back under Geoffrey's control. That year he readied them for war as he rebelled against Henry a second time. In the <b>intervening</b> <b>years,</b> his brother had been crowned King HenryII of England at the end of a long-running civil war. Henry besieged and captured Geoffrey's castles in the summer of 1156 and kept them under his control, giving Geoffrey an annuity of £1,500 in compensation. The presence of a treasury and one of HenryII's main arsenals marked Chinon as a particularly important castle in the 12thcentury. It was a primary residence of HenryII who was responsible for construction of almost all of the massive castle.|$|E
