40|$|Abstract – The rural {{distribution}} transformer <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> due to lightning activity {{is a critical}} matter in several regions of Colombia. Different research projects have been funded by Colombian electrical companies in order to solve this problem. In some colombian regions, such as Rionegro, Cundinamarca, the tramsformer <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> has been as high as 50 %. In different {{places around the world}} with a lightning activity similar to our country, the <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> has been kept close to 1 %. The problem could be solved by developing an integral solution that includes: reduction of grounding resistance and inductive loops, specific transformer design and extensive use of surge arresters on the low and medium voltage transformer windings. The hygroscopic properties of granular materials against lightning-like current and voltage impulses were used to develop an economic surge protection device based on sand. The transformers with the highest <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> were selected to install this new type of surge protection device. The design and implementation of the new device for the {{distribution transformer}} low-voltage side is described in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{describe}} an emergency evacuation support system (ESS) that employs short-range wireless communications among mobile devices carried by civilians. Emergency information is disseminated via opportunistic contacts between communication nodes (CNs), and each CN provides adaptive step-by-step navigation directions for its user during evacuation. Using mobile devices and opportunistic communications (oppcomms) allow ESS to operate when {{other means of}} communication are destroyed or overloaded. In this paper, we evaluate the resilience of oppcomms as used to enable evacuation support in ESS; we specifically consider the effect of CN failures on evacuation and communication performance. Our simulation experiments of evacuation of a three-floor office building show that ESS is highly resilient to node <b>failures,</b> and <b>failure</b> <b>ratios</b> up to 20 % are well-tolerated. ...|$|R

30|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to analyze the bearing {{properties}} of the differently oriented glulam using digital image correlation (DIC). Six differently oriented specimens associated with three anatomical directions including longitudinal (L), radial (R), and tangential (T), and 12 -mm drift pins were used to analyze the bearing properties, including yield load and bearing strength. The highest bearing strength of 22.57  MPa from RL was found, whereas the lowest bearing strength of 6.47  MPa from LR was found. Different strain distributions were observed from the differently oriented bearing specimens using DIC. Different <b>failure</b> <b>ratios</b> of the differently oriented specimens were highly related to the strain distributions. Although the bearing properties were found to be different between the differently oriented specimens, for the connection design aspect, the bearing properties of glulam could be grouped as RL and TL specimens, RT and TR specimens, and LR and LT specimens.|$|R
30|$|A second {{important}} {{finding of}} this study was a high EL capillary sampling failure rate. This problem had not been evidenced in preliminary validation studies [12 – 14] and was considered to be independent from the new collecting system. The two interim analyses, undertaken after the inclusion of the 15 th and 45 th patients, permitted the research team to survey sampling success evolution. High sampling <b>failure</b> <b>ratios</b> were evidenced early in the present study and were clearly associated with insufficient blood flow delivery to the collecting system. This was attributed to a reduced capillary blood flow in the EL. Thereafter, it was decided to increase arterialization time in an attempt to increase vasodilation and augment earlobe subcutaneous capillary blood flow. Nevertheless, extended arterialization times were not able to compensate for insufficient blood flow, and sampling failure rates remained unchanged throughout the study. Upon study finalization, data analysis showed that patient age (> 65  years) was an independent factor associated with sampling failure. Aging is responsible for vascular function impairment [24] and increased capillary rigidity, which may cause limited capillary blood flow and blood delivery to the collector. The impact of age became evident when patients aged[*]<[*] 45  years were analyzed, in which case sampling success rate reached 100 %. Indeed, if proper patient selection is made a significant number of patients could benefit from this technique. In our polyvalent ICU, around 48 % of patients admitted are[*]<[*] 65  years, representing more than 600 potential users of this technique per year. Finally, vasoactive drugs, moderate NE doses (> 0.22  μg/kg/min) and the cumulative effect of hemodynamic failure variables were also factors with potential influence upon sampling success; however, data did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, signs of tissue hypoxia/hypoperfusion such as elevated blood lactate or cutaneous signs of insufficient perfusion, and conditions known to cause microvascular dysfunction such as sepsis [25] were not associated with increased sampling <b>failure</b> <b>ratios.</b> This finding questions the impact of low tissue perfusion associated with hemodynamic instability as an influencing factor in sampling success; however the present study was not specifically designed to address this issue.|$|R

40|$|An even {{distribution}} of preservatives is favoured as non-impregnated parts of wood {{will lead to}} a less durable material. Plenty of factors could be the reasons for the observed un{{even distribution}} of preservatives, such as wood products dimension, moisture content, drying process, wood extractives and structure. In this study, the influence of drying conditions, extractives and wood structure to uneven distribution of preservatives was studied. 294 Scots pine (Pinus Sylvestris) boards were treatment with copper based preservatives. The boards were kiln dried under two different drying temperatures (dry temperature was 60 and 80 °C, respectively) to three different target MC (10 - 12, 18 and 24 %). Before drying and impregnation, green and dried test samples (2 × 400 mm) from these boards were taken and stored in freezer at - 24 °C, respectively. The total <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> (boards which have failure/total boards) was 31 %. The highest <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> occurred in group whose drying temperature was 80 oC and MC was 13. 8 %, and the minimum <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> occurred group whose drying temperature was 80 oC and MC was 20. 2 %. Quantitative analysis of extractives on matched impregnated and umimpregnated areas of dried and green samples were done by GC-FID. The microstructure of wood on the areas with impregnation failures was also studied by SEM. The results showed that fatty acids, resin acids and fats could {{play an important role in}} explaining uneven distribution of preservatives. The areas with impregnation failures contained more fatty acids, resin acids and fats than impregnated areas on dried samples. Those extractives could block resin canal as well as parenchyma cells which will hinder liquid penetration. Also, the drying process has an influence to presence of fatty acids, resin acids and fats, which could well explain the impregnation <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> of the whole batch. In addition, the influence of reconditioning to uneven distribution of preservatives was investigated with the help of CT-scanner. However, the results showed that the influence of reconditioning to impregnation results was not obvious. Validerat; 20120615 (anonymous...|$|E

This paper presents a statistical performance evaluation of soft seat spring operated pressure relief valves. These pressure relief valves are typically smaller and of lower cost than hard seat (metal to metal) pressure relief valves and can provide substantial cost savings in fluid service applications (air, gas, liquid, and steam) providing that probability of failure on demand (the probability that the pressure relief valve fails to perform its intended safety function during a potentially dangerous over pressurization) {{is at least as}} good as that for hard seat valves.

Therefore, the improvement of scheduling efficiency in the TDRSS can not only help to increase the resource utilities, but also to reduce the scheduling <b>failure</b> <b>ratio.</b> A model of nonhomogeneous parallel machines scheduling prob-lems with time window (NPM-TW) is firstly built up for the TDRSS, considering the distinct features of the variable preparation time and the nonhomogeneous transmission rates for different types of antennas on each tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS). Then, an adaptive subsequence adjustment (ASA) framework with evo-lutionary asymmetric path-relinking (EvAPR) is proposed to solve this problem, in which an asymmetric progressive crossover ope-ration is involved to overcome the local optima by the conventional job inserting methods. The numerical results show that, compared with the classical greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) algorithm, the scheduling <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> of jobs can be re-duced over 11 % on average by the proposed ASA with EvAPR...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} efficient approximate learning by multilayered feedforward circuits subject to two objective functions. First, we {{consider the}} objective to maximize the ratio of correctly classified points compared to the training set size (e. g., see [3, 5]). We show that for single hidden layer threshold circuits with n hidden nodes and varying input dimension, approximation of this ratio within a relative error c/n 3, for some positive constant c,is NP-hard even {{if the number of}} examples is limited with respect to n. For architectures with two hidden nodes (e. g., as in [6]), approximating the objective within some fixed factor is NP-hard even if any sigmoid-like activation function in the hidden layer and ε-separation of the output [19] is considered, or if the semilinear activation function substitutes the threshold function. Next, we consider the objective to minimize the <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> [2]. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> within every constant larger than 1 for a multilayered threshold circuit provided the input biases are zero. Furthermore, even weak approximation of this objective is almost NP-hard. ...|$|E

40|$|Background. Complications of spinal {{anaesthesia}} (SpA) range between 1 and 17 %. Habitus and operator experience {{may play a}} pivotal role, but only sparse data is available to substantiate this claim. Methods. 161 patients were prospectively enrolled. Data such as spread of block, duration of puncture, number of trials, any complication, operator experience, haemodynamic parameters, was recorded and anatomical patient habitus assessed. Results. Data from 154 patients were analyzed. Success rate of SpA {{in the group of}} young trainees was 72 % versus 100 % in the group of consultants. Trainees succeeded in patients with a normal habitus in 83. 3 % of cases versus 41. 3 % when patients had a difficult anatomy (P= 0. 02). SpA in obese patients (BMI ≥ 32) was associated with a significantly longer duration of puncture, an increased <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> when performed by trainees (almost 50 %), and an increased number of bloody punctures. Discussion. Habitus plays a pivotal role for SpA efficiency. In patients with obscured landmarks, <b>failure</b> <b>ratio</b> in unexperienced operators is high.
