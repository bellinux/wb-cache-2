500|$|Although he did {{not have}} to face top-class fast bowling in Test matches, he was {{successful}} against English fast bowlers such as Harold Larwood in county cricket, and he established his ascendancy over O'Reilly, the world's best bowler at the time. On one occasion, O'Reilly held his head in his hands when he saw Leyland come out to bat, and was heard to say: [...] "Oh, it's that bloody Yorkshireman again!" [...] In later years, O'Reilly vigorously denied that Leyland held the upper hand, responding to such suggestions by saying [...] "You <b>just</b> <b>check</b> how many times I got him out!" [...] The cricket historian David Frith points out that [...] "the answer is nine times in 16 Tests, but with decreasing frequency. In their Test encounters Leyland made 1,412 runs at an average of 56." [...] Robertson-Glasgow noted that Leyland was almost anonymous in good batting conditions under little pressure; he came to life in more difficult circumstances: [...] "His element was foul weather. He would disappear into the haze of Bramall Lane, where a sterner sort of game was being played under the name of cricket, and entrench himself among the sawdust and smoke and off-breaks and appeals, and do his raw, tough work in silence." ...|$|E

Both were huge, forward-moving story elements that harkened back to Season 1 and gave viewers something to root for and grab onto as the show itself heads into its final arcs." [...] Fowler also noted, [...] "As a reader of the books with no more books to read, Season 6 {{has been a very}} interesting experience," [...] giving the episode a 9.2 out of 10. Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also praised the scenes at Castle Black and in Vaes Dothrak, writing [...] "Game of Thrones lived up to its billing as A Song of Ice and Fire on Sunday, as there was plenty of action in both of the signature halves of the story." [...] Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "Now that is how you set the table. [...] "Book Of The Stranger" [...] doesn't <b>just</b> <b>check</b> off plot points. In fact, there aren't a lot of plot points to check off. It's an episode of introductions, reunions, and wall-to-wall scheming," [...] giving the episode an A.

The noble master had told her that they were sure of a run from Craigattan, and she wasn't in the least tired, and they were not called upon to stand still in a big wood, and it didn't rain, and, in every respect, the day was very different from Monday. Mounted on a bright-skinned, lively steed, with her cousin on one side and Lord George de Bruce Carruthers on the other, with all the hunting world of her own county civil around her, and a fox just found in Craigattan Gorse, what could the heart of woman desire more? This was to live. There was, however, just enough of fear to make the blood run quickly to her heart. [...] "We'll be away at once now," [...] said Lord George with utmost earnestness; [...] "follow me close, but not too close. When the men see that I am giving you a lead, they won't come between.
