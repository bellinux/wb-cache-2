40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the cytotoxicity of some recently introduced tissue retraction materials and to compare their cytotoxic effects on the human gingival tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One representative brand of the commonly used conventional tissue retraction materials (Gingi-pak) along with two recent types (Expasyl and SnoWhite as a part of PerfectlM systems) were used in this project. A total of 27 specimens were prepared and divided into three groups, nine of each tested material. The cytotoxicity of the tested specimens was judged using the cell viability method along with direct contact test in an especially prepared culture at different time periods. RESULTS: The obtained results showed qualitatively that Gingi-pak material did inhibit the cell growth of the used culture media. On the other hand, Expasyl and SnoWhite (as a part of PerfectlM Systems) materials produced very slight growth inhibition of the cultured cells with some observed <b>detached</b> <b>cell</b> linings. CONCLUSIONS: The conventional gingival retraction cord impregnated with adrenaline; Gingi-pak was the most toxic material among the tested materials at all time periods. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|Adherent cells, cell sheets, and spheroids were {{harvested}} noninvasively from {{a culture}} surface {{by means of}} electrochemical desorption of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of alkanethiol. The SAM surface was made adhesive by the covalent bonding of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) -peptides to the alkanethiol molecules. The application of a negative electrical potential caused the reductive desorption of the SAM, resulting in the detachment of the cells. Using this approach greater than 90 % of adherent cells detached within 5 min. Furthermore, this approach was used to obtain two-dimensional (2 D) cell sheets. The <b>detached</b> <b>cell</b> sheets consisted of viable cells, which could be easily attached to other cell sheets in succession to form a multilayered cell sheet. Moreover, spheroids of hepatocytes of a uniform diameter were formed {{in an array of}} cylindrical cavities at a density of 280 spheroids/cm 2 and were harvested by applying a negative electrical potential. This cell manipulation technology could potentially be a useful tool for the fabrication and assembly of building blocks such as cell sheets and spheroids for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} method to {{characterize}} the mechanical properties of cells using a robot-integrated microfluidic chip (robochip) and microscopy. The microfluidic chip is designed to apply the specified deformations to a single <b>detached</b> <b>cell</b> using an on-chip actuator probe. The reaction force is simultaneously measured using an on-chip force sensor composed of a hollow folded beam and probe structure. In order to measure the cellular characteristics in further detail, a sub-pixel level of resolution of probe position is required. Therefore, we utilize the phase detection of moiré fringe. Using this method, the experimental resolution of the probe position reaches 42 nm. This is approximately ten times smaller than the optical wavelength, which is the limit of sharp imaging with a microscope. Calibration of the force sensor is also important in accurately measuring cellular reaction forces. We calibrated the spring constant from the frequency response, by the proposed sensing method of the probe position. As a representative of mechanical characteristics, we measured the elastic modulus of Madin-Darby Cannie Kidney (MDCK) cells. In spite of the rigid spring constant, the resolution and sensitivity were twice that achieved in our previous study. Unique cellular characteristics can be elucidated by the improvements in sensing resolution and accuracy...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} detachment of esophageal cancer cells from extracellular matrix on the localization of death receptor 5 (DR 5) and apoptosis. METHODS: Anchorage-dependent EC 9706 cells of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were pretreated or not treated with brefeldin A. <b>Detached</b> <b>cells</b> were harvested by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid digestion. Expression and localization of DR 5 in these cells were determined by immunocytochemical and immunofluorescence assays, as well as flow cytometry analysis. Apoptosis of EC 9706 cells was detected by flow cytometry after stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V/propidium iodide. Activation of caspase 8 was detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Immunocytochemical assay indicated that DR 5 was predominantly perinuclear in adherent cells but was mainly localized in <b>cell</b> membrane in <b>detached</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, immunofluorescence assay also confirmed the above-mentioned results, and further demonstrated that DR 5 was present {{in the form of}} coarse granules in <b>detached</b> <b>cells,</b> but in the form of fine granules in adherent cells. Cytometry analysis revealed higher levels of DR 5 expression on the surfaces of brefeldin-A-untreated cells than on the surfaces of brefeldin-A-treated cells, but brefeldin A treatment did not affect the total DR 5 expression levels. Moreover, nocodazole did not influence the extracelluar DR 5 expression levels in EC 9706 cells. Apoptosis assay revealed that <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> were more sensitive to DR 5 antibody-induced apoptosis than adherent cells. Western blotting showed that caspase 8 was activated in temporarily <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> 4 h earlier than in adherent cells. CONCLUSION: Progress from adhesion to detachment of EC 9706 cells causes DR 5 relocalization, and promotes cytoplasmic translocation of DR 5 to cell surfaces via a Golgi-dependent pathway. Moreover, it might also result in DR 5 aggregation to render apoptosis of <b>detached</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

Plaque formation was enhanced in both cell types. Plaques reached a size with an average diameter of 5 mm within 4 days with trypsin in the overlay, whereas their diameter remained less than 1 mm at this time after plating without trypsin in the overlay. Fusion of both cell types was observed 12 to 18 h after infection when trypsin was present in the medium. Fusion was not observed in infected BFB cell cultures and was rarely observed 48 h after infection of BFTy cells maintained with the trypsin-free medium. The largest polycaryons formed had 15 to 22 nuclei. They then lysed and <b>detached.</b> <b>Cell</b> fusion depended on de novo synthesis of hemagglutinin and infectivity.

40|$|Target cells adsorbed in {{affinity}} sepn. processes need to {{be effectively}} recovered from the adsorption matrix once contaminating cell types have been removed. Although tangential flow {{can be used to}} generate detachment forces, the resultant diln. is excessive. In this study, three alternative detachment protocols have been assessed using a membrane-based adsorption surface. Back flushing buffer through the membrane to generate greater detachment forces was studied. However, at the max. back flush velocity obtainable less than 50 % of attached cells were removed and recovered cell concns. were low. Controlled transmembrane delivery of hydrochloric acid as a non-specific eluent was also investigated. While this allowed complete recovery of cells the effective acid concn. was excessive. The upstream diln. required to maintain cell viability again leads to considerable diln. Injection of air bubbles into the tangential flow stream to generate elevated detachment forces was found to be the most effective approach. Detachment was found to be a function of both no. and size of bubbles. Under optimal conditions, 80 % of attached cells can be removed to give a <b>detached</b> <b>cell</b> concn. of 108 cells ml- 1.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed to}} assess {{the effect of the}} {{concentration}} of an aqueous extract of Eucalyptus microcorys on the detachment of enteropathogenic E. coli cells previously adhered on polythene surface. The results showed that the extract causes a detachment of cells adhered and the importance of detachment depends on incubation duration of substrate in the plant extract solution. The higher value of <b>detached</b> <b>cell</b> abundance, after 3 hours duration of cell adhesion process (DCAP), was 8. 72 (Ln (CFU/cm 2)) and the percentage of detached cells reached value of 11. 2 % when the bacteria cells were harvested from the lag growth phase. For cells coming from exponential growth phase, after 9 h of DCAP, the abundance of cells detached reached value of 8. 95 (Ln (CFU/cm 2)) and the higher percentage of detached cells was 68. 8 %. The values of 48. 5 % and 55. 6 % were noted when cells harvested from stationary and decline growth phases respectively. The cell detachment process observed could be due to the presence of some secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, triterpenoids, alkaloids, tannins which can disrupt physicochemical characteristics of bacteria surface.

Bioluminescence in this strain was mediated by a construction containing the entire lux operon from Photorhabdus luminescens. An excellent correlation between bioluminescence and classical plate count data was obtained when we compared attachment profiles, biocide concentration exponents, and thermal inactivation D values (D value {{was the time}} required for a 10 -fold {{reduction in the number}} of survivors). Biocide challenge of surface-adherent S. enteritidis resulted in concentration exponents that were experimentally indistinguishable from those obtained with Luria-Bertani broth-grown planktonic cells. It appears that cleansing regimes developed by using planktonic cell data are effective against surface-attached cells of this bacterium.

40|$|Methylcellulose (MC), a {{water-soluble}} polymer {{derived from}} cellulose, was investigated {{as a possible}} temporary substrate having thermo-responsive properties favorable for cell culturing. MC-based hydrogels were prepared by a dispersion technique, mixing MC powder (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12  % w/v) with selected salts (sodium sulphate, Na 2 SO 4), sodium phosphate, calcium chloride, or phosphate buffered saline, to evaluate the influence of different compositions on the thermo-responsive behavior. The inversion {{test was used to}} determine the gelation temperatures of the different hydrogel compositions; thermo-mechanical properties and thermo-reversibility of the MC hydrogels were investigated by rheological analysis. Gelation temperatures and rheological behavior depended on the MC concentration and type and concentration of salt used in hydrogel preparation. In vitro cytotoxicity tests, performed using L 929 mouse fibroblasts, showed no toxic release from all the tested hydrogels. Among the investigated compositions, the hydrogel composed of 8  % w/v MC with 0. 05  M Na 2 SO 4 had a thermo-reversibility temperature at 37  °C. For that reason, this formulation was thus considered to verify the possibility of inducing in vitro spontaneous detachment of cells previously seeded on the hydrogel surface.

In manufacturing plants detached clumps entering a process stream decrease product quality. Two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a wild type (PAO 1) and a cell signaling mutant (JP 1), were studied to (i) quantify and model detachment patterns and (ii) determine the influence of cell signaling on detachment. We collected effluent from a biofilm flowthrough reactor and determined the size distribution for cell detachment events by microscopic examination and image analysis. The two strains were similar in terms of both biofilm structure and detachment patterns. Most of the detachment events were single-cell events; however, multiple-cell detachment events contributed a large fraction of the total detached cells. The rates at which events containing multiple cells detached from the biofilm were estimated by fitting a statistical model to the size distribution data. For events consisting of at least 1, 000 cells, the estimated rates were 4. 5 events mm− 2 min− 1 for PAO 1 and 4. 3 events mm− 2 min− 1 for JP 1.

40|$|Cell shape profoundly affects {{cellular}} metabolic activity, {{protein and}} nucleic acid synthesis, and cytoskeletal organization. To examine {{the influence of}} cell shape on protein expression, normal rat kidney (NRK) cells {{were exposed to the}} microfilament-disrupting drug cytochalasin D (CD), labelled with [35 S]methionine, and newly synthesized cellular and cytoskeletal proteins examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. CD produced dramatic changes in cell shape (from a flat to round phenotype) with concomitant 3 - 7 -fold increases in the cellular content and cytoskeletal deposition of the microfilament-associated proteins actin, alpha-actinin, and tropomyosin isoform 1. Augmented actin protein content in NRK/CD cells was paralleled by a corresponding increase in actin mRNA abundance and was inhibited by prior addition of actinomycin D. A detergent-insoluble protein of 52 kDa was also detected at high levels in the cytoskeletal fraction of NRK/CD cells. Two-dimensional electrophoretic mapping of total cellular and cytoskeletal proteins revealed this 52 kDa protein to be the previously described glycoprotein p 52 [Higgins & Ryan (1989) Biochem. J. 257, 173 - 182]. By using electrophoretic and immunochemical criteria, p 52 was identified as plasminogen-activator inhibitor type- 1 (PAI- 1). Like actin, CD-induced p 52 (PAI- 1) synthesis, cellular content, and partitioning to the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal compartment reflected a corresponding increase in p 52 (PAI- 1) mRNA. Such induction was similarly inhibited by actinomycin D. p 52 (PAI- 1) expression in the NRK-cell system is thus responsive to CD-mediated shape changes and requires ongoing RNA synthesis for its induction. Differential extraction of <b>detached</b> <b>cell</b> bodies and the substrate-adherent 'remnant' fraction of NRK/CD cultures, furthermore, indicated that p 52 (PAI- 1) was not an intrinsic internal cytoskeletal element but, rather, selectively localized to the extracellular residue. p 52 (PAI- 1) retained its detergent-insoluble characteristics even in this isolated 'remnant' fraction, where it was also the predominant protein species resolved...|$|E
40|$|Background. Microparticles (MP) from endothelial cells (endothelial microparticles; EMP) {{circulate}} in disease states, but {{the processes}} such as apoptosis or cell activation underlying their release are unclear. Objectives: We investigated whether adherent (viable) or <b>detached</b> (apoptotic) endothelial <b>cells</b> are the possible source of EMP in vitro, i. e. under control and interleukin (IL) - 1 α activation conditions, and in vivo. Methods: Adherent and <b>detached</b> endothelial <b>cells,</b> and EMP, were isolated from human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures (n = 6), treated without or with IL- 1 α (5 ng mL(- 1); 24 h). Cell fractions were analyzed by flow cytometry for annexin V binding., propidium iodide (PI) and caspase 3 staining (n = 3). Caspase 3 in EMP was studied using Western blot (n = 6) and flow cytometry (n = 6). Plasma from healthy subjects and systemic lupus erythematosus patients (both n = 3) were analyzed for caspase 3 -containing (E) MP. Results: Detached but not adherent cells double-stained for annexin V and PI, confirming the apoptotic conditions of the <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> and the viable nature of the adherent cells. Caspase 3 was solely present in the <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> and procaspase 3 in the adherent cells. Caspase 3 was present in EMP from both control and IL= 1 α-treated cultures. Counts of EM P and <b>detached</b> <b>cells,</b> but not adherent cells, highly correlated (r = 0. 959, P < 0. 0001). In vivo circulating MP from nucleated (endothelial cells, monocytes) and anucleated cells (platelets, erythrocytes) contained caspase 3. Conclusions: EMP contain caspase 3 and may be mainly derived from <b>detached</b> (apoptotic) endothelial <b>cells</b> in vitro. The presence of caspase 3 in MP from anucleated cell types, however, suggests that its presence {{may not necessarily be}} related to apoptosis in vivo but may be associated with caspase 3 activation unrelated to apoptosi...|$|R

Recently, circulating (<b>detached)</b> endothelial <b>cells</b> and endothelial microparticles (EMP) {{have been associated}} with endothelial functioning in vitro and in vivo. We investigated whether simvastatin affects endothelial detachment and release of EMP. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with clinically relevant concentrations of simvastatin (1. 0 and 5. 0 microM), with or without mevalonic acid (100 microM) or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP; 20 microM) for 24 hours, and analyzed by flowcytometry and Western blot. Simvastatin at 1. 0 and 5. 0 microM increased cell detachment from 12. 5 +/- 4. 1 % to 26. 0 +/- 7. 6 % (p= 0. 013) and 28. 9 +/- 2. 2 % (p= 0. 002) as well as EMP release (p= 0. 098 and p= 0. 041, respectively). The majority of <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> was apoptotic, although the fraction of <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> that showed signs of apoptosis (> 70 %) was unaffected by simvastatin. <b>Detached</b> <b>cells</b> and EMP contained caspase 3 and caspase 8, but not caspase 9. Restoring either cholesterol biosynthesis and prenylation (mevalonate) or prenylation alone (GGPP) reversed all simvastatin-induced effects on cell detachment and EMP release. Adherent cells showed no signs of simvastatin-induced apoptosis. Simvastatin promotes detachment and EMP release by inhibiting prenylation, presumably via a caspase 8 -dependent mechanism.

The <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> cannot reattach to VN unless their surface integrins are first activated by treatment with MnCl 2. Immunoprecipitation and subcellular fractionation experiments reveal that PAI- 1 treatment triggers deactivation and disengagement of uPA–uPAR–integrin complexes and their endocytic clearance by the low density lipoprotein receptor–related protein. Transfection experiments demonstrate that efficient cell detachment by PAI- 1 requires an excess of matrix-engaged uPA–uPAR–integrin complexes over free engaged integrins and that changes in this ratio alter the efficacy of PAI- 1. Together, these results suggest a VN-independent, uPA–uPAR-dependent mechanism by which PAI- 1 induces cell detachment. This pathway may represent a general mechanism, since PAI- 1 also can <b>detach</b> <b>cells</b> from fibronectin and type- 1 collagen.

40|$|In young pollen {{grains of}} Datura innoxia, {{a wall of}} the usual {{hemispherical}} type separates the 2 gametophytic cells initially and, in the electron microscope, appears as an electron-translucent matrix which is contiguous with the intine. Before detachment of the generative cell from the intine, the matrix decreases in thickness and in places is dispersed altogether leaving the pla 8 malemmae {{on either side of}} it in close apposition. A particularly prominent zone, triangular in profile, is left where the wall joins with the intine. After detachment of the cell, remnants of the matrix can be seen distributed irregularly around the cell and it is supposed that these are partly derived from material in the triangular zone as the cell is drawn away from the intine. The wall residues persist throughout the maturation phase of the pollen and are considered to be either callose resulting from incomplete digestion of the initial wall, or some other polysaccha-ride material which is unevenly laid down along the wall and concentrated at the junction with the intine. In pollen induced into embryogenesis by anther culture, wall material is also distributed irregularly around the <b>detached</b> <b>cell</b> in a series of discrete zones, but these are more extensive than in vivo, closer together and in many instances highly dilated. The wall profiles thus have a beaded appearance, the 'beads ' being connected together by short links of the 2 apposed plasmalemmae. The contents of the swollen zones have a similar electron density to that of the matrix in vivo but also show traces of a fibrillar component. It is postulated that this unusual swelling is a prelude to dispersal of the wall by disruption of the plasmalemmal links and to the establishment of cytoplasmic continuity between the 2 cells. The significance of such binucleate pollen grains in the formation of non-haploid embryos is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{instigation}} was {{to develop}} thermoresponsive polymer films for cell culture use. Conventional cell detachment methods involve the use of proteolytic enzymes, such as trypsin, or mechanical scrapping. These detachment methods yield either individual cells or cell clusters, neither of which is attractive from a tissue engineering perspective. Temperature controlled cell detachment via thermoresponsive polymer films is an attractive alternative, as upon temperature reduction below the chosen polymers lower critical solution temperature (LCST) the polymer film will either swell or dissolve facilitating the detachment of a cell sheet with intact cell-cell junctions. This work describes the use of physical adsorption {{as a method of}} thermoresponsive film preparation. Physical adsorption is routinely used to coat surfaces with cell adhesion promoters and {{it is one of the}} simplest methods available for altering surface properties. Four polymers were used in this study; (1) poly N-(isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm), (2) NIPAm-co-N-tertbutylacrylamide (NtBAm), (3) NIPAm-co-acrylamidobenzophenone (AcBzPh) and (4) NIPAm-co-NtBAm-co-AcBzPh. These were chosen due to their unique advantages: (1) polymerization circumvention, (2 and 4) hydrophobicity and (3 and 4) crosslinking capability. Polymer films were formed both above and below the LCST in order to determine whether or not the temperature induced changes in the polymersâ conformation affected the filmâs physical and chemical properties and their ability to successfully host cells. The physically adsorbed filmâs roughness, thickness, percentage composition and wettability were determined. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were seeded on the prepared films and cell viability was assessed qualitatively using light microscopy and quantitatively using cell viability assays. Electron microscopy was used to investigate the <b>detached</b> <b>cell</b> sheets. The cell culture potential of a new class of thermoresponsive copolymers was investigated.

40|$|Today, human {{influenza}} vaccines are still mainly produced in embryonated henâs eggs. However, strong efforts are put into the development of cell culture-based vaccine production systems to overcome limitations and drawbacks of this production system. In cell culture-based vaccine production cellular physiology during infection is of great importance for process characterization and subsequent optimization approaches. The use of flow cytometry offers a powerful tool to monitor and correlate several physiological parameters on a single-cell level. Here, we present flow cytometric data on the replication of human influenza A virus in adherent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in lab-scale stirred-tank bioreactors. Physiological parameters of interest are apoptosis, status of infection and viral nucleoprotein content per cell. For the quantification of cellular infection status and content of viral nucleoprotein in the host-cells we established a sensitive immunocytometric detection method. In contrast to virus titration methods, this single cell-based immunocytometry is independent of dilution series {{and the number of}} infected cells. This is of interest especially in case of vaccine production processes, which are typically initiated at low multiplicities of infection. Apoptotic cell death occurring during virus propagation was measured via DNA strand breaks and pancaspase activity. Results obtained from monitoring vaccine production processes confirm a close correlation of apoptosis and influenza virus infection. Separate analysis of adherent and <b>detached</b> <b>cell</b> populations showed strong differences regarding status of infection and degree of apoptosis. The extend of apoptosis induction was found to be strongly dependent on culture conditions during the virus propagation phase. Based on these results, options to influence cell physiology to increase overall virus yields are being investigated.

The <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited the full spectrum of apoptotic changes, whereas the attached cells only showed activation of caspase- 3 -like proteases but not PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation, nor release of DNA fragments to the cytoplasm. Activation of caspases in the attached cells was several-fold lower and occurred at a later time (ie, 24 vs 12 hours) compared to the <b>detached</b> <b>cells.</b> In the <b>detached</b> <b>cells,</b> caspase activation was first detected at 12 hours and peaked at 36 hours, whereas PARP cleavage was first detected at 24 hours and was completed prior to 72 hours.

In summary, in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, caspase activation was followed with a 12 -hour lag time by PARP cleavage, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and release of DNA-histone complex to the cytoplasm. There was no detectable lag time between PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. The observation that only the <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> but not the attached cells showed the full spectrum of apoptotic changes suggests that detachment is either a part of the initiation execution phases of apoptosis and or is required for their completion...|$|R

After the steady-state biofilm was reached, the mechanisms of the interfacial cell detachment (at the biofilm-liquid interface) were determined. It was established that (i) the hydrophobicity of immobilized sessile cells (parent cells) increased (from 50 to 80 %) as the dilution rate increased, while the hydrophobicity of <b>detached</b> suspended <b>cells</b> (daughter cells) remained constant (about 45 %); and (ii) the immediately <b>detached</b> suspended <b>cells</b> showed a synchronized growth in about three generations. These results indicate that (i) the immobilized sessile and suspended <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> grew synchronically at the end and at the beginning of the cell cycle, respectively; and (ii) the hydrophobicity difference of immobilized sessile and suspended <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> permitted the cells detachment. Therefore, it is probable that independent of shear stress (due to recirculated flow), the synchronized growth and hydrophobicity of cells (which vary during the cell cycle) are the main factors permitting the {{maintenance of}} a steady-state xenobiotic-degrading biofilm reactor (in which the overall accumulation of biofilm is determined by the average growth rate of the biofilm cells minus the rate of detachment of cells from the biofilm) ...|$|R
40|$|JM 216, an oral {{platinum}} drug {{entering into}} phase III clinical trial, exhibited comparable cytotoxicity to cisplatin in three human ovarian carcinoma cell lines: the sensitive (CH 1), acquired resistant (CH 1 cisR) and intrinsically resistant (SKOV- 3). Platinum accumulation and binding to DNA {{were similar in}} each of the three cell lines at equimolar doses, indicating that the resistant cell lines could tolerate higher intracellular platinum levels and platinum bound to DNA at IC 50 concentrations of drug. Comparison with cisplatin demonstrated that intracellular platinum levels were marginally higher with JM 216, but that platinum binding to DNA was similar for the two drugs {{in each of the}} cell lines. Each of the cell lines exhibited an ability to repair JM 216 induced platinum/DNA lesions in the N-ras gene (gene-specific repair) at equitoxic concentrations of drug. However, this occurred to a greater extent in the two resistant cell lines such that by 24 h the CH 1 cisR and SKOV- 3 had removed 72 % and 67 % respectively compared with approximately 32 % for the CH 1. Reduced gene-specific repair capacity in CH 1 cells was also seen following incubation with 25 μM (or 5 μM – 2 × IC 50) cisplatin, whereas the CH 1 cisR and SKOV- 3 cell lines were repair proficient. JM 216 induced apoptosis in the three cell lines following a 2 h incubation with 2 × the IC 50 of drug. Fluorescent microscopy of cells stained with propidium iodide showed that the <b>detached</b> <b>cell</b> population displayed typical apoptotic nuclei. Furthermore, field inversion gel electrophoresis demonstrated the presence of DNA fragments approximately 23 – 50 kb in size, indicative of apoptosis, in the detached cells. JM 216 induced an S phase slow down {{in each of the three}} cell lines accompanied by a G 2 block in the CH 1 pair. Incubation with this concentration of JM 216 also resulted in the induction of p 53 in the CH 1 and CH 1 cisR. These studies suggest that the relative sensitivity of the CH 1 cell line to cisplatin and JM 216 is at least partly attributable to a deficiency in gene-specific repair. The oral platinum drug, JM 216, exerts its cytotoxic effects through the induction of apoptosis following a slow-down in S phase in both the sensitive and resistant lines. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer�s disease (AD) is {{the most}} common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder affecting cognitive functions of the brain, and is pathologically characterized by extracellular Amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are the main pathological features of AD. Amyloid-beta, the main protein constituent of Amyloid plaques, is derived from the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by proteolytic processing. APP is a type I transmembrane protein, which resembles a cell surface receptor, and consists of a large ectodomain and a short cytoplasmic tail. While Abeta generation from APP is well investigated, the physiological function of APP is still incompletely understood. Nevertheless, a diverse set of APP functions has been proposed, including cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and intracellular signalling. In this study, the cell adhesion properties of APP and its mammalian paralogues, APLP 1 and APLP 2, were investigated in vivo and in vitro. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, {{it has been shown that}} expression of APP, APLP 1, or APLP 2 in the Drosophila wing leads to cell adhesion defects, which was evident from <b>detached</b> <b>cell</b> layers and incomplete wing development. It was further revealed that the induced, so called blistered wing phenotype depends on the extracellular domain and membrane anchoring of APP, and the phenotype is additionally modulated by proteolytic conversion of APP. Interestingly, the most pronounced defects in wing development were caused by overexpression of APLP 2, which were shown to be caused by interference of APLP 2 with Wingless signaling via genetic interaction with the Drosophila Glypican Dally. Furthermore, using the Drosophila model organism, genetic interactions of the APP intracellular domain with two novel putative interaction partners, Numb and Disabled- 2, were identified. The interacting domain of APP was mapped, and binding was verified by biochemical analysis. The results obtained with the Drosophila model system for cell adhesion properties of APP family proteins were extended to an in vitro cell aggregation assay, where APP, APLP 1, or APLP 2 were shown to mediate homo- and heterotypic cell interaction. The intercellular interaction of APP family proteins is highly specific, as a mutant of APP lacking the extracellular domain failed to promote cell clustering. These data strongly suggest that APP family proteins form trans-dimers and contribute to cellular interactions via formation of homo- and heterotypic, trans-cellular complexes. Interestingly, the in vivo phenotype strength induced by APP family proteins in Drosophila correlates with the cell aggregation data, suggesting that trans-cellular interaction of APP family proteins is crucial for both phenomena. Additionally, APLP 1 and APLP 2 were shown to mediate cellular uptake of their corresponding secreted fragments, supporting a hitherto not observed receptor-like function. Moreover, a genetic interdependence and molecular interaction of APP and APLP 1 in synaptically enriched membrane compartments was found in this study, corroborating a functional role for APP family proteins in the connectivity of pre- and postsynaptic membranes. Taken together, previously not described homo- and hetero-trans-dimerization of APP family proteins seems to be involved in cell adhesion and represents an important feature required for their physiological function...|$|E
40|$|Endothelial cell {{cultures}} contain caspase 3 -containing microparticles (EMP), {{which are}} reported to form during or after cell detachment. We hypothesize that also adherent endothelial cells release EMP, thus protecting these cells from caspase 3 accumulation, detachment and apoptosis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were incubated with and without inhibitors of microparticle release (Y- 27632, calpeptin), both in the absence or presence of additional "external stress", i. e. the apoptotic agent staurosporin (200 nM) or the activating cytokine interleukin (IL) - 1 alpha (5 ng/ml). Control cultures contained mainly viable adherent cells and minor fractions of apoptotic <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> and microparticles {{in the absence of}} inhibitors. In the presence of inhibitors, caspase 3 accumulated in adherent cells and detachment tended to increase. During incubation with either staurosporin or IL- 1 alpha in the absence of inhibitors of microparticle release, adherent cells remained viable, and detachment and EMP release increased slightly. In the presence of inhibitors, dramatic changes occurred in staurosporin-treated cultures. Caspase 3 accumulated in adherent cells and > 90 % of the <b>cells</b> <b>detached</b> within 48 hours. In IL- 1 alpha-treated cultures no accumulation of caspase 3 was observed in adherent cells, although detachment increased. Scanning electron microscopy studies confirmed the presence of EMP on both adherent and <b>detached</b> <b>cells.</b> Prolonged culture of <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> indicated a rapid EMP formation as well as some EMP formation at longer culture periods. Inhibition of EMP release causes accumulation of caspase 3 and promotes cell detachment, although the extent depends on the kind of "external stress". Thus, the release of caspase 3 -containing microparticles may contribute to endothelial cell surviva...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure chondrocytes {{detachment}} from cellularized constructs cultured in a perfusion bioreactor, and to evaluate the effect of different scaffold coatings on cell adhesion under a fixed flow rate. The scaffolds were polyurethane foams, treated to promote cell attachment and seeded with human chondrocytes. In a preliminary static culture experiment, the scaffolds were imbibed with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and then cultured for 4 weeks. To quantify cell detachment, the number of <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> from the scaffold treated with FBS was estimated under different interstitial perfusion flow rates and shear stress levels (0. 005 mL/min equivalent to 0. 05 mPa, 0. 023 mL/min equivalent to 0. 23 mPa, and 0. 045 mL/min equivalent to 0. 45 mPa). Finally, groups of scaffolds differently treated (FBS, plasma plus FBS, plasma plus collagen type I) were cultured under a fixed perfusion rate of 0. 009 mL/min, equivalent to a shear stress of 0. 09 mPa, and the <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> were counted. Static cultivation showed that cell proliferation increased with time and matrix biosynthesis decreased after the first week of culture. Perfused culture showed that the number of <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> increased with the perfusion rate on FBS-treated constructs. The plasma-treated/collagen-coated scaffolds showed the highest resistance to cell detachment. To minimize cell detachment, the perfusion rate must be maintained in the order of 0. 02 mL/min, giving a shear stress of 0. 2 mPa. Our set-up allowed estimating the resistance to cell detachment under interstitial perfusion in a repeatable manner, to test other scaffold coatings and cell type...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Preparation of viable cultured adult cardiomyocytes (vARCs) is a {{prerequisite}} for cell-based transplantation and tissue engineering. Ectopic gene expression is important in this context. Here, we present an in vitro cell replating strategy using Accutase™ for cultured vARCs, allowing ectopic gene expression. Methods: Cultured vARCs from 6 - to 8 -week-old rats were used. Transfections with EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) constructs, Mlc- 3 f-EGFP or α-actinin-EGFP were performed using adenovirus-enhanced transferrin-mediated infection (AVET). Accutase™ (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria) was used for the detachment of cultured cells. Immunohistochemical analysis, together with confocal laser microscopy was used for structural analysis of the cells. Results: Cultured vARCs could be detached with a high yield (40 to 60 %) from primary cultures using Accutase™. The cultivation period {{plays an important role in}} the yield of viable cells. Resultant replated vARCs (rep-vARCs) rapidly (1 - 2 h) acquired a rounded up shape without degradation of their contractile apparatus, which is in contrast to the rod-shaped freshly isolated vARCs (fi-vARCs). The <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> survived passage through a narrow syringe needle. After seeding, <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> rapidly attached to various substrates, increased their content of the contractile apparatus, and formed cell-cell contacts within 3 days after reseeding. The <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> survived passage through a narrow syringe needle. The high recovery of cells after replating enabled the use of the AVET system for gene delivery. AVET is free of infectious particles and does not lead to expression of viral proteins. Transfection of vARCs prior to detachment had a small effect on cell recovery and ectopically synthesized proteins were properly localized after replating. Conclusions: Detachment of cultured vARCs using Accutase™ is well compatible with ectopic gene expression and yields a viable transgenic population of vARCs that eventually may be suitable as transgenic cardiomyocyte graft...|$|R

40|$|International audienceExposure of {{epithelial}} respiratory {{cells to}} the alkylating agent, mechlorethamine (HN 2), induces anoikis initiated by mitochondrial depolarization and caspase- 2 activation. The mechanisms of disruption of cell interactions were investigated and expression of integrins, E-cadherin, and actin were therefore studied after HN 2 treatment. In the adherent cells, an early disruption of F-actin occurred associated with cell rounding. Inhibitors of caspase- 2 resulted in attenuating {{of the decline}} of adhesion proteins and microfilaments. HN 2 -induced down-regulation of beta 1 integrin, E-cadherin expression and F-actin pattern occurred in <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> but were efficiently prevented by inhibitors of mitochondrial permeabilization. Moreover, inhibiting mitochondrial depolarization improved significantly both cell survival and capacity of <b>detached</b> <b>cells</b> to re-adhere. These findings confirm the pro-survival integrins and E-cadherin mediated signalling pathway. The central role of mitochondria in HN 2 -induced cell detachment is reinforced, suggesting that mitochondria acts as a key executor of reduced cell adherence during anoikis and could be responsible of an inside-out signalling. Present data support the potential of these therapeutics, generated via the inhibition of mitochondrial depolarization, as protectors against the alkylating agent lesions...|$|R
