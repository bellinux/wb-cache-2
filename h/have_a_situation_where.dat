For instance, Tibor Scitovsky demonstrated that the Kaldor criterion alone is not antisymmetric: it's possible to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> an outcome A is an improvement (according to the Kaldor criterion) over outcome B, but B is also an improvement over A.

25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E
500|$|It is {{very unusual}} {{to find a}} helmet of this type on a native {{ceremonial}} site. It was probably made between 25 and 50 AD, close to {{the date of the}} conquest of Britain in 43 AD; this makes it one of the earliest Roman helmets ever found in Britain. Other British examples of later date were found in isolation away from settlements, as in the cases of the Guisborough Helmet and Crosby Garrett Helmet, or on Roman sites, as with the Newstead Helmet. Various suggestions have been put forward as to why the helmet ended up at Hallaton; it may have been owned by a Briton who served in the Roman cavalry, {{it may have been a}} diplomatic gift from the Romans or it may have been captured in war. According to Dr Jeremy Hill of the British Museum, the first explanation is the most likely: [...] "Here you probably <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> local Britons are fighting on the Roman side." [...] The Roman cavalry at this time was mostly recruited from native allies, not Italians, suggesting that Britons fought alongside the Romans as they carried out their conquest of Britain.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{reshuffle}} of the ministry, Rudd demoted Garrett as Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts. This demotion was {{in response}} to Garrett's administration of the Home Insulation Program (HIP) that was linked to four deaths, over 100 house fires and allegations of fraud. It was revealed in May 2010 that Garrett had written to Prime Minister Rudd on four occasions raising concerns about safety. Further to this, following the 2010 Labor leadership spill, Gary Gray was reported to believe that Garrett was demoted because [...] "Rudd had a shocking interview on The 7.30 Report and needed a scapegoat". Gray stated:The majority of caucus felt he had been badly treated. For Rudd and his office to position Garrett as the fall guy was disgraceful, weak, sneaky, unprincipled and just plain wrong. All along, Peter properly put his objections to the administration of the program on the record. How can you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> Rudd executes complete and total influence, micromanages everything, yet not the home insulation program?

Napolitano's questions were critical of the airlines' plans to impose self-regulation in response to recent customer service controversies. As the founder and Chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Napolitano further asked whether the Airlines provide mental health services to their employees because of the stressful nature of flight attendant jobs and the increasing demands that airline companies put on flight attendants. Mr. William J. McGee, the country’s foremost expert and advocate on consumer rights as the Aviation Consultant for Consumers Union responded that this was “an excellent question because… right now we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> employees are under tremendous strain because of the executive decisions that are putting flight attendants in {{the front lines of}} many of these situations.
