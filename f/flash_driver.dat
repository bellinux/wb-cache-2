The main gas pipe on the leading coach was broken off in the impact, and the entire contents of the pressurised gas cylinders escaped in under two minutes. The gas then ignited in a single <b>flash.</b> <b>Driver</b> Bath had been injured in the leg but made his way on foot to the Ais Gill signal box {{a mile and a}} half north to summon help. The signalman there (Benjamin Bellas) sent another light engine under driver Judd, with Bath, along the up line. Judd attempted to put out the fire by bucketing water from his tender. Another light engine had been sent from Hawes Junction and its crew tried to drag the rear coaches away from the fire but could move only the brake vans at the rear of the train. The six leading coaches were immovable. The engine crews and the express train's guards, the sleeping car attendants, some platelayers from a hut a short distance up the line and a shepherd whose home was nearby tried desperately to rescue the trapped passengers but were eventually driven back by thick smoke. Because a strong wind was fanning the flames, the fire could not be extinguished and all six coaches were burned out.|$|E

We present the Coffee file system for flash-based sensor devices. Coffee provides a programming interface for building efficient and portable storage abstractions. Unlike previous flash file systems, Coffee uses a small and constant RAM footprint per file, making it scale elegantly with workloads consisting of large files or many files. In addition, the performance overhead of Coffee is low: the throughput is at least 92 % of the achievable direct <b>flash</b> <b>driver</b> throughput. We show that network layer components such as routing tables and packet queues can be implemented on top of Coffee, leading to increased performance and reduced memory requirements for routing and transport protocols.

40|$|While it is {{essential}} to exploit in-network processing in wireless sensor networks in order to save bandwidth and energy, we are constrained by the limited storage available in off-the-shelf sensor devices. NAND flash memory has great potential for extending storage capacity for sensor applications. Since each sensor platform is typically equipped with limited main memory and sensor data, as well as the fact that queries are temporal, existing flash index or file systems for general portable devices are not suitable for sensor networks. We propose Time-Log Tree (TL-Tree), a novel unbalanced and cascaded structure, that takes advantage of available flash capacity while making use of the time-series property as a primary feature for optimizing both memory and energy constraints. Extensive experiments show TL-Tree’s ability to utilize both flash capacity and temporal locality to support sensor data processing. Compared to other schemes, it achieves much better access and energy savings for different kinds of random and temporal range queries. In addition, TL-Tree can also be easily extended to support value-based queries. We have developed a hardware board that includes a raw 128 MB NAND flash chip on MicaZ mote. We have also implemented a <b>flash</b> <b>driver</b> and the TL-Tree to demonstrate the practicality of this idea...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A video {{transmission}} system generally {{consists of three}} main parts: A video data acquisition unit, transmission networks and play back terminals. The video data acquisition unit {{is one of the}} main parts. This paper focuses on an embedded video data acquisition hardware and software design. In the design, a PXA 310 is used as a primary processor. The software design is based on an Android operating system. First, the paper briefly introduces the hardware design including overall scheme and the selection of key components. Then, the software design of the video data acquisition unit is introduced more detail, which includes the transplant of an Android operating system and the application software implementations for video data acquisition and processing. The modifications of BLOB boot program, the modifications of the operating system kernel and the NAND <b>FLASH</b> <b>driver</b> transplantation are described in more detail. The description of the video data acquisition software design includes the use of the Android internal class “Mediarecorder”, the method of extracting frame data according to 3 GP and H. 264 protocol, and the use of the socket interface to transmit frame data to a 3 G wireless network called TD-SCDMA. The designed acquisition unit has been tested in a video surveillance and monitoring system and the experiment results are given at the end of the paper. Copyright © 2013 IFSA...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of the Internet of Things (IoT) has increased the demand for networked, resource-constrained devices tremendously. Many of the devices used for IoT applications {{are designed to be}} resource-constrained, as they typically must be small, inexpensive, and powered by batteries. In this dissertation, we consider a number of challenges pertaining to these constraints: system support for energy efficiency; flash-based storage systems; programming, testing, and debugging; and safe and secure application execution. The contributions of this dissertation are made through five research papers addressing these challenges. Firstly, to enhance the system support for energy-efficient storage in resource-constrained devices, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the Coffee file system and the Antelope DBMS. Coffee provides a sequential write throughput that is over 92 % of the attainable <b>flash</b> <b>driver</b> throughput, and has a constant memory footprint for open files. Antelope is the first full-fledged relational DBMS for sensor networks, and it provides two novel indexing algorithms to enable fast and energy-efficient database queries. Secondly, we contribute a framework that extends the functionality and increases the performance of sensornet checkpointing, a debugging and testing technique. Furthermore, we evaluate how different data compression algorithms can be used to decrease the energy consumption and data dissemination time when reprogramming sensor networks. Lastly, we present Velox, a virtual machine for IoT applications. Velox can enforce application-specific resource policies. Through its policy framework and its support for high-level programming languages, Velox helps to secure IoT applications. Our experiments show that Velox monitors applications' resource usage and enforces policies with an energy overhead below 3 %. The experimental systems research conducted in this dissertation has had a substantial impact both in the academic community and the open-source software community. Several of the produced software systems and components are included in Contiki, one of the premier open-source operating systems for the IoT and sensor networks, and they are being used both in research projects and commercial products...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Flash {{memory has}} become {{virtually}} indispensable in most mobile devices. In order for mobile devices to operate successfully, {{it is essential}} that flash memory be controlled correctly through the device driver software. However, as is typical for embedded software, conventional testing methods often fail to detect hidden flaws in the complex device driver software. This deficiency incurs significant development and operation overhead to the manufacturers. In order to compensate for the weaknesses of conventional testing, we have applied NuSMV, Spin, and CBMC to verify the correctness of a multi-sector read operation of the Samsung OneNAND TM <b>flash</b> device <b>driver</b> and studied their relative strengths and weaknesses empirically. Through this project, we verified the correctness of the multi-sector read operation on a small scale. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using model checking techniques to verify the control algorithm of a device driver in an industrial setting. ...|$|R
