50|$|GSM-R is {{typically}} implemented using dedicated base station masts {{close to the}} railway, with tunnel coverage effected using directional antennae or 'leaky' feeder transmission. The distance between the base stations is 7-15 km. This creates {{a high degree of}} redundancy and higher availability and reliability. In Germany, Italy and France the GSM-R network has between 3,000 and 4,000 base stations. In areas where the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 2 or 3 is used, the train maintains a circuit switched <b>digital</b> <b>modem</b> connection to the train control centre at all times. This modem operates with higher priority than normal users (eMLPP). If the modem connection is lost, the train will automatically stop.|$|E

Most systems rely on the use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) because of its capability to elegantly cope with multipath interference. However, to evaluate the complete system, we should not only consider the <b>digital</b> <b>modem,</b> but also take into account the influence of the front-end. To that goal, we have set up a simulation environment which comprises both the <b>digital</b> <b>modem</b> and the most important front-end distortions. We show that for the same data rate, bandwidth and transmit power constraints Single-Carrier with Cyclic Prefix (SC-CP) allows the design of more power efficient modems than OFDM and is therefore a very suitable candidate for portable wireless modems...|$|E

40|$|Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) {{have evolved}} to a level where it is {{feasible}} for <b>digital</b> <b>modems</b> with relatively low data rates to be implemented entirely with software algorithms. With current technology it is still necessary for analogue processing between the RF input and a low frequency IF but, as DSP technology advances, it will become possible to shift the interface between analogue and digital domains ever closer towards the RF input. The software radio concept is a long-term goal which aims to realise software-based <b>digital</b> <b>modems</b> which are completely flexible in terms of operating frequency, bandwidth, modulation format and source coding. The ideal software radio cannot be realised until DSP, Analogue to Digital (A/D) and Digital to Analogue (D/A) technology has advanced sufficiently. Until these advances have been made, it is often necessary to sacrifice optimum performance {{in order to achieve}} real-time operation. This Thesis investigates practical real-time algorithms for carrier frequency synchronisation, symbol timing synchronisation, modulation, demodulation and FEC. Included in this work are novel software-based transceivers for continuous-mode transmission, burst-mode transmission, frequency modulation, phase modulation and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Ideal applications for this work combine the requirement for flexible baseband signal processing and a relatively low data rate. Suitable applications for this work were identified in low-cost satellite return links, and specifically in asymmetric satellite Internet delivery systems. These systems employ a high-speed (>> 2 Mbps) DVB channel from service provider to customer and a low-cost, low-speed (32 - 128 kbps) return channel. This Thesis also discusses asymmetric satellite Internet delivery systems, practical considerations for their implementation and the techniques that are required to map TCP/IP traffic to low-cost satellite return links...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} optimizing the burst format of packet transmission to perform enhanced-accuracy estimation of Doppler-shift and Doppler-rate of the carrier of the received signal, due to relative motion between the transmitter and the receiver. Two novel burst formats that minimize the Doppler-shift and the Doppler-rate Cramér-Rao bounds (CRB s) for the joint estimation of carrier phase/Doppler-shift and of the Doppler-rate are derived, and a data-aided (DA) estimation algorithm suitable for each optimal burst format is presented. Performance of the newly derived estimators is evaluated by analysis and by simulation, showing that such algorithms attain their relevant CRB s with very low complexity, {{so that they can}} be directly embedded into new-generation <b>digital</b> <b>modems</b> for satellite communications at low SNR.|$|R

40|$|All-digital {{approaches}} for the adjustment of timing offset in <b>digital</b> <b>modems</b> have attracted increasing attention. We recently announced a novel interpolation method which, instead of approximating the continuous-time signal with a conventional polynomial and computing the synchronized samples using a Farrow structure, uses a trigonometric polynomial. Simulation {{results indicate that}} improved performance, reduced computational delay and, in most cases, simplified hardware can be achieved. To recover a synchronized sample from existing samples, given a timing offset, we show here that we can optimize this method such that the interpolation error in the recovered sample is minimized for that specific timing offset value. Using this optimization technique, the overall interpolation error is reduced. As for the implementation, the optimal interpolator does not require additional hardware as compared to our original method. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this contribution, {{a design}} space {{exploration}} of the various possible schemes for alldigital symbol timing adjustment of QAM signals is made. The exploration is guided by both performance degradation and implementation cost considerations. The BER performance degradation is obtained using a quasianalytic simulation approach, while the implementation cost is estimated by high level digital circuit synthesis. The results show that a good performance/implementation tradeoff is obtained by using baseband interpolation with an oversampling factor of three and adequate compensation.

Baud rate phase samples from the baseband processor are decoded to yield the original data stream. The method of encoding onto the 16 -ary phase nodes, together with convolutional coding gain, results in near quad PSK (QPSK) performance.

30|$|We {{present the}} design of a {{wideband}} <b>digital</b> <b>modem</b> based on non-maximally decimated filter bank (NMDFB) with perfect reconstruction (PR) property. The PR-NMDFB contains an analysis filter bank (AFB) and a synthesis filter bank (SFB) whose efficient polyphase forms are named as polyphase analysis channelizer (PAC) and polyphase synthesis channelizer (PSC). The waveform being processed is the legacy square root Nyquist-shaped quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). In contrast to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the shaped QAM transmission has much superior performance properties in throughput, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and synchronization. We will show the PR-NMDFB is capable of efficiently performing several key tasks of a digital receiver with dramatic workload reduction. This includes digital filtering, carrier recovery, and symbol timing recovery. Moreover, the nature of NMDFB allows the signal processing to operate a significantly reduced sample rate, which is a desired characteristic for replacing current FIR implementation in wideband systems.|$|E
