40|$|Although the 4 th Railway Package was {{proposed}} by the European Commission in 2013, a consensus {{has not yet been}} reached. Recently, however, significant steps forward have been taken. Various stakeholders and prominent academics in the field gathered at the 9 th Florence Rail Forum to reflect upon the latest developments in the legislative process. Discussion at the Forum focused on the opening of competition in rail passenger transport and the changing role of the regulators at all levels. According to the provisions listed in the 4 th Railway Package, the tasks of the national regulatory authorities are likely to increase, and, inevitably, new challenges will arise. Regulators will play a crucial role when it comes to resolving two major issues: on the one hand, how to harmonise the openness of the market of commercial lines so as to guarantee fair and open access to the network in all EU countries for all operators; on the other hand, {{how to deal with the}} provision of services under Public Service Obligations (PSO) and how to differentiate between <b>directly</b> <b>awarded</b> contracts and competitive tendering for PSO lines...|$|E

This statement {{is based on a}} report we issued in July 2010, which discussed the extent to which Gulf Coast small businesses received federal contract funds for recovery efforts, with data on contract funds updated through fiscal year 2011 where possible. More specifically, the statement discusses (1) the amounts that small businesses nationwide and small businesses in four Gulf Coast states received directly from federal agencies through contracts for relief and recovery efforts related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; and (2) the extent to which four agencies [...] the U.

30|$|Gamification {{has gained}} a lot of {{attention}} in recent years as a possible way to foster students’ motivation and learning behavior. As a high drop-out rate is associated with distance learning, in particular with students often struggling to engage with the material, the implementation of gamification may support and enhance more successful online learning. A distance learning Bachelor degree class was selected as a case study to investigate the implementation of a Moodle-based gamification concept as well as different variables associated in using a mixed-methods-approach. Eight students were interviewed and 32 participated in an online survey. Significant positive correlations were found between students’ online learning readiness in the dimension of technical competencies and both types of autonomous motivation (identified and intrinsic motivation). A significant positive correlation was also found between self-reported attitudes towards gaming and the dimension of coping of study-satisfaction. As expected, students who indicated rather low online learning readiness tended to show non-autonomous motivation (amotivation). Surprisingly, some students reported autonomous motivation, despite having expressed a rather dismissive attitude towards playing online and computer games in general. Acquiring digital badges reportedly felt like appreciation <b>directly</b> <b>awarded</b> by the students’ instructor. Progress bars were positively evaluated and were accepted as a management tool for individual learning strategies.|$|E
