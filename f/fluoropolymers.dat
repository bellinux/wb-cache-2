5|$|About 180,000metrictons of <b>fluoropolymers</b> were {{produced}} in 2006 and 2007, generating over $3.5billion revenue per year. The global market {{was estimated at}} just under $6 billion in 2011 and was predicted to grow by 6.5% per year up to 2016. <b>Fluoropolymers</b> can only be formed by polymerizing free radicals.|$|E
5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other <b>fluoropolymers,</b> including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different <b>fluoropolymers</b> replace glass in solar cells.|$|E
5|$|Organofluorides consume over 20% of mined {{fluorite}} {{and over}} 40% of hydrofluoric acid, with refrigerant gases dominating and <b>fluoropolymers</b> increasing their market share. Surfactants are a minor application but generate over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenue. Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts. Electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride, and the Fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride.|$|E
40|$|Thermosetting <b>fluoropolymer</b> foams {{are made}} by mixing fluid form {{thermosetting}} <b>fluoropolymer</b> components having a substantial fluorine content, placing the mixture in a pressure tight chamber, filling the chamber with a gas, at relatively low pressure, that is unreactive with the <b>fluoropolymer</b> components, allowing the mixture to gel, removing the gelled <b>fluoropolymer</b> from the chamber and thereafter heating the <b>fluoropolymer</b> at a relatively low temperature to simultaneously sure and foam the <b>fluoropolymer.</b> The resulting <b>fluoropolymer</b> product is closed celled with the cells storing the gas employed for foaming. The <b>fluoropolymer</b> resins employed may be any thermosetting <b>fluoropolymer</b> including fluoroepoxies, fluoropolyurethanes and fluoroacrylates...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fluoropolymer</b> brushes {{are widely}} used to prevent nonspecific {{adsorption}} of commercial polymeric or biological materials due to their strongly hydrophobic character. Herein, a series of <b>fluoropolymer</b> brushes with different compositions, thicknesses and molecular architectures was prepared via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Subsequently, the antifouling properties of these <b>fluoropolymer</b> brushes against organic polymers were studied in detail using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements and polystyrene as a representative fouling polymer. Among all of the molecular architectures studied, homopolymerized methacrylate-based <b>fluoropolymer</b> brushes (PMAF 17) show the best antifouling properties. Annealing the <b>fluoropolymer</b> brushes improves the antifouling property dramatically due to the reregulated surface composition. These <b>fluoropolymer</b> brushes can be combined with, e. g., micro- and nanostructuring and other advanced materials properties to yield even better long-term antifouling behavior under harsh environments. </p...|$|R
5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other <b>fluoropolymers</b> retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
25|$|Organofluorine {{chemistry}} impacts {{many areas}} of everyday life and technology. The C-F bond is found in pharmaceuticals, agrichemicals, <b>fluoropolymers,</b> refrigerants, surfactants, anesthetics, oil-repellents, catalysis, and water-repellents, among others.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} use of {{hydrofluoric acid}} is in organofluorine chemistry. Many organofluorine compounds are prepared using HF as the fluorine source, including Teflon, <b>fluoropolymers,</b> fluorocarbons, and refrigerants such as freon.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFluoropolymer {{process aids}} (PPAs) are {{commonly}} used to eliminate melt fracture during the extrusion of polyolefins, and their performance may be quantified directly by measuring the <b>fluoropolymer</b> deposition rate on internal die surfaces, or indirectly by measuring the time needed for the PPA to eliminate melt fracture under {{a particular set of}} conditions. Historically, the performance of PPA has been considered optimal when the <b>fluoropolymer</b> enters the die in the form of small discrete particles, less than about 1 mm in diameter. Using both direct and indirect measurements, the present study shows that the reverse is true – performance improves when the PPA is more coarsely dispersed, so that <b>fluoropolymer</b> particles larger than about 2 mm in diameter enter the extrusion die. Based on these observations, a quantitative model of the <b>fluoropolymer</b> coating process is developed. The model fits the experimental data on <b>fluoropolymer</b> coating thickness as a function of <b>fluoropolymer</b> particle size and extrusion shear rate, and also provides insight on other aspects of the PPA coating process. These findings culminated {{in the development of the}} Z Technology PPAs, which use interfacial agents and a fluoroelastomer having a distinctly different rheology from the traditional fluoroelastomers in PPAs to deliver the large <b>fluoropolymer</b> particles needed to provide reliable, quick elimination of polyolefin melt fracture at low PPA usage levels...|$|R
40|$|Infrared {{waveguide}} spectroscopy using a sapphire rod {{coated with}} an amorphous <b>fluoropolymer</b> (Cytop, Asahi Glass Co., ltd, Japan) {{has been developed}} in order to directly observe CO 2 in aqueous solutions. Since the amorphous <b>fluoropolymer</b> has a relatively high gas-permeability and hydrophobic feature, the aqueous CO 2 transmits into the amorphous <b>fluoropolymer</b> coating film, but water cannot penetrate into the film. Good linearity of calibration curves for CO 2 in the gas and the aqueous solution were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Waterborne <b>fluoropolymer</b> {{emulsions}} were synthesized {{using the}} one-step semi-continuous seed emulsion polymerization of chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), vinyl acetate (VAc), n-butyl acrylate (BA), Veova 10, and acrylic acid (AA).

Characteristics of the polymer films such as thermal stability, glass transition temperature, film-forming properties, and IR spectrum were studied. Meanwhile, the weatherability of fluoride coatings formulated by the waterborne <b>fluoropolymer</b> and other coatings were evaluated by the quick ultraviolet (QUV) accelerated weathering test, and {{the results showed that}} the <b>fluoropolymer</b> with more than 12 % fluoride content possessed outstanding weather resistance.

25|$|A {{fluoropolymer}} is a fluorocarbon based polymer {{with multiple}} strong carbon–fluorine bonds. It {{is characterized by}} a high resistance to solvents, acids, and bases. <b>Fluoropolymers</b> were discovered in 1938 by Dr. Roy Plunkett when he accidentally polymerized tetrafluoroethylene to form polytetrafluoroethylene.|$|E
25|$|Other oxidizers besides oxygen {{can be used}} {{to produce}} a flame. Hydrogen burning in {{chlorine}} produces a flame and in the process emits gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl) as the combustion product. Another of many possible chemical combinations is hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide which is hypergolic and commonly used in rocket engines. <b>Fluoropolymers</b> {{can be used to}} supply fluorine as an oxidizer of metallic fuels, e.g. in the magnesium/teflon/viton composition.|$|E
25|$|Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (conjugate base perfluorooctanoate), {{also known}} as C8, is a {{synthetic}} perfluorinated carboxylic acid and fluorosurfactant. One industrial application is as a surfactant in the emulsion polymerization of <b>fluoropolymers.</b> It {{has been used in}} the manufacture of such prominent consumer goods as polytetrafluoroethylene (commercially known as Teflon). PFOA has been manufactured since the 1940s in industrial quantities. It is also formed by the degradation of precursors such as some fluorotelomers.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we studied}} {{influence}} of <b>fluoropolymer</b> thin film deposition on wettability of the silicon oxide nanowires array.

40|$|Amorphous <b>fluoropolymer</b> {{films have}} low {{dielectric}} constants and high chemical resistance and, so, have {{potential to be}} used as the insulator for high speed interconnects and as protection layers. Many applications would require high resolution patterning of the <b>fluoropolymer</b> film. We have found that these films are easily etched by reactive ion beam etching using an O 2 /Ar gas mixture. High etching rates of 600 nm/min with a 0. 2 mA/cm − 2, 500 eV ion beam were obtained. This technique allows good selectivity with typical underlayers such as Si, Au, and photoresist. We have also found that a short Ar ion milling of the <b>fluoropolymer</b> surface allows good wettability of the film by photoresist.

25|$|The {{most common}} type of optical glass is crown glass, which has an index of {{refraction}} of about 1.52. An optimal single-layer coating would have to be made of a material with an index of about 1.23. Unfortunately, there are no solid materials with such a low refractive index. The closest materials with good physical properties for a coating are magnesium fluoride, MgF2 (with an index of 1.38), and <b>fluoropolymers</b> (which can have indices as low as 1.30, but are more difficult to apply). MgF2 on a crown glass surface gives a reflectance of about 1%, compared to 4% for bare glass. MgF2 coatings perform much better on higher-index glasses, especially those with index of refraction close to 1.9. MgF2 coatings are commonly used because they are cheap, and when they are designed for a wavelength {{in the middle of the}} visible band, they give reasonably good anti-reflection over the entire band. Researchers have produced films of mesoporous silica nanoparticles with refractive indices as low as 1.12, which function as antireflection coatings.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two classes}} of {{non-toxic}} anti-fouling coatings. The most common class relies on low friction and low surface energies. Low surface energies result in hydrophobic surfaces. These coatings create a smooth surface which can prevent attachment of larger microorganisms. For example, <b>fluoropolymers</b> and silicone coatings are commonly used. These coatings are ecologically inert but have problems with mechanical strength and long-term stability. Specifically, after days biofilms (slime) can coat the surfaces which buries the chemical activity and allows microorganisms to attach. The current standard for these coatings is polydimethylsiloxane, or PDMS, which consists of a non-polar backbone made of repeating units of silicon and oxygen atoms. The non-polarity of PDMS allows for biomolecules to readily adsorb to its surface in order to lower interfacial energy. However, PDMS also has a low modulus of elasticity that allows {{for the release of}} fouling organisms at speeds of greater than 20 knots. The dependence of effectiveness on vessel speed prevents use of PDMS on slow-moving ships or those that spend significant amounts of time in port.|$|E
500|$|Large-scale {{production}} of elemental fluorine began during World War II. Germany used high-temperature electrolysis to make tons {{of the planned}} incendiary chlorine trifluoride and the Manhattan Project used huge quantities to produce uranium hexafluoride for uranium enrichment.

30|$|Application of <b>fluoropolymer</b> finish {{reduces the}} surface {{energy of the}} fabric and does not permit the water or other fluids to adsorb and spread on the fabric surface. The {{difference}} in water repellence is significant at 1 % and 4 % concentration level of <b>fluoropolymer,</b> but when the concentration level increases to 7 %, the difference is insignificant, which {{may be due to}} the fact that the <b>fluoropolymer</b> has already linked with functional groups of the polymer. 100 % polyester and polyester cotton fabrics treated with 4 % and 7 % fluorpolymer reach hydrostatic pressure level of more than 20  cm and therefore can be used for level 2 protection as per AAMI barrier classification, whereas 100 % cotton fabric can provide only level 1 protection even on application of 7 % <b>fluoropolymer</b> finish.|$|R

In PTFE processing, PFOA is in aqueous solution and forms micelles that contain tetrafluoroethylene and the growing polymer. PFOA can be used to stabilize fluoropolymer and fluoroelastomer suspensions before further industrial processing and in ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography it can act as an extraction agent.
