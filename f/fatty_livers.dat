40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Fatty</b> <b>liver</b> is {{associated}} with metabolic syndrome (MetS) {{but it may also}} occur without MetS. Whether resolution of <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> in the general population affects risk of MetS is unknown. Our aim was to determine whether a change in <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> status (either the development of new <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> or the resolution of existing <b>fatty</b> <b>liver)</b> would modify the risk of de novo MetS. METHODS:Two thousand eighty-nine people without hypertension, diabetes, and MetS were examined at baseline and at 5 -year follow-up using a retrospective cohort study design. <b>Fatty</b> <b>liver</b> status was assessed at baseline and at follow-up by ultrasonography. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for de novo MetS at follow-up were calculated controlling for the potential confounders, compared to the reference group (people who never had <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> at baseline and follow-up). RESULTS:During follow-up, <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> developed in 251 people and <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> resolved in 112 people. After the adjustment for multiple confounders, persisting <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> and incident <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> development were associated with de novo MetS, with aHR of 2. 60 (95 % CIs [1. 61, 4. 20]) and 3. 31 (95 % CIs [1. 99, 5. 51]), respectively. Risk of new MetS in resolved <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> group was attenuated with insignificant aHR of 1. 29 accompanying 95 % CIs of 0. 60 and 2. 80. DISCUSSION:Development or maintenance of <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> is positively associated with occurrence of new MetS. Resolution of <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> status has similar risk of de novo MetS with those who never had <b>fatty</b> <b>liver.</b> Therefore, cautious management is needed with those with <b>fatty</b> <b>liver...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{importance}} of LXRs in physiological lipid and cholesterol metabolism {{suggests that they}} may influence the development of metabolic disorders such as hyper lipidemia and atherosclerosis. Evidence for this idea has been observed by recent studies that linked LXR activity to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. LXRα knockout mice are healthy when fed with a low-cholesterol diet. However, LXRα knockout mice develop enlarged <b>fatty</b> <b>livers,</b> degeneration of liver cells, high cholesterol levels in liver, and impaired liver function when fed a high-cholesterol diet. LXRβ knockout mice are unaffected by a high-cholesterol diet, suggesting that LXRα and LXRβ have separate roles. LXRs regulate fatty acid synthesis by modulating the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). LXRs also regulate lipid homeostasis in the brain. LXRα and LXRβ double knockout mice develop neurodegenerative changes in brain tissue. LXRβ knockout mice results in adult-onset motor neuron degeneration in male mice.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} genes are {{involved}} in regulating lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and thereby affecting the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Among them is the gene responsible for sterol response element binding protein-1c or SREBP-1c (a membrane-bound transcription factor which can directly activate the expression of several genes involved in the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol, fatty acids, triglycerides and phospholipids). In mice models, overexpression of SREBP-1c led to <b>fatty</b> <b>livers,</b> hypertriglyceridemia, severe insulin resistance and finally type 2 diabetes mellitus. Later, SREBP-1c {{was identified as a}} candidate gene in the regulation of human insulin resistance. Two missense mutations in exons coding the aminoterminal transcriptional activating domain of SREBP-1c were found in individuals displaying severe insulin resistance. Another association was found between an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (C/T) between exons 18c and 19c and the onset of diabetes in men, but not in women. These studies suggest that mutations in SREBP-1c may increase the sensitivity to developing diabetes.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of variations in <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> on the ultrasonographic detection of focal liver lesions. Methods: A total of 229 patients with varying degrees of <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> and focal liver lesions and 200 patients with focal liver lesions but no <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> were randomly selected for inclusion in groups I and II, respectively. Findings of focal liver lesions identified on computed tomography were taken as the reference, and findings on ultrasonography were compared with them. Results: The number of focal liver lesions in groups I and II were 501 and 413, respectively. The ultrasonographic detection rates of focal liver lesions in groups I and II were 86. 8 % (435 / 501) and 94. 2 % (389 / 413), respectively. Comparison of the detection of the focal lesions between patients with and without <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> or different grades of <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> were as follows: mild <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (162 / 177) vs. liver without fat infiltration (389 / 413) (P= 0. 277); mild <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (162 / 177) vs. moderate <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (190 / 212) (P= 0. 604); mild <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (162 / 177) vs. severe <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (83 / 112) (P< 0. 001); moderate <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (190 / 212) vs. liver without fat infiltration (389 / 413) (P= 0. 051); moderate <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (190 / 212) vs. severe <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (83 / 112) (P< 0. 001); severe <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (83 / 112) vs. liver without fat infiltration (389 / 413) (P< 0. 001); and <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (435 / 501) vs. liver without fat infiltration (389 / 413) (P< 0. 001).

Regional and visceral abdominal fat were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging, and endogenous glucose production, whole-body glucose disposal during an insulin clamp, and NEFA concentrations were measured, along with NEFA suppression (percent (%) suppression and insulin sensitivity index for NEFA during an OGTT).

Since the prevalence of obesity is growing worldwide and in Iran, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> disease in obese children who were referred to pediatric clinic of Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran. METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 306 obese children aged 4 to 18 years was done. Demographic data, type of milk in infancy, weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure were recorded. Liver ultrasonography for sonographic evidence of <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> disease was performed and laboratory measurement including fasting blood glucose, insulin, serum lipid profile and liver enzymes was done. FINDINGS: In this study, 306 obese children (178 girls and 128 boys) {{with a mean age of}} 9. 55 Â± 3. 2 year enrolled. <b>Fatty</b> <b>liver</b> was diagnosed by ultrasound in 163 (53. 3) of children (92. 5 had grade 1 and 7. 5 grade 2 <b>fatty</b> <b>liver).</b> The average body mass index (BMI) was 24. 6 Â± 3. 3 in subjects without <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> and 27. 6 Â± 4. 6 in <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> grade 1, and 29. 6 Â± 4. 4 in <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> grade 2 subjects.

40|$|Hepatic {{steatosis}} {{may have}} a generally benign prognosis, either because most hepatocytes are not significantly injured or mechanisms to replace damaged hepatocytes are induced. To determine {{the relative importance of}} these mechanisms, we compared hepatocyte damage and replication in ethanol-fed and ob/ob mice with very indolent fatty liver disease to that of healthy control mice and PARP- 1 (-/-) mice with targeted disruption of the DNA repair enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Compared to the healthy controls, both groups with <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> had significantly higher serum alanine aminotransferase values, hepatic mitochondrial H(2) O(2) production, and hepatocyte oxidative DNA damage. A significantly smaller proportion of the hepatocytes from <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> entered S phase when cultured with mitogens. Moreover, this replicative senescence was not reversed by treating cultured hepatocytes with agents (i. e., betaine or leptin) that improve liver disease in intact ethanol-fed or leptin-deficient mice. Hepatocytes from PARP 1 (-/-) mice also had more DNA damage and reduced DNA synthesis in response to mitogens. However, neither mice with <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> nor PARP- 1 -deficient mice had atrophic livers. All of the mice with senescent mature hepatocytes exhibited hepatic accumulation of liver progenitor (oval) cells and oval cell numbers increased with the demand for hepatocyte replacement. Therefore, although hepatic oxidant production and damage are generally increased in <b>fatty</b> <b>livers,</b> expansion of hepatic progenitor cell populations helps to compensate for the increased turnover of damaged mature hepatocytes. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that induction of mechanisms to replace damaged hepatocytes is important for limiting the progression of fatty liver disease. status: publishe...|$|E

A significant inverse linear correlation between mean peroxisomal diameter and numerical density was found in patients with <b>fatty</b> <b>livers.</b> Because a similar correlation was also found when control data were added to the fatty liver data, we hypothesize that the peroxisomal compartment in human <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> is adapted in such a way to permit the same metabolic efficiency as in control livers...|$|E
40|$|Oxidation of some {{substrates}} requiring DPN (glutamate, malate, pyruvate, ketoglutarate) {{is strongly}} decreased in <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> of rats, obtained either by injection of steatogenic poisons (CCl 4, P) or by feeding with a diet deficient of choline. The decrease of oxidative power is particularly strong in mitochondria. Addition to these mitochondria of the supernatant fluid produces {{stimulation of the}} oxidative activity. Almost complete restoration of activity is produced both in homogenates and in mitochondria by addition of DPN. The concentration of pyridine nucleotides in <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> is strongly decreased. The extent of this decrease is particularly remarkable in mitochondria. A redistribution of pyridine nucleotides, with displacement of these substances from mitochondria into the supernatant fluid, occurs in fatty liver homogenates. The PN/PNH ratio is decreased in <b>fatty</b> <b>livers.</b> Synthesis of DPN in vitro through the Kornberg reaction and destruction of DPN are not modified. Both decrease of oxidation of glutamate and decrease and displacement of DPN occur in the livers of treated animals {{before the beginning of}} the accumulation of fat within the cells. The possible causes for the described phenomena and their importance for the pathogenesis of liver steatosis are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> index (FLI) is an {{algorithm}} {{involving the}} waist circumference, body mass index, and serum levels of triglyceride and gamma-glutamyl transferase to identify <b>fatty</b> <b>liver.</b> Although {{some studies have}} attempted to validate the FLI, {{few studies have been}} conducted for external validation among Asians. We attempted to validate FLI to predict ultrasonographic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> in Taiwanese subjects. We enrolled consecutive subjects who received health check-up services at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 2002 to 2009. Ultrasonography was applied to diagnose <b>fatty</b> <b>liver.</b> The ability of the FLI to detect ultrasonographic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> was assessed by analyzing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Among the 29, 797 subjects enrolled in this study, <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> was diagnosed in 44. 5 % of the population. Subjects with ultrasonographic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> had a significantly higher FLI than those without <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> by multivariate analysis (odds ratio 1. 045; 95 % confidence interval, CI 1. 044 - 1. 047, p< 0. 001). Moreover, FLI had the best discriminative ability to identify patients with ultrasonographic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (AUROC: 0. 827, 95 % confidence interval, 0. 822 - 0. 831). An FLI < 25 (negative likelihood ratio (LR-) 0. 32) for males and < 10 (LR- 0. 26) for females rule out ultrasonographic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver.</b> Moreover, an FLI ≥ 35 (positive likelihood ratio (LR+) 3. 12) for males and ≥ 20 (LR+ 4. 43) for females rule in ultrasonographic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver.</b> FLI could accurately identify ultrasonographic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> in a large-scale population in Taiwan but with lower cut-off value than the Western population. Meanwhile the cut-off value was lower in females than in males...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fatty</b> <b>liver,</b> {{including}} non-alcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> disease, {{is closely}} associated with metabolic syndrome (MS). Thus, the presence of <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> without MS in some conditions may be clinically important. Many {{studies have shown that}} compared with no or occasional alcohol intake, moderate alcohol consumption is associated with lower prevalence rates of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, and lower levels of circulating C-reactive protein, a valuable marker for MS and insulin resistance. Considering these findings, light to moderate alcohol consumption has theoretical benefits on <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> and MS. <b>Fatty</b> <b>liver,</b> including non-alcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> disease, may be more clinically important than MS, particularly in non-obese individuals, because <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> can develop before MS in several conditions, such as regular alcohol consumers.

40|$|Hepatic {{steatosis}} is a {{major risk}} factor in ischemia-reperfusion. The present study evaluates whether preconditioning, demonstrated {{to be effective in}} normal livers, could also confer protection in the presence of steatosis and investigates the potential underlying protective mechanisms. Fatty rats had increased hepatic injury and decreased survival after 60 minutes of ischemia compared with lean rats. <b>Fatty</b> <b>livers</b> showed a degree of neutrophil accumulation and microcirculatory alterations similar to that of normal livers. However, in presence of steatosis, an increased lipid peroxidation that could be reduced with glutathione-ester pretreatment was observed after hepatic reperfusion. Ischemic preconditioning reduced hepatic injury and increased animal survival. Both in normal and <b>fatty</b> <b>livers,</b> this endogenous protective mechanism was found to control lipid peroxidation, hepatic microcirculation failure, and neutrophil accumulation, reducing the subsequent hepatic injury. These beneficial effects could be mediated by nitric oxide, because the inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis and nitric oxide donor pretreatment abolished and simulated, respectively, the benefits of preconditioning. Thus, ischemic preconditioning could be an effective surgical strategy to reduce the hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in normal and <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> under normothermic conditions, including hepatic resections, and liver transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Machine {{perfusion}} at subnormothermic temperature (20 °C), MP 20, {{was developed}} by Vairetti et al. and showed to afford a better preservation of <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> respect to traditional cold storage (CS) in terms of enzyme release into the perfusate and bile, glycogen stores, energy charge and oxidative stress. Here we investigated whether it also caused decreased cell death by apoptosis. Fatty and lean Zucker rats were submitted to MP 20 or CS for 6 h and reperfused normothermically for 2 h. Apoptotic cells were revealed by immunohistochemistry of activated caspase- 3 and M 30 (new epitope on CK 18 degraded by caspase- 3) and by the TUNEL assay. Portal pressure was also determined. A statistically significant reduction of hepatocyte apoptosis, but especially of sinusoidal cells was determined for <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> submitted to MP 20 respect to CS. Portal pressure was significantly lower after MP 20 respect to CS. The reduction of sinusoidal cell death by apoptosis without need for anti-apoptotic therapies appears particularly positive since apoptotic sinusoidal cells hinder microcirculation in the sinusoids and are thrombogenic. These results further confirm the potential of MP 20 for preserving <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> that would be otherwise discarded as grafts, and thus for increasing the donor pool for liver transplantation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} omega- 3 fatty acids (FAs) treatment of experimental steatosis and the consequent effect on ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. <b>Fatty</b> <b>livers</b> are more susceptible to IR injury and display decreased regenerative capacity. Consequently, restrictions exist for patients with <b>fatty</b> <b>livers</b> to undergo a major hepatectomy or to participate in living donor liver transplantation. Until recently, weight reduction constituted the only proven therapy for patients with <b>fatty</b> <b>livers.</b> Steatosis was induced by a 3 -wk methionine/choline-deficient diet, followed by oral administration of omega- 3 FAs (Omega- 3), standard lipid solution (Lipid), or NaCl (Saline) during 2 wk. Control animals received a standard diet without treatment. Rats underwent partial (70 %) hepatic IR combined with partial hepatectomy (PHx) of the non-ischemic lobes (30 %) followed by 24 -h reperfusion. Histological analysis revealed mild (5 - 33 %) macrovesicular steatosis in omega- 3 -treated animals vs. severe (> 66 %) macrovesicular steatosis in both Lipid and Saline groups. Following IR/PHx, omega- 3 -treated rats exhibited reduced serum ALT levels after 6 - and 24 -h reperfusion, a reduced hepatic TNF-α content, and an improved anti-oxidative capacity. Omega- 3 treatment significantly reduces experimental hepatic steatosis and associated pathophysiological features, resulting in significantly reduced IR injury following PH...|$|E
40|$|Background/PurposeFor estrogen-receptor {{positive}} {{breast cancer}} cases, tamoxifen {{has been the}} most important adjuvant hormonal therapy for the purpose of reducing recurrence rates and prolonging disease free survival. However, several side effects have been noticed, and <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> {{is one of the most}} common side effects among them. Since <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> is a common problem in the general population, we wanted to examine the effects of tamoxifen under pre-existing <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> conditions and evaluate the prevalence of tamoxifen-related impaired liver function. MethodsWe recruited breast cancer cases at ages 20 − 70 years and divided them into tamoxifen or control groups. Personal information was collected, and fasting blood tests and abdominal ultrasound were performed. The changes of <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> degree between the initial and follow-up ultrasound were divided into five categories. ResultsOf the 406 enrolled participants, 266 were in the tamoxifen group and 140 were in the control group. The tamoxifen group had a higher risk of newly developed <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> [hazard ratio (HR)  =  3. 69; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 67 − 8. 13), lower rate of improved <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (HR =  0. 33; 95 % CI 0. 15 − 0. 75), and higher rate of worsened <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> (HR =  2. 11; 95 % CI 1. 02 − 4. 35). ConclusionThe current study suggests that tamoxifen treatment is associated with the risk of <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> either by increasing the risk of newly developed <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> conditions or worsening previous <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> conditions, and even retarding <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> improvement...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} {{understanding of}} non-alcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> disease epidemiology {{would lead to}} identification of individuals {{at high risk of}} developing chronic liver disease and extra-hepatic complications, thus contributing to more effective case finding of non-alcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> disease among selected groups. We aimed to illustrate the epidemiology of non-alcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> disease in high-risk groups, which were identified based on existing literature. To this end, PubMed was searched to retrieve original articles published until May 2015 using relevant and pertinent keywords “nonalcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> disease” and “diabetes”, “obesity”, “hyperlipidemia”, “familial heterozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia”, “hypertension”, “metabolic syndrome”, “ethnicity”, “family history” or “genetic polymorphisms”. We found that age, sex and ethnicity are major physiological modifiers of the risk of non-alcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> disease, along with belonging to “non-alcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> disease families” and carrying risk alleles for selected genetic polymorphisms. Metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, mixed hyperlipidaemia and hypocholesterolaemia due to familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia are the major metabolic modifiers of non-alcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> disease risk. Compared with these metabolic conditions, however, arterial hypertension appears to carry a relatively more modest risk of non-alcoholic <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> disease.
