Currently owned by the Alabama Historical Commission, the house is {{undergoing}} major restoration and preservation {{to take it back}} to the 1920s condition. Joseph Wheeler married into the property which was owned by his wife Daniella (b. 20 August 1841 m.8 February 1866 d.1895). Daniella had inherited the property when her previous husband, Benjamin Sherrod died. The Sherrods had bought the property from the Hickman family and expanded and added several buildings, including the two story dogtrot log cabin that {{came to be known as}} the Sherrod House. The Wheelers built their own <b>house</b> <b>right</b> next to the Sherrod house and occupied both houses while Daniella and Joe were alive.|$|E

Liam Tucker, founder of website Watch With Mothers, compared the fire episode {{to the film}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and admired the special effects and performances of the episode, but said that it seemed unlikely that everyone would have escaped safely, especially Stacey and her baby. Roz Laws from the Sunday Mercury wondered if the fire episode was inaccurate {{due to the lack}} of fire alarms, sprinklers and emergency lighting in the pub, but noted that the episode's use of the song [...] "Murder on the Dancefloor", featuring the line [...] "Gonna burn this god damn <b>house</b> <b>right</b> down", was [...] "clever". A writer for Heat said [...] "We knew the Vic fire was coming, but actually seeing it was quite another thing, and knowing that it also marked the end of an era with the departure of [...] Windsor made it that much more emotional."

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to outline and examine the growing corpus of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> and assess their {{relevance}} and applicability to complex contemporary housing systems across the world. Design/methodology/approach - The paper sets out the principal instruments and commentaries on <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> developed by the United Nations, regional and other bodies. It assesses their relevance in the context of contemporary analysis of housing systems, organized and directed by networks of legal and other professionals within particular domains. Findings - <b>Housing</b> <b>rights</b> instruments are accepted by all States across the world at the level of international law, national constitutions and laws. The findings suggest that there are significant gaps in the international law conception and framework of <b>housing</b> <b>rights,</b> and indeed, human rights generally, which create major obstacles for the effective implementation of these rights. There is a preoccupation with one element of housing systems, that of subsidized or social housing. However, effective <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> implementation requires application at meso-, micro- and macro-levels of modern, dynamic housing systems as a whole. Epistemic communities of professionals develop and shape housing law and policy within these domains. The <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> paradigm must be further fashioned for effective translation into contemporary housing systems. Research limitations/implications - The development of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> precedents, both within international and national law, is leading to a wide and diffuse corpus of legislation and case law. More research is needed on specific examples of effective coupling between <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> and elements of housing systems. Originality/value - This paper offers housing policy makers and lawyers an avenue into the extensive jurisprudence and writings on <b>housing</b> <b>rights,</b> which will inevitably become part of the lexicon of housing law across the world. It also highlights the limitations of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> implementation, but offers some new perspectives on more effective application of these rights...|$|R

He took the boiling water and placed the moss inside and then made soup. The tells the men to have a seat on his bench with his big hyu7kem plate.

2500|$|Reunited {{with his}} Knights, Arthur meets Tim the Enchanter who warns {{them of the}} danger of a killer rabbit. When the rabbit bites a knight's head off, Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch against it, {{knocking}} down a nearby hill and revealing that the [...] "evil rabbit" [...] was actually a puppet controlled by a surprised puppeteer. A large stone block showing a combination of letters and numbers is also revealed. (The letters are based on the seat numbering system used by each theatre. [...] They are changed from performance to performance to discourage audience members from intentionally booking any of the possible seats. [...] The seat is typically on the aisle in one of the first few rows nearest the orchestra. In the Broadway production and on the tour it is either A101, B101, C101 or D101; i.e., Seat 101 – which is <b>house</b> <b>right</b> of the center aisle – of Rows A, B, C, or D. [...] In the West End Production a word is revealed – DONE, CONE or BONE, referring to D1, C1 and B1 respectively.) After pondering the final clue, Arthur admits that they're [...] "a bit stumped with the clue thing" [...] and asks God to [...] "give them a hand". A large hand points to the audience and Arthur realises that the letters and numbers refer to a seat number in the audience. The grail is [...] "found" [...] (with some sleight of hand) under the seat and the person sitting in the seat is rewarded with a small trophy and a polaroid photo. ("The Holy Grail"). Arthur marries the Lady of the Lake, who reveals that her name is Guinevere; Lancelot marries Herbert (who finally has a chance to sing); and Sir Robin decides to pursue a career in musical theatre. Herbert's father attempts to interrupt the finale and stop all of the [...] "bloody singing", but is hit over the head with a shovel by Lancelot, a nod to [...] "He is Not Yet Dead".

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impact of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> {{jurisprudence}} on Chinese legal and policy frameworks in the housing sector, examines the key related issues, and assesses whether current practices {{are in line with}} international best practice. The thesis considers three major questions, viz. 1 What are <b>housing</b> <b>rights?</b> 2 What is the significance of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> in the Chinese context? 3 Given the features and nature of <b>housing</b> <b>rights,</b> and China’s transitional societal background, how could <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> be implemented? By looking at the jurisprudence and jurisprudential development of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> in international law and related humanitarian jurisprudence, this thesis proposes a three-layer framework of <b>housing</b> <b>rights,</b> which encompasses property and resource dimensions. While the property dimension requires the state to refrain from interfering in property interest in housing, the resource dimension establishes a set of principles for directing governmental duties in utilizing and redistributing resources. The governments should enable equal and equitable access to housing and housing-related resources, and ensure housing development is a human-centered, sustainability-oriented process. China is a transitional society, where the Constitution shows a trend towards strengthening property rights protection, but institutional constraints on property rights remain. There are also transformative schemes in the housing sector that take the form of land reform and public housing programs. An overview of the housing regime in China identifies three primary limitations: an incoherent legal framework of Chinese takings law related to the property dimension of housing rights; problems with equal and equitable access to land resource as reflected by the urban-rural divide in the land tenure system; and the lack of a sustainability vision in public housing development. It is, therefore, argued that implementing <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> involves enshrining values and principles related to <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> in the domestic constitution. This can take the form of reinterpreting the Chinese constitutional property according to the three-layer framework of <b>housing</b> <b>rights.</b> Such a reinterpretation sheds further light on how to resolve the key issues in the current housing regime. This study concludes that <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> require Chinese constitutional property {{to strike a balance between}} protecting existing property-holdings and the transformative schemes in the housing sector. For the property dimension of Chinese constitutional property, <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> help to construct a coherent jurisprudence for Chinese takings law. The resource dimension of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> serves as an assessment tool for the policy framework to guide both the utilization and redistribution of land resources and the development of public housing programs. This facilitates the legal and policy framework in the housing sector to be informed by humanitarian jurisprudence and be in line with international best practice. The pioneering nature of this thesis lies in its exploration of humanitarian jurisprudence which is new to Chinese constitutional reasoning, and the extension of jurisprudential discussion of <b>housing</b> <b>rights</b> to public policy formulation. It is also innovative in proposing the three-layer framework of <b>housing</b> <b>rights.</b> Some of the findings from the discussion of international jurisprudence may be extended not only to the Chinese setting but also to other transitional economies which face similar housing issues and concerns in their policy-making. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
