40|$|Abstract. Varian Medical Systems has {{manufactured}} {{and recently}} {{put into operation}} a clinically-applicable solution for image-guided radiation therapy. Cone-beam CT imaging, one of the operation modes of the imaging unit of this device, aims at highquality volumetric reconstruction. To boost the image quality, the dual-gain mode, a successful means for enhancing the dynamic range of the flat-panel detectors and obtaining better results in the contrast of the reconstructed image, was developed and successfully tested {{during the last few}} years. The important steps in the calibration of this mode involve a correction to the pulse widths associated with the X-ray production, the assessment of the detector signal above which nonlinear effects become significant and the determination of some properties of the detector pixels, namely, of dark <b>fields,</b> <b>flatness</b> corrections, etc. Finally, the defect-pixel map is obtained, containing dead and flickering pixels, as well as pixels with properties which are sufficiently ‘out of range’. An effect observed in the offset correction of raw images seems to originate in the mismatch between the measured and extrapolated values of the dark field; a correction scheme is proposed to take account of this effect. In the data processing, which is achieved {{on the basis of the}} files produced in the calibration of the mode, the high-gain signal is used whenever meaningful; otherwise, it is substituted by the lowgain signal, properly scaled. Defect pixels are interpolated from their good neighbours; a procedure achieving a correction in case of small defect-pixel clusters is outlined...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} produce a low energy {{effective}} field theory from a string model, {{it is necessary to}} specify a vacuum state.

The situation becomes particularly interesting when one attempts to realize such directions while assigning VEVS to fields transforming under non-Abelian representations of the gauge group.

40|$|Current {{techniques}} for deciding when {{to pull out}} worn bits are based on speculation rather than reliable engineered methods. Two concepts have been previously {{reported in the literature}} to incorporate the effects of drilling parameters on forecasting the life of drill bits. Bit tooth flatness and specific energy approaches were used for assessing the bit tooth wear and predicting the rock formation and its properties being drilled. However, drilling shale formations as well as encountering abnormal geologic formations especially unconformities, reduces the reliability of these methods. In this paper, a modified technique based on combined bit dullness and specific energy have been used as trending tools for determining the status of the drill bit even in cases where drill torque data is unavailable. As case studies, currently producing oil wells from southern Iraq are analysed for bit wear. Estimated results of bit wear for each bit run were correlated with the qualitative <b>field</b> bit tooth <b>flatness</b> revealing a successful key index for the suitable time to pull out worn bits. Furthermore, literature values of unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the drilled formations were compared with the computed mechanical specific energy (MSE) to validate the obtained results.

40|$|This {{practical}} and written research investigates abstract painting and its intrinsic relationship to pictorial space {{throughout the course}} of Modern Art. Influenced by the spatial and decorative qualities of Eastern art, the early Modernists made the discovery of several key concepts that culminated in twentieth century abstraction and the flattening of picture plane. Ambiguities between figure and <b>field,</b> depth and <b>flatness,</b> abstraction and representation continue to be ripe for exploration within painting and this research charts the development of several pictorial devices and how they began to metamorphose in practice. A context is provided for the ways in which painting procedures may instigate doubt, uncertainty and ambiguity; and how materials can have implications for a painting’s facture and imagery. There is often a refusal within contemporary abstraction to pin-point specific sources and a preference for imagery that evolves through an iterative process without pre-conception, naming and categorisation. Painting, in this case, begins as being about something and moves towards the consideration of painting as something. Many contemporary commentators on art adopt phenomenological modes of inquiry that focus on intuitive knowledge, lived-experiences and sensations rather than an objective appraisal of the image. The slowness of studio production is also a factor in gleaning of this knowledge, as the passing of time heightens awareness of the ordinary objects, textures and events that surround us. These themes are explored in tandem with the project’s own development and outcomes are evidenced in the documented paintings...|$|R

40|$|The continual {{development}} of high energy photon beam radiotherapy in Norway urges for a revision in dosimetric quality controls. It is favorable to use sharply defined fields, but existing routines for quality assurance are lacking, especially for modalities such as asymmetric fields and IMRT. The thesis suggests a new {{procedure for implementing}} radiochromic film {{as a tool for}} quality assurance in radiotherapy, in cooperation with the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). GafChromic®EBT type film has been used for the experiments. The procedure is based on the general method first suggested by Devic et al, with several modications. Films have been calibrated using the Co- 60 gammatron at the NRPA Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory, and measurements have been performed on 14 treatment units at 7 different hospitals in Norway. In addition to film irradiation, reference dosimetry according to TRS- 398 protocol using an ionization chamber in a water phantom was performed at 13 of 14 linacs. Measurements show that measured doses for a 10 x 10 cm 2 field at reference conditions with an ionization chamber in a water phantom were within 2 % for all linear accelerators, for both 6 MV and 15 MV photon energies. Radiochromic film measurements were inaccurate for absolute dosimetry due to difficulties in the absolute calibration of the film. However, relative measurements using radiochromic film show that values for <b>field</b> size, penumbra, <b>flatness</b> and symmetry are close to expected clinical values. Different asymmetric field setups are also investigated using radiochromic film. In the case where two asymmetric half-collimated fields are spliced together, high over- and underdosages of more than 20 % are detected in the border between the fields, both with and without collimator rotation. These discrepancies are not corrected for in dose planning software. Studies of fields with overtravel collimator parameters in both x- and y-directions show that field sizes vary within 7 % of the desired values, and measured doses do not fully agree with the calculated doses in treatment planning software. Radiochromic film shows promise as a tool in radiotherapy quality assurance, but the existing method is not accurate enough to satisfy needs for clinical use. A modified method is suggested that will potentially improve the detected uncertainties...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The quality {{assurance}} (QA) procedures in particle therapy centers with active beam scanning make {{extensive use of}} films, which do not provide immediate results. The purpose of this work is to verify whether the 2 D MatriXX detector by IBA Dosimetry has enough sensitivity to replace films {{in some of the}} measurements. Methods: MatriXX is a commercial detector composed of 32 32 parallel plate ionization chambers designed for pre-treatment dose verification in conventional radiation therapy. The detector and GAFCHROMIC films were exposed simultaneously to a 131. 44 MeV proton and a 221. 45 MeV/u carbon-ion therapeutic beam at the CNAO therapy center of Pavia - Italy, and the results were analyzed and compared. Results: The sensitivity MatriXX on the beam position, beam width and <b>field</b> <b>flatness</b> was investigated. For the first two quantities, a method for correcting systematic uncertainties, dependent on the beam size, was developed allowing to achieve a position resolution equal to 230 lm for carbon ions and less than 100 lm for protons.

40|$|Superconducting {{cavities}} for the CKM RF separated kaon beamline at Fermilab have modes {{that are}} closely spaced {{compared to the}} resonance bandwidths when warm, and this complicates the <b>field</b> <b>flatness</b> ("warm") tuning process. Additionally, {{it is necessary to}} maintain the azimuthal orientation of the mode during the tuning deformations. We present two analytic techniques to warm-tune cavities with overlapping modes, a finite-element analysis of the tuning process, the design of a warm tuner which maintains mode polarization, and the results of tuning a cavity in which initial manufacturing variations caused the desired π and nearby π- 1 modes to be indistinguishable before <b>field</b> <b>flatness</b> tuning. OVERLAPPING MODES Because of application [1] requirements, CKM cavities are designed with an aggressive specification for mode spacing. The desired mode is just over 1 MHz from the nearest other mode; at a Q of ~ 5000 at room temperature, this is just over one bandwidth. Production errors on the first prototype resulted in a cavity for which these two modes were initially indistinguishable, although they could be somewhat resolved by cooling the cavity to liquid N 2 temperatures (see figures 1 and 2). Figure 1 : Room temperature S 21 before tuning. In order to warm-tune with overlapping modes, one must first realize that the traditional bead-pull formula [2] gives the shift in each of the overlapping resonances. The usual procedure is to measure the phase of S 12 as the bead moves through the cavity; the phase changes for each of the resonances then add linearly, at least to lowest order. These phase changes may be computed in a reasonably straightforward way from the observed intermode spacing, resonance Q, and S 21 amplitudes. Two details are noteworthy: (1) the frequency of the resonance is most accurately determined by looking for a peak in-∂φ/∂ω, as in figure 2, and (2) Q is best determined from the left side of peak 2 in figure 1 (theoretical differences in Q between modes are small) ...|$|E
