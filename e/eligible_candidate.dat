5|$|The incumbent, 4th {{president}} of the Republic, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, is eligible to run for reelection to a second and final term. Another <b>eligible</b> <b>candidate</b> is the former 3rd {{president of}} Croatia, Ivo Josipović. He narrowly lost the 2015 election to Grabar-Kitarović after serving one 5-year term and can therefore also run for reelection to a second and final term.|$|E
5|$|At {{both the}} 1999 and 2005 presidential elections, S. R. Nathan {{was elected by}} default as the only <b>eligible</b> <b>candidate</b> on {{nomination}} day. While {{being a member of}} a minority community worked to his advantage, he was unanimously endorsed by the 1999 Cabinet because of the merit of his overall qualities. Similarly, Nathan's decision to run for a second term in 2005 was accompanied by declarations of support from Government ministers and organizations like the NTUC.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most state}} chief {{executives}} in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, {{but not more than}} twice in a row. This makes it possible for a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An <b>eligible</b> <b>candidate</b> for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he or she must file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, {{plagued by}} {{political}} missteps and personal scandals, {{the administration of}} Republican Acting Governor of Massachusetts Jane Swift appeared vulnerable, and many Republicans viewed her as unable to win a general election. Prominent party figures– {{as well as the}} White House– wanted Romney to run for governor and the opportunity appealed to him for reasons including its national visibility. A poll by the Boston Herald showed Republicans favoring Romney over Swift by more than 50percentage points. On March 19, 2002, Swift announced she would not seek her party's nomination, and hours later Romney declared his candidacy, for which he would face no opposition in the primary. In June 2002, the Massachusetts Democratic Party challenged Romney's eligibility to run for governor, noting that state law required seven years' consecutive residence and that Romney had filed his state tax returns as a Utah resident in 1999 and 2000. In response, the bipartisan Massachusetts State Ballot Law Commission unanimously ruled that he had maintained sufficient financial and personal ties to Massachusetts and was, therefore, an <b>eligible</b> <b>candidate.</b>|$|E

On December 3, 2010, Kathy Dunderdale, Williams' Deputy Premier, {{was sworn in as}} Newfoundland and Labrador's tenth Premier. Although she had originally stated she would not seek the permanent leadership she announced on December 30, 2010, she would run for the Progressive Conservative leadership. Her announcement came after several high-profile cabinet ministers announced they would not run and endorsed her candidacy. In January 2011, Dunderdale was acclaimed party leader when she was the only <b>eligible</b> <b>candidate</b> to seek the leadership. On April 2, 2011, she was sworn in as leader of the Progressive Conservatives.|$|E
25|$|Kathy Dunderdale {{was sworn}} in as the tenth Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador on December 3, 2010, {{following}} the resignation of Williams. She became the first woman in the province to hold the post and only the sixth woman in Canada to become premier. Although she had stated she would not seek the leadership of the party Dunderdale announced on December 30, 2010, that she was entering the leadership race with the backing of her entire caucus. She was the only <b>eligible</b> <b>candidate</b> to seek the leadership and {{was sworn in}} as party leader on April 2, 2011. Later that year Dunderdale led the Progressive Conservatives to their third consecutive victory in the provincial election. Despite a drop in support from the previous election the PC Party elected 37 MHAs and won 56 percent of the popular vote. The development of the Muskrat Falls project, along with other natural resource developments, and the reining in of public spending dominated her time as premier. As well Dunderdale faced many questions about her leadership and communication skills as public support for her and her government declined significantly during her three years in office.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} discrepancy between the two texts of the Constitution {{is to be found}} in the subsection stipulating the minimum age for a candidate to be eligible for election as President (Art. 12.4.1°). [...] According to the English text, an <b>eligible</b> <b>candidate</b> [...] "has reached his thirty-fifth year of age", whereas the Irish text has this as [...] "ag a bhfuil cúig bliana tríochad slán" [...] ("has completed his thirty-five years").|$|E
2500|$|Candidates must be Irish {{citizens}} and over 35 years old. However, {{there is a}} discrepancy between the English- and Irish-language texts of Article 12.4.1°. According to the English text, an <b>eligible</b> <b>candidate</b> [...] "has reached his thirty-fifth year of age", whereas the Irish text has this as [...] "ag a bhfuil cúig bliana tríochad slán" [...] ("has completed his thirty-five years"). [...] Because a person's thirty-fifth year of life begins {{on his or her}} thirty-fourth birthday, this means there is a year's difference between the minimum ages as stated in the two texts. Various proposals have been made to amend the Constitution so as to eliminate this discrepancy. [...] At present, however, the Irish version of the subsection prevails in accordance with the rule stated in Article 25.5.4°. The current government has introduced the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Age of Eligibility for Election to the Office of President) Bill 2015 to reduce the age of candidacy from 35 to 21, which was put to referendum in May 2015, but the bill was heavily defeated, with approximately 73% of voters voting against reducing the age of eligibility.|$|E
