40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: The risk of fatality is greater in jump than in flat racing in Victoria, Australia. This {{is the first}} study to identify risk factors specific to <b>jump</b> <b>starts</b> in Victoria. Objective: To identify risk factors for fatality of Thoroughbred racehorses in <b>jump</b> <b>starts</b> on all racecourses in Victoria, Australia between 1989 and 2004. Methods: Fatalities comprised all horses that died during or immediately after a jump (hurdle or steeplechase) race or official jump trial and all horses that were subjected to euthanasia within 24 h of an event in which an injury was sustained. The retrospective study involved 191 case starts and 2324 control starts. Univariable and multivariable backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for fatality at any one start. A multiple level model was used with racecourse included as a random effect. Results: In the final multivariable model, {{the duration of the}} racing career of the horse, the number of flat, hurdle and steeple starts accumulated in the 60 days prior to the case or control start, the number of flat and <b>jump</b> <b>starts</b> accumulated over the racing career, if the horse had had a start between 1 and 14 days prior to the case or control start, the type of jump race (hurdle or steeple), the calendar year of the start and the location of the racecourse were associated with fatality. Conclusions: The findings highlight the need to investigate further the differences between hurdle and steeplechase events and the adverse effect of prolonged prior flat racing careers on the risk of fatality in <b>jump</b> <b>starts.</b> Potential relevance: This is the first study to examine risk factors for fatality in <b>jump</b> <b>starts</b> in Victoria. The results should shape the development of interventions to reduce the risk in <b>jump</b> <b>starts</b> in the future...|$|R

25|$|Secondary flight {{controls}} include the rotor transmission clutch, {{also known as}} a pre-rotator, which when engaged drives the rotor to start it spinning before takeoff, and collective pitch to reduce blade pitch before driving the rotor.

Unlike a helicopter, autogyros without collective pitch or another <b>jump</b> <b>start</b> facility need a runway to take off; however, they are capable of landing with a very short or zero ground roll. Like helicopters, each autogyro has a specific height–velocity diagram for safest operation, although the dangerous area is usually smaller than for helicopters.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{there have}} been {{numerous}} legislative actions and policies implemented on a federal and state level to both regulate atomic energy and promote its expansion.

Following stress from touring, founding member Jonathan Teves left the band, {{and was replaced by}} bassist Curtiss Lopez. They then embarked on their first European tour with Lagwagon, and also toured with Less Than Jake. Midway through the latter tour, Lopez abruptly quit the band.

25|$|In {{the last}} four years the three Balkenende {{cabinets}} had implemented an ambitious program of social-economic reforms, including tax cuts, reforms to the social welfare system and investments in education. Their aim was to <b>jump</b> <b>start</b> the Dutch economy. Initially there was great public dissatisfaction with this policy, with large demonstrations in 2003, 2004 and 2005 by the main labour union FNV and the three main opposition parties. They criticised the government for taking these measures at the wrong point in time, during a recession, and they claimed that the government made the poor and socially weaker pay for the economic recovery. A major focus of this debate was on the fact that more than 10% of the people were said to live in poverty, as exemplified by the rising number of 'voedselbanken' (give-away shops for food). As the economy began to perform better in 2006 the public dissatisfaction decreased.|$|E
25|$|After {{the grapes}} destined for Vin Santo are {{harvested}} in September or October, they {{are laid out}} on straw mats, often under rafters or staircases. They are kept in warm, well ventilated rooms that allow the moisture in the grape to evaporate. This process of desiccation allows the sugars in the grape to be more concentrated. The longer the grapes are allowed to dry and desiccate, the higher the resulting residual sugar levels {{will be in the}} wine. Depending on the style of wine desired, the grapes may be crushed and the fermentation process started after a few weeks or not till late March. Producers may use a starter culture of yeast known as a madre that includes a small amount of finished Vin Santo from previous years production. It is believed that this older wine can help <b>jump</b> <b>start</b> the fermentation process and also add complexity to the wine.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of {{hyperinflation}} in the late 1940s when the Kuomintang (KMT) military regime of Chen Yi overprinted the new Taiwan Yuan against the previous Japan Taiwan Yen, {{it became clear that}} a new and stable currency was needed. When the KMT government retreated to Taiwan after the loss of mainland China in the Chinese Civil War, it brought part of the precious metal and foreign currency reserve of mainland China to the island. Although war-ravaged China had held only a very small reserve, some $170 million in all, those reserves helped to establish a gold-standard reserve currency in Taiwan, which in turn helped to stabilize prices and reduce hyperinflation. More importantly, many of the Chinese intellectual and business elites moved with KMT to the island. The Japanese had built up the agricultural and industrial infrastructure as well as chemical, material, and food reserves on the island that allowed the elite of the KMT supporters to <b>jump</b> <b>start</b> their own economic endeavors. Along with the $4 billion in financial aid and soft credit provided by the US (as well as the indirect economic stimulus of US food and military aid) over the 1945-1965 period, Taiwan had the necessary capital to restart its economy. Further, the KMT government instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China.|$|E
