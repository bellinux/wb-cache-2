5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly <b>disposal</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E

30|$|The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008 / 56 /EC [5]) {{is similar}} to the WFD, in its {{stepwise}} implementation mode and with its main objective in the achievement of good environmental status (GES) in the marine environment by 2020. Between the source of a pollutant and its final receptor, the sea, we have the temporal storage in flood plains, lakes, artificial lakes behind dams, deltas, and man-made sedimentation traps (harbors); these are temporary receptors on the temporal scale of years to decades (Salomons [191]). Using scenarios and linking source to receptors has been carried out for prediction of sediment quality in harbors (Salomons and Gandrass [192]). In these cases the impact at the receptor could be defined as exceeding the standard for <b>disposal</b> <b>at</b> the <b>sea</b> (Heise et al. [193]); which is sufficient for the harbor manager [191]. For example in the scenario for the Rhine sediment between the barrage Iffezheim and Rotterdam, the hexachlorobenzene (HCB) source can contribute to a failure of the objectives of the WFD in the Rhine Basin [194, 195] and may require additional measures for its control [57]. All of these should be indications for a mandate to the RBC Elbe; however, no activities at the land–sea interface are reported in the Actualized RBMP (RBC Elbe 2015 [4]).|$|R

40|$|Solid {{waste in}} the world’s waters and solid waste that accumulates on the shorelines of {{waterways}} is known as marine debris. Marine debris has been recognized {{as a form of}} pollution for nearly 50 years and is a concern for the general public for aesthetic reasons and may also pose a human health and safety hazard. Marine debris can affect the tourism industry, especially the eco-tourism industry in the United States and internationally. The commercial fishing industry may also be affected by marine debris through habitat degradation and destruction. For over 20 years international treaties and U. S. federal legislation have regulated the discharge and <b>disposal</b> of debris <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> from ships. Plastics are not allowed to be disposed anywhere in the ocean. Despite international and federal legislation designed to prevent at-sea dumping, marine debris continues to be a major pollution issue. However, not all debris found in waterways and on the beaches comes from the ocean. Debris can be water-based (washed ashore) as a result of accidental or intentional dumping from ships or offshore gas/oil rigs <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> or land-based (washed from the land) from litter, stormwater run-off and discharges.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of discards in European fisheries {{has been identified}} as a specific objective of the reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. To reduce the uncertainty in catch data and the socially unacceptable waste of resources that results from the <b>disposal</b> of catch <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> a policy to ban discards has been proposed. Discard bans are currently implemented in Alaska, British Columbia, New Zealand, the Faroe Islands, Norway and Iceland. Experience from these countries highlights that a policy of mandatory landings can result in a reduction in discards, but relies upon a high level of surveillance or economic incentives to encourage fishers to land more of their catch. Discard bans will also not result in long term benefits to stocks unless total removals are reduced, through the avoidance of undersized, non-commercial or over quota catch. Experience shows that additional management measures are required to incentivise such a move towards more selective fishing. Success has resulted from the use of area closures and bycatch limits, with potential applications in EU fisheries. However, selective fishing will not be a panacea for the current state of European fisheries; discard bans and accompanying measures must be embedded in a wider management system that constrains fishing mortality to reasonable levels before sustainable exploitation can occur...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Solid {{fish waste}} is {{generated}} from the unwanted parts of fish including heads, tails, fins, frames, offal (guts, kidney and liver) and skin. It accounts for up to 80 % of material from production of surimi, 66 % from production of fillet and 27 % from production of headed and gutted fish. Currently, fish wastes are disposed off in land-based waste <b>disposal</b> systems or <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> generating toxic by-products during the decomposition process. However, fish processing waste {{can be used to}} produce commercially valuable by-products, such as chymotrypsin. Approach: A comperehensive review of the literature on the extraction, purification and characeterization of fish chymotrypsin was performed. Results: Chymotrypsin is an endopeptidase secreted by the pancreatic tissues of vertebrates and invertebrates. It has 3 different structures (chymotrypsin A, B and C) varying slightly in solubility, electrophoretic mobility, isoelectric point and cleavage specificity. Only chymotrypsin A and B are found in fish. Compared with mammal chymotrypsin, fish chymotrypsins have similar amino acid composition and molecular weights. Fish chymotrypsins have higher specific activity, especially those from cold-water fish, and low pH and temperature tolerance. The factors affecting the concentration and activity of chymotrypsin in fish are water temperature, fish species, fish age, fish weight and starvation. Chymotrypsin has application in various industries including the food industry, leather production industry chemical industry and medical industry...|$|R

It covers the deliberate <b>disposal</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, and platforms. It does not cover discharges from land-based sources such as pipes and outfalls, wastes generated incidental to normal operation of vessels, or placement of materials for purposes other than mere disposal, providing such disposal is not contrary to aims of the Convention.

50|$|A 1997 {{study at}} South Georgia {{indicated}} that several thousand Antarctic fur seals were entangled in man-made debris from fishing vessels. Consequently, CCAMLR campaigned for compliance with MARPOL provisions relating to waste <b>disposal</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> and for cutting of any material jettisoned which could form collars to entangle seals. Subsequent monitoring of entangled fur seals confirmed that entanglement {{is still a}} persistent problem, but it has halved in recent years. However, the South Georgia fur seal population has approximately doubled in the same period, so that the overall total of animals entangled may even have increased. The particular reduction in entanglement due to packing bands {{and the fact that}} all such bands washed ashore over the last 2 years have been cut, does suggest a general improvement in standards of waste disposal on Southern Ocean fishing vessels.|$|E
