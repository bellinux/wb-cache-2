The Office is an American adaptation of the British comedy series of the same name, and is presented in a mockumentary format, portraying {{the daily lives of}} office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The ninth season of The Office aired on Thursdays at 9:00p.m. (Eastern) in the United States, as part of the Comedy Night <b>Done</b> <b>Right</b> television block. This is the second season not to star Steve Carell as lead character Michael Scott, although he returned for a cameo appearance in the series finale.|$|E
25|$|Parks and Recreation was {{broadcast}} in the 8:30PM timeslot Thursdays on NBC, in the United States, {{during its first}} two seasons, {{as part of the}} network's Comedy Night <b>Done</b> <b>Right</b> line-up. It was moved to a 9:30PM timeslot during its third season, where it premiered as a mid-season replacement. In the fall of 2011, the show returned to its original 8:30pm timeslot for the fourth season.|$|E

500|$|Although when {{he started}} his career it was more common for goalkeepers to wear long-sleeved jerseys, Buffon has always been known for wearing short-sleeves {{throughout}} his entire career, even during the winter months; when asked {{in an interview with}} FourFourTwo why he preferred to wear short sleeves, he commented: [...] "I really don't know why. It's just something that I've always <b>done,</b> <b>right</b> from the time I first started playing in goal. It always felt good. And now look: lots of goalkeepers do it. I've started a fashion." ...|$|E
500|$|Adams {{continued}} {{to shape the}} negative view of Harding with several nonfiction works in the 1930s, culminating with The Incredible Era—The Life and Times of Warren G. Harding (1939) in which he called his subject [...] "an amiable, well-meaning third-rate Mr. Babbitt, with the equipment of a small-town semi-educated journalist... It could not work. It did not work." [...] Dean deems the works of White and Adams [...] "remarkably unbalanced and unfair accounts, exaggerating the negative, assigning responsibility to Harding for all wrongs, and denying him credit for anything <b>done</b> <b>right.</b> Today there is considerable evidence refuting their portrayals of Harding. Yet the myth has persisted." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{featured}} {{the deaths of}} several recurring characters in the series. Faye Marsay, who portrayed the Waif, spoke about her participation in the episode, and leaving Game of Thrones after several seasons, saying [...] "As much as I'm sad that I'm now off of the show, I think that storyline needed to be concluded that way. I'm rooting for Arya and Maisie as well. Even though I won't be able {{to hang out with}} everyone again, I think it was <b>done</b> <b>right</b> and done properly. I think Arya deserved to rip off her face and stick it on a wall." [...] Recurring guest actors Clive Russell as Blackfish, and Essie Davis as Lady Crane portrayed their characters for the last time in the series, as they were killed off on screen.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{comments from}} TV Squad, with Brett Love commenting that [...] "the suspended license plot {{was a little}} thin, but that's forgivable given {{that this was the}} b-story for the episode, and there are only 22 minutes to work with." [...] Love comments positively on the Stewie and Brian relationship in the episode, commenting that, [...] "the Stewie and Brian story is what made the episode for me. It was very well <b>done,</b> <b>right</b> down to the goofy little details." [...] IGN commented that, [...] "...for Family Guy to have a great episode, it takes a good story and humorous [...] "manatee" [...] gags. [...] "Road to Rupert" [...] was able to deliver on both these fronts, with the majority of the episode's attention focused on Stewie and Brian's road story, meshed with many laugh out loud gags." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Scream" [...] {{contains}} heavily sexual lyrics. MTV's Jenna Hally Rubenstein {{wrote that}} Usher sings about a [...] "hot chick and how it'll {{be a total}} cinch {{for him to get}} her home", in the line [...] "I see you over there, so hypnotic/ Thinking 'bout what I do to that body.../ Got no drink in my hand/ But I'm wasted/ Getting drunk of the thought of you naked/ I get you like ooh, baby, baby." [...] In the chorus, he sings [...] "If you wanna scream ‘yeah,’ let me know and I’ll take you there / Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby, a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby / If you want it <b>done</b> <b>right,</b> hope you’re ready to go." [...] DJ Booth depicted the track to be about orgasms. Digital Spy's Lewis Corner wrote that [...] "Scream" [...] contains [...] "sex-fuelled lyrics" [...] portrayed in the line [...] "I see you over there so hypnotic/ Thinkin' 'bout what I'd do to that body".|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} also been noted for its strong sexual themes. Opening with an image of conception, the film then portrays Henry Spencer as a {{character}} who is terrified of, but fascinated by, sex. The recurring images of sperm-like creatures, including the child, are a constant presence during the film's sex scenes; the apparent [...] "girl next door" [...] appeal of the Lady in the Radiator is abandoned during her musical number as she begins to violently smash Spencer's sperm creatures and aggressively meets his gaze. David J. Skal, in his book The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror, has described the film as [...] "depict human reproduction as a desolate freak show, an occupation fit only for the damned". Skal also posits a different characterization of the Lady in the Radiator, casting her as [...] "desperately eager for an unseen audience's approval". In his book David Lynch Decoded, Mark Allyn Stewart proposes that the Lady in the Radiator is in fact Spencer's subconscious, a manifestation of his own urge to kill his child, who embraces him after he does so, as if to reassure him that he has <b>done</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

50|$|Ethics can {{be defined}} as going beyond what is legal and <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> things, even no one is paying {{attention}} to.

500|$|In the State Senate, Solis {{authored}} 17bills {{to prevent}} {{domestic violence and}} championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as [...] "a big believer that government, if <b>done</b> <b>right,</b> {{can do a lot}} {{to improve the quality of}} people's lives". In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave-like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti-sweatshop laws. Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was [...] "a committed liberal in the pockets of labor", but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, [...] "We obviously didn't see eye to eye. But she was respectful. I'll give her credit; she was a very hard worker and she knew her stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{aired on}} Thursdays at 9:00p.m., {{as part of}} the Comedy Night <b>Done</b> <b>Right</b> {{programming}} block. [...] The season premiere, [...] "New Guys" [...] received a 2.1/6 percent share in the Nielsen ratings among viewers aged 18 to 49, meaning that 2.1 percent of viewers aged 18 to 49 watched the episode, and 6 percent of viewers watching television at the time watched the episode. The episode was viewed by 4.28 million viewers and became the lowest-rated season premiere for the series. In addition, it marked a 46 percent drop in viewership from the season eight premiere [...] "The List". For the first sixteen episodes, the series was able to maintain roughly 4 million viewers. However, starting with the seventeenth episode [...] "The Farm", ratings began to drop below this threshold. The series hit an all-time low with the twentieth episode, [...] "Paper Airplane", which was viewed by only 3.25 million viewers, and received a 1.7 rating/5 percent share. The series finale was viewed by 5.69 million viewers and received a 3.0 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This made it the highest-rated episode of the season; it also marked an increase in the previous season finale, which garnered only 4.49 million viewers. [...] "Finale" [...] was the most watched episode of The Office since the eighth season episode [...] "Pool Party", but ranked as the third-least watched finale of the series, following the eighth- and first-season finales. Although in its ninth season, The Office no longer was NBC's highest-rated scripted comedy series—it was surpassed by Go On—it often ranked as the highest-rated scripted NBC series on Thursday nights. Rainn Wilson argued that the show's lower ratings were a combination of the overall trend in lower television ratings in 2012, as well as the fact that [...] "NBC didn't promote [...] one bit". NBC increased their usual ad-price by 200 percent for the finale, asking for $400,000 per commercial. This was largely due to the anticipated increase in viewership that the finale would bring.|$|E
500|$|For {{the change}} from Ghost Rider to LMD, Joseph McCabe at Nerdist said that any doubts he had about the change [...] "are more or less eliminated" [...] by the series take on a robotic antagonist, which he called [...] "Avengers: Age of Ultron <b>done</b> <b>right</b> ... where it most {{obviously}} improves on the overstuffed second Avengers film is in the humor department". Schwartz called the transition smooth, and felt the series' ongoing Inhuman subplot complimented the LMD storyline well. Valentine said that the beginning of LMD [...] "doesn’t maintain the heights of [...] days with Ghost Rider in the driver’s seat, but it does manage to remain a solid entry on the airwaves." [...] He was very critical of the Inhuman subplot, calling the Watchdogs [...] "pretty much played out at this point" [...] and feeling the Inhumans had become stale after the previous two seasons. Fitzpatrick also criticized the [...] "flat" [...] Inhuman storyline, but felt the change to LMD [...] "got off to the best possible start" [...] given the [...] "obviously less of an immediate hook" [...] than Ghost Rider. Beginning the Agents of Hydra pod, Schwartz said [...] "this return episode more than delivered" [...] on the previous episode's cliffhanger. She was satisfied that the Framework reality was not undone within a single episode, and was hopeful that the remaining episodes of the season would offer [...] "similar surprises [...] our expectations". Valentine felt [...] "What If..." [...] "made for a very good start" [...] to the pod, feeling it [...] "continues {{to build on the}} goodwill created by season 4 of S.H.I.E.L.D. presenting an interesting concept and world to be explored". McCown-Levy continued the praise, saying [...] "This could’ve been a sodden slog through too-obvious reveals and portentous doom and gloom. Instead, S.H.I.E.L.D. kept its fleet and efficient pacing, but bent it to the service of a dark and compelling narrative arc already paying dividends in terms of rewarding long-time viewers with deep-pull references and stories". Fitzpatrick, however, felt the episode [...] "stumbled" [...] and was [...] "something of a bumpy reentry into season 4, and doubly so for anyone who lost sight of the Life Model Decoy conflict in play, or harbor concern ABC might not order a fifth season." [...] He found it difficult to determine the rules at play in the Framework, and felt the storyline was done more so because the [...] "producers missed working with Brett Dalton".|$|E

500|$|Civil disobedience as non-violent protest {{or civil}} {{resistance}} are also acts of conscience, but are designed {{by those who}} undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity). Civil disobedience, in a properly functioning democracy, allows a minority who feel strongly that a law infringes their sense of justice (but have no capacity to obtain legislative amendments or {{a referendum on the}} issue) to make a potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the intensity of opposing views. A notable example of civil resistance or satyagraha ("satya" [...] in sanskrit means [...] "truth and compassion", [...] "agraha" [...] means [...] "firmness of will") involved Mahatma Gandhi making salt in India when that act was prohibited by a British statute, in order to create moral pressure for law reform. Rosa Parks similarly acted on conscience in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama refusing a legal order to give up her seat to make room for a white passenger; her action (and the similar earlier act of 15-year-old Claudette Colvin) leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rachel Corrie was a US citizen allegedly killed by a bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while involved in direct action (based on the non-violent principles of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi) to prevent demolition of the home of local Palestinian pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. Al Gore has argued [...] "If you're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being <b>done</b> <b>right</b> now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration." [...] In 2011, NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen, environmental leader Phil Radford and Professor Bill McKibben were arrested for opposing a tar sands oil pipeline and Canadian renewable energy professor Mark Jaccard was arrested for opposing mountain-top coal mining; in his book Storms of my Grandchildren Hansen calls for similar civil resistance on a global scale to help replace the 'business-as-usual' Kyoto Protocol cap and trade system, with a progressive carbon tax at emission source on the oil, gas and coal industries – revenue being paid as dividends to low carbon footprint families.|$|E
