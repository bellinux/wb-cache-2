Inserted in this context, we investigated the syntheses of novel organic ligands and the respective metal complexes, to be applied for ethylene and propylene oligomerisation. A group of tridentate imino-ligands was synthesised, which includes the 2, 6 -bis(imino) pyridines 1 - 2, the 2, 6 -diacetyl-monoiminopyridine 3, the iminophosphines 16, and the imidazo[1, 5 -a]pyridines 23 c and 24 a, and others, obtaining a range of different N,N,N- or N,N,O- or N,N,P-ligands through variation of the coordinating backbone and of the substituents. The corresponding iron(II) complexes were then prepared and tested for the ethylene oligomerisation in the presence of MAO as co-catalyst. The 2, 6 -bis(imino) pyridyl-, the 2, 6 -diacetyl-monoiminopyridyl-, and the iminophosphine iron(II) complexes 5 - 7, 17 were active catalysts and gave only linear olefins. Furthermore, different classes of bidentate ligands for nickel(II) complexes were synthesised, which are easily tuneable in their steric and electronic properties; for instance the imidazo[1, 5 -a]pyridines 23 a-b and 24 b-f, the 3 -aminoacrylates 28, 29, and 31, the 3 -aminoiminoacrylates 35 and 37. In particular, the syntheses of the differently substituted 3 -aminoiminoacrylates required to be developed and optimised according to the different substituents at the acrylic backbone and at the aryl rings. The bidentate N,N-ligands 23 a, 24 b-d, 40, and 42 were used in their neutral form to yield the corresponding nickel(II) dibromide complexes. The rest of the ligands was deprotonated with sodium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide to yield their monoanionic form that next reacted with [(PPh 3) 2 Ni(Mes) Br]. Two different classes of neutral nickel(II) complexes were obtained: in one class (45 and 46) the ligands actually coordinate as monodentate through their CN-group, while in the latter class of complexes (47 - 50 and 53) the ligands coordinate as bidentate chelate to the nickel centre. The nickel complexes tested for ethylene oligomerisation gave the best results in the presence of MAO as co-catalyst.

40|$|Introduction: Recently, it {{has been}} shown that the direct {{conversion}} of ethene to propene (ETP-reaction) is an attractive alternative to face the increasing demand of propene [1 - 3]. In this reaction, it is proposed that propene is producing through a sequence of three single chemical reactions [2]. This sequence consists in the dimerization of ethene to 1 -butene in the first step. In the second one, 1 -butene dimerizes to 2 -butene that reacts with another molecule of ethene to produce propene through a metathesis reaction. More recently, {{it has been}} suggested that during the ETP-reaction, propene is participating in other type of reactions [4]. Therefore, in this work a detailed study of the reaction mechanism of the ETP-reaction has been carried out by investigating separately the isomerization of butene isomers, the metathesis of ethene and 2 -butene and the retro-metathesis of propene. In situ DRIFTS characterization was also performed. Experimental: The catalysts synthesis procedure is described in [4]. The following experiments were performed; (a) Isomerization of 1 -butene, cis-butene, trans-butene by feeding a mixture of 2 vol. % of 1 - or cis- or trans-butene with a GHSV of 200 l h- 1 gcat- 1; (b) Metathesis of ethene and 2 -butene (trans- or cis-butene) by feeding a mixture of ethene and trans- or cis-butene with a feed concentration of 2. 5 vol. % for each olefin, GHSV 1. 4 h- 1 gcat- 1; (c) Metathesis of propene was carried out by feeding a mixture of 5 vol. % propene in nitrogen, GHSV 1. 4 h- 1 gcat- 1. All experiments were performed in a fixed-bed reactor consisting of a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 0. 6 cm at atmospheric pressure. The temperature was changed from 50 to 475 °C. The feed and reaction products were analyzed by on-line CG/MS. In situ DRIFTS was done for ETP-experiments by feeding to a DRIFTS cell a mixture of 2. 5 % of ethene in nitrogen. The DRIFTS spectra were collected at different temperature without interrupting the ethene feed. Results and short discussion No side reactions were observed in the isomerization of cis- and trans-butene. The contrary was observed in the isomerization of 1 -butene. The occurrence of the isomerization of butene confirms the acidity of the catalysts. No catalytic cracking of butene was observed because of the modest acidity of the catalysts. Metathesis of ethene and butenes did not produce propene as main reaction product, indicating that Ni/AlMCM- 41 catalysts are not efficient catalysts in metathesis reactions. This behavior was confirmed by feeding propene into the reactor (the retro-metathesis of propene), where the main reaction products were <b>hexenes</b> isomers. The in situ DRIFTS experiments confirmed the formation of oligomeric species on the surface of the catalyst during the ETP-reaction. This type of compounds might be precursor for different carbon species that were observed in the ETP-reaction [4]. The results obtained in this work strongly suggest that a conjunct polymerization (hydropolimerization) is taking place, where propene is one of the main reaction products at high temperature. This conjunct polymerization yields a product that is a complex mixture of saturated (alkanes and cycloalkanes) and unsaturated (alkanes, alkapolyenes, cycloalkenes, and cycloalkapolyenes) hydrocarbons, and occasionally even aromatic compounds [5]. No metathesis properties could be confirmed on Ni/AlMCM- 41 catalysts. Detailed results will be discussed during the poster session. References [1] M. Iwamoto, Y. Kosugi, J. Phys. Chem.

40|$|Nowadays petroleum, {{attributed}} as the ‘mother of all commodities’, {{accounts for}} 35 % of energy consumption, 95 % {{of the transportation}} fuels and 100 % {{of a large number}} of industrially important chemicals and materials. The increasing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere due to fossil hydrocarbon combustion has reached alarming levels urging the use of renewable carbon resources for fuels and chemicals. In chemical industry strategies are being developed for producing chemicals from biomass capable to replace petroleum-derived chemicals. Approaches are typically based on fermentation, gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis from carbon monoxide and hydrogen produced from biomass. Ethers are an important class of chemical compounds that can be derived from biomass. They find lots of applications as fuel additives, inert solvent for specialty applications as well as chemical reactions, fragrance and flavor additives, medical ingredients, anesthetics, etc. Etherification of secondary olefins to produce fuel ethers is reported in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic processes in gas phase as well as liquid phase conditions. But the etherification of α-olefins is less documented in literature. The goal of this work was to develop a liquid phase, heterogeneous catalytic process for the etherification of typical Fischer - Tropsch α-olefins and monoterpenes for use as fuel additives and specialty solvents. Fischer - Tropsch C 6 -C 10 α-olefins are not useful as such and require upgrading process like isomerization for use as fuel. 1 -Hexene, 1 -octene and 1 -decene were selected as model compounds and ethanol as the model bio-alcohol. The reactions were performed at high pressure (6 MPa) to maintain the reaction mixture in liquid state. Zeolites were identified as prospective catalysts. Zeolite beta with Si/Al ratio of 19 was found to be an excellent catalyst for hydroalkoxylation reactions. Identification of reaction products using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and NMR revealed unique selectivity. Etherification reaction of 1 -hexene with ethanol could be performed using an equimolar feed at low temperature, viz. 423 K. Ethoxy hexanes were the major product with ca. 90 % selectivity with respect to 1 -hexene. 2 -Ethoxy hexane was the majority product. Side reactions such as dehydration of ethanol to form diethyl ether, oligomerization of <b>hexenes</b> and hydration of 1 -hexene to form 2 -hexanol were suppressed. Similar product profiles, activities and selectivities were observed for the etherification of 1 -octene and 1 -decene with ethanol. Etherification of 1 -hexene with higher bio-alcohols viz. 1 -propanol and 1 -butanol was also demonstrated. While selectivity for etherification was always excellent, the conversion did not surpass 60 % typically, even with optimized reaction conditions. For the isomerization of 1 -hexene to internal isomers, thermodynamic equilibrium composition was achieved in the absence of 1 -propanol in the feed while presence of 1 -propanol prevented the achievement of equilibrium. For the etherification reaction, a limitation of the maximum achievable conversion by unfavorable thermodynamic equilibrium was evidenced using computational chemistry methods. Terpenes are a class of natural olefins, the ethers of which are valuable to the perfume industry. In view of the immense applications of terpene ethers as fragrance and flavor additives, specialty solvents like in development of photopolymerizable printing plates, etc., etherification of monoterpene β-citronellene with bio-alcohols was also investigated. β-citronellene is a monoterpene containing two types of double bonds, one terminal α-double bond and an internal β-double bond. Among the different zeolites tested, zeolite beta (Si/Al 19) profiled again to be the best. The etherification reaction was found to occur mostly at the β-double bond with a chemoselectivity of ca. 90 %, which was found out by Density Functional calculations to be due to the difference in stability of the carbocations formed on protonation of the two double bonds. Under optimized conditions, maximum citronellene conversions of ca. 50 % with ca. 80 % selectivity for etherification was achieved, which was also found to be limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. Citronellene isomerization and dimerization were the side reactions occurring. In order to identify the reasons for the superior activity of zeolite beta and in general for identifying the prerequisites for a successful hydroalkoxylation catalyst, physicochemical properties of the catalysts were investigated along with performing experiments with selectively poisoned catalysts. Acid site poisons 2, 4, 6 -collidine and 2, 6 -ditertiarybutyl pyridine cannot enter the channels of the zeolite and hence selectively poison the external surface and pore mouth acid sites. Poisoned catalysts exhibited negligible activity indicating the role of pore mouth and external surface acid sites in etherification reactions. Overall this work highlighted the superior activity and selectivity of zeolite beta in hydroalkoxylation of FT α-olefins and monoterpenes using alcohols which can be produced from biomass via fermentation. Zeolite beta particles are composed of very small crystallites measuring hardly 40 nm each. A zeolite material with such very short channels offers a large number of pore mouths, revealed to be the locus of the catalytic activity. 13 C NMR investigations substantiated the occurrence of pore mouth catalysis mechanism induced by competitive adsorption phenomena. The attractiveness of a continuous flow, fixed bed, liquid phase process to produce chemicals out of biomass in replacement of petrochemical derived commodities like fuel additives, specialty solvents, fragrance and flavor additives is an example of greening of the chemical industry.
