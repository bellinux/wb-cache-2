The incidence of leaf browning, associated with Alternaria spp. and Botrytis cinerea, was less in 1989 and 1990 than in 1988 when the period, in July, between flowering and harvest was wet, but the incidence of powdery mildew was greater in 1989 and 1990 than in 1988. Fungicide sprays decreased leaf browning in 1988 and powdery mildew in 1990. In 1988 there were more capsules per plant and the crop was taller than in either 1990 or 1989, when July and August were hot with periods of dry weather.

50|$|Planting date {{refers to}} the date that the seed is sown. This concept is of prime {{importance}} in growing soybeans because yields are strongly correlated with planting date. Data from Iowa State University shows that earlier planted soybeans tend to have higher yields than soybeans planted later in the growing season.

Other special considerations include soil pathogens, insect pressure, {{and the possibility of}} frost. <b>Fungicide</b> <b>treatment</b> and insecticide treatment are options used to help reduce the risk of soil pathogens and insect pressure.

50|$|Downy mildew {{is a major}} {{disease of}} onion. The {{pathogen}} persists as mycelium systemically infecting onion bulbs, but is not known to be transmitted in onion seed. The pathogen can persist in the soil for several years as oospores. Systemically infected plants are dwarfed and pale green. Under moist conditions, the pathogen sporulates on the affected tissues and spreads to other plants, on the leaves and stalks of which it forms greyish-violet local lesions. Infected leaves are often entirely killed. Critical periods for infection have been determined. Infected crops yield poorly, and produce distorted bulbs. Control is by crop rotation (at least 3 years between successive onion crops), use of healthy bulbs for planting (heat treatment {{has been used to}} eliminate the pathogen from bulbs), <b>fungicide</b> <b>treatment</b> of the bulbs for planting, and fungicide sprays of the foliage if downy mildew infection is nevertheless observed.|$|E

5000|$|Scouting and foliar fungicides: It is {{important}} to scout for early symptoms and the progression of the disease with respect to its growth stages to {{determine the amount of}} fungicides, if any, that should be applied to the infected plant. If, at the flowering stage, symptoms do spread below the lower third of the plant canopy, then the risk of yield loss is low and <b>fungicide</b> <b>treatment</b> is unnecessary. Fungicides are warranted when a combination of half of the lower third of the plant canopy is infected and is spreading to the middle, the weather forecast is rainy and humid, and a high yield would justify the fungicide cost. Despite fungicide application having benefits or not to the yield of crops, some may choose to do so to at least protect the seed quality.

50|$|Clearing or {{ploughing}} in the stubble, grass {{weeds and}} volunteer cereals reduce inoculum as does crop rotation (Diehl et al., 1982). Reis et al. (1998) indicate that eradicant <b>fungicide</b> <b>treatment</b> of the seed and crop rotation with non-host crops can control spot blotch. In the rice-wheat system of South Asia, little {{work has been}} done on the epidemiology of HLB and how management of the rotation crops affects spot blotch and tan spot, except as noted earlier. More quantitative information is required on the role of alternate rotations, soil and plant nutrition, inoculum sources and climate. In the rice-wheat system, {{there is a need for}} timely planting of wheat, better stand establishment and root development, increased soil organic matter, sufficient levels of macro- and micronutrients, and water and weed management (Hobbs et al., 1996; Hobbs and Giri, 1997). Crop rotation and organic manures will play a major role in HLB. This should favour beneficial soil organisms as well as better plant nutrition. In the rice-wheat system, it will be necessary to break the rotation with other crops to make it more sustainable, and this should help reduce disease problems in general. The use of oilseed rape in South Asia is common in mixture with wheat or in rotation. Since rape is known to have some fungitoxic effects upon decay, its effects on HLB would need research (Dubin and Duveiller, 2000). In the HLB complex, rotations would need to be sufficiently long to reduce the amount of soil inoculum. Cook and Veseth (1991) note that the kind of rotation crop may not be so important to root health as the length of time out of wheat. The rotation crops and length of rotation would have to be studied in relation to HLB.|$|E
