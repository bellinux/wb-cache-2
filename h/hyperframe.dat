30|$|Let us {{consider}} two ocean-going ships, ships A and B, to explain EASO-TDMA. Ship A {{is located at}} a position where {{it is able to}} receive the base station’s signal, while ship B is not directly connected to the base station and transfers its data to the base station via ship A in an ad hoc manner. Then, ship B is defined as ship A’s subscribing ship. Let us also consider a <b>hyperframe</b> and a superframe in EASO-TDMA, which correspond to the frame and sub-frame in ASO-TDMA, respectively. In EASO-TDMA, a ship determines adaptively the number of allocated time slots according to the number of subscribing ships, in order to ease the bottleneck problem. To do this, the ship checks the routing table to obtain the information of the number of its subscribing ships {{at the end of the}} current <b>hyperframe</b> and determines the number of allocated time slots for the next <b>hyperframe.</b> In addition, a ship can allocate time slots at all superframes in EASO-TDMA, whereas it can do so only at the available sub-frames in ASO-TDMA. This enables data transfer between the source and the destination to be done during one <b>hyperframe,</b> and this can reduce the overall end-to-end delay. Accordingly, it is expected that EASO-TDMA can outperform ASO-TDMA in terms of the reception success rate, collision rate, end-to-end delay, and channel utilization.|$|E

30|$|The {{number of}} time slots that are {{allocated}} by {{the base station}} is given as 300 per <b>hyperframe</b> (or frame) for the two MAC protocols. In addition, the number of allocated time slots per sub-frame for ASO-TDMA is given as ten {{in order to make}} it equal to the number of allocated time slots per superframe in the SOHF for EASO-TDMA.|$|E
30|$|The {{reception}} {{success rate}}: EASO-TDMA has a 15 % higher reception success rate than ASO-TDMA on average. The maximum margin is around 25 %, {{as shown in}} Figure 8 a. The reception success rate of the two MAC protocols decreases {{as the number of}} active ships increases. On the other hand, the reception success rate first decreases and then bottoms out with increasing number of packets generated per <b>hyperframe.</b> This implies that the reception success rate mainly depends on the number of active nodes, which increases the possibility of receiver collisions among hidden ships by allocating the same time slots.|$|E
40|$|The film {{discourse}} has constantly {{fought to}} adapt and struggle with the competitor screens that have arisen with the digital revolution, which has transformed its own texture. We can sort these transformations in two large kinds.

On the other hand, the cinema postclassic chooses the deconstruction of the narrative linearity and the deployment of different plots and levels of action and representation that lead us to the notion of hipernarration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{article is}} devoted to the {{cognitive}} modelling of modality on the basis of information-content structure of the English short story text. The cognitive, modal and textual functions interaction may be represented as the hierarchical systerm of textual modality <b>hyperframe,</b> which comprises as essential parts frames of referential and subjective modalities. In its turn, the referential modality frame as the basic layer of the text content embraces the scenes and scenarios of subject, action/state, object, temporality and locality. The subjective modality frame is subdivided into subjective–personal (author – text) and subjective–interpersonal (author – recipient) modalities. Correspondingly, the former consists of the scenes of sensor, emotive (psychic reaction), mental, evaluative and compositional modalities; the latter implies the epistemic, axiological and deontic modalities. The provided textual analysis reveals the interaction of language units of different levels (phonetic, lexical, grammatical, syntactical), activating frames of referential and subjective modalities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{our current}} research about an open framework layered development architecture. The objective {{of our research}} program is to capture design principles for adaptable, flexible, and composable open software systems in particular domains. Furthermore, these open systems are presented in terms of frameworks {{that allow us to}} define the basic elements or kernel of a number of related applications associated with a domain, and then reuse these elements or kernel in the development of members of this application family. This research concentrates on the methodology, the tools and techniques, and the theoretical foundation associated with the development of such architecture. One of the domains for which this architecture will be instantiated and built is hypermedia authoring. The specification of this case study is the main goal of this paper. We will describe the general architecture for framework construction and then instantiate it for the case of <b>HyperFrame,</b> a hypermedia-authoring framework. The framework {{can be seen as a}} process-centered software engineering environment that uses the OOHDM method as the development process...|$|E

40|$|Postnatal {{development}} of the internal auditory canal (lAC) was investigated in 20 normal human temporal bones obtained from individuals 1 month to 72 years old. Computer-aided three-dimensional reconstIUction and measurement of bones showed that the superior, inferior, anterior, and posteriorwaIls ofthe lAC lengthen significantly from birth until about 10 years ofage, withdevelopment mainly attributable to lengthening of {{the part of the}} lAC medial to the foramen singulare. The lengths of the part of thelAC lateral to the foramen singulare and ofthe transverse crest and Bill's bar did not appear to develop postnatally. The lAC diameter increasedslightly at the porus for about the first year afterbirth, but not at the fundus or the middle portion of the canal. 'Ibis (meting was confirmed by studying the shape of the lAC. Postnatal increases in the volume of the lAC followed patterns similar to that of increases in length of the lAC walls. These results show that postnatally the lAC increases significantly in length until about 10 years of age and slightly in diameter until about 1 year ofage, especially medial to the foramen singulare. This concentration ofgrowth ofthe lAC mediallyimplies that its postnatal development is mainly due to growth of the bone around the otic capsule, which hasimplications for lAC surgery.
