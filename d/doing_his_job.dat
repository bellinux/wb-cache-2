5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Cleveland {{was faced with}} the task of filling all the {{government}} jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> well, and would not appoint anyone {{solely on the basis of}} party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E

Hampered by injury in his first three seasons at the new club, including a groin injury in 1997, he played all 22 games in 1998 and won named the club champion by one vote from Adrian Fletcher.

Zoë dies shortly after landing and Artemis makes a constellation in her honor. The rest of the group then heads for Olympus.|$|E

500|$|Ripken spent 1960 {{with the}} Fox Cities Foxes of the Class B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League, {{known as the}} Three-I League. He had his best season that year, batting a career-high [...]281 with 100 hits, nine home runs, and 74 RBI. Earl Weaver, {{eventually}} a Hall of Fame manager for the Orioles but manager of Fox Cities in 1960, recalled, [...] "He was hitting over [...]300 until our team bus driver quit and Cal started <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> too. The 15-hour bus trips were strenuous work, but Rip always was hard as nails -- toughness personified." [...] During spring training in 1961, he suffered an injury after several foul tips went off his shoulder. Initial X-rays showed nothing, but three months into the season {{it was discovered that}} Ripken had a dislocated shoulder, an atrophied deltoid muscle, and a tendon problem. He continued to play, but the injury was one which would take years to fully recover from, and his son, Cal Jr., wrote, [...] "Practically speaking, if my father wanted to stay in the game he'd have to shift his sights from playing to coaching and managing." [...] He played with three teams in 1961: the Class D Leesburg Orioles of the Florida State League, the Double-A Little Rock Travelers of the Southern Association, and the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings of the International League. The stint with Rochester came because the Red Wings were in desperate need of a catcher; although Ripken could catch and handle pitchers, the injury had robbed him of the ability to throw well. He appeared in 58 games with the Class D Appleton Foxes in 1962, and played his final games in 1964, when made two appearances for the Class A Aberdeen Pheasants of the Northern League.|$|E

Ferguson was subsequently charged by The FA with improper conduct, which he decided to contest.

[...] On the other hand, Chairman Gunnar Jahn of the Nobel Peace prize committee lobbied heavily against giving Thant the prize which was at the last minute awarded to UNICEF. The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to Thant. The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given, with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to Thant.

In 2006, Rove personally told Weh that Iglesias had been dismissed. Weh was dissatisfied with Iglesias {{due in part to}} his failure to indict New Mexico State Senator Manny Aragon on fraud and conspiracy charges. After Iglesias was dismissed, his replacement, Acting U.S. Attorney Larry Gomez brought a 26 count felony indictment against Aragon. In a plea bargain, Aragon plead guilty to three felony fraud counts. Weh followed up with, [...] "There’s nothing we’ve done that's wrong. It wasn’t that Iglesias wasn’t looking out for Republicans. He just wasn’t <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> period.”" [...] White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said that Rove [...] "wasn’t involved in {{who was going to be}} fired or hired".|$|E
