5|$|The {{extent of}} Zenobia's {{territorial}} control during her early reign is debated; according to <b>historian</b> Fergus Millar, her authority {{was confined to}} Palmyra and Emesa until 270. If this was the case, the events of 270 (which saw Zenobia's conquest of the Levant and Egypt) are extraordinary. It {{is more likely that}} the queen ruled the territories controlled by her late husband, a view supported by Southern and <b>historian</b> , and backed by ancient sources (such as the Roman <b>historian</b> Eutropius, who wrote that the queen inherited her husband's power). The Augustan History also mentioned that Zenobia took control of the East during Gallienus' reign.

40|$|What was {{the nature}} of Britain’s {{interests}} in the Gulf Arab states before their independence from Britain, and how did Britain protect those interests? These are questions that <b>historians</b> of the Middle East have examined at length, but this examination has taken place completely outside of a wider debate about British imperialism that has occupied <b>historians</b> of Africa, India, Latin America, and China. <b>Historians</b> of the Middle East, and the Gulf in particular, have largely overlooked the theories about {{the nature of}} imperialism that these other <b>historians</b> have developed.
