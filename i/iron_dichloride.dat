40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 53 - 55) A {{series of}} bis-phosphinite and bis-phosphite PONOP iron complexes were prepared and characterized by NMR and IR. Bis-phosphinite PONOP <b>iron</b> <b>dichlorides</b> [(RPONOP) FeCl 2 (RPONOP= 2, 6 -(R 2 PO) 2 (C 5 H 3 N); R=iPr, tBu) ] were prepared through complexation {{of the free}} ligands with FeCl 2 and their solid-state structures were determined by X-ray diffraction. Bis-phosphite PONOP iron complexes [(OEtPONOP) Fe(PMe 3) 2 and (CatPONOP) Fe(PMe 3) 2; (Cat=catechol) ] were synthesized through complexation of the free ligands to Fe(PMe 3) 4. Carbonyl complexes of both bis-phosphinite and bis-phosphite PONOP were prepared and characterized by IR. The monocarbonyl (iPrPONOP) Fe(CO) Cl 2 was accessed through exposure of (iPrPONOP) FeCl 2 to an atmosphere of CO and the solid-state structure was determined by X-ray diffraction. The CO stretching frequency was observed at 1969 cm- 1. Dicarbonyl complexes (iPrPONOP) Fe(CO) 2 and (OEtPONOP) Fe(CO) 2 were accessed through reduction of the corresponding chloride complexes with sodium amalgam under a CO atmosphere. Carbonyl stretching frequencies for (iPrPONOP) Fe(CO) 2 and (OEtPONOPFe) (CO) 2 were observed at 1824 and 1876 cm- 1, and at 1871 and 1927 cm- 1 respectively. The bis-phosphite PONOP complexes exhibit a more oxidized metal center than the bis-phosphinite PONOP complexes, {{as would be expected}} for the stronger ??-acceptor character of these ligands. The electronic properties of the bis-phosphinite PONOP and bis-phosphite PONOP iron complexes are intermediate between previously reported PNP and PDI structures, with the PONOP ligands exhibiting stronger electron donating ability than PDI ligands, but promoting a more oxidized metal center than found in analogous PNP iron complexes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} paper, the {{synthesis}} of new pyridine bis(imine) ligands modified with halogens (Cl, Br, CF 3) or alkyl groups (Heptyl, tert-butyl, Phenyl, [...] .) is reported. When coordinated with <b>iron</b> or cobalt <b>dichloride,</b> they yielded complexes which were associated to methylaluminoxane (MAO) to achieve the polymerization of ethylene. It was shown that cobalt catalysts are generally {{more sensitive to the}} ligand substitutions than the iron ones. The addition of a chlorine atom on the ligand frame is generally unfavorable. On the contrary, the presence of a bromine atom seems more favorable. Phenyl rings lead to almost completely inactive catalysts, probably because of a too weak coordination to the metal. It was also demonstrated that a mono-substitution of the aryl groups with an electron-withdrawing group (-CF 3) is sufficient to yield polymers, whereas, considering the bulkiness of this substituent only, oligomers would have been expecte...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{describe}} the synthesis of two new pyridine-bis(imine) s { 4 -chloro- 2, 6 -bis[1 -(2, 6 -diisopropylphenylimino) ethyl]pyridine and 2, 6 -bis[1 -(2, 6 -dimethylcyclohexylimino) ethyl]pyridine} and their complexation with <b>iron</b> and cobalt <b>dichloride.</b> The solid-state structure of the iron complexes was solved and found to be very close to catalysts already described by Brookhart and Gibson. Their ability to polymerize ethylene was investigated after activation with MAO. It was thus shown that the substitution of the pyridine ring of the ligand is unfavorable: their catalytic activity is rather low. The replacement of the aromatic rings on the imine functions by dimethylcyclohexyl rings resulted in a complete loss of activity of the iron complex for oligomerization and polymerization of ethylene. With the cobalt analog, polymerization of ethylene could be achieved under the same conditions. ((c) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2006) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} mixed tetradentate ligands associating two iminophosphorane {{moieties}} with two phosphino, thiophosphino, or phosphine oxide groups (labelled 2, 3, and 4 respectively) {{have been prepared}} from the corresponding aminophosphonium derivatives. Their coordination to the <b>iron</b> <b>dichloride</b> metal fragment was achieved using the [FeCl 2 (THF) 1. 5] precursor leading to [(P 2 N 2) FeCl 2] (5), [(S 2 N 2) FeCl 2] (6), and [(O 2 N 2) FeCl 2] (7). These complexes were shown to be paramagnetic. Moreover, those ligands can act as bi, tri or tetradentate, as evidenced by X-ray structure analysis of the complexes, depending {{on the nature of}} the pendant PY coordinating ligand (Y = lone pair, S, O). Indeed, while only one phosphorus atom is coordinated to iron in 5 (PNN coordination), no thiophosphine moiety is connected to Fe in 6 (NN coordination), whereas both phosphine oxide arms are linked to the metal in 7 (ONNO) coordination. For ligand 2, coordination reactions were also performed with a non-chlorinated iron precursor (either [Fe(CH 3 CN) 6](BF 4) 2 or [Fe(H 2 O) 6](BF 4) 2) leading to complexes 8 and 9 depending on the reaction conditions.

40|$|In {{previous}} work {{we have found}} that Cp 2 TiCl 2 and its corresponding deriv. of tamoxifen, Titanocene tamoxifen, show an unexpected proliferative effect on hormone dependent breast cancer cells MCF- 7. In order to check if this behavior is a general trend for titanocene derivs. we have tested two other titanocene derivs., Titanocene Y and Titanocene K, on this cell line. Interestingly, these two titanocene complexes behave in a totally different manner. Titanocene K is highly proliferative on MCF- 7 cells even at low concns. (0. 5. mu. M), thus behave almost similarly to Cp 2 TiCl 2. This proliferative effect is also obsd. in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA). In contrast, Titanocene Y alone has almost no effect on MCF- 7 at a concn. of 10. mu. M, but exhibits a significant dose dependent cytotoxic effect of up to 50 % when incubated with BSA (20 - 50. mu. g/mL). This confirms the crucial role played by the binding to serum proteins in the expression of the in vivo, cytotoxicity of the titanocene complexes.

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structure of a}} family comprising tetrahedral (α-diimine) <b>iron</b> <b>dichloride,</b> and tetrahedral bis(α-diimine) iron compounds has been investigated by Mössbauer spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and X-ray crystallography. In addition, broken-symmetry density functional theoretical (B 3 LYP) calculations have been performed. A detailed understanding of the {{electronic structure}} of these complexes has been obtained. A paramagnetic (S_t = 2), tetrahedral complex [Fe^(II) (^ 4 L) _ 2], where (^ 4 L) ^(1 −) represents the diamagnetic monoanion N-tert-butylquinolinylamide, has been synthesized and characterized {{to serve as a}} benchmark for a Werner-type complex containing a tetrahedral Fe^(II) N_ 4 geometry and a single high-spin ferrous ion. In contrast to the most commonly used description of the electronic structure of bis(α-diimine) iron(0) complexes as low-valent iron(0) species with two neutral α-diimine ligands, it is established here that they are, in fact, complexes containing two (α-diiminato) ^(1 −•) π radical monoanions and a high-spin ferrous ion (in tetrahedral N_ 4 geometry) (S_(Fe) = 2). Intramolecular antiferromagnetic coupling between the π radical ligands (S_(rad) = 1 / 2) and the ferrous ion (S_(Fe) = 2) yields the observed S_t = 1 ground state. The study confirms that α-diimines are redox noninnocent ligands with an energetically low-lying antibonding π^* lowest unoccupied molecular orbital which can accept one or two electrons from a transition metal ion. The (α-diimine) FeCl_ 2 complexes (St = 2) are shown to contain a neutral α-diimine ligand, a high spin ferrous ion, and two chloride ligands...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{of a family}} of para-substituted pyridine di(imine) ligands, and their corresponding iron dihalide, dicarbonyl and dinitrogen complexes are described. The influence of the substituents on the electronic structure of each derivative was investigated using a combination of X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, infrared, Mößbauer, and NMR spectroscopies as well as density functional theory. No dramatic changes to the electronic structure description were observed {{as a result of the}} para-substituent. However, significant differences in catalytic activity were observed for the hydrogenation of olefins and the [2 [pi] + 2 [pi]] cycloaddition of [alpha],[omega]-heptadienes, and were also found to be substrate dependent. The electronic structure and catalytic activity of a structurally related pyridine di(carbene) complex, (iPrCNC) Fe(N 2) 2 was investigated. The spectroscopic data establish that (iPrCNC) Fe(N 2) 2 and several of its derivatives are redox non-innocent. They are best described as hybrid structures with [(iPrCNC 0) Fe 0] and [(iPrCNC 2 -) FeII] resonance forms with the iPrCNC ligand acting as a [pi]-acceptor. The activity of (iPrCNC) Fe(N 2) 2 for the catalytic hydrogenation of olefins and [2 [pi] + 2 [pi]] cyclization of [alpha],[omega]-diolefins was also investigated. (iPrCNC) Fe(N 2) 2 exhibited hydrogenation activities that were consistent with the trends observed in pyridine di(imine) iron olefin hydrogenation, but exhibited no activity for the [2 [pi] + 2 [pi]] cycloaddition of [alpha],[omega]-heptadienes. Isotopic experiments indicated that a competitive, unproductive 2, 1 -insertion pathway or a vinylic C-H activation mechanism was responsible for the deviation in hydrogenation activity trends observed with 1, 1 -diphenylethylene and the electron-rich iron catalysts. A series of dialkyl dinitrogen complexes were prepared from treatment of (iPrCNC) FeBr 2 with two equivalents of the corresponding alkyl lithium reagent. The iron dialkyl dinitrogen complexes were characterized by infrared, NMR and Mößbauer spectroscopies as low-spin, ferrous compounds. One member of the series, (iPrCNC) Fe(CH 3) 2 (N 2) underwent extrusion of ethane at 23 [MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR]C. The mechanism of this transformation was investigated by isotopic cross-over experiments. The dimeric iron bis(dinitrogen) complex, [(MeBPDI) Fe(N 2) ] 2 ([MICRO SIGN] 2 -N 2) was prepared by sodium naphthalenide reduction of the corresponding <b>iron</b> <b>dichloride.</b> This complex was established to be more susceptible to contamination by THF complexes, and underwent the irreversible formation of [eta] 6 -arene species in solution. [(MeBPDI) Fe(N 2) ] 2 ([MICRO SIGN] 2 -N 2) and (iPrBPDI) Fe(N 2) 2 exhibited remarkably lower activity for the hydrogenation of ethyl 3, 3 dimethylacrylate relative to (iPrPDI) Fe(N 2) 2. NMR studies and stoichiometric experiments established that this was due to the more electrophilic iron center as engendered by the BPDI chelate, resulting in a greater affinity for carbonyl coordination. A family of bis(oxazoline) iron dialkyl complexes were prepared by treatment of their ferrous dihalide precursors with the appropriate alkyl lithium reagent and examined for the asymmetric hydrosilylation of ketones using PhSiH 3 as the stoichiometric reductant. While these complexes expressed high levels of activity, low enantiomeric inductions were observed regardless of the identity of the auxiliary ligand or the alkyl substituent. Activation of these complexes in situ using B(C 6 F 5) 3 resulted in higher levels of enantiomeric induction; however, synthetically useful e. e. 's were not observed...|$|E
