25|$|From the 1920s to the 1940s, Long Island {{began the}} {{transformation}} from backwoods and farms as developers created numerous suburbs. Numerous {{branches of the}} LIRR already enabled commuting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> to Manhattan. Robert Moses engineered various automobile parkway projects to span the island, and developed beaches and state parks for the enjoyment of residents and visitors from the city. Gradually, development also followed these parkways, with various communities springing up along the more traveled routes.|$|E

25|$|Private {{investment}} in downtown Albany saw {{an influx of}} restaurants, bars, and nightclubs; especially on Pearl Street and the first new office high rise in 15 years was built on Broadway.

Along with Proctor's being expanded, two new hotels, a large movie theater, and the headquarters of Price Chopper moving Downtown <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> of neighboring Rotterdam, that section has seen a huge revival.|$|E
25|$|In 1848, {{a series}} of tumultuous {{revolutions}} swept across Europe. The resulting political turmoil would affect Semmelweis's career. In Vienna on 13 March 1848 students demonstrated in favor of increased civil rights, including trial by jury and freedom of expression. The demonstrations were led by medical students and young faculty members and were joined by workers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs.</b> Two days later in Hungary, demonstrations and uprisings led to the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and a full-scale war against the ruling Habsburgs of the Austrian Empire. In Vienna, the March demonstration was followed by months of general unrest.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, Amiens {{began to}} feel {{the effects of the}} {{industrial}} revolution, an became known worldwide thanks to the quality of its textile production. The city walls were demolished, opening up space for large boulevards around the town centre. The Henriville quarter in the south of the city was developed around this time, on the plots of the hospices of Amiens, far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> of Saint-Honore and Saint-Acheul. The Rue de la RÃ©publique was created and became a street of power and knowledge, with the erection of the municipal library and the Picardie Museum, as well as the installation of the prefecture.|$|E

25|$|William Penn grew {{up during}} the rule of Oliver Cromwell, who succeeded in leading a Puritan {{rebellion}} against King Charles I; the king was beheaded when Penn was age 5. Penn's father was often at sea. Little William caught smallpox at a young age, losing all his hair (he wore a wig until he left college), prompting his parents to move <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> to an estate in Essex. The country life made a lasting impression on young Penn, and kindled in him a love of horticulture. Their neighbour was famed diarist Samuel Pepys, who was friendly at first but later secretly hostile to the Admiral, perhaps embittered in part by his failed seductions of both Penn's mother and his sister Peggy.|$|E

25|$|Embark (formerly METRO Transit) is the city's {{public transit}} company. The main {{transfer}} terminal is downtown at NW 5th Street and Hudson Avenue. Embark maintains limited {{coverage of the}} city's main street grid using a hub-and-spoke system from the main terminal, making many journeys impractical due to the rather small number of bus routes offered and that most trips require a transfer downtown. The city has recognized transit as a major issue for the rapidly growing and urbanizing city and has initiated several studies in recent times to improve upon the existing bus system starting with a plan known as the Fixed Guideway Study. This study identified several potential commuter transit routes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> into downtown OKC as well as feeder-line bus and/or rail routes throughout the city.|$|E

25|$|Los Angeles had racial {{restrictive}} covenants {{that prevented}} blacks and Mexican Americans from renting and buying in certain areas, even {{long after the}} courts ruled them illegal in 1948. Since {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, Los Angeles has been geographically divided by ethnicity. In the 1910s, the city was already 80% covered by racially restrictive covenants in real estate. By the 1940s, 95% of Los Angeles and southern California housing was off-limits to African Americans and Asians. Minorities who had served in World War II or worked in L.A.'s defense industries returned to face increasing patterns of discrimination in housing. In addition, they found themselves excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> and restricted to housing in East or South Los Angeles, which includes the Watts neighborhood and Compton. Such real-estate practices severely restricted educational and economic opportunities available to the minority community.|$|E
25|$|Though Oklahoma City has no light-rail or {{commuter}} rail service, city residents identified improved transit {{as one of}} their top priorities and from the fruits of the Fixed Guideway and other studies city leaders strongly desire to incorporate urban rail transit into the region's future transportation plans. The greater Oklahoma City metropolitan transit plan identified from the Fixed Guideway Study includes streetcar in the downtown section that would be fed by enhanced city bus service and {{commuter rail}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> including Edmond, Norman, and Midwest City. There is a significant push for a commuter rail line connecting downtown OKC with the eastern suburbs of Del City, Midwest City, and Tinker Air Force Base. In addition to commuter rail, a short heritage rail line that would run from Bricktown just a few blocks away from the Amtrak station to the Adventure District in northeast Oklahoma City is under reconstruction.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "garage rock", {{originally}} used {{in reference}} to 1960s acts, stems from the perception that its performers were young and amateurish, and often rehearsed in the family garage. [...] While numerous bands were made up of middle-class teenagers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs,</b> others were from rural or urban areas or were composed of professional musicians in their twenties.

500|$|The {{smallest}} of Chicago's passenger rail terminals, Grand Central Station {{was a relatively}} quiet place, even during its heyday. [...] Grand Central never became a prominent destination for large numbers of cross-country travelers, nor for the daily waves of commuters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs,</b> that other Chicago terminals were. [...] In 1912, for example, Grand Central served 3,175passengers per dayârepresenting only 4.5 {{percent of the total}} number for the city of Chicagoâand serviced an average of 38trains per day (including 4 B suburban trains). [...] This number paled in comparison to the 146 trains served by Dearborn Station, the 191 by LaSalle Street Station, the 281 at Union Station, the 310 by the Chicago and North Western Terminal and the 373 trains per day at Central Station.|$|E
500|$|Regardless {{how it is}} credited, the {{horsepower}} race {{centered around}} the V8 engine and the muscle-car era lasted until new smog regulations forced dramatic changes in OEM engine design in the early 1970s.

Each year brought larger engines and/or increases in horsepower, providing a catalyst for customers to upgrade to newer models. Automobile executives also deliberately updated the body designs yearly, {{in the name of}} [...] "planned obsolescence" [...] and added newly developed or improved features such as automatic transmissions, power steering, power brakes and cruise control, {{in an effort to make}} the previous models seem outdated and facilitate the long drive <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs.</b> Record sales made the decade arguably the [...] "golden era" [...] of automobile manufacturing.|$|E
