40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} the {{biodegradation}} of salicylate in Pseudomonas putida R 1 has been studied. This strain utilizes the meta pathway for oxidizing salicylate through formation of catechol and 2 -hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. The enzymes of the meta pathway are induced by salicylate but not by catechol, and the genes specifying these enzymes are clustered. The gene cluster can be eliminated from some salicylate-positive cells by treatment with mitomycin C and appears to exist inside the cell as an extrachromosomal element. This <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>gene</b> cluster, termed the SAL plasmid, can be transferred by conjugation from P. putida R 1 {{to a variety of}} other Pseudomonas species...|$|E

In this protocol chapter we describe our work using episomal vectors where {{expression of a}} cDNA is controlled by a 10 kB piece of genomic DNA encompassing the promoter of the low density lipoprotein receptor. We explain methods to sub-clone large genomic inserts into gene {{expression vectors}}. We also illustrate various methods employed to ascertain whether expression from these vectors is robust and physiologically relevant by investigating their sensitivity to changes in cellular milieu.

40|$|The psu {{gene product}} of "phasmid" (phage-plasmid) P 4 {{acts as a}} {{transcription}} antitermination factor in trans and in cis, respectively, within the morphogenic operons of its P 2 phage helper during lytic viral development and on P 4 itself during the establishment stage of its alternative mode of propagation as a plasmid. Here we show that psu also antagonizes activity of the Escherichia coli transcription termination factor rho at the terminator of the trp operon. Such a finding provides to our knowledge the first direct evidence for antitermination activity at a known rho-dependent site by the psu gene product. It also reveals {{an example of an}} <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>gene</b> product that acts on specific sites of three different genomes to regulate expression of unlinked families of genes...|$|E
40|$|Several studies, some {{of which}} have been updated during the recent {{workshop}} entitled Genome Medicine: Gene Therapy for the Millennium (Rome, 30 September- 3 October 2001), have highlighted the usefulness of <b>extrachromosomal</b> or episomal <b>genes</b> in gene targeting strategies. Due to the selectable nature of antibiotic resistance and reporter genes, targeted correction of mutated versions of these <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genes</b> allows an accurate quantification of correction frequency. In addition, these model systems facilitate and speed up the optimization of critical parameters for the successful application of gene targeting approaches. In fact, type of cell line, gene delivery system, molar ratio of episomal target/therapeutic constructs, nature and design of therapeutic complexes and different recombinative proteins may be critical for the actual feasibility of each method. Although virus-based approaches are now being investigated as well, this article is focusing on the targeted correction of <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genes</b> by the use of small DNA fragments (SDF), chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides (RDO) and triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFO) ...|$|R

The phenanthrene-degrading phenotype (Phn+) of AFK 2 disappeared after 20 successive subcultures in a mineral salts medium containing o-phthalate or after subculture in nutrient broth containing mitomycin C.

40|$|The scalded skin {{syndrome}} {{has been}} associated with phage group II staphylococci. The clinical manifestations of {{scalded skin syndrome}}, Ritter's disease, scarlatiniform erythema, and localized bullous impetigo, are due to the production of an extracellular protein, designated exfoliative toxin. Phage group II staphylococci can also produce an extracellular protein, bacteriocin, which is bacteriocidal for specific gram-positive microorganisms. Strain UT 0007 produces both bacteriocin and exfoliative toxin which appear to be products of <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genes.</b> These genes are jointly eliminated from strain UT 0007 after growth in either ethidium bromide or at high temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Particular {{combinations}} of fungal strains and transformation vectors allow for fungal rearrangement of normally integrative plasmids, {{resulting in the}} creation of linear self-replicating plasmids in Fusarium oxysporum. The rearrangement results in the addition of fungal DNA, including telomere consensus sequences, to plasmid termini. The mechanism by which this rearrangement occurs is unclear, but it has similarities to <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>gene</b> amplification. A DNA fragment which allows for linear autonomous replication upon reintroduction to the fungus was subcloned and sequenced. This DNA sequence contains the repeated telomeric sequence TTAGGG flanked by a region of twofold symmetry consisting primarily of pUC 12 DNA. Isolation and identification of this sequence {{is the first step toward}} development of vectors that function as artificial chromosomes in filamentous fungi. This sequence was shown to promote autonomous replication and enhance transformation in several strains of F. oxysporum, Nectria haematococca, and Cryphonectria parasitica...|$|E
40|$|We {{constructed}} substrates {{to study}} gene conversion in mammalian cells specifically without the complication of reciprocal recombination events. These substrates contain both an insertion mutation of the neomycin resistance gene (neoX) and an internal, homologous fragment of the neo gene (neo- 526), such that gene conversion from neo- 526 to neoX restores a functional neo gene. Although two reciprocal recombination events can also produce an intact neo gene, these double recombination events occur much less frequently that gene conversion in mammalian cells, We used our substrates to characterize <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>gene</b> conversion in recombination-deficient bacteria and in monkey COS cells. Chromosomal recombination was also studied after stable integration of these substrates into the genome of mouse 3 T 6 cells. All extrachromosomal and chromosomal recombination events analyzed in mammalian cells resulted from gene conversion. Chromosomal gene conversion events occurred at frequencies of about 10 (- 6) per cell generation and restored a functional neo gene without overall effects on sequence organization...|$|E

Moreover, the organization of these clusters of repeats in the somatic macronucleus is different from that in the germinal micronucleus. In this study we used the exonuclease Bal 31 to show that the repeats are located near free ends of DNA in the macronucleus. When whole cell DNA or macronuclear DNA was digested with Bal 31 to remove approximately 600 base pairs from free ends, 80 % of the C 4 A 2 repeats were removed, as judged by hybridization. Because no particular cluster was resistant to exonuclease digestion, we believe that essentially all the C 4 A 2 repeats are located near free ends of DNA. The C 4 A 2 repeats in the micronucleus, on the other hand, were not digested by Bal 31...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn bacteria, niche {{adaptation}} may {{be determined}} by mobile extrachromosomal elements. A remarkable characteristic of Rhizobium and Ensifer (Sinorhizobium) but also of Agrobacterium species is that {{almost half of the}} genome is contained in several large extrachromosomal replicons (ERs). They encode a plethora of functions, some of them required for bacterial survival, niche adaptation, plasmid transfer or stability. In spite of this, plasmid loss is common in rhizobia upon subculturing. Rhizobial gene-expression studies in plant rhizospheres with novel results from transcriptomic analysis of Rhizobium phaseoli in maize and Phaseolus vulgaris roots highlight the role of ERs in natural niches and allowed the identification of common <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genes</b> expressed in association with plant rootlets and the replicons involved...|$|R

40|$|Two {{thousand}} Bacillus cereus {{sensu lato}} isolates from food and environmental matrices were screened by PCR {{for the presence}} of cereulide-producing strains. This survey identified 73 potential emetic strains, most of which originated from non-random food and clinical samplings. None of the 460 Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus pseudomycoides strains were PCR-positive for the cereulide genetic determinants. The chromosomal and <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>gene</b> pool diversity of a subset of 30 cereulide-producing strains was then assessed using multilocus sequence typing, large plasmid gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization. The strain toxicity on boar sperm and cereulide production were also analysed. The most striking observation was the identification of two distinct clusters of cereulide-producing strains, with members of the second group (cluster II) identified as psychrotolerant B. weihenstephanensis able to grow at 8 degrees C. Moreover, the location of the cereulide genetic determinants was shown to vary depending on the strain, indicating a probable genomic mobility...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMurine Pre- 13 {{lymphocytes}} with experimentally activated MycER show both chromosomal and <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>gene</b> amplification. In this report, we have elucidated the size, structure, functional {{components of}} c-Myc-induced extrachromosomal elements (EEs). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that EEs isolated from MycER-activated Pre-B+ cells are {{an average of}} 10 times larger than EEs isolated from non-MycER-activated control Pre-B- cells. We demonstrate that these large c-Myc-induced EEs are associated with histone proteins, whereas EEs of non-MycER-activated Pre B- cells are not. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses using pan -histone-specific, histone H 3 phosphorylation-specific, histone H 4 acetylation-specific antibodies indicate that {{a significant proportion of}} EEs analyzed from MycER-activated cells harbors transcriptionally competent and/or active chromatin. Moreover, these large, c-Myc-induced EEs carry genes. Whereas the total genetic make-up of these c-Myc-induced EEs is unknown, we found that 30. 2 % of them contain the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene, whereas cyclin C (CCNC) was absent. In addition, 50 % of these c-Myc-activated Pre-B+ EEs incorporated bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), identifying them as genetic structures that self-propagate. In contrast, EEs isolated from non-Myc-activated cells neither carry the DHFR gene nor incorporate BrdU, suggesting that c-Myc deregulation generates a new class of EEs...|$|E
40|$|Large-molecular-weight {{plasmids}} {{were isolated}} from virulent and avirulent strains of Bacillus anthracis. Each strain contained a single plasmid species unique {{from the others}} with respect to molecular weight. Bacterial strains were cured of their resident <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>gene</b> pools by sequential passage of cultures at 42. 5 degrees C. Coincidental to the curing of plasmids was a loss of detectable lethal toxin and edema-producing activities and a dramatic decrease in lethal factor and protective antigen serological activities. The involvement of these plasmids {{in the production of}} toxin was firmly established by transformation of heat-passaged cells with plasmid DNA purified from the parent strain. The ability to produce parent strain levels of toxin was restored, and the plasmid DNA similar in molecular weight to that isolated from the parent was reisolated in all transformants examined. The exact role these plasmids play in the production of toxin remains to be elucidated. Two additional strains of B. anthracis, designated Pasteur vaccine strains, were examined for the ability to produce toxin and for the presence of plasmid DNA. Both strains were found to be nontoxigenic and contained no detectable plasmid elements. It is therefore likely that we, like Pasteur, cured B. anthracis strains of temperature-sensitive plasmids which code for toxin structural or regulatory proteins...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} drug {{susceptibility}} tests {{were found to}} be affected by changes that occur spontaneously in populations of Mycobacterium avium maintained in the laboratory. Because the transparent colony type variant was resistant to antituberculosis chemotherapeutic agents and the opaque colony type variant was usually susceptible to these agents, the transition of transparent to opaque colony type was investigated. The rate of the transition was found to be temperature dependent and, in agreement with a previous report, was found to be about 10 − 4 to 10 − 5 per generation at 37 C. Reversion was found to occur at a rate of 10 − 6 to 10 − 7 at 37 C. The mutation rate from susceptibility to resistance to rifampin, kanamycin, and erythromycin was about 10 − 8 to 10 − 9 mutations per bacterium per generation. Judged from our data, the high rate of the transparent to opaque variation was not caused either by mutator effects or by the occurrence of <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genes</b> in these bacteria, but could have been due to selective mechanisms still incompletely understood...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{hepatitis}} B virus {{infection is}} {{a leading cause of}} cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis B virus encodes the regulatory HBx protein whose primary role is to promote transcription of the viral genome, which persists as an extrachromosomal DNA circle in infected cells. HBx accomplishes this task by an unusual mechanism, enhancing transcription only from extrachromosomal DNA templates. Here we show that HBx achieves this by hijacking the cellular DDB 1 -containing E 3 ubiquitin ligase to target the 'structural maintenance of chromosomes' (Smc) complex Smc 5 / 6 for degradation. Blocking this event inhibits the stimulatory effect of HBx both on <b>extrachromosomal</b> reporter <b>genes</b> and on hepatitis B virus transcription. Conversely, silencing the Smc 5 / 6 complex enhances <b>extrachromosomal</b> reporter <b>gene</b> transcription in the absence of HBx, restores replication of an HBx-deficient hepatitis B virus, and rescues wild-type hepatitis B virus in a DDB 1 -knockdown background. The Smc 5 / 6 complex associates with extrachromosomal reporters and the hepatitis B virus genome, suggesting a direct mechanism of transcriptional inhibition. These results uncover a novel role for the Smc 5 / 6 complex as a restriction factor selectively blocking extrachromosomal DNA transcription. By destroying this complex, HBx relieves the inhibition to allow productive hepatitis B virus gene expression...|$|R

40|$|The induced {{expression}} of c-Myc in plasmacytomas in BALB/c mice is regularly associated with nonrandom chromosomal translocations that juxtapose the c-myc gene {{to one of}} the Ig loci on chromosome 12 (IgH), 6 (IgK), or 16 (IgL). The DCPC 21 plasmacytoma belongs to a small group of plasmacytomas that are unusual in that they appear to be translocation-negative. In this paper, we show the absence of any c-myc-activating chromosomal translocation for the DCPC 21 by using fluorescent in situ hybridization, chromosome painting, and spectral karyotyping. We find that DCPC 21 harbors c-myc and IgH genes on extrachromosomal elements (EEs) from which c-myc is transcribed, as shown by c-myc mRNA tracks and <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>gene</b> transfer experiments. The transcriptional activity of these EEs is supported further by the presence of the transcription-associated phosphorylation of histone H 3 (H 3 P) on the EEs. Thus, our data suggest that in this plasmacytoma, c-Myc expression is achieved by an alternative mechanism. The {{expression of}} the c-Myc oncoprotein is initiated outside the chromosomal locations of the c-myc gene, i. e., from EEs, which can be considered functional genetic units. Our data also imply that other “translocation-negative” experimental and human tumors with fusion transcripts or oncogenic activation may indeed carry translocation(s), however, in an extrachromosomal form...|$|E

Complete nucleotide sequences of pIL 1 (6, 382 bp), pIL 2 (8, 277 bp), pIL 3 (19, 244 bp), pIL 4 (48, 979), pIL 5 (23, 395), pIL 6 (28, 435 bp) and pIL 7 (28, 546) were established and deposited in the generally accessible database (GeneBank). Nine highly homologous repB-containing replicons, belonging to the lactococcal theta-type replicons, have been identified on the seven plasmids. Moreover, a putative region involved in conjugative plasmid mobilization was found on four plasmids, through identification of the presence of mob genes and/or oriT sequences. Detailed bioinformatic analysis of the plasmid nucleotide sequences provided new insight into the repertoire of plasmid-encoded functions in L. lactis, and indicated that plasmid genes from IL 594 strain can be important for L. lactis adaptation to specific environmental conditions (e. g. genes coding for proteins involved in DNA repair or cold shock response) as well as for technological processes (e. g. genes encoding citrate and lactose utilization, oligopeptide transport, restriction-modification system).

Cl- 30 subline (770 -fold CLCR) and a ~ 70 -fold amplification in the J 7. Cl- 100 subline (2500 -fold CLCR). In this study, we analyzed the localization and organization of the mdr gene. In the colchicine-resistant (CLCR) J 7. Cl- 30 subline, the p-glycoprotein domain was observed to reside on differently sized extrachromosomal elements. Our results indicate not only circular extrachromosomal elements but also linear extrachromosomal elements. By means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), the sizes of the extrachromosomal elements were shown to be > 2, 500 kilobasepairs (kb), 800 kb, and 400 kb. In contrast, the J 7.

40|$|Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic {{bacteria}} (AAP) {{are abundant}} in the photic zone of the marine environment. Dinoroseobacter shibae, {{a representative of the}} Roseobacter group, converts light into additional energy that enhances its survival especially under starvation. However, light exposure results in the production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species in AAPs. Here we investigated the response of D. shibae to starvation and oxidative stress, focusing on the role of extrachromosomal elements (ECRs). D. shibae possessing five ECRs (three plasmids and two chromids) was starved for 4 weeks either in the dark or under light/dark cycles and the survival was monitored. Transcriptomics showed that on the chromosome genes with a role in oxidative stress response and photosynthesis were differentially expressed during the light period. Most <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genes</b> in contrast showed a general loss of transcriptional activity, especially in dark-starved cells. The observed decrease of gene expression was not due to plasmid loss, as all five ECRs were maintained in the cells. Interestingly, the genes on the 72 -kb chromid were the least downregulated, and one region with genes of the oxygen stress response and a light-dependent protochlorophyllide reductase of cyanobacterial origin was strongly activated under the light/dark cycle. A Δ 72 -kb curing mutant lost the ability to survive under starvation in a light/dark cycle demonstrating the essential role of this chromid for adaptation to starvation and oxidative stress.

Streptomycin resistance genes (strr) and novobiocin resistance genes (novr) were used concurrently as representatives for chromosomal genes; penicillinase (PI 254) and tetracycline plasmids were used as examples of medium- and small-size <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>genes,</b> respectively. Superinfection of the lysogenic recipients with the competence-inducing phage phi 11 or 83 A enhanced transformation for all markers. Phenotypic expression of cadmium (cadr), tetracycline (tetr), or methicillin resistance (mecr) {{did not appear to}} require a host recombination system since a recA 1 mutant could serve as the recipient provided it was superinfected with a competence-inducing phage. There was, furthermore, no requirement for preexisting plasmids for phenotypic expression. Ultraviolet irradiation of transforming DNA enhanced at low doses the transformation frequency for chromosomal genes strr and novr but not for mecr, cadr, or tetr. The gene(s) for mecr was transformed with chromosomal DNA after sodium dodecyl sulfate-sodium chloride extraction and after neutral sucrose gradient centrifugation of bulk DNA from wild-type strain DU 4916 and the transformats. No cavalently closed circular DNA or open circular DNA carrying the methicillin resistance gene(s) could be detected in the wild type or the transformants either by ethidium bromide-cesium chloride gradient centrifugation or by zonal rate centrifugation of cells directly lysed on top of the gradients. The mecr gene(s) is thus probably of chromosomal nature but possibly under recombinational control of phage genes, since transfer of mecr is independent of the recA 1 gene(s) but can be accomplished in this strain after superinfection with a competence-inducing phage.

40|$|A novel gene {{targeting}} strategy, small fragment homologous replacement (SFHR), {{has been used}} to correct specific genomic lesions in human epithelial cells. The frequency of targeting was estimated to be 1 - 10 %. However, given the genomic target, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, it is difficult to accurately quantify targeting frequency. As an alternative to targeting CFTR, targeted correction of a mutant selectable marker or reporter gene would be more amenable to accurate and rapid quantification of {{gene targeting}} efficiency. The present study evaluates the conditions that modulate SFHR-mediated correction of a defective Zeocin antibiotic resistance (Zeo(r)) gene that has been inactivated by a 4 -bp insertion. The conditions include delivery systems, plasmid-to-fragment ratio, fragment length, and fragment strandedness (single- or double-stranded DNA). Targeting fragments comprise the wild-type Zeo(r) gene sequence and were either 410 (Zeo 1) or 458 bp (Zeo 3). Expression vectors containing the corrected Zeo(r) gene were isolated as episomal plasmids or were allowed to stably integrate into cultured human airway epithelial cells. Correction of the Zeo(r) gene was phenotypically defined as restoration of resistance to Zeocin in either bacteria or epithelial cell clones. <b>Extrachromosomal</b> <b>gene</b> correction was assayed using polymerase chain reaction amplification, restriction enzyme digestion, DNA sequencing, and Southern blot hybridization analysis of DNA from isolated prokaryotic and eukaryotic clones.

Initial isolates of drug-resistant populations were genetically unstable, rapidly reverting to a drug-sensitive phenotype when grown without drug, at 0. 05 reversion per cell division. After prolonged growth in drug, this drug-resistant genotype stabilized. Mean chromosome number increased 300 % in an initially isolated 20 -fold maytansine-resistant clone, which also displayed numerous double-minute chromosomes. Descendants 240 -fold more resistant than the parent, also unstable, possessed the wild-type complement of 80 chromosomes, but 45 % of these cells possessed 24 double-minute chromosomes per cell; such chromosomes were absent from the drug-sensitive parental clone.

Studies of [3 H]gentamicin uptake in paired sets of Escherichia coli HB 101 and Salmonella typhimurium LT 2 expressing and not expressing tet showed that tet expression accelerates energy-dependent [3 H]gentamicin uptake. Increased [3 H]gentamicin uptake was accompanied by decreased bacterial protein synthesis and bacterial growth. Increased aminoglycoside uptake occurred whether tet expression was constitutive or induced, whether the tet gene was class B or C, and whether the tet gene was plasmid borne or integrated into the bacterial chromosome. tet expression produced no measurable change in membrane potential, suggesting that tet expression increases aminoglycoside uptake either by increasing the availability of specific carriers or by lowering the minimum membrane potential that is necessary for uptake...|$|R

A few genes, identified by sequence similarity, have been localized and arranged in a map with dnaA, indicating the presumed origin of replication. There {{are at least two}} rRNA operons. In addition, rRNA genes are found on a 40 kb, possibly <b>extrachromosomal,</b> structure. The <b>genes</b> thought to be involved in magnetite synthesis, bfr and magA, are located in the same 17 % of the genome. A one base pair-overlap seen in the bfr genes of MS- 1 is found also in the closely related magnetic strain AMB- 1, but not in the non-magnetic relative A. itersonii...|$|R
40|$|Infections {{caused by}} Extended {{spectrum}} beta-lactamase (ESBL) -producing E. coli are an emerging global problem, threatening {{the effectiveness of}} the extensively used beta-lactam antibiotics. ESBL dissemination is facilitated by plasmids, transposons, and other mobile elements. We have characterized the plasmid content of ESBL-producing E. coli from human urinary tract infections. Ten diverse isolates were selected; they had unrelated pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types (< 90 % similarity), were from geographically dispersed locations and had diverging antibiotic resistance profiles. Three isolates belonged to the globally disseminated sequence type ST 131. ESBL-genes of the CTX-M- 1 and CTX-M- 9 phylogroups were identified in all ten isolates. The plasmid content (plasmidome) of each strain was analyzed using a combination of molecular methods and high-throughput sequencing. Hidden Markov Model-based analysis of unassembled sequencing reads was used to analyze the genetic diversity of the plasmid samples and to detect resistance genes. Each isolate contained between two and eight distinct plasmids, and at least 22 large plasmids were identified overall. The plasmids were variants of pUTI 89, pKF 3 - 70, pEK 499, pKF 3 - 140, pKF 3 - 70, p 1 ESCUM, pEK 204, pHK 17 a, p 083 CORR, R 64, pLF 82, pSFO 157, and R 721. In addition, small cryptic high copy-number plasmids were frequent, containing one to seven open reading frames per plasmid. Three clustered groups of such small cryptic plasmids could be distinguished based on sequence similarity. Extrachromosomal prophages were found in three isolates. Two of them resembled the E. coli P 1 phage and one was previously unknown. The present study confirms plasmid multiplicity in multi-resistant E. coli. We conclude that high-throughput sequencing successfully provides information on the <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>gene</b> content and can be used to generate a genetic fingerprint of possible use in epidemiology. This could be a valuable tool for tracing plasmids in outbreaks...|$|E
40|$|Members of the Bacillus genus include {{potential}} pathogens. They are {{ubiquitous in}} the environment and contribute substantially to the bacterial communities found in confined places such as the ISS and the Antarctic Concordia station. In a context of planetary and crew health protection, {{it is necessary to}} monitor bacterial contamination and adaptation inside the confined stations designed for the exploration of new environments. The first part of this thesis consisted on the study of the Bacillus population diversity found in ISS and Concordia and to the comparison with the situation in environment, with a specific focus on members of the B. cereus group. The contribution of plasmids related to B. anthracis virulence elements to the <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>gene</b> pool was assessed. The ability of several plasmids with a pXO 2 -like replicon to sustain conjugative transfer demonstrated the putative importance of horizontal gene transfer in bacterial adaptation. This was further confirmed by the isolation of a new conjugative element in a Concordia B. cereus s. l. isolate and by the detection of plasmid transfer among the Bacillus strains from the confined stations. The actual role of conjugation on bacterial adaptation was further assessed in real situation. The choice of food matrices was relevant since putative food pathogens were detected in the Bacillus population of the ISS and Concordia. Conjugative transfer of the reference conjugative plasmids pAW 63 and pXO 16 was successfully demonstrated in dairy products. Interestingly, transfer frequencies in foodstuffs turned out to be higher by up to 10 to 100 fold compared to those obtained in laboratory medium. Finally, the specific features of pXO 16 make that it was an interesting Gram-positive model to define the mechanisms of conjugation, mobilization and retromobilization, i. e. plasmid capture. Kinetics experiments have shown that retromobilisation followed a two-step mechanism, pXO 16 having first to establish in the cell harboring the mobilizable plasmid. This confirmed the previous extensive study in Gram-negative bacteria. A preliminary analysis of pXO 16 sequence also suggested that it could represent the archetype of a new mobile element.

40|$|Purified {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mitDNA) from ovaries ofXenopus lae vis was {{injected into}} the nuclei (germinal vesicles) of large viteUogenic oocytes of the same organism and examined by electron microscopy ofthe spread nuclear contents. Normally located nuclei of untreated oocytes as weil as peripherally translocated nuclei of centrifuged oocytes were used. In addition, oocyte nuclei isolated and incubated under liquid paraffin oil were injected with DNA. The integrity oftranscriptional structures of endogenous chromosomal (Iampbrush chromosomes) and <b>extrachromosomal</b> (nucleoli) <b>genes</b> of the injected nuclei was demonstrated. Microinjected mitDN A was identified as circles of chromatin exhibiting polynucleosome-like organization and a me an contour length of 2. 6 J. Lm, corresponding to a compaction ratio of the mitDN A of about 2 : I. This DNA packing ratio {{is similar to that}} observed after preparation of various kinds of native chromatin in low salt buffers. The chromatin circles formed from injected mitDNA only very rarely exhibited lateral fibrils suggestive of transcriptional activity. These results suggest that purified mitDNA can be transformed to normally structured chromatin when exposed to oocyte nuclear contents but is rarely, if at all, transcribed in this form and in this environment...|$|R
40|$|Amplification {{of genes}} can {{sometimes}} be detected by molecular hybridization but not by cytogenetic methods, suggesting {{that in some cases}} the units of amplification may be too small to be detected by light microscopy. The experiments reported here investigate whether submicroscopic amplification units are present in early passages of the human tumor cell lines HL- 60 and COLO 320. The results show that such cells do contain submicroscopic, extrachromosomal, supercoiled circular molecules harboring MYC genes. The molecules in HL- 60 are approximately 250 kilobase pairs (kbp), while those in COLO 320 are 120 - 160 kbp. The extrachromosomal molecules in HL- 60 are shown to replicate semiconservatively and approximately once in one cell cycle. We propose that these submicroscopic elements are precursors of double-minute chromosomes, the usual <b>extrachromosomal</b> manifestation of <b>gene</b> amplification, since both are structurally similar and replicate autonomously...|$|R
40|$|One hundred seventy-five {{strains of}} gram-negative bacillae of the Enterobacteria-ceae which cause urinary tract infections were studied for MICs of sulfamethox-azole (SMZ) and {{trimethoprim}} (TMP). The synergistic {{effect of the}} TMP-SMZ was studied. An <b>extrachromosomal</b> location of <b>genes</b> responsible for resistance to sulfonamide and to TMP was sought. The synergistic effect of TMP-SMZ was observed in three groups of strains: sulfonamide- and TMP-sensitive strains, sul-fonamide-resistant and TMP-sensitive strains, and sulfonamide-resistant, and low-level TMP-resistant strains. Strains belonging to {{the second and third}} group transferred their respective drug resistance to Escherichia coli KI 2. A fourth group of strains was highly resistant to sulfonamide and TMP. It failed to trans-fer the resistance to TMP and to show a synergistic effect of TMP-SMZ. Results of treatment with TMP-SMZ in 135 episodes of urinary tract infections showed no difference between patients infected with sulfonamide-sensitive or sulfonamide-resistant strains.

40|$|AbstractConstitutively active {{forms of}} the small GTPases RhoA (RhoA. V 14) and Cdc 42 (Cdc 42. V 12) induce {{expression}} of <b>extrachromosomal</b> SRF reporter <b>genes</b> in microinjection experiments, but only Cdc 42. V 12 can efficiently activate a chromosomal template. Both SAPK/JNK-dependent or -independent signals can cooperate with RhoA. V 14 to activate chromosomal SRF reporters, and it is SAPK/JNK activation by Cdc 42. V 12 that allows it to activate chromosomal templates. Cooperating signals can be bypassed by deacetylase inhibitors. Three findings show that histone H 4 hyperacetylation is one target for cooperating signals, although it alone is not sufficient: (1) Cdc 42. V 12, but not RhoA. V 14, induces H 4 hyperacetylation; (2) cooperating signals use the same SAPK/JNK-dependent or -independent pathways to induce H 4 hyperacetylation; (3) growth factor and stress stimuli induce substantial H 4 hyperacetylation, detectable in reporter gene chromatin. These data establish a link between signal-regulated acetylation events and gene transcription...|$|R
