40|$|As {{more and}} more low gap vacuum {{chambers}} are installed at the ESRF, the single bunch instability threshold tends to decrease dramatically and, in order to anticipate the evolution of vertical impedance, {{there is a real}} need for it to be tracked. Two type of experiments based on closed orbit distortion measurements will be presented and compared. The first one is a local measurement using the closed bump technique, while the second one allows the measurement of all impedance around the ring using a single measurement. Results and improvements of both methods as well as the evolution of machine vertical impedance will be discussed. A particular focus will be put on in-vacuum insertion devices. Indeed, these devices have variable gap and enable us to make gap dependent measurements. THE LOCAL BUMP METHOD The local bump method was first introduced around the same time at BINP[2] and ALS[1] and implemented at ESRF in 2002 [3]. The principle of the method is to locally displace the beam from its axis by applying a closed bump of 1 mm, and to record the effect of impedance on the closed orbit. Once the beam is displaced, its closed orbit will be affected by an impedance kick proportional to the beam displacement, the imaginary part of the <b>effective</b> <b>impedance,</b> and is current dependent. Assuming a gaussian distribution for the bunch, the kick angle is related to the <b>effective</b> <b>impedance</b> by[6]: Where θ is the kick angle, z is the bump amplitude, f 0 the revolution frequency I the bunch current and σt the RMS bunch length in seconds.

40|$|Abstract — Synchronization of coupled {{oscillators}} is a perva-sive theme of multi-disciplinary research. Focused on circuit-theoretic applications, in this paper, we derive sufficient con-ditions for global asymptotic synchronization {{in a system}} of identical nonlinear circuits coupled through linear time-invariant (LTI) electrical networks. The nonlinear circuits are composed of a parallel combination of passive LTI circuit elements and a nonlinear voltage-dependent current source with finite gain. The terminals of the nonlinear circuits are coupled through LTI networks characterized by either identical per-unit-length <b>impedances</b> or identical <b>effective</b> <b>impedances</b> between any two terminals. This setup is motivated by a recently proposed control strategy for inverters in microgrids. We analyze synchronization by means of an input-output analysis of a coordinate-transformed system that emphasizes signal differences.

Although there have been early proposals for fast time-varying capacitances [31], it now is considered to be more convenient to make use of dissipationless Josephson junctions for this purpose. In a regime in which the current I flowing through a Josephson junction is much smaller than its critical current [...]...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} {{for the analysis}} of power supply noise in the frequency domain. Power supply network is modeled as a linear time invariant (LTI) system comprising of the parasitic resistance (R), inductance (L), and capacita. nce (C). Each gate (or cell) is modeled as a time-varying current source. Voltage fluctuation caused by t he switching events is calculated based on the <b>effective</b> <b>impedances</b> seen by the corresponding current sources and the spatial correlation between the nodes of the power network. Superposition is applied to the LTI system to obtain the overall noise spectrum at any node of the power supply network. Inverse Fast Fourier Transformation (IFFT) is then performed on the frequency domain noise spectrum to obtain the time domain noise waveform. Given the POWER/GROUND network and the time-varying current sources derived from an event-driven simulation based on primary inputs, our approach can produce accurate noise waveforms while being two orders of ma. gnitude faster than HSPICE...|$|R

From these measurements, the real and imaginary part of the transverse impedance can be estimated.

40|$|Abstract—Work on compact, variable, efficient, {{and high}} {{brightness}} radiation sources is extended by calculating the radiated power and angular distributions for characteristic configurations and drive sources. On {{the assumption that}} the transport physics with Maxwell’s Equations are valid but modified by the material properties, a number of analogs are suggested between free and bound electron sources of radiation. Characteristics of representative 1 -to-n port examples are discussed in terms of a few basic shape parameters and the wavelength. Conditions for coherence and interference are discussed and demonstrated for the latter. Figures-of-merit are defined in terms of brightness, efficiencies or <b>effective</b> <b>impedances</b> such as the radiation coupling impedance Z rc. Both time and frequency domain techniques are used and checked against other calculations and measurements where available. Finally, we discuss some further possibilities together with various impediments to realizing these kinds of devices such as the Terahertz (THz) modulation problem as well as nonlinear methods for their optimization. To our knowledge, there have been no implementations of such possibilities.
