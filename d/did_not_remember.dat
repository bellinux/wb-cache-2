In another 1998 event, Elizabeth Gracen recanted a six-year-old denial and stated she had a one-night stand with Clinton in 1982. Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton. Throughout the year, however, Gracen eluded a subpoena from Kenneth Starr to testify her claim in court.|$|E
5|$|Ramírez had {{difficulty}} with his vision; {{he could not}} see which pitch the catcher was calling for. He was fitted for prescription goggles, which he continued to wear throughout his career. Angels' MLB players of the time <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> working with Ramírez; catcher José Molina suggested that Ramírez must not have been in the Angels' long-term plans, as they had a number of right-handed power pitching relief pitchers in the organization.|$|E
5|$|Altman {{was then}} {{instructed}} to contact Newark Liberty International Airport, a directive he agreed to. However, {{he did not}} contact the tower at Newark. It later transpired that, in acknowledging the instruction to contact Newark, Altman had read back the wrong frequency (127.8MHz instead of 127.85), an error that the controller did not correct. Soon after, a controller at Newark who was concerned about aircraft in the Piper's path contacted the Teterboro controller and asked the him to attempt to re-establish contact. All attempts to contact Altman and change his aircraft's heading were unsuccessful. After the failure to contact Altman, a radar alert about a possible collision occurred in both the Newark and Teterboro towers. However, the two controllers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> seeing or hearing this alert.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{game in the}} 2004 {{season in}} which Favre and the Packers {{finished}} 10–6 was against the New York Giants. During the game, Favre suffered a concussion. He did not receive medical clearance to re-enter the game. Despite the concussion, Favre threw a 28-yard touchdown to Javon Walker on a fourth down play. Afterwards {{it was reported that}} Favre <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> throwing the touchdown pass. Favre also had two significant touchdown streaks of note during the season. He had completed at least one touchdown pass in 36 consecutive games over the 2002–2004 seasons which at the time was the second longest streak in NFL history. Also, during the 2004 post-season, he broke Dan Marino's record for consecutive games with at least one touchdown pass in the post season. Favre went on to throw a touchdown pass in twenty consecutive playoff games which is still an NFL record.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E
5|$|After a long-awaited {{pre-season}} {{after the}} agreements from the NFL lockout, {{and the release}} of Delhomme, McCoy became the starter for the Browns. In the home opener against the Bengals, McCoy threw 19 for 40 attempts throwing 213 yards with two touchdowns and one interception in a 27-17 loss. The next two weeks, the Browns defeated the Indianapolis Colts and the Miami Dolphins with McCoy throwing combined 41 of 71 attempts, 421 yards, and 3 touchdowns with 1 interception. Against the Tennessee Titans in week 5, McCoy threw 1 touchdown and 1 interception in a 13-31 loss. After a bye week, McCoy and the Browns lost to the Oakland Raiders 17-24, McCoy threw for 215 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. After the loss to the Oakland Raiders the Browns played the Seattle Seahawks and won 6-3 as McCoy finished with 178 yards, no touchdowns, and 1 interception. Against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 14, McCoy threw 2 interceptions and no touchdowns in a 3-14 loss where McCoy would also sustain a concussion. His father raised eyebrows when he questioned whether or not McCoy's team had properly evaluated him for the concussion prior to returning to the game. McCoy stated that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> anything. James Harrison, the Steelers player responsible for the helmet-to-helmet hit on McCoy, was subsequently punished by being suspended for the Steelers' next game against the San Francisco 49ers.|$|E

25|$|In May, {{this was}} {{followed}} by the arrest of most members of the military Supreme Command and mass arrests throughout the military, often on fabricated charges.

25|$|With this {{activity}} ongoing, another Wings West aircraft, a Metroliner similar to SkyWest 5569, called the tower reporting {{they were ready}} for takeoff. The same local controller queried this aircraft about their position, and they told her they were holding on a taxiway short of 24L. The flight progress strip for this flight {{had not yet been}} given to the local controller by the clearance delivery controller (another distraction), and the local controller mistakenly thought this Metroliner was SkyWest 5569 and thus the runway was clear of aircraft. The first officer of the USAir flight recalled hearing this conversation, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> anyone being cleared to hold on the runway.|$|E

The book contained {{a brief description of}} Xanadu, the summer capital of the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan. The text about Xanadu in Purchas, His Pilgrimes, which Coleridge admitted he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> exactly, was: In Xandu did Cublai Can build a stately Pallace, encompassing sixteen miles of plaine ground with a wall, wherein are fertile Meddowes, pleasant Springs, delightfull streames, and all sorts of beasts of chase and game, and in the middest thereof a sumptuous house of pleasure, which may be moved from place to place.|$|E

25|$|After {{starting}} {{at their own}} 20yard line, Tech's quarterback Graham Harrell completed four straight passes {{to bring them to}} midfield. On the fifth play, Harrell's pass was intercepted by Lendy Holmes and returned for a touchdown giving Oklahoma the early lead. The Red Raiders answered on their next two possessions with two field goals to cut Oklahoma's lead to onepoint. On the Sooners' first offensive play, quarterback Sam Bradford handed the ball off to Allen Patrick who quickly fumbled. Bradford suffered a concussion when he tackled the Tech defender who recovered the lost ball. Bradford did not show any immediate signs as he played on the ensuing Oklahoma possession, but he later told quarterbacks coach Josh Heupel that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> any of the plays from the previous drive and Bradford was benched {{for the remainder of the}} game. Bradford was replaced by backup Joey Halzle.|$|E
25|$|On February 7, 1981, the Beechcraft Bonanza A36TC Wozniak was {{piloting}} crashed {{soon after}} takeoff from the Sky Park Airport in Scotts Valley, California. The plane stalled while climbing, then bounced down the runway, went through two fences, {{and crashed into}} an embankment. Wozniak and his three passengers—then-fiancée Candice Clark, his brother, and his girlfriend—were injured. Wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries, including losing a tooth, and also suffered for five weeks after the crash from anterograde amnesia, the inability to create new memories. He had no memory of the crash, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> {{his name in the}} hospital or the things he did after he was released.

25|$|Wanting {{to become}} a doctor, Tutu secured {{admission}} to study medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand; however, his parents could not afford the tuition fees. Instead, he turned toward teaching, gaining a government scholarship to start a course at Pretoria Bantu Normal College, a teacher training institution, in 1951. There, he served as treasurer of the Student Representative Councillor, helping to organise the Literacy and Dramatic Society, and chairing the Cultural and Debating Society for two years. It was during one local debating event that he first met the lawyer and future President Nelson Mandela; the latter <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> the meeting {{and they would not}} encounter each other again until 1990. At the college, he attained his Transvaal Bantu Teachers Diploma, having gained advice about taking exams from the activist Robert Sobukwe. He had also taken five correspondence courses provided by the University of South Africa (UNISA), graduating in the same class as future Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe.|$|E
