50|$|Hock burns are marks {{found on}} the upper joints of {{chickens}} and other birds raised on broiler farms. These marks are where the ammonia from the waste of other birds has burned through {{the skin of the}} leg, leaving a mark. Many meat processors now remove these marks as they discourage customers. <b>Hock</b> <b>burn</b> normally does not surpass 15% of a flock, according to poultry industry standards, but independent studies have found incidents of <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> more common.

40|$|Welfare Quality((R)) (WQ) {{assessment}} protocols {{place the}} emphasis on animal-based measures as an indicator for animal welfare. Stakeholders, however, emphasize that {{a reduction in the}} time taken to complete the protocol is essential to improve practical applicability. We studied the potential for reduction in time to complete the WQ broiler assessment protocol and present some modifications to the protocol correcting a few errors in the original calculations. Data was used from 180 flocks assessed on-farm and 150 flocks assessed at the slaughter plant. Correlations between variables were calculated, and where correlation was moderate, meaningful and promising (in terms of time reduction), simplification was considered using one variable predicted from another variable. Correlation analysis revealed a promising correlation between severe <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> and gait scores on-farm. Therefore, prediction of gait scores using <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> scores was studied further as a possible simplification strategy (strategy 1). Measurements of footpad dermatitis, <b>hock</b> <b>burn,</b> cleanliness and gait score on-farm correlated moderately to highly with slaughter plant measurements of footpad dermatitis and/or <b>hock</b> <b>burn,</b> supporting substitution of on-farm measurements with slaughter plant data. A simplification analysis was performed using footpad dermatitis, <b>hock</b> <b>burn,</b> cleanliness and gait scores measured on-farm predicted from slaughter plant measurements of footpad dermatitis and <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> (strategy 2). Simplification strategies were compared with the full assessment protocol. Close agreement was found between the full protocol and both simplification strategies although large confidence intervals were found for specificity of the simplified models. It is concluded that the proposed simplification strategies are encouraging; strategy 1 can reduce the time to complete the on-farm assessment by similar to 1 h (25 % to 33 % reduction) and strategy 2 can reduce on-farm assessment time by similar to 2 h (50 % to 67 % reduction). Both simplification strategies should, however, be validated further, and tested on farms with a wide distribution across the different welfare categories of WQ...|$|E
40|$|According to EU-Regulation 889 / 2008 {{slow growing}} strains shall {{be used in}} organic farming {{in order to ensure}} good broiler welfare. We {{examined}} effects of growth speed on broiler welfare in four different strains (33. 01 ± 5. 8 to 44. 02 ± 8. 0 g/day) in two batches on nine organic farms that kept two to four strains in parallel. The currently common slow growing strain (44. 02 ± 8. 0 g/day) was a reference on all farms. In total 5593 broilers in 36 groups with 30 to 565 animals were kept. Live weight, lameness, skin and plumage condition and cleanliness of plumage were investigated on samples of 30 to 81 birds depending on group size. If possible, measures were taken repeat-edly (twice), at an average body weight of 1800 g to 2600 g. Individual data were analyzed using a logistic mixed model with daily weight gain, body weight and batch as fixed factors and farm as random factor. Percentages of birds without lameness, foot pad dermatitis, <b>hock</b> <b>burn,</b> plumage and skin damage on the breast, injuries and without dirty feathers decreased with higher daily weight gain (p< 0. 0001, breast skin damage p= 0. 004, n= 2260), and higher body weight (p< 0. 0001 to p< 0. 0429, except for <b>hock</b> <b>burn).</b> Thus, higher daily weight gain and body weight lead to more welfare problems also in broilers with relatively low daily weight gain under organic conditions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{most common}} lesions {{observed}} in commercial broiler farms are <b>hock</b> <b>burns</b> and pododermatitis, defined as necrotic lesions on the plantar {{surface of the}} footpads and in the hock of growing broilers, causing pain and compromising broiler welfare. The present study aimed at identifying the risks of <b>hock</b> <b>burns</b> and pododermatitis in broilers reared under commercial conditions on new or reused litter. Twenty-four 40 -d-old broilers reared in two houses in a commercial broiler farm. The plantar surface of the footpads and the hocks of broiler were recorded using infrared thermal images. The incidence of <b>hock</b> <b>burns</b> in broilers reared on new litter was 0. 72 times lower than those on reused litter. Broilers reared on new litter presented lower risk (0. 75, RR< 1) of presenting pododermatitis when compared to those reared on reused litter. When simulating the risk using a larger sample, the simulated risk of broilers presenting footpad and hock lesions when reared on new litter was 38 % higher those reared on reused litter...|$|R
40|$|The {{reasons for}} the gait {{problems}} in broiler chickens are multiple although weight and growth rate {{are said to be}} the main reasons for locomotion problems (Vestergaard and Sanotra, 1999). Other factors that play role are infectious diseases, genetics, sex, weight and growth rate, age, feed conversion, feeding, management and movement. In this study, gait score as a measure for lameness, is thoroughly investigated in relation to the following physiological variables: weight, sex, corticosterone content in the blood plasma, <b>hock</b> <b>burns,</b> chest dirtiness, foot pad dermatitis, tibial dyschondroplasia and femoral head necrosis. A total of 152 birds were selected from a house of 1500 birds in 3 consecutive growth periods. The chickens were scored for their locomotion by experts, weighed, their sex was determined and blood samples were taken for quantification of stress hormones in the blood plasma. They were then slaughtered and visually scored for <b>hock</b> <b>burns,</b> chest dirtiness and foot pad dermatitis. The birds were dissected to diagnose tibial dyschondroplasia and femoral head necrosis. Between the 8 mentioned parameters, sex, blood stress hormone corticosterone, chest dirtiness and femoral head necrosis had significant relations with the lameness of the birds. Body weight and gait score relation was significant (p < 0. 001) and non-linear. Males were significantly heavier than the females (p < 0. 001). Females and males had similar average gait scores (2. 63, 2. 75 out of 5). Higher corticosterone concentration in the blood plasma in the birds increased with higher gait scores (p = 0. 006). Between the three visual quality variables (<b>hock</b> <b>burns,</b> foot pad lesions and chest dirtiness) only chest dirtiness showed a significant relation with gait score (p = 0. 02). Post slaughter diagnosis for femoral head necrosis revealed significant relation with the lameness of the birds (p < 0. 001). status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Sitting {{and lying}} {{behaviours}} in fast growing strains increase with age from 75% {{in the first}} seven days to 90% at 35 days of age.

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Standardised data on flock husbandry {{were recorded}} on 149 broiler farms {{during the four}} days prior to slaughter. 2. Birds were examined at the slaughterhouse for contact dermatitis lesions. Foot pad dermatitis score (FPDS) and <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> score (HBS) were measured on five point scales. Carcass rejection data were also collected. 3. The mean percentage of birds in each flock with: moderate or severe foot lesions was 11. 1 % (range 0 % - 71. 5 %); moderate or severe <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> was 1. 3 % (range 0 % - 33. 3 %); and, breast burn was 0. 02 %. 4. A general linear model was developed to examine factors associated with mean flock FPDS. Assuming a linear relationship, {{within the range of}} data collected and with all other factors remaining the same, every 1 % increase in the proportion of Genotype A birds in the flock was associated with an increase in mean FPDS of 0. 003, every 1 -point increase in litter score was associated with a 0. 326 increase in mean FPDS and every 1 -point increase in flock mean HBS was associated with a 0. 411 increase in mean FPDS. Flock mean FPDS was associated with feed supplier and was higher in winter. 5. The general linear model developed for flock mean HBS, found that every 1 -point increase in mean FPDS increased mean HBS by 0. 090, every 1 -point increase in litter score increased HBS by 0. 119 and, every 1 % increase in small/emaciated birds decreased mean HBS by 0. 333. Reduced HBS was also associated with increased final litter depth, younger slaughter age and an increased percentage of dietary wheat. For every 1 % increase in Genotype A birds, a decrease in flock mean HBS of 0. 003 would be expected. An effect of hatchery was also identified...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} {{stocking}} density (STD) on leg weakness in broiler chickens was assessed in two trials. The interaction {{between age and}} STD on leg weak-ness was further evaluated in one trial. In Trial 1, walking ability was assessed at 28, 42, and 49 d of age. Birds were stocked at 833, 625, or 435 cm 2 per bird. In Trial 2, birds were stocked at 625 or 455 cm 2 per bird and assessed for tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) by radiographic examina-tion at 28 d and walking ability at 35 d. Foot pad burn, <b>hock</b> <b>burn,</b> and angulation of the hock joint were also assessed at slaughter on Day 42. Body weight was mea-sured during both trials. At 4 wk of age, leg weakness was a relatively minor problem; few severely lame birds had a gait score (GS) of 4 or 5 at any density.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the feather coverage on breast and thighs in meat type chickens, reared on three different types of litter materials, including wood shavings, shredded paper and chopped wheat straw. The experiment lasted for 72 days. A total of 447 one-day-old meat type chickens were randomly allotted to the three litter materials, giving 149 birds per litter. On days 24, 47 and 72 of the experimental period, feathering on the breast and thighs was scored according to a 1 – 4 scale. In addition, the severity of foot pad dermatitis (FPD) and <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> (HB) was evaluated at the same days by attributing scores from 1 − 3. Litter characteristics (moisture content, water absorbing capacity, bulk density, pH) were determined {{at the end of}} the experiment. Severity of FPD varied significantly (P   0. 016) on the severity of HB and on thigh feathering. Birds reared on chopped wheat straw presented the lowest breast feather coverage.

40|$|Abstract: In broiler production, {{stocking}} density, i. e. floor surface per chicken, is {{very important}} welfare factor which directly and indirectly influences and determines the level of growth of chicken body weight, {{but it is also}} related to other welfare indicators. Objective of the paper was to define the broiler welfare in different stocking densities by evaluation of their walking ability (gait score), feathering, incidence and degree of <b>hock</b> <b>burns,</b> foot pad lesions, and by determination of the biochemical blood parameters (glucose concentration, total cholesterol concentration), as indicators of condition of stress. One day old chickens of Hubbard genotype were housed in boxes in floor rearing system, in 3 stocking densities and 5 repetitions of each treatment. Treatment A scored stocking density of 10 birds/m 2; treatment B, 13 birds/m 2 and treatment C, 16 birds/m 2. Results of the trial indicate absence of significance of differences between trial groups of broilers in regard to their walking ability, condition of skin and legs, and stress indicators. In general, broiler welfare in all trial groups was satisfactory. However, determined tendencies of worsening of the condition of litter, increase of the frequency of lower scores for walking ability (gait score), <b>hock</b> <b>burns</b> and foot pad lesions which occur with increase of stocking density, indicate the importance of this rearing factor and need to define limiting stocking densities from the aspect of broiler welfare but also economical efficiency of production...|$|R

This experiment was conducted to {{examine the effect of}} supplementation of drinking water with Satureja khuzistanica essential oils (SkEO) on litter quality and external carcass defects using 420 one-day-old Cobb 500 broiler chicks. Seven experimental treatments consisting supplementation of drinking water with 0 (control-), 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 g / L SkEO or 3. 0 g / L polysorbate 80 (control+) were examined in three replicates of 20 birds each up to day 28 of age. Water intake significantly reduced in a dose-dependent linear fashion in the birds received SkEO-treated water compared to the control birds (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Footpad {{dermatitis}} (FPD) and <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> (HB) {{are a major}} welfare {{concern in}} broiler chicken farming. In general, foot lesions are linked to poor environmental conditions. Ulcers caused by advanced lesions can negatively affect the gait of the birds, with effects on the welfare of animals, including, in the worst cases, inability to reach the feed or water. FPD and HB score data were collected manually at two broiler farms across Europe, during welfare assessments performed within the EU-PLF (Precision Livestock Farming) project, which {{is supported by the}} European Commission. This ongoing project aims to create "added value" for the farmer through the application of sensors and information technology at farm level. On those broiler farms, a number of variables such as temperature, relative humidity, ventilation rate, bird weight, light schedule, and feed and water consumption rates are measured automatically. The welfare of the chickens was assessed three times per cycle (at week 3, 4 and 5), scoring FPD, HB, gait score, cleanliness of the birds and litter quality. Data analysis was performed by combining data from the welfare assessments with environmental data collected by the automatic monitoring systems. The analysis showed that FPD and HB were more frequent when the flock was exposed to poor environmental conditions for prolonged periods of time. As environmental conditions can be measured continuously, and the risk factor for FPD and HB increases with poor environmental conditions, there is potential to develop a detection and control system for foot and hock lesions. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the pres-ence of genetic variation in footpad dermatitis (FPD) and <b>hock</b> <b>burns</b> (HB) and the possibility to genetically select against these. A field trial including 10 commer-cial broiler lines (n = 102 to 265) was carried out at 2 Dutch farms. Footpad dermatitis and HB were sub-jectively scored at ~ 4, 5, and 7 wk {{on a scale from}} 0 through 5. Genetic parameters were estimated in 2 lines based on a larger data set. The overall agreement of repeated FPD and HB scores was high (0. 66 to 0. 86) and the scoring system was, therefore, considered reli-able. Kendall’s τ between left and right scores was low-er than 1 (FPD: 0. 73 and HB: 0. 57), and both left and right FPD and HB must, therefore, be evaluated. High prevalences of FPD, but also HB, were achieved in the field trial, but lower prevalences may be sufficient for genetic evaluations and would be less detrimental to welfare. Genetic variation between and within lines was present for both FPD and HB as indicated by between-line differences and heritabilities, and selection against FPD and HB is, therefore, possible. It is important that selection is done against both FPD and HB, and such selection should not have a negative influence on the genetic improvement in BW. In contrast, continued selection for increased BW while ignoring FPD in the breeding goal is likely to lead to an increased propen-sity to develop FPD in broilers.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether {{a high level}} of footpad dermatitis (FPD) in broiler chickens induced by increased litter moisture content is accompanied by negative effects on technical performance, carcass yield, and other welfare aspects. Litter moisture content was increased by systematically spraying water over the litter from 6 d of age onward (lesion-induction treatment). Results were compared with a control group kept on relatively good quality litter and having a very low prevalence of footpad lesions. Litter quality significantly decreased from 7 d of age onward in the pens with the lesion-induction treatment compared with the control pens. At 21 and 36 d of age, significantly more FPD was observed in the lesion-induction groups compared with the control groups. Technical performance of the broilers was negatively affected for the lesion-induction groups from 28 d of age onward; lesion-induction groups had significantly lower BW gain, feed intake, and water intake and significantly higher FCR compared with control groups. As a result of the lower BW gain, carcass weight was less for the lesion-induction group and significantly more rejections for commercial parts were found. The lesion-induction groups also had significantly more <b>hock</b> <b>burns</b> and breast irritations at d 21 and 36, and were dirtier but had fewer thigh scratches at d 35 compared with the control groups. In addition, locomotion was negatively affected among the lesion-induction group, as they had a higher gait score at d 36 compared with the control group.

40|$|Commercially reared broiler {{chickens}} {{are commonly}} supplied with drinking water through lines of nipple drinkers that are positioned above the birds ’ heads to avoid water leaking and spoiling the litter underfoot. This {{means that the}} birds have to peck upwards to obtain water, an action that {{is very different from}} the ‘scoop ’ action of natural drinking seen when birds drink from troughs or puddles. In this study we investigate the welfare implications of this unnatural drinking behaviour imposed by nipple drinkers. We show 1) that chickens have no apparent aversion to the taste of tap water, 2) that they prefer bell drinkers and troughs over nipple drinkers, 3) that the stereotyped ‘scoop ’ action is seen even when birds are drinking from bowls of different heights, 4) that chickens have a strong preference for drinking from nipples that are lower rather than higher and, 5) that when offered a choice between bowls and nipples of the same height, the chickens are indifferent to the method of water presentation. We conclude that the height at which water is presented to chickens is more important to them than whether they can drink with the natural ‘scoop ’ action. While this might suggest that chicken welfare could be improved by lowering the drinker lines, wet litter causes welfare issues of its own through its effect on <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> and pododermatitis. We suggest that drinker systems should be designed so that both aspects of welfare (birds able to drink in their preferred way and clean litter) are possible...|$|E

The experiment was performed on 210 -day-old fast-growing hybrid male chickens with identical conditions until 47  days of age. Animal-based welfare parameters were measured to investigate the welfare level in the group housed on deep litter, a litter and slat system, and a slatted floor, with five replicates for each group. Results showed that the main welfare indicators in live birds, such breast dirtiness, plumage score, footpad lesion, and <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> lesion, were negatively affected in broilers kept on conventional deep-litter floor housing. But hemorrhage or lesion scores of the breast and shoulder of broilers in slat floor housing were found to be significantly greater than in conventional deep litter as a result of a heavy body weight at a greater slaughter age (p [*]<[*] 0. 05). Pathologically, the prevalence of footpad and hock joint dermatitis was very high in the deep-litter housing system. Femoral head necrosis was not observed in any floor housing group. The results indicated that keeping broilers on a slat flooring system is preferable for younger slaughter ages and for a lighter slaughter weight.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different stocking density on broiler performance two repeated experiments were conducted in a conventional and an environmentally controlled house using a total of 10, 232 broiler chickens. In each experiment, a total of 5, 116 one-day old Ross 308 broiler chickens were randomly distributed to 16 floor pens arranged within each house at density of 16, 18, 20 or 22 birds/m 2. Results showed that the broiler chickens grown in environmentally controlled house had greater (p< 0. 05) weight gain, kg body weight (BW) /m 2, production efficiency index (PEI) and spleen relative weight at day 42 and also had lower (p< 0. 05) feed conversion ratio and mortality rate during 21 to 42 and 1 to 42 days of age than those reared in conventional house. Weight gain, feed intake and PEI decreased (p< 0. 05) and kg BW/m 2 and carcass yield increased (p< 0. 05), when broiler density increased more than 20 birds/m 2. House type and stocking density {{had no effect on}} relative weights of liver, abdominal fat, bursa of Fabricius, and litter pH and ammonia emission. However, higher litter moisture in conventional house led to a greater (p< 0. 05) incidence of foot pad lesions and <b>hock</b> <b>burns,</b> which intensified with increased density. In conclusion, broiler chickens reared in environmentally controlled house had superior performance, higher liability, and lower litter moisture content and foot lesions. Moreover, broiler rearing at the density of 22 birds/m 2 adversely affected growth performance and foot quality, despite the greater kg BW/m 2 compared to broilers grown at lower densities...|$|R

The light-emitting diode (LED) is an energy-saving alternative. The aims of the present 2 studies were to examine 1) the preference for LED color temperature and effects on behavior, and 2) ef-fects of LED color temperature on performance and welfare of male broilers (Ross 308). Two color temper-atures were investigated: neutral-white (4, 100 K) and cold-white (6, 065 K). First, 6 groups of 6 -day-old chicks were housed in pens consisting of 2 lightproof com-partments with a pop-hole between allowing chicks to move freely between compartments. Number of broilers in each compartment and their behavior were recorded every 15 min on 6 d. A preference for 6, 065 K was found (P 0. 07). Second, each of the 2 light conditions was applied to 6 groups of 75 chicks. BW and feed con-sumption were registered weekly. On d 34, we scored gait, foot pad dermatitis, and <b>hock</b> <b>burns</b> in 15 indi-viduals/pen. At slaughter (d 35), cold carcass weight was recorded from all individuals, while yields of differ-ent body parts were collected from 9 individuals/group.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} which effects of floor eggs, washed floor eggs, and clean nest eggs were investigated on incubation characteristics and performance in later life of broiler chickens. In both experiments, a young and an older breeder flock were used in a 3 × 2 factorial design during incubation. In the second experiment, male and female chickens were reared separately until d 35 of age in floor pens. During this grow out trial, an extra group was created in which chickens obtained from clean nest eggs were mixed with chickens obtained from floor eggs, meaning that grow out period was set up as a 4 × 2 × 2 factorial design with 4 egg types, 2 breeder ages, and 2 sexes. In both experiments, fertility and hatchability of fertile eggs were lower in floor and washed eggs than in clean nest eggs (hatchability: experiment 1 : 74. 4 vs. 70. 6 vs. 92. 6 % for floor eggs, washed floor eggs and clean nest eggs, respectively, P < 0. 001; experiment 2 : 78. 3 vs. 81. 7 vs. 90. 2 %, respectively, P < 0. 001). In experiment 2, BW at d 0 of chickens obtained from clean nest eggs was {{higher than that of}} chickens from floor eggs and washed floor eggs (41. 5 vs. 40. 4 and 40. 3 g, respectively; P < 0. 001). This difference disappeared during the grow out period and was absent at slaughter age at d 35 of age. Feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and mortality during the grow out period were not affected by egg type. Incidence and severity of <b>hock</b> <b>burns</b> and footpad dermatitis were not affected by egg type or breeder age. Litter friability at d 35 of age tended to be lower in pens with chickens obtained from washed floor eggs compared to clean nest eggs. We conclude that incubation of floor eggs or washed floor eggs resulted in lower fertility and hatchability compared to clean nest eggs, but that performance during the grow out period was not affected. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract 1. The {{relationship}} between the physical activity and leg health of broiler chickens was assessed at a semi-commercial scale. 2. Three batches of birds were raised under two lighting regimes during the photoperiod; either a stepwise change of light intensity alternating between an illuminance of 200 and 10 lx or a constant illuminance of 10 lx. The activity of focal individuals was observed at 2, 4 and 6 weeks of age, and leg health assessed weekly, based on gait score, the prevalence of burns on the hock and foot pad, and varus-valgus deformation and rotation of the leg at the intertarsal joint. Cortical bone density and thickness and area moments of inertia of the mid-physis tibiotarsus were measured post mortem at 6 weeks of age. 3. The stepwise change in light intensity did not affect overall performance, activity or leg health. 4. An individual bird's activity did not affect its gait score, the prevalence of <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> or foot pad burn, cortical density or thickness or shape of the tibiotarsus. Sex of the bird was the only factor to affect significantly the area moment of inertia in the horizontal (P = 0. 04) and vertical (P = 0. 002) planes of the tibiotarsus, with females showing a lower moment of inertia for both. No variable {{had a significant effect}} on cortical density or thickness. Mean cortical density was low across all birds and may indicate that, when allowed to move freely as much or as little as they choose, broiler chickens do not exercise enough or do not perform the higher impact activities required to affect bone quality. 5. These findings imply that the activity of broiler chickens raised at a semi-commercial scale is unaffected by stepwise changes in light intensity and that other husbandry measures are needed to raise activity and hence improve leg health...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of photoperiod length and light intensity on leg and eye health, tonic immobility, some blood parameters, carcass, and meat quality characteristics in broilers. A total of 272 one-day-old male broiler chicks (Ross 308) were randomly assigned to four treatment groups based on the photoperiod length (23 L: 1 D or increasing duration of light) and light intensity (20 lux vs. dim light) with four replicates. In this study, photoperiod lenght had no effect on incidence of foot pad and <b>hock</b> <b>burn.</b> On the other hand, the effect of photoperiod lenght had significant influence on the gait score. The incidences of gait score (3 + 4 + 5) in bright and dim light groups was found as 21. 4 and 41. 0 % in broilers, respectively. In addition, the effect of light intensity had statistical significance on gait score. The tonic immobility duration in 20 lux and dim light groups were 271. 53 and 226. 78 s, respectively, and tonic immobility duration was unaffected by light intensity. All the blood parameters, except for triglyceride, were not affected by light intensity. The dim light had a negative effect on broiler welfare as demonstrated by increased eye weight and dimensions. Cold carcass yield and whole breast and wing yields were lower in the dim light group than in 20 lux light intensity. The broilers kept with dim light had lower breast meat ultimate pH (6. 19) and L* values (54. 30) than those reared with 20 lux. These findings have a lot of implications on the use of increasing photoperiod and bright light to improve leg an eye health benefits for the broiler welfare in broilers...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of litter thickness on growth performance, immune status, environmental condition, and welfare quality in yellow broilers. In total, 1, 800 one-day-old Suqin yellow broilers were raised for 21 d. On d 22, 1, 600 birds of similar BW (404 ± 12 g) were randomly selected and placed into 20 indoor pens (8 birds/m 2, 10 m 2 /pen). These birds were assigned to a litter treat-ment of 4, 8, 12, and 16 cm. Each treatment was re-peated in five pens. The results showed that a thicker litter was related to increased BW, daily weight gain, and daily feed intake (P < 0. 001). Feed conversion ra-tio and mortality were unaffected by litter thickness (P = 0. 320, P = 0. 353, respectively). Absolute and rela-tive liver weights showed a significant linear response to increasing litter thickness (P = 0. 01, P = 0. 001, respec-tively). The litter moisture content, air ammonia, and CO 2 content decreased, whereas the air dust content increased with increasing litter thickness (P < 0. 001, P = 0. 017, P = 0. 033, P < 0. 001, respectively). Litter thickness {{had no effect on}} gait, plumage damage, <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> or breast skin crusting (P = 0. 076, P = 0. 964, P = 0. 131, P = 0. 401, respectively). Plumage cleanli-ness, foot pad dermatitis, hock swelling and breast blis-ter varied significantly with litter thickness (P = 0. 027, P = 0. 011, P = 0. 014, P = 0. 042, respectively).

40|$|Red light (RL) marked higher {{weight gain}} (WG) and {{preference}} of broilers {{compared to other}} light colors. This study aimed to investigate how different intensities of RL affect the performance, behavior and welfare of broilers. RL treatments were T 1 = high intensity (320 lux), T 2 = medium intensity (20 lux); T 3 = dim intensity (5 lux), T 4 = control/white light at (20 lux) provided on 20 L: 4 D schedule and T 5 = negative control; 12 hours dark: 12 hours day light. Cobb strain broilers were used in a Complete Randomize Design with 6 replicates. WG, water/feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR), mortality, behavior and welfare were assessed. At 35 d, significantly (p< 0. 05) highest body weight (2, 147. 06 g± 99) was recorded by T 3. Lowest body weight (1, 640. 55 g± 56) and FCR (1. 34) were recorded by T 5. Skin weight was the only carcass parameter showed a significant (p< 0. 05) influence giving the highest (56. 2 g) and the lowest (12. 6 g) values for T 5 and T 1 respectively. Reduced welfare status indicated by significantly (p< 0. 05) higher foot pad lesions, <b>hock</b> <b>burns</b> and breast blisters was found under T 3, due to reduced expression of behavior. Highest walking (2. 08 %± 1 %) was performed under T 1 in the evening during 29 to 35 days. Highest dust bathing (3. 01 %± 2 %) was performed in the morning during 22 to 28 days and highest bird interaction (BI) (4. 87 %± 4 %) was observed in the evening by T 5 during 14 to 21 days. Light intensity×day session×age interaction was significantly (p< 0. 05) affected walking, dust bathing and BI. Light intensity significantly (p< 0. 05) affected certain behaviors such as lying, eating, drinking, standing, walking, preening while lying, wing/leg stretching, sleeping, dozing, BI, vocalization, idling. In conclusion, birds essentially required provision {{of light in the}} night for better performance. Exposed to 5 lux contributed to higher WG, potentially indicating compromised welfare status.

40|$|The {{effect of}} hatch {{location}} and diet density on {{the prevalence of}} footpad dermatitis and growth performance in broiler chickenswas studied. Broilers (Ross 308), incubated at 2 different hatch locations but originating from the same parent stock,were subjected to 2 feeding programs differing in energy content (2, 750 vs. 2, 950, 2, 850 vs. 3, 050, 2, 900 vs. 3, 100, and 2, 900 vs. 3, 100 kcal/kg for starter, grower I, grower II, and finisher diets, respectively) in a 2 × 2 factorial design (6 replicates per treatment combination). Broilers were housed under conditions and managed according to Dutch practice. Hatch location did not affect hatching results nor the prevalence and severity of footpad dermatitis, but did affect BW gain, feed, and water intake. A significant interaction was found between hatch location and feeding program; broilers fed the low-energy (LE) program had a better performance when hatched at Location 2 than at Location 1, whereas performance was similar for the high-energy (HE) broilers hatched at both locations. Broilers fed the LE program had similar BWgain but a higher feed conversion due to a higher feed intake as compared to broilers fed the HE program. In addition, moisture content of the litter in the pens with LE birds was higher than in pens with HE birds. As a result, broilers fed the LE program had more footpad dermatitis and hock burns at d 36 as compared to broilers fed the HE program. It is concluded that the HE feeding program is preferred to prevent footpad dermatitis and <b>hock</b> <b>burn,</b> and with respect to growth performance. The differences in growth performance between the 2 hatch locations merit further study but indicate {{the importance of the}} incubation and hatching environment and posthatch handling in relation to the growth performance of broilers on-farm...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to 1) identify determinants of poor welfare in commercial broiler chicken flocks by studying the associations between selected resource-based measures (RBM, potential risk factors), such as litter quality and dark period, and animal-based welfare indicators (ABM), such as foot pad dermatitis and lameness, and 2) establish the breadth of effect of a risk factor by determining the range of animal welfare indicators associated with each of the risk factors (i. e., the number of ABM related to a specific RBM). Eighty-nine broiler flocks were inspected in 4 European countries (France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands) in a cross-sectional study. The ABM were contact dermatitis (measured using scores of foot-pad dermatitis and <b>hock</b> <b>burn,</b> respectively), lameness (measured as gait score), fear of humans (measured by the avoidance distance test and the touch test), and negative emotional state (measured using qualitative behavior assessment, QBA). In a first step, risk factors were identified by building a multiple linear regression model for each ABM. Litter quality was identified as a risk factor for contact dermatitis. Length of dark period at 3 wk old (DARK 3) was a risk factor for the touch test result. DARK 3 and flock age were risk factors for lameness, and the number of different stockmen and DARK 3 were risk factors for QBA results. Next, the ABM were grouped according to risk factor and counted. Then, in a second step, associations between the ABM were investigated using common factor analysis. The breadth of a risk factor’s effect was judged by combining the number (count) of ABM related to this factor and the strength of association between these ABM. Flock age and DARK 3 appeared to affect several weakly correlated ABM, thus indicating a broad range of effects. Our findings suggest that manipulation of the predominant risk factors identified in this study (DARK 3, litter quality, and slaughter age) could generate improvements in the related ABM and thereby enhance the birds’ overall welfare statu...|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{information}} on the welfare of broilers reared in alternative systems is scarce. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the welfare of free-range broilers using the Welfare Quality® protocol. Free-range broilers reared in ten farms were observed, and measures were made in broilers of five of these farms. The collected data were transformed into scores (0 - 100), with higher scores indicating better welfare, except for emotional states. Prevalence percentages were calculated for the remaining data. Median (min-max) scores were 81 (63 - 98) for lameness, 93 (83 - 99) for <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> on the farm, 100 (95 - 100) for plumage cleanliness, 35 (8 - 70) for podermatitis on the farm, 56 (26 - 88) for density, 53 (20 - 53) for dust, 34 (14 - 67) for litter quality, 93 (41 - 100) for drinkers, and 100 (100 - 100) for birds panting or huddling on the farm. The following average (min-max) prevalence percentages were obtained: total mortality 2. 0 % (1. 4 - 7. 2 %), culling 0. 0 % (0. 0 - 2. 2 %), feed withdrawal time 875 min (715 - 945 min), water withdrawal time 220 min (170 - 275 min), dead on arrival at the processing plant 0. 00 % (0. 00 - 0. 01 %), broken wings 0 %, (0 - 0 %), inefficient stunning 3. 9 % (1. 3 - 6. 7 %), pre-stun shock 49. 3 % (26. 7 - 56. 8 %), hepatitis 4. 5 % (1. 8 - 11. 0 %), bruising 9. 3 % (6. 7 - 16. 7 %), and ascites 0 % (0 - 0 %). The negative broiler welfare points detected were pododermatitis, litter quality, density, dust, culling, feed withdrawal time, inefficient stunning, pre-stun shock, and hepatitis. The positive points identified were the absence of birds panting or huddling on the farm; low prevalence of lameness, hock lesions, dead on arrival, broken wings, and ascites; good plumage cleanliness scores, and short water withdrawal time...|$|E
40|$|Podo{{dermatitis}} (FPD) is {{a contact}} dermatitis commonly observed in poultry, primarily affecting {{the surface of}} the footpad and the hock joint, and causes poor welfare and economic losses when severe. Most reported field outbreaks of FPD have been associated with poor litter conditions. There are three important aspects of litter condition associated with incidences of FPD and hock burns (HB) i. e. increased litter moisture, greasy or capped litter as well as high ammonia (NH 3) content. Therefore maintaining litter quality and more specifically the moisture content is essential if conditions such FPD and HB are to be controlled. Poor litter condition is caused by an interaction between management, nutrition and intestinal health. In terms of nutrition, dietary density i. e. energy and protein concentrations are important factors in terms of determining litter quality and incidences of FPD, because of the effect that they exert on water intake. Four experiments were used to investigate the effects of nutritional modifications on water intake (WI) and excretion by turkeys. In the first experiment explored the effect of different dietary nutrient concentrations supplemented with and without phytase on WI and excretion. It was noted that excreta moisture content was reduced (P 0. 05) on the cumulative WI. Water output (g/g of weight gain) was higher (P 0. 05). In the next two experiments floor-pen studies were used {{to examine the effects of}} nutrient density and dietary protein concentration (ranging from 77 to 120 % of BUT breed recommendation) on litter quality parameters and, therefore, on leg health conditions. In one study the energy and protein ratio were kept constant whereas in the second the protein concentration changed while the energy remained constant (100 % of breed requirement). Growth performance parameters were determined for each study which was conducted from 4 to 20 weeks of age. When birds were fed diets in which the energy and protein ratio remained constant the high protein/energy diets resulted in a lower WI and litter moisture content when compared to group fed diet containing lower concentrations of protein/energy (P 0. 05) of treatment on FPD. Birds fed diets containing a higher than the recommended dietary protein concentration (constant energy concentration) had a higher WI and litter moisture content when compared to group fed diets containing the low nutrient density diets (P< 0. 001). Likewise, litter pH and NH 3 concentration and prevalence of HB and FPD were higher where birds were fed the higher than recommended protein concentration diets. The final experiment was designed to establish the relative importance of protein and potassium in determining WI and excretion. There were six treatments based on three diets containing either 77, 100 and 120 % of the dietary protein recommended by the breeder. Each diet was then split into two and one of the two diets was supplemented with K 2 CO 3 to give a K+ concentration of 16. 5 g/kg of diet. The remaining diet of the pair was left unsupplemented (ie contained only naturally occurring potassium). It was noted that birds fed with diet containing higher dietary protein concentration had higher WI and moisture output (MO) when compared to group fed diet containing lower dietary protein concentration (P< 0. 001). The effect within diets containing the same CP and standardised K+ was marginally insignificant (P= 0. 065) in terms of WI. Whereas birds fed diets containing naturally occurring K+ only had approximately 10 % less (P< 0. 05) MO compared to these fed diets containing the standardised concentration of K+. While recognising that factors such as non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), indigestible fat and trypsin inhibitor could not be excluded totally, it was concluded, on the basis of the experiments conducted, that dietary protein (as provided by soybean meal) was primarily responsible for the higher WI and hence excretion. This then ultimately produces unacceptable litter quality and results in leg health problems in turkeys. To prevent excessive water intake and reduce litter moisture content there should be a correct balance between dietary energy and protein levels. Feeding turkeys lower ideal protein diets containing higher apparent metabolisable energy ratio crude protein (AME:CP) may help to improve the amino acid digestibility and ionic balance and, therefore, litter quality and this will help to decrease leg health problems such as footpad dermatitis and <b>hock</b> <b>burn.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The PhD {{project was}} focused on the study of the poultry welfare {{conditions}} and improvements. The project work was divided into 3 main research activities. A) Field evaluation of chicken meat rearing conditions kept in intensive farms. Considering the lack of published reports concerning the overall Italian rearing conditions of broiler chickens, a survey was carried out to assess the welfare conditions of broiler reared in the most important poultry companies in Italy to verify if they are in accordance with the advices given in the European proposal COM (2005) 221 final. Chicken farm conditions, carcass lesions and meat quality were investigated. 1. The densities currently used in Italy are in accordance with the European proposal COM 221 final (2005) which suggests to keep broilers at a density lower than 30 - 32 kg live weight/m 2 and to not exceed 38 - 40 kg live weight/m 2. 2. The mortality rates in summer and winter agree with the mortality score calculated following the formula reported in the EU Proposal COM 221 final (2005). 3. The incidence of damaged carcasses was very low and did not seem related to the stocking density. 4. The FPD scores were generally above the maximum limit advised by the EU proposal COM 221 final (2005), although the stocking densities were lower than 30 - 32 kg live weight per m 2. 5. It can be stated that the control of the environmental conditions, particularly litter quality, appears a key issue to control the onset of foot dermatitis. B) Manipulation of several farm parameters, such litter material and depth, stocking density and light regimen to improve the chicken welfare conditions, in winter season. 1. Even though 2 different stocking densities were established in this study, the performances achieved from the chickens were almost identical among groups. 2. The FCR was significantly better in Standard conditions contrarily to birds reared in Welfare conditions with lower stocking density, more litter material and with a light program of 16 hours light and 8 hours dark. 3. In our trial, in Standard groups we observed a higher content of moisture, nitrogen and ammonia released from the litter. Therefore it can be assumed that the environmental characteristics have been positively changed by the improvements of the rearing conditions adopted for Welfare groups. 4. In Welfare groups the exhausted litters of the pens were dryer and broilers showed a lower occurrence of FPD. 5. The prevalence of <b>hock</b> <b>burn</b> lesions, like FPD, is high with poor litter quality conditions. 6. The combined effect of a lower stocking density, a greater amount of litter material and a photoperiod similar to the natural one, have positively influenced the chickens welfare status, {{as a matter of fact}} the occurrence of FPD in Welfare groups was the lowest keeping the score under the European threshold of the proposal COM 221 final(2005). C) The purpose of the third research was to study the effect of high or low stocking density of broiler chickens, different types of litter and the adoption of short or long lighting regimen on broiler welfare through the evaluation of their productivity and incidence of foot pad dermatitis during the hot season. 1. The feed efficiency was better for the Low Density than for High Density broilers. 2. The appearance of FPD was not influenced by stocking density. 3. The foot examination revealed that the lesions occurred more in birds maintained on chopped wheat straw than on wood shaving. 4. In conclusion, the adoptions of a short light regimen similar to that occurring in nature during summer reduces the feed intake without modify the growth rate thus improving the feed efficiency. Foot pad lesion were not affected neither by stocking densities nor by light regimens whereas wood shavings exerted a favourable effect in preserving foot pad in good condition. D) A study was carried out to investigate more widely the possible role of 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol supplemented in the diet of a laying hen commercial strain (Lohmann brown) in comparison of diets supplemented with D 3 or with D 3 + 25 - hydroxycholecalciferol. Egg traits during a productive cycle as well as the bone characteristics of the layers have been as well evaluated to determine if there the vitamin D 3 may enhance the welfare status of the birds. 1. The weight of the egg and of its components is often greater in hens fed a diet enriched with 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol. 2. Since eggs of treated groups are heavier and a larger amount of shell is needed, a direct effect on shell strength is observed. 3. At 30 and at 50 wk of age hens fed 25 hydroxycholecalciferol exhibited greater values of bone breaking force. 4. Radiographic density values obtained in the trial are always higher in hens fed with 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol of both treatments: supplemented for the whole laying cycle (25 D 3) or from 40 weeks of age onward (D 3 + 25 D 3) ...|$|E
