2500|$|Woven bone is {{produced}} when osteoblasts produce osteoid rapidly, which occurs initially in all fetal bones, but is later replaced by more resilient lamellar bone. In adults woven bone is created after fractures or in Paget's disease. Woven bone is weaker, {{with a smaller}} number of randomly oriented collagen fibers, but forms quickly; it is for this appearance of the <b>fibrous</b> <b>matrix</b> that the bone is termed woven. It is soon replaced by lamellar bone, which is highly organized in concentric sheets with a much lower proportion of osteocytes to surrounding tissue. Lamellar bone, which makes its first appearance in humans in the fetus during the third trimester, is stronger and filled with many collagen fibers parallel to other fibers in the same layer (these parallel columns are called osteons). [...] In cross-section, the fibers run in opposite directions in alternating layers, much like in plywood, assisting in the bone's ability to resist torsion forces. After a fracture, woven bone forms initially and is gradually replaced by lamellar bone during a process known as [...] "bony substitution." [...] Compared to woven bone, lamellar bone formation takes place more slowly. The orderly deposition of collagen fibers restricts the formation of osteoid to about 1 to 2µm per day. Lamellar bone also requires a relatively flat surface to lay the collagen fibers in parallel or concentric layers.|$|E

50|$|This {{is due to}} the way {{in which}} the two {{materials}} break. Wood, which is a natural <b>fibrous</b> <b>matrix,</b> flexes to a certain degree before it snaps at the target point. When unpegged, this allows for an entire stack of wood to flex upon impact, resulting in the break occurring in the order of furthest board from impact to the closest board (albeit a fraction of a second difference separates each board, making it appear instantaneous). This can be witnessed in many novice demonstrations where the rear board will break, but the remaining top boards are intact. When pegged, the gap between the boards necessitates each individual board to flex and snap before the next board is reached in succession. Bricks, on the other hand, are ceramic, and snap (or shatter) upon impact, with no flex action.|$|E

Using reductionist approaches based on 3 D electrospun fibers, we report for various cell types that single-cell migration along fibronectin-coated nanofibers is associated with lateral actin-based waves. These cyclical waves have a fin-like shape and propagate up to several hundred micrometers from the cell body, extending the leading edge and promoting highly persistent directional movement. Cells generate these waves through balanced activation of the Rac 1 /N-WASP/Arp 2 / 3 and Rho/formins pathways. The waves originate from one major adhesion site at leading end of the cell body, which is linked through actomyosin contractility to another site {{at the back of}} the cell, allowing force generation, matrix deformation and cell translocation.

The work presented here aimed to use Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to study paper surface sizing, namely, the penetration of the sizing chemicals into the paper structure. Two different surface sizing formulations were applied to paper produced from Eucalyptus globulus bleached pulp (reference paper) : both contain 90 % (w/w) cationic starch, but one contains 10 % (w/w) poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) whereas the other contains 10 % (w/w) poly(styrene-co-butyl acrylate). The surface-sized paper sheets were further manually delaminated, so that the top surfaces as well as the internal layers could be analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy.

From the spectroscopic results, it was possible to detect the presence of the copolymers on the paper top surfaces, despite the application of only small amounts of these chemicals in the surface sizing.
