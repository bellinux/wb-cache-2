5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors <b>interpret</b> these verses to mean {{that the world is}} real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators <b>interpret</b> these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others <b>interpret</b> them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is remote <b>interpreting</b> (RI). Our {{objective}} has been to describe the current experience with this new kind of <b>interpreting,</b> the reasons for its application, {{the opinions of the}} interpreters and the impact of RI on their work and health. The paper is divided in two sections. In the theoretical part, we explained the term remote <b>interpreting</b> and its two meanings: (distance <b>interpreting</b> in general x simultaneous conference <b>interpreting</b> without direct view at the speaker). A short description of the various types of distance <b>interpreting</b> (telephone <b>interpreting,</b> <b>interpreting</b> for deafs and in media) and the modern ways of conferencing make a panorama of situations in which the distance <b>interpreting</b> is (or could be) used...|$|R

40|$|Whether and how language-pair {{specificity}} {{affects the}} process and product of <b>interpreting</b> is a recurring implicit topic of debate in <b>interpreting</b> studies. Previous discussions have touched upon this issue in Japanese/English and German/English <b>interpreting,</b> with little attention to its role in Chinese/English <b>interpreting.</b> This study focuses {{on the effect of}} structural asymmetry between English and Chinese on English-Chinese simultaneous <b>interpreting</b> performance, which is exemplified by right-branching structures in English and left-branching structures in Chinese. Based on a naturalistic observation of three professional interpreters’ on-site simultaneous interpretations of the same speech, it investigates two major questions: a) Does structural asymmetry between English and Chinese constitute particular difficulties in the interpreters’ <b>interpreting</b> performance? b) If yes, how does such language-pair specificity affect their <b>interpreting</b> product? While previous <b>interpreting</b> studies generally consider that the <b>interpreting</b> product is shaped by three major variables including the interpreter’s <b>interpreting</b> competence, cognitive conditions on the site and norms of <b>interpreting,</b> findings of the present study suggest that language-pair specificity functions as another variable in English-Chinese <b>interpreting.</b> It implies the necessity of considering it in the theoretical account of <b>interpreting</b> between languages such as English and Chinese that involve significant contrasts in linguistic structure and cultural conceptualization...|$|R
40|$|<b>Interpreting</b> is {{generally}} {{recognized as a}} particularly demanding language processing task for the cognitive system. Dependency distance, the linear distance between two syntactically related words in a sentence, is an index of sentence complexity and is also able to reflect the cognitive constraints during various tasks. In the current research, we examine the difference in dependency distance among three <b>interpreting</b> types, namely, simultaneous <b>interpreting,</b> consecutive <b>interpreting</b> and read-out translated speech based on a treebank comprising these types of <b>interpreting</b> output texts with dependency annotation. Results show that different <b>interpreting</b> renditions yield different dependency distances, and consecutive <b>interpreting</b> texts entail the smallest dependency distance other than those of simultaneous <b>interpreting</b> and read-out translated speech, suggesting that consecutive <b>interpreting</b> bears heavier cognitive demands than simultaneous <b>interpreting.</b> The current research suggests {{for the first time}} that <b>interpreting</b> is an extremely demanding cognitive task that can further mediate the dependency distance of output sentences. Such findings may be due to the minimization of dependency distance under cognitive constraints...|$|R

40|$|Remote <b>interpreting,</b> {{whereby the}} {{interpreter}} is physically separated {{from those who}} need the interpretation, has been investigated in relation to conference and healthcare settings. By contrast, very {{little is known about}} remote <b>interpreting</b> in legal proceedings, where this method of <b>interpreting</b> is increasingly used to optimise interpreters’ availability. This paper reports the findings of an experimental study investigating the viability of videoconference-based remote <b>interpreting</b> in legal contexts. The study compared the quality of interpreter performance in traditional and remote <b>interpreting,</b> both using the consecutive mode. Two simulated police interviews of detainees, recreating authentic situations, were <b>interpreted</b> by eight interpreters with accreditation and professional experience in police <b>interpreting.</b> The languages involved were French (in most cases the interpreter’s native language) and English. Each interpreter <b>interpreted</b> one of the interviews in remote <b>interpreting,</b> and the other in a traditional face-to-face setting. Various types of problem in the interpretations were analysed, quantitatively and qualitatively. Among the key findings are a significantly higher number of <b>interpreting</b> problems, and a faster decline of <b>interpreting</b> performance over time, in remote <b>interpreting.</b> The paper gives details of these findings, and discusses the potential legal consequences of the problems identified...|$|R
