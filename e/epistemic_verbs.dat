50|$|Albert’s voluminous {{collection}} of Sophismata (c. 1359) examined various sentences that raise difficulties of interpretation {{due to the}} presence of syncategorematic terms such as quantifiers and certain prepositions, which, according to medieval logicians, do not have a proper and determinate signification but rather modify the signification of the other terms in the propositions in which they occur. In his Sophismata, he followed William Heytesbury. In his analysis of <b>epistemic</b> <b>verbs</b> or of infinity, Albert admitted that a proposition has its own signification, which is not that of its terms: just like a syncategorematic term, a proposition signifies a “mode of a thing.” Albert made use of the idea of the distinguishable signification of the proposition in defining truth and in dealing with “insolubles” or paradoxes of self-reference. In this work he shows that since every proposition, by its very form, signifies that it is true, an insoluble proposition {{will turn out to be}} false because it will signify at once both that it is true and that it is false.|$|E

Less salient mental spaces are omitted in the textual representation. The summary generation component has access to language specific ways of formulating news reports. The text generator also provides the syntactic structures with prosodic markers that modify the default prosodic rules of the text-to-speech system that reads the summary. 1 Introduction: Tex...|$|E

This has been extensively discussed following Kuno (1976) for the case where the matrix predicate is an <b>epistemic</b> <b>verb.</b> Under CCG analysis an o-marked phrase is a surfacecompositional object rather than a raised argument.

40|$|This paper takes a {{cognitive}} perspective on epistemic complementation constructions in English, {{focusing on the}} contrast between constructions of the type [X thinks that Y] and [X thinks Y]. Given that English has two different syntactic constructions for building up the same semantic content, the question to be raised, based on the Non-Synonymy Principle (Goldberg, 1995), is: what is the pragmatic difference between them? In this paper, we aim at addressing this question, relying on the notions of subjectivity and intersubjectivity (Langacker, 1990; Verhagen, 2005). The analysis is based on real corpus data, consisting of complementation constructions instantiated by <b>epistemic</b> <b>verbs</b> such as think, suppose, believe, find and know, which were gathered from transcribed interviews (Kepler, 1995, 2009). Our main arguments are: (i) Epistemic complementation constructions (e. g. I think that he’ll come and I think he’ll come) are more subjective than corresponding independent clauses (e. g. He’ll come), since the former directly or indirectly codes the Ground (speaker, hearer an...|$|E

By applying corpus-based methodology, we also illustrate the functional variability of think –the most salient of these lexical verbs–, especially the roles it performs when hedging the discourse and complying with politeness conventions as part of interactional and metadiscoursal strategies. At a textual level, results indicate that lecturing speech favors the proliferation of evaluation markers {{that appear to be}} arranged in several recurrent formal patterns.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{whether and}} how gradability is manifested in the nominal domain, {{as well as the}} implications this could have for theories of the representation of gradability. 	It is shown that the various gradability diagnostics proposed in the literature not only yield different results, but that they do not actually work as could be expected. In case after case, other factors turn out to underlie the noted effects: epistemicity and evidentiality (cf. the <b>epistemic</b> <b>verb</b> seem and real-type adjectives), the expression of a value judgment (e. g. N of an N constructions), the delineation of salient sub-kinds identifiable by natural consequences (cf. internal such) and abstract size modification (e. g. when a size adjective like big modifies a noun denoting an instance of a property or a set of individuals defined in terms of such an abstract object). 	Our investigation leads to the unexpected conclusion that,there are no grammatical contexts in the nominal domain that are exclusively reserved for a particular class of nouns that could properly be called gradable. As a result, there is no motivation for postulating a degree structure in the syntactic representation of nouns. In addition, there are no expressions performing the type of semantic operations familiar from degree modification in the adjectival domain that would indicate the existence of a grammatically accessible gradable structure in the semantics of nouns at the lexical level. The tale of this dissertation is therefore a cautionary one: arguments to reduce gradability in the nominal and in the adjectival domain to the same phenomenon are misguided. 	This study shows the importance of a cross-categorial perspective for a better understanding of gradability. It is of interest to a general syntactic and semantic readership. Promotor: J. E. C. V.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the field of interlanguage {{pragmatics}} – the study of L 2 use and development – has neglected facework strategies that are directed towards the speaker rather than the hearer. These strategies serve to present particular identities and qualities of the speaker. This is exemplified through examples from L 2 learners of German at three different levels of proficiency taking part in an argumentation task and retrospective interviews with thee learners. The analysis shows that, the lower learners’ level of proficiency is, {{the more likely it}} is that the organisation of the discourse and the use of <b>epistemic</b> <b>verbs</b> such as ‘ich denke’ (I think) are oriented towards the maintenance of a ‘good L 2 speaker’ face. Learners in essence play the role of a language learner rather than the role imposed on them by the argumentative task, and ‘politeness’ towards the interlocutor is not at the forefront of their mind. As a consequence, the paper suggests that interlanguage pragmatics needs to integrate perspectives which see face management as more than the mere enactment of politeness...|$|E
40|$|Attenuating {{devices are}} {{frequently}} employed in both spoken and written language {{to weaken the}} illocutionary force of utterances {{as well as their}} directness. In this way, they are associated with expressing linguistic politeness. In scientific discourse, hedges are largely used to express negative politeness since the authors aim to protect themselves against disapproving or critical remarks of text recipients. Linguistically, hedging devices are realised in various ways, e. g. as modal adverbs (possibly, perhaps, probably,…), modal adjectives (possible, (un) likely, probable, [...] .), modal nouns (assumption, possibility, suggestion,…), modal verbs expressing possibility (might, could, would,…), <b>epistemic</b> <b>verbs</b> (assume, seem, appear, suggest,…), approximators such as approximately and roughly, etc. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse hedging devices in written academic discourse, in particular in English and Czech medical research papers published in medical journals with an impact factor, and compare them with respect to their types, occurrence and communicative functions they perform. In other words, to find out whether the pragmatics of hedging is or is not culture-specific. Hedging devices may be classified from various points of view.

40|$|This papers {{explains}} the syntactic behaviour of the verbal sequences of two verbs (Vl+V 2) -and specifically the sequences haver + participle, va + infinitive, and modal <b>epistemic</b> <b>verbs</b> + infinitive- in Catalan {{as the result}} of the syntactic and morphological characteristics of V 1. These characteristics are given by the following specifications of affixal features: [+ syntacticl- morphological]. With these we predict the behaviour attested if we follow Baker (1988) 's theory of incorporation with the modifications in Roberts (1991) and his excorporation proposal. The consequence of the given specifications for the features is that the two verbal elements in the sequences are always adjacent in Catalan as long as we assume that V 1 selects V 2 and that this selection implies morphological subcategorization. The result of this type of subcategorization is the creation of a slot in the structure which requires substitution in the course of the derivation. Three crucial predictions follow from considering V 1 an affix: (a) that V 2 cannot move once it has incorporated unless there is another fi which may replace it (another V); (b) that the selecting element cannot move either (by the Stray Affin Principle), and (c) that incorporation is wmpulsory. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Korean verb alta, {{preceded by}} a {{proposition}} nominalized {{by means of the}} dependant noun cwul, can be interpreted as a dynamic modal verb expressing an ability as well as an <b>epistemic</b> modal <b>verb</b> expressing factivity, counter-factivity or non-factivity. In the cases of dynamic and factive modality, the dependent noun cwul can be followed by the accusative mark, while in the cases of counter-/ non-factive modality, it cannot. However, the absence of the accusative mark does not lead systematically to a counter-/ non-factive interpretation. This study identifies syntactic and semantic features associated with each modality expressed by the verb alta. The hypothesis defended is that the counter-/ non-factive interpretation of the verb alta is due to the grammaticalization of this verb, which loses its syntactic autonomy and triggers a syntactic and interpretative reanalysis...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we try to}} {{contribute}} to the body of knowledge about the acquisition of English <b>epistemic</b> modal <b>verbs</b> (e. g. Mary may/has to be at school).

40|$|Abstract. Lechner (2006) {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the scopal interaction of English <b>epistemic</b> modal <b>verbs</b> with negated strong quantiers in the framework of Transparent Logical Form, which constructs semantic representations as extensions of syntax trees. Noting conceptual and empirical shortcomings of this ap-proach, we propose an analysis in Lexical Resource Semantics, a constraint-based semantics framework embedded in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar. Our analysis treats the original English data as well as semantically parallel constructions in German, although the syntax of the German constructions is sub-stantively different from English. The LRS framework views syntax and semantics as independent modules connected by a complex interface employing modern underspecication techniques. It permits a surface-oriented syntactic analysis without a multitude of additional empty categories, which has clear advantages for the application of efcient parsing algorithms. At the same time, the LRS analysis elegantly captures crosslinguistic generalizations about the semantic phenomenon under investigation. ...|$|R

The present study aims to reveal the tendency and preferences of Turkish and Anglo-sphere scholars in terms of using hedging strategies, and frequency of hedges and whether any differences exist in their published articles. Data corpus was composed of 100 articles published in English that equally belong to Non-native writers (Turkish) and native writers of English (Anglo-sphere). Three main parts of the articles i. e. Introduction, Discussion, and Conclusion, where hedging devices are commonly used will be analyzed through a concordance program to get the hedge frequencies. The outputs will be categorized according to a framework included 9 hedge types (Adverbs of Frequency, Quantifiers, Modal Auxiliary Verbs, <b>Epistemic</b> <b>Verbs,</b> Adjectives & Adverbs, Nouns, Conversational & Informal, Introductory phrases, Vague References). The categorized outputs will be analyzed by means of MANOVA and Mann-Whitney tests to compare Non-native writers (NNW) and Native writers (NW) in terms of the hedge frequency. Having completed statistical analyses, the function of hedges used in both groups was examined so as to interpret hedging strategies. The results will provide important insights about using tentative language strategies of NNWs and NWs of English. Further, as for nine hedging types, the results will reveal each group's hedging tendencies and differences...|$|E
40|$|Subjunctive mood in {{complement}} clauses is licensed under selection {{from certain}} predicates {{or under the}} scope of a modal or negation. In contexts where mood choice varies, such as the complement of a negated epistemic verb no creer, it introduces a contrast in interpretation. The subjunctive is thought {{to contribute to a}} shift in the modal anchoring of the embedded clause, and is consequently interpreted as indicative of a dissociation between the epistemic models of the speaker and the subject. We provide evidence that these uses also interact with pragmatic context. Given independent claims that 1) the overt realization of first person subject pronouns is contrastive and 2) it generally serves to anchor discourse to the speaker’s perspective and 3) overt use is particularly frequent with <b>epistemic</b> <b>verbs,</b> we examined the interaction between negation, first person subject pronoun realization, and mood of the dependent clause for the verb creer.  An analysis of oral speech from the Proyecto de Habla Culta revealed that for negative sentences (no creo que), yo is overtly realized more frequently for cases with exceptional indicative dependents than for those with canonical subjunctive dependents; there was no association with mood for affirmative uses of creer. These results support analyses where negation has specific scope over the contrastive subject, rather than over the epistemic clause. As a consequence, the matrix proposition remains an assertion and use of indicative complements is licensed...|$|E

This hypothesis fits well with certain instances of optionaiity observed in infinitivai contexts.

They are all unified in a try to evaluate two recent hypotheses about clitic placement in Western Romances. I mainly use data from Asturian (an almost forgotten Western Romance). The paper is organized as follows: section 1 presents the basic facts about clitic placement in Asturian, and introduces Rouveret and Uriagereka's hypothesis about them; section 2 offers certain data that do not seem to fit well with any of them; section 3 concludes, finally, that only Rouveret's hypothesis, implemented with some theoretical devices independently needed by the theory, can surmount the conflictive data of the previous section...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEpistemic modal markers are {{frequent}} in medical discourse (Salager-Meyer, 1992 and Vold, 2006), {{as they are}} used to construct the rhetorical strategies of hedging and boosting through which authors position themselves on the continuum of (un) certainty. The choice of these expressions is dictated, among others, by the communicative purpose of the discourse and the level of claim the authors wish to make (Salager-Meyer, 1996). Research article abstracts serve as a basis for medical decision-making (Yavchitz, 2015) and their communicative function is the accurate transmission of research results into medical practice. In Cochrane medical abstracts, epistemic modal markers such as ‘probably’ or ‘may’ are used to convey different levels of proof and confidence in the results (Glenton, Santesso, Rosenbaum, Nilsen, Rader, Ciapponi & Dilkes, 2010). The use of hedging and boosting strategies differs between English- and French-language authors, the latter having a reputation for being less hedged and more affirmative than the former (Salager-Meyer, Ariza & Zambrano, 2003). These differences in modalisation strategies are also reflected in translations from English to French, and crucial in the correct decoding of the target language (Pilegaard, 1997). The modal auxiliary ‘may’, for instance, is used in medical abstracts as an epistemic as well as evidential marker (Alonso-Almeida & Cruz-García, 2011). In the Cochrane abstracts corpus compiled for our preliminary study (Martikainen, 2017), ‘may’ is translated mainly (49 %) by the indicative mode of the verb ‘pouvoir’, which is naturally more affirmative than the conditional mode used in 35 % of the cases. The first translation solution is therefore likely to positively bias readers’ interpretation of results, in regard of the level of certainty conveyed by ‘may’. Using a context-specific typology drafted for this purpose, we will conduct a corpus study on sources of bias in translated Cochrane abstracts that will establish the frequency of modal sources of bias by type (auxiliaries, <b>epistemic</b> <b>verbs,</b> adjectives and adverbs, modal clusters) and comparatively to other sources of bias, namely certain translation errors. We will also encode their impact (positive/negative) on the level of certainty. We hypothesize that the more affirmative writing style of French scientific discourse will also be perceptible in translated abstracts, in which we expect to see a tendency towards positively biased translations of epistemic modal markers of hedging and boosting...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how the communicative {{purpose of}} the different rhetorical sections of research papers (RP) and case reports (CR) in medical English written discourse influences the frequency and category distribution of the modulation devices (hedges) used in each section. To this end, we analyzed a corpus of 15 articles drawn from five leading medical journals. Hedges were identified {{by means of a}} contextual analysis, their frequency was recorded in the different rhetorical sections of the 15 articles, and their percentages (over the total number of running words) were computed. The hedges recorded were then classified according to five pre-established categories, and their percentual distribution per category was evaluated in each rhetorical section. The results were analyzed by means of Chi-square tests. Our research indicates that the three most frequently used hedging devices in both text-types (shields, approximators and compound hedges) account for over 90 % {{of the total number of}} hedges used in our sample. The Discussion (RP) /Comment (CR) sections are the most heavily hedged sections, whereas the Methods (RP) and the Case Report sections (CR) are the least-hedged rhetorical divisions (p=. 001 and. 071 respectively). The Introduction section of both RP and CR favors shields (mainly <b>epistemic</b> <b>verbs)</b> as a hedging convention followed by approximators (negative or quasi negative expressions in RP Introductions, and adaptors of frequency in CR Introductions). In the Introduction hedges allow researchers to establish an "early niche" for their research. Scientific writers mostly resort to approximators as a hedging technique in the Methods section (p=. 0001) as well as in the Results sections of RP and in the Case Report sections of CR. Shields (mostly modal verbs) are also used (although to a much lesser extent) in the Result section of RP to evaluate, interpret and comment on the findings of the research being reported. Both shields and compound-hedges are the most frequently encountered hedging devices in the Discussion/Comments sections of RP and CR. Finally, the distribution of hedges in the Case Report section in CR resembles that observed in the Result section in RP, but it is significantly richer in approximators (p=. 0001) used for describing symptoms and for conveying the idea of range. We conclude that the choice of expressions of tentativeness and flexibility is dictated by the general structure of the discourse, by its communicative purpose, by the level of claim the writers wish to make, and by the authors' pretension to universality and generalization. Because hedging in scientific discourse is a necessary and vitally important skill, we finally provide some pedagogical implications of our research such as the use of sensitization, translation and rewriting exercises in ESP courses. 149 - 171 frmeyer@cantv. ne...|$|E

More precisely, the article focuses on qualifying adjectives describing scale of “seriousness” together with the recommended “dosage”. It also looks at <b>epistemic</b> modal <b>verbs</b> (Halliday 2004; Palmer 1986), as well as adverbial adjuncts (Halliday 2004). “Vagueness {{is a form of}} unclarity – specifically, an unclarity about the boundaries of things” (Raffman 2014, p. 2). As a consequence, a concept or word is vague if it allows borderline cases (Smith 2008, p. 1; Van Deemter 2010, p. 8). PILs (and not only) are rich in vague expressions: sometimes they are “necessary” (Encott 200), but at other times they can be omitted so as to make a text more comprehensible for the addressee. For example, is it really necessary to use multiple adjectives such as “bad”, “severe”, “serious” within the same PIL or in several PILs, instead of using only one, perhaps the most common and understandable, for example the word “bad”...|$|R

A number of markers are counted to see which expressions are preferred by L 1 and L 2 writers respectively and if the frequency rates differ between the two groups.

Compared to the native writers, the L 2 writers display higher frequency rates when it comes to markers that are most commonly found in spoken conversation. Further the L 2 writers seem to display more ‘writer visibility’ than the L 1 writers do, which could perhaps be due to differences in writing culture.

Recent studies have investigated the role that aspect plays in the difficulties found in tense morphology. It {{has been suggested that}} children with SLI are less sensitive to aspect and its interaction with tense than typically developing (TD) children. Profound impairment in past tense morphology compared with the present in this population was explained by a breakdown in the association between event completion information and past tense. To date, research on tense morphology in this population has not examined all three tense conditions in a single study. Aims To examine whether monolingual Turkish-speaking children with SLI exhibit deficits in comprehending tense and aspect morphology, and, if so, whether these deficits are restricted to completed events (past tense) or also occur for incomplete non-past events (future and present tense). Methods & Procedures A sentence–picture matching task was administered to 36 monolingual Turkish-speaking children: 13 with SLI (mean age = 6; 9 years) and 23 age-matched TD children (mean age = 6; 5 years). Upon hearing a sentence, each child had to select between a target (past, present or future) and a distracter picture. Tense and aspect information could only be established from verb morphology. Outcomes & Results The SLI group had lower accuracy than the TD group on all test conditions. For both groups, present tense had the highest accuracy scores. Performance scores within the SLI group showed the following hierarchy from easy to difficult: present > future > past. Conclusions & Implications Turkish children with SLI have deficits in comprehending tense and aspect morphology. Although comprehending past was more difficult than non-past (present and future), future was more difficult to comprehend than the present. This disassociation between two non-past incomplete events indicates that the underlying difficulties comprehending (past) tense–aspect is not restricted to event completion in past tense contexts. This finding raises the possibility that in children with SLI, non-temporal <b>epistemic</b> functions of <b>verb</b> morphology (i. e., certainty, probability or possibility of an event occurring) might play a role in efficient understanding of tense and aspect morphology. If so, children with SLI may benefit from language therapy focused on the <b>epistemic</b> functions of <b>verb</b> morphology to improve comprehension of tense and aspect...|$|R
40|$|English {{speakers}} {{talk and}} think about Time in terms of physical space. The past is behind us, and the future {{is in front of}} us. In this way, we ‘map’ space onto Time. This dissertation addresses the specificity of this physical space, or its topography. Inspired by languages like Yupno (Núñez, et al., 2012) and Bamileke-Dschang (Hyman, 1980), languages that encode temporal events through physical downhill/uphill topography or through fine-grained proximal-distal grammatical forms, this dissertation revisits our understanding of English by asking the extent to which English speakers, too, construe temporal events as physically proximal or distal with relation to a deictic center. Through seven experiments featuring two novel paradigms with physical space both behind and in front of the deictic center, this dissertation shows that English speakers construe Time through fine-grained topographical space, with tomorrow physically closer to a deictic center than next year. Since thought and language are inextricably connected, it also addresses the extent to which grammaticalized constructions, such as future forms (be going to vs. will) and <b>epistemic</b> modal <b>verbs</b> (may vs. might) encode proximal-distal temporal distinctions (Comrie, 1985; Langacker, 2008). English speakers have multiple means of construing fine-grained past or future events, co-locating the present either with the ego (e. g., The past is behind me) or with an external locus, like a square on a calendar (Núñez and Cooperrider, 2013). Therefore, this dissertation also examines the conditions under which English speakers adopt an external deictic center or default to an internal one, essentially demonstrating the contextual flexibility of speakers’ space-time construals. Finally, English speakers have also been shown to recruit representations of physical motion when processing temporal events (e. g., We’re approaching summer) (Boroditsky 2 ̆ 6 Ramscar, 2002). Using a novel paradigm in which participants estimate physical distances behind and in front of them, this dissertation shows that English speakers recruit representations of motion when co-locating the present with the ego, but not when they co-locate the present with an external locus. In these ways, this dissertation serves as a first map of English speakers’ space-time topography, providing a new perspective on the interaction of language and cognition when speakers cognize temporal events...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concentrates}} on modality as {{expressed by the}} set of modal auxiliaries and seeks to establish that these verbs share semantic as well as syntactic properties by identifying a single core meaning which they share. The relationship between modality and factivity is examined {{with the aim of}} gaining an insight into the former, more complex concept. When viewed from this perspective, the defining characteristic of all the modal auxiliary verbs in almost all of their uses is found to be nonfactivity. The meanings expressed by this set of verbs are classified according to a framework derived from modal logic consisting of three basic types of modality each of which relates to a different set of laws or principles; the relative factivity associated with the modal auxiliaries is seen to vary with the nature of modality as defined and classified by this framework. Within each of the three types of modality, a semantic scale is identified and modality is described as a gradable concept for which scalar analysis is appropriate, both within and beyond these three scales. Relative factivity is also shown to vary according to the degree of modality expressed by each of the modal verbs. The nature and degree of modality expressed interact with features of the linguistic (and pragmatic) context to determine the particular factive or a contrafactive interpretation conveyed by a given modal auxiliary token. The influence of certain combinations of contextual features is sufficiently strong to force a factive or contrafactive reading of a modal token, although in general the role of such features is merely to strengthen or weaken the relative factivity associated with the modal <b>verb.</b> <b>Epistemic</b> modality is seen to be most directly related to nonfactivity and therefore to be the most central modal meaning. The modal auxiliaries are found to be semantically less modal when they occur in contexts of determinate factual status. Least modal are those members of this set of auxiliary verbs which in certain uses have determinate factual status even without the presence of any of the significant contextual features...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of explicit and implicit instruction on the interlanguage pragmatic development of Japanese EFL learners. The interventions, which were taught in intact classes, focused on the semantic-pragmatic domain of epistemic stance. The main research questions guiding this study focused on the relative effects of explicit and implicit instruction on the short- and long-term acquisition of epistemic stance. This study also investigated the interaction between type of instruction and the following four variables: (l) mode of communication (writing/speaking); (2) proficiency; (3) difficulty of target forms; (4) individual differences. Eighty-one Japanese EFL learners at a national university took part {{in all parts of}} this study. They were divided into explicit and implicit instruction groups for the interventions (4 x 45 minutes), which covered the whole domain of <b>epistemic</b> stance (cognitive <b>verbs,</b> evidential verbs, modal verbs, modal adverbs and epistemic expressions). Free production data (spoken and written) was collected from the participants shortly before the intervention (pre-test), soon after the intervention (post-test) and approximately five months after the intervention (delayed post-test). For both the spoken and written data participants completed two tasks: a picture description and an opinion statement. The learners' data was analyzed using a combination of corpus linguistic techniques and manual analysis, which included the calculation of epistemic token and type scores to measure the frequency and variety of epistemic stance use, respectively. As regards immediate instructional effects, explicit instruction was found to be more effective than implicit instruction. The findings for long-term effects were similar, although a partial loss of immediate gains was observed. The main findings for the four variables were as follows: (1) both types of instruction had stronger effects on writing than speaking, and particularly in the long-term; (2) proficiency did not {{play a major role in}} determining the degree of instructional effectiveness, although typical patterns in the development of the means of expressing epistemic stance were observed; (3) some forms were acquired more easily than others, with the degree of contingency of form-function mappings apparently playing a key role; (4) a minority of learners did not follow the same developmental patterns as the majority. The findings suggest that explicit instruction is the most effective way of helping learners with difficult aspects of L 2 pragmatics. However, the partial loss of gains in the long-term suggested that explicit instruction needs reinforcement through practice and/or further input. The degree of difference between learners' use of epistemic stance in writing and speaking demonstrated the role played by different processing conditions on learners' language production. The finding that learner readiness plays a role in the acquisition of epistemic. stance has clear implications for teaching. Instruction on epistemic stance also needs to take into account the extent to which contingency affects the learnability of epistemic forms. Finally, the degree of 'hidden' individual variation in the data does not diminish the main findings of this study but does need to be taken into consideration by both teachers and researchers.
