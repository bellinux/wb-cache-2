Physical conditions of the fluid source at 27 km were inferred to be at 100 °- 250 °C and 0. 8 GPa. The upwelling of fluid is more active near the spring in Holes <b>1200</b> <b>E</b> and <b>1200</b> A and becomes less so with increasing distance toward Hole 1200 D. These pore fluids are depleted in Cl and Br, enriched in F (except in Hole 1200 D) and B (up to 3500 µM), have low 11 B (16 - 21), and have lower than seawater Br/Cl ratios. The mixing ratios between seawater and pore fluids is calculated to be ~ 2 : 1 at shallow depth.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} discrete event simulation as a {{tool for}} analysis of stochastic systems. It argues that simulation of such systems may require computations beyond the power of single processor computers, and suggests that running the simulation on a multiple processor platform might resolve this problem.

To justify parallel simulations, an urban transportation network analysis and design is presented. It is necessary to employ a parallel computer for the following four reasons: the problem is complex, it takes a long time for the simulation executions to reach a steady state, each simulation run is too much time consuming, and there is also the issue of state dependency.

Due to the strong increase in ocular absorption in the 1. 2 to 1. 4 micrometer (i. <b>e.</b> <b>1200</b> - 1400 nm) range, evaluation of the SC generation phenomenon is necessary because any shift in laser energy within the eye to shorter wavelengths (i. e. greater frequency) could lead to unforeseen increases in hazards to the retina. The findings of this research do in fact indicate a shift in laser energy to shorter wavelengths for femtosecond pulsed lasers. In addition, an analysis involving spectral measurements through a water cuvette leads to estimations involving the eye configuration that show radiant exposures exceeding the ANSI thresholds for visible wavelengths. The implications of these findings are such that enough NIR energy is converted to visible energy near the retina when dealing with femtosecond pulsed lasers, warranting further studies in examining what the effects caused by nonlinear optical phenomena due to ultrashort pulsed lasers have on MPE thresholds established for eye safety...|$|E

A microestrutura das cerâmicas queimadas foi avaliada por microscopia eletrônica de varredura e difração de raios X. Os resultados indicaram que a incorporação de nefelina sienito melhorou significativamente as propriedades da argila possibilitando alcançar a especificação de revestimento cerâmico vitrificado. This {{work had}} for objective to development vitrified ceramic tiles body using the nepheline-syenite flux with a kaolinitic clay. Formulations were prepared with addition of 0, 30 and 50 wt. % of nepheline-syenite to the clay. Specimens were prepared by uniaxial pressure at 30 MPa followed by firing at 1100, 1150 and 1200 ºC. The evaluated physical and mechanical properties were: dry bulk density, linear shrinkage, three point bending mechanical strength and water absorption. The microstructure of the fired ceramics was evaluated by {{scanning electron microscopy}} and X-ray diffraction. The {{results showed that the}} incorporation of nepheline-syenite significantly enhanced the properties of the clay making it possible to reach the specification of vitrified ceramic tiles...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} zinc on the {{stimulation}} of osteogenesis {{has become a}} major focus in research work on bone formation. Based on this fundamental work, a base HAP body (HA 1) was reformulated by adding 10 wt% ZnO. The physical properties (i. e bulk density and porosity), phase analysis (XRD) and surface fracture analysis (SEM) were determined after sintering at five different temperatures (i. <b>e</b> 1150, <b>1200,</b> 1250, 1300 and 1350 °C). Addition of ZnO shows that the bulk density is decreased (2. 30 - 2. 70 g/cm 3) and porosity is increased (5. 0 - 27. 0 %) compared to a pure HAP (HA 1) at these five different temperatures. The XRD pattern of the HAP + ZnO (HA 1 Z) indicated that the reaction of HAP and ZnO to form CaZn 2 (P 04) 2 occured at 1250 °C...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} used a {{digitizing tablet}} to analyse the temporal, spatial, and kinematic characteristics of handwritten production of arabic numbers. They addressed a specific {{issue of the}} numerical domain: Does the lexical and syntactic structure of verbal numerals influence the production of arabic numerals (Experiments 1 and 2), even after enforced semantic processing in a comparison task (Experiment 2) ? Subjects had to write multi-digit arabic numerals (<b>e.</b> g., <b>1200)</b> presented in two different verbal structures: a multiplicative one (e. g., teen-hundred, douze cents (twelve hundred)) or an additive one (e. g., thousand-unit-hundred, mille deux cents (one thousand two hundred)). Results show differences in the inter-digit jumps that reflect {{the influence of the}} structure of verbal numerals, even after the semantic task. This finding is discussed with regard to different models of number transcoding (McCloskey, Caramazza, & Basili, 1985; Power & Dal Martello, 1990, 1997) ...|$|R
5000|$|Catholic Central High School {{opened in}} 1929, {{as a unified}} name given to all the local parish {{high schools in the}} Springfield area. These three schools merged in 1932, moving {{operations}} over to the high school located at St. Raphael's Church in downtown Springfield. However, as the site began to become too crowded, the need for a larger campus became evident, and the school eventually moved again to a new building built {{down the street from the}} St. Raphael campus. Operations would move to this site, located at <b>1200</b> <b>E.</b> High Street in the fall of 1958.|$|R
