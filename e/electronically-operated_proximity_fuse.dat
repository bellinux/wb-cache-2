50|$|One of Sprague Electric's biggest {{contributions}} {{to the war effort}} was in the manufacturing of the variable timing <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse.</b> The <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> was a small transmitter (and in some cases a receiver) built on a bomb or artillery shell that would detonate the bomb or shell before impact, causing greater destruction. Sprague Electric continued to make capacitor and resistive components to meet military requirements of quality and reliability. Robert C. Sprague was also a member of War Production Board for the Advisory Committee on Capacitors (1942-1945).|$|R

25|$|The Germans {{had felt}} {{relatively}} safe from timed artillery fire {{because they thought}} that the bad weather prevented the Allies from observing their movements accurately. When the Americans employed the POZIT <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse,</b> their artillery fire was far more devastating, decimating German troops caught in the open, causing up to 20% losses. The effectiveness of the new fused shells exploding in mid-air stirred some German soldiers to refuse orders {{to move out of}} their bunkers during an artillery attack. U.S. General George S. Patton said that the introduction of the <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> required a full revision of the tactics of land warfare.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> was {{a type of}} fuse {{attached}} to artillery shells, making them explode within the proximity of a target, rather than on impact. Testing of the <b>proximity</b> <b>fused</b> anti-aircraft shells was carried out from Kirtland Field as early as 1943. On a certain desert mesa nearby, the army suspended aircraft with [...] "the tallest wooden towers in the world" [...] to fire the shells at them.

50|$|The warhead section, just aft of the {{guidance}} section, contains the <b>proximity</b> <b>fused</b> warhead, safety-and-arming device, fuzing circuits and antennas, link antenna switching circuits, auxiliary electronics, inertial sensor assembly, and signal data converter.|$|R
50|$|The {{demands on}} {{personnel}} and funds {{at the start}} of the war were such that little more was done at that time. In less than a year, however, (in September 1940), Butement's concept was moved dramatically toward mass production when it was exported under the technology transfer arrangements of the Tizard Mission, and subsequently a variation of his circuit became adopted in the United States as the <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> or VT (variable-time) fuse, the most-manufactured electronic device of the war. In the later stages of the war, anti-aircraft shells fitted with <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses</b> played a major part in defeating both German V-1 flying bomb attacks on London, and Japanese kamikaze attacks on Allied shipping. As well as the dramatic breaking of Japanese Naval air power in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, it immortalised the invention's impact with the battle's alternate name: The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot, where the battle losses were so severe that it led to the Japanese adoption of the kamikaze. Years later, Butement said that he considered the <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> as his most significant accomplishment.|$|R
2500|$|In general, {{the system}} {{identifies}} potential targets (radar), selects a particular target (command), fires a missile (launcher) at the target, and resupplies the system (logistics). The missiles require a radar lock to initially steer the missile {{to the target}} until the missile's on-board radar system takes over to provide final course corrections. A <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> aboard the missile determines when it will detonate, creating an expanding fragmentation pattern of missile components and warhead to intercept and destroy the target. [...] A <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> improves the [...] "probability of kill" [...] given the missile and target closure rates, which can be more than [...] (or more than [...] ).|$|R
25|$|According to the Israeli military, 38 shells were fired, {{two-thirds of}} them {{equipped}} with <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses,</b> an anti-personnel mechanism that causes the weapon to explode above the ground. The firing on the UN compound lasted 17 minutes.|$|R

2500|$|The warhead {{used was}} a {{standard}} [...] general-purpose aerial bomb. A <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> {{would cause the}} warhead to detonate within lethal distance of the target; the heavy warhead was expected to ensure {{the destruction of the}} attacking aircraft.|$|R

50|$|In 1988 tests {{started on}} an {{improved}} warhead using a <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse,</b> {{in order to}} give Rapier capability against smaller targets that would be difficult to hit directly, notably high-speed remotely piloted vehicles. Serial production of Mk. 1E began in 1989.|$|R

50|$|Van Allen {{joined the}} Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) of Johns Hopkins University in Silver Spring, Maryland, at its founding, to {{continue}} his work on <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses.</b> He worked on improving the ruggedness of vacuum tubes subject to the forces from a gun battery.|$|R
50|$|Both testimonies {{state that}} part of the {{problems}} stem from its original design as an anti-aircraft system. Patriot was designed with <b>proximity</b> <b>fused</b> warheads, which are designed to explode immediately prior to hitting a target spraying shrapnel out in a fan in front of the missile, either destroying or disabling the target. These missiles were fired at the target's center of mass. With aircraft this was fine, but considering the much higher speeds of TBMs, as well as the location of the warhead (usually in the nose), Patriot would most often hit closer to the tail of the Scud due to the delay present in the <b>proximity</b> <b>fused</b> warhead, thus not destroying the TBM's warhead and allowing it to fall to earth.|$|R
50|$|The main improvement, {{which was}} also made on {{the latest version of}} the AIM-9 Sidewinder, is a new 128×128 {{resolution}} imaging infrared focal plane array (FPA) seeker manufactured by Hughes before they were acquired by Raytheon. This seeker has a long acquisition range, high countermeasures resistance, approximately 90 degrees off-boresight lock-on capability, and the possibility to designate specific parts of the targeted aircraft (like cockpit, engines, etc.). The ASRAAM also has a LOAL (Lock-On After Launch) ability which is a distinct advantage when the missile is carried in an internal bay such as in the F-35 Lightning II. The ASRAAM warhead is triggered either by laser <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> or impact. A laser <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> was selected because RF fuses are vulnerable to EW intervention from enemy jammers.|$|R
50|$|The main {{problems}} were {{a lack of}} range, and the decision to omit a <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse,</b> an attribute which required the operator to strike the target aircraft directly with the missile. Rapier also suffered from problems with the IFF system and suffered interference with RN radar.|$|R
50|$|After {{the turret}} {{there are two}} CIWS DARDO, with two 40 mm/L70 Bofors guns. They have very rapid {{mechanical}} systems, and depots with over 700 shells, and can fire around 600 rounds per minute. The <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses</b> and the fire control systems help this unmanned turret to react quickly to incoming missiles.|$|R

500|$|Instead of {{returning}} to the Cavendish, the team moved to Exeter, where Dee and three others worked on developing rockets as anti-aircraft weapons, while Strothers and Curran joined a group under John Coles working {{on the development of}} the <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse.</b> Strothers was based at Leeson House and Durnford School. She and Curran developed a workable fuse, which was codenamed VT, an acronym of [...] "Variable Time fuze". The system was a small, short-range, Doppler radar that used a clever circuit. However, Britain lacked the capacity to mass-produce the fuze, so the design was shown to the United States by the Tizard Mission in late 1940. The Americans perfected and mass-produced the fuse. In due course, these <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses</b> arrived in the United Kingdom, where they played an important part in the defence of the kingdom against the V-1 flying bomb.|$|R
