In Australia, consumer demand for foods produced to environmentally sustainable standards is minimal because consumers don't believe these products offer special benefits.

50|$|In {{promoting}} his mail-order business, {{he realized the}} tremendous power that radio had for selling his product. Specifically, he found incredible success giving radio interviews in exchange for advertising by way of commercials and promotional giveaways. As {{a result of this}} success, he developed a direct-response format for radio advertising. Before long, businesses in the infomercial industry began to take notice of Catona’s methods and asked for his help getting their message to a larger audience. As more businesses asked for his help, Catona, in 1993, decided to start “Radio Direct Response”, the first advertising agency focusing solely on <b>direct</b> <b>response</b> radio <b>marketing.</b> As the success of “Radio Direct Response” grew, he was approached by entrepreneur Jay Walker with an idea for a new website where consumers could name their own price for airline tickets. Tapping William Shatner as a celebrity spokesperson, Catona developed a campaign for this new website, now called Priceline.com. Within just the first 18 months of its inception, Priceline.com went on to generate 1 billion dollars using direct-response radio alone. Some of Catona’s other achievements have included launching FreeCreditReport.com and many other multimillion-dollar companies.|$|R

Any connection between poverty, education and terrorism is indirect, complicated and probably quite weak. Instead of viewing terrorism as a <b>direct</b> <b>response</b> to low <b>market</b> opportunities or ignorance, we suggest it is more accurately viewed {{as a response to}} political conditions and long-standing feelings of indignity and frustration that {{have little to do with}} economics.

40|$|In {{the scheme}} of things, the 1996 Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act (FAIR) {{contained}} important breaks with a tradition of crop-by-crop subsidies {{dating back to the}} Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933. It freed many producers of "program commodities" (maize, grain sorghum, wheat, barley, oats, cotton and rice) from a system of crop-specific base acre accounting, merged these accounts into a single "whole farm base," and allowed production of any but a few crops on these lands. Overall, the freedom to produce in <b>direct</b> <b>response</b> to <b>market</b> forces, rather than on the basis of crop-by-crop subsidies, as well as the budget discipline of predetermined payments, were important steps in the direction of decoupled lump-sum compensation. Yet {{from the point of view}} of advocates of policy reform, FAIR represents an unfinished agenda. A variety of problems and issues remain. First, the coverage of "freedom to farm" is only partial, with numerous commodities left out of the decoupling program. Second, those critical of the distributive impacts of the commodity programs find little to cheer about in the new contracts, and consider the acronym FAIR ironic. Supply responses induced by price levels in the first two years of FAIR have led to substantially lower prices and marketing receipts in 1998. A call has now gone up to resuscitate some form of safety net, such as a return to deficiency payments or an extension and increase in contract payments under the 1996 Act. It is appropriate to move now to finish the unfinished agenda of the 1996 Act by implementing a long term safety net based on some form of revenue assurance (á la Cochrane and Runge, 1992).

40|$|Calibration {{refers to}} the {{adjustment}} of the posterior probabilities output by a classification algorithm towards the true prior probability distribution of the target classes. This adjustment is necessary {{to account for the}} difference in prior distributions between the training set and the test set. This article proposes a new calibration method, called the probability-mapping approach. Two types of mapping are proposed: linear and non-linear probability mapping. These new calibration techniques are applied to 9 real-life direct marketing datasets. The newly-proposed techniques are compared with the original, non-calibrated posterior probabilities and the adjusted posterior probabilities obtained using the rescaling algorithm of Saerens et al. (2002). The results recommend that marketing researchers must calibrate the posterior probabilities obtained from the classifier. Moreover, it is shown that using a 'simple' rescaling algorithm is not a first and workable solution, because the results suggest applying the newly-proposed non-linear probability-mapping approach for best calibration performance.

40|$|Identifying {{customers}} {{who are likely}} to respond to a product offering is an important issue in <b>direct</b> <b>marketing.</b> <b>Response</b> models are typically built from historical purchase data. A popular method of choice, logistic regression, is easy to understand and build, but limited in that the model is linear in parameters. Neural networks are nonlinear and have been found to improve predictive accu-racies for a variety of business applications. Neural networks have not always demonstrated clear supremacy over traditional statistics competitors, largely because of over-fitting and instability. Combining multiple networks may allevi-ate these problems. A systematic method of combining neural networks is pro-posed, namely bagging or bootstrap aggregating, whereby overfitted multiple neural networks are trained with bootstrap replicas of the original data set and then averaged. We built response models using a publicly available DMEF data set with three methods: bagging neural networks, single neural networks, and conventional logistic regression. The proposed method not only improved but also stabilized the prediction accuracies over the other two...|$|R

5000|$|Sharing card {{transaction}} {{data can be}} beneficial to consumers as it allows for card companies and merchants to provide better products and services tailored to them directly. This increases consumer's spending habits, but for a favourable product or service for the consumer. Allowing for marketers to understand consumers better can increase the chances of consumer's getting more products and searches that they want tailored {{in a way that}} they desire. This also ensures that less mass marketing is done and instead only specific groups that are interested in the information will be targeted. It is also beneficial to companies as this type of information analysis is useful to identify promising areas of growth, enhance <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>response</b> rates and improve retention of existing customers. Offering the opportunity for a competitive advantage within other companies in this high technologically advanced era, this information is crucial in today's business world.

This encourages the idea of promotional services to be offered to select groups who will take the most advantage from the opportunity.|$|R
