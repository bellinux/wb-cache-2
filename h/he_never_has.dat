500|$|The artwork of Gunnerkrigg Court {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "stylized," [...] with simple character designs."What he did was make an intentional choice to make his characters very cartoony." [...] At least one reviewer, on the other hand, has noticed that the backgrounds, in contrast to the characters, are often very elaborate."His characters are really simple, and some of his backgrounds are really complicated." [...] The comic has also been described as having a [...] "rich" [...] look in spite of its limited color palette,"I love his use of color, too, in particular, because <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> more than like ten colors on the average page, but it looks really really rich." [...] and Siddell himself has stated that he first developed the idea for the comic using {{only a limited number of}} colors.Siddell: [...] "I did another sketch right after that of the same girl and, wanting to color it but only having a very limited selection of marker pens, put her in an ugly school uniform with some crazy makeup." [...] The pieces of artwork that Siddell has posted at the end of each printed book, entitled [...] "Treatise" [...] and [...] "Second Treatise," [...] demonstrate many such of Siddell's artistic and storytelling motifs: they integrate alchemical symbols, mythological figures, nature, and technology.|$|E

Lincoln's reassurance earned him Singleton's support in the 1864 election.|$|E
2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{gave the}} episode {{a score of}} 8 out of 10; she praised its humor and use of Rumpelstiltskin, {{explaining}} that the writers [...] "keep his true motivations hidden and separating Rumple from the group gives {{him the opportunity to}} shine. Robert Carlyle owned the character in a way <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> before. His flourishes and 'dearies' didn't seem out of place and he even played with them a bit." [...] Ratcliffe also positively received Peter Pan's introduction, saying [...] "I appreciate how they've flipped Peter Pan from a lighthearted boy to a master manipulator with questionable intentions. This show is at its brightest when it thinks out of the storybook in that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist Michael Einziger {{noted that}} his {{contributions}} to the album were influenced by his musical studies during the band's hiatus: [...] "Maybe my desire to return to simplicity, or even to just go to simplicity - because I've never really written music that simple before — {{is sort of a}} response to maybe having a better or larger perspective of the overall musical landscape that I’ve never had before." [...] Einziger elaborated further, [...] "Over the years, we've become less and less aggressive as far as our music goes. There's always moments of that aggression, but this album is pretty free of that. It's definitely not a hard rock record. I think we're asking a lot of our fans. We're asking them to listen for things that they normally wouldn't listen for. We're not leaning on the strengths of our last records either. It's that much different than our previous work. I think we took a risk by making this type of album. But it's not some crazy, experimental album." [...] Vocalist Brandon Boyd cited Einziger as a key reason for the band's new direction, noting [...] "Michael really buckled down and studied musical composition that inspired him to reach out and dig into different places that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} 1965 election, he very briefly served as {{parliamentary}} secretary (junior minister) to Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1965, {{but the two}} fell out when Chrétien advised him against seeking an election in 1965, predicating (correctly) that Pearson would not win the majority he was seeking. When Pearson recruited his [...] "Three Wise Men" [...] consisting of Jean Marchand, Gérard Pelletier and Pierre Trudeau into the cabinet, Chrétien was offended at {{the way he was}} by-passed, telling Pearson he deserved to be promoted to the cabinet. Starting in 1966 served for a more substantial period of time as the parliamentary secretary to Minister of Finance, Mitchell Sharp. Sharp was to serve as Chrétien's mentor and patron, and it was largely through Sharp's influence that Chrétien rose up the ranks. Like his mentor Sharp, Chrétien was identified with {{the right wing of the}} Liberal Party in the 1960s, and it was not until the 1970s that Chrétien first started to become identified with the left-wing of the Liberals. Sharp was quoted as saying about his protégé in an interview with Peter C. Newman: Jean is not accustomed to reading as much as I am or you are, and therefore we tend to judge him on that sort of basis. We read all sorts of things; Chrétien doesn't. Chrétien's reading is limited. He has an instinctive approach, and faced with a problem, he's always comes out with sensible answers, and that's why I say <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> to eat his words. In 1967, Chrétien visited western Canada for the first time, which he was curious to see. In Vancouver he declared in a speech about the demands for more powers for Quebec being made by Union Nationale Premier Daniel Johnson that [...] "whose who are in favor of a special status [...] are often separatists who don't want to admit they are separatists", which caused an uproar in la belle province with Johnson saying he just wanted more powers for Quebec, not independence. When the French President Charles de Gaulle in a speech during his visit to Montreal said [...] "vive le Québec libre!" [...] ("Long Live A Free Quebec!") and compared English-Canadians to the Nazis, Chrétien in a cabinet meeting demanded that Pearson have de Gaulle formally declared persona non grata and expelled, instead of politely asking him to leave Canada, which was the course that Pearson followed.|$|E
