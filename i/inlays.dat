5|$|In {{addition}} to Bushka rings, various other decorative rings were commonly incorporated, including various colored plastics (often marbleized), and silver and contrasting wooden rings. For decoration, Balabushka often inlaid small mother-of-pearl dots and notched diamonds. Series of window-shaped maple pieces commonly adorned Balabushka butt sleeves, with each window usually featuring one burl for its aesthetic effect. Some other features common {{to many other}} cuemakers' lines from the same era are notably absent or mostly absent from Balabushka's, including ivory <b>inlays</b> and the signing of his cues. A long-standing controversy exists over what finish Balabushka used. One side argues that he used an oil finish on all his cues, while the other insists that his later cues were coated with a spray lacquer.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its history, Tell Brak was an {{important}} trade center; it was an enterpot of obsidian trade during the Chalcolithic, as it was situated on the river crossing between Anatolia, the Levant and southern Mesopotamia. The countryside was occupied by smaller towns, villages and hamlets, but the city's surroundings were empty within three kilometers. This was {{probably due to the}} intensive cultivation in the immediate hinterland, in order to sustain the population. The city manufactured different objects, including chalices made of obsidian and white marble, faience, flint tools and shell <b>inlays.</b> However, evidence exists for a slight shift in production of goods toward manufacturing objects desired in the south, following the establishment of the Uruk colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper deck}} housed {{facilities}} for officers and first- and second-class passengers. A long forecastle contained the accommodations {{for the crew}} and petty officers, {{as well as a}} hospital and the third-class lavatories. First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close {{to the middle of the}} ship. To their rear, between the funnels, was the first-class passenger dining room, spanning the width of the ship. With seating for 208, it featured mahogany furniture and satinwood paneling with <b>inlays,</b> and a glass skylight ceiling that extended up through two decks. Beyond this area were the galleys, sculleries, and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger dining room, which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned the width of the ship and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond the dining area were cabins for 76 second-class passengers.|$|E

5|$|While local {{sources of}} gold are attested during the Aksumite era, silver {{seems to have}} been rarer in Aksum. No mention of silver mines in the region exist until the 15th and 16th centuries. Though silver was {{imported}} as attested by the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, given the preponderance of silver coins, it could not have been the only source of silver in Aksum. Furthermore, a significant number of the silver coins contain gold <b>inlays</b> (presumably to increase the value), which would have been unnecessary if silver were so rare {{that it had to be}} mainly imported. Silver may have been obtained from the refinement of gold, which sometimes occurs naturally with silver in an alloy called electrum. Copper and bronze do not seem to have existed locally in the Aksumite empire, though they were noted as imports in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Helmle, Corbett & Harrison {{teamed with}} another {{architectural}} firm, Sugarman & Berger. Henry Sugarman, {{of the latter}} organization, advised in the building's design and supervised interior construction work. The cornerstone was laid on March 24, 1929. It has an all-black irregular shape stepped like the building. On it are inscribed the year 1929 and a symbol designed by Roerich consisting of a circle enclosing three dots together with a monogram. The monogram, showing the letter R within the letter M, stands for the Roerich Museum. The circle and the three dots are the symbol of Roerich's Banner of Peace. He once said the circle represents eternity and unity and the dots the triune nature of existence. On another occasion he said the symbol has two meanings: in one interpretation, the circle represents the totality of culture and the dots are art, science, and religion (or philosophy), while in the other, the circle symbolizes the endlessness {{of time and the}} dots are the past, the present, and the future. The cornerstone contains a 400-year-old casket from the Rajput dynasty of northern India. Made of iron with <b>inlays</b> of gold and silver, the casket contains photographs taken during the Roeriches' expedition to Central Asia. It is also said to contain Jacob's Pillow or the Stone of Scone. Prominent politicians participated in the cornerstone-laying ceremony and among messages read from prominent Americans was a letter from Albert Einstein in which he praised the cultural goals of the building's directors.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: A {{comparison}} study between ceramic {{full coverage}} FPDs & 3 designs of ceramic <b>inlay</b> retained FPDs regarding vertical marginal gap & retention. Materials & Methods: Twenty samples were construc- ted and divided into 4 groups {{according to the}} type of restorations: full coverage, inlay-shaped (occluso-pro- ximal <b>inlay</b> + proximal box), tub-shaped (occluso-pro- ximal <b>inlay),</b> and proximal box-shaped FPDs. All samples were subjected to a vertical marginal gap measurements followed by a retention test. Results: The vertical marginal gap data showed no significant difference between full coverage FPDs, the tub-shap- ed <b>inlay</b> retained FPDs and the proximal box-shaped <b>inlay</b> retained FPDs. While there was a difference between these three designs and the <b>inlay</b> retained FPDs. Regarding retention, the full coverage FPDs recorded higher retentive strengths and was signifi-cant difference than all <b>inlay</b> retained FPDs designs tested. The inlay-shaped design was significant dif-ference than the other two <b>inlay</b> retained FPDs de-signs. Conclusions: There was no significant differ- ence between full coverage FPDs, tub-shaped & pro- ximal box shaped <b>inlay</b> retained FPDs as regard ver- tical marginal discrepancies. While, the inlay-haped design showed the highest vertical marginal discrep- ancies. The premolar & molar retainers for the same type of restorations showed no difference in vertical marginal discrepancies. All measured vertical mar- ginal discrepancies were in the range of clinical ac- ceptance. The full coverage FPDs recorded higher retentive strengths than all <b>inlay</b> retained FPDs de- signs tested. The inlay-shaped design recorded the highest retentive strengths among the three <b>inlay</b> re- tained FPDs designs. There was no difference as re- gard retentive strengths between tub-shaped & pro- ximal box shaped <b>inlay</b> retained FPDs...|$|R

50|$|<b>Inlay</b> on guitars {{or similar}} fretted {{instruments}} are decorative materials {{set into the}} wooden surface of the instrument using standard <b>inlay</b> techniques. Although <b>inlay</b> can be done on any part of a guitar, it is most commonly found on the fretboard, headstock —typically the manufacturer's logo— and around the sound hole of acoustic guitars. Only the positional markers on the fretboard or side of neck and the rosette around the sound hole serve any function other than decoration (the rosette serves as reinforcement). Nacre ("mother of pearl"), plastic and wood are the materials most often used as <b>inlay.</b>|$|R

40|$|The tin <b>inlay</b> of a {{piece of}} {{furniture}} designed by Hendrik Van Soest has been investigated for its composition, microstructure and corrosion. Small samples were removed and investigated with optical microscopy, micro X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray detection and synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction. The results show that the <b>inlay</b> is composed of a binary alloy consisting of tin and mercury. The composition suggests the use of an amalgam to produce the metal <b>inlay.</b> However, the microstructure of the <b>inlayed</b> fillets proves that tin sheet was used instead of a tin mercury amalgam. Corrosion of the tin <b>inlay</b> is the most important sign of deterioration. Analyses show the presence of a thin layer of tin oxide chloride hydroxide in direct contact with the metal. This layer is covered by a layer of the more common tin corrosion compounds romarchite and cassiterite. The harmful effect of chloride containing compound is shown by the advanced corrosion. For future preservation of the tin <b>inlay</b> this compound must be either removed or be immobilized...|$|R

40|$|Background: Traditionally, <b>inlay</b> casting waxes {{have been}} used to {{fabricate}} patterns for castings. Newer resin pattern materials offer greater rigidity and strength, allowing easier laboratory and intraoral adjustment without the fear of pattern damage. They also claim to possess a greater dimensional stability when compared to <b>inlay</b> wax. Aims: This study attempted to determine and compare the marginal accuracy of patterns fabricated from an <b>inlay</b> casting wax, an autopolymerized pattern resin and a light polymerized pattern resin on storage off the die for varying time intervals. Materials and Methods: Ten patterns each were fabricated from an <b>inlay</b> casting wax (GC Corp., Tokyo, Japan), an autopolymerized resin pattern material (Pattern resin, GC Corp, Tokyo, Japan) and a light-cured resin pattern material (Palavit GLC, Hereaus Kulzer GmbH, Germany). The completed patterns were stored off the die at room temperature. Marginal gaps were evaluated by reseating the patterns on their respective dies and observing it under a stereomicroscope at 1, 12, and 24 h intervals after pattern fabrication. Results: The results revealed that the <b>inlay</b> wax showed a significantly greater marginal discrepancy at the 12 and 24 h intervals. The autopolymerized resin showed an initial (at 1 h) marginal discrepancy slightly greater than <b>inlay</b> wax, but showed a significantly less marginal gap (as compared to <b>inlay</b> wax) at the other two time intervals. The light-cured resin proved to be significantly more dimensionally stable, and showed minimal change during the storage period. Conclusion: The resin pattern materials studied, undergo a significantly less dimensional change than the <b>inlay</b> waxes on prolonged storage. They would possibly be a better alternative to <b>inlay</b> wax in situations requiring high precision or when delayed investment (more than 1 h) of patterns can be expected...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{define the}} <b>inlay</b> shading {{effect on the}} {{polymerization}} levels and kinetics of a light activated bonding system for an indirect restoration technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the bonding system, an adhesive: Excite (Ivoclar-vivadent) and a composite: Z 250 (3 M-ESPE, St Paul Minnesota, USA) were investigated. A Demetron (Kerr USA) light curing unit was used. The composite <b>inlay</b> blocks of 2 mm thick {{were used for the}} experiment (Artglass A 2 Heraeus, Kulzer, Dormagen, Germany). The bonding composite was photocured using a 2 mm composite <b>inlay</b> block as a shielding system while the adhesive was shielded by a 2. 3 mm thick wafer, composed of the <b>inlay</b> material and the previously cured bonding composite. The kinetics and levels of polymerization were measured by a differential scanning calorimeter technique (DSC 25, Mettler, Orange, CA, Toledoh, küsnacht, switzerland). RESULTS: The <b>inlay</b> shielded dental composite reaches a significantly lower level of polymerization compared to the unshielded composite. <b>Inlay</b> shielded composite, has a slower polymerization kinetic compared to unshielded composite. The resin adhesive shielded by the inlay-composite wafer reaches polymerization values not significantly {{different from those of the}} unshielded adhesive. SIGNIFICANCES: The degree of cure of the light-cured composite resins for use as a base for indirect composite restorations, may be severely reduced as a result of <b>inlay</b> shielding...|$|R
