5|$|Dunder Mifflin's {{tech support}} employee, Sadiq (Omi Vaidya), {{arrives at the}} Scranton branch {{to set up a}} system that allows Michael Scott (Steve Carell) to monitor his employees' emails. When {{everyone}} in the office finds out, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) worries that Michael will discover the party he is throwing that night, to which Michael is not invited. Inevitably, Michael notices and tries to get Jim to admit that he's having a party, while Jim acts nonchalantly as <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> is happening. In order to keep Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) from exposing the party, Jim tells him that it is a surprise party for Michael.|$|E
5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.|$|E
5|$|The meticulously {{designed}} buildings composing {{the larger}} Chacoan complexes did not emerge until around AD 1030. The Chacoans melded pre-planned architectural designs, astronomical alignments, geometry, landscaping, and engineering into ancient urban centers of unique public architecture. Researchers {{have concluded that}} the complex may have had a relatively small residential population, with larger groups assembling only temporarily for annual ceremonies. Smaller sites, apparently more residential in character, are scattered near the great houses in and around Chaco. The canyon itself runs along one of the lunar alignment lines, suggesting the location was originally chosen for its astronomical significance. <b>If</b> <b>nothing</b> else, this allowed alignment with several other key structures in the canyon.|$|E

5|$|Shankly {{tried to}} keep busy in {{retirement}} and {{stay in touch with}} football. He worked for Radio City 96.7, a Liverpool station on which he presented his own chat show, once interviewing prime minister Harold Wilson, and was a pundit on its football coverage. He briefly took up advisory roles at Wrexham and then at Tranmere Rovers, helping former Liverpool captain Ron Yeats at the latter. In November 1976, the press speculated that Shankly would make a return to management as the successor to Dave Mackay at Derby County, but the position went to Colin Murphy instead. John Toshack recalled that Shankly was a great help to him when he went into management with Swansea City in 1978. Despite being in his sixties, Shankly kept himself fit and often took part in five-a-side football. <b>If</b> <b>nothing</b> else was available he would join teams of youngsters in kickabouts.|$|E
5|$|There {{appear to}} be no extant records of the {{meetings}} which elected Arsenal to the First Division in 1919, however the book Making the Arsenal proposes a different reason for their election in that year. The site argues that the match fixing issues of {{the final year of}} football before the war (1914–15) were used by Norris as a weapon in his battle to get Arsenal promoted. He demanded that Liverpool and Manchester United (some of who's players had been found guilty of match fixing) be punished by relegation or expulsion, and threatened to organise a breakaway from the league by Midlands and southern clubs <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> was done. To placate him the League offered Arsenal a place in the First Division.|$|E
5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} {{complains}} about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) building standards, such as un-plying toilet paper, adding motion sensors to the lights, and placing a roach billboard over the windows to the office. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> is done. She leaves and comes back with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E

The forward with the ball can pass to the cutting guard or to the corner guard coming off the wing's screen. <b>If</b> <b>nothing's</b> available, he can shoot the basketball himself.|$|R

25|$|Trying to {{maintain}} control and civil order (a Mandate requirement <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> else), the British enacted the Defence Emergency Regulations in September 1945. These regulations suspended Habeas Corpus and established military courts. They prescribed {{the death penalty for}} various offences, including carrying weapons or ammunition illegally and membership in an organization whose members commit these offenses. As World War II ended, a Jewish insurgency began, with the Zionist groups Irgun and Lehi attacking British targets in order to compel the British to leave Palestine. The insurgency was a response to Britain's implementation of the White Paper of 1939, which greatly restricted Jewish immigration and land purchases.|$|E

On May 20, 1968 the Illinois Central truncated it to Springfield, Illinois and renamed it the Governor's Special, a name which <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> else suited the new terminus. The Green Diamond had operated just over 32 years. Amtrak did not continue the Governor's Special and it ended on April 30, 1971.

25|$|The World Health Organization {{stated that}} a 2013 thyroid {{ultrasound}} screening program was, {{due to the}} screening effect, {{likely to lead to}} an increase in recorded thyroid cases due to early detection of non-symptomatic disease cases. The overwhelming majority of thyroid growths are benign growths that will never cause symptoms, illness, or death, even <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> is ever done about the growth. Autopsy studies on people who died from other causes show that more than one third of adults technically have a thyroid growth/cancer. As a precedent, in 1999 in South Korea, the introduction of advanced ultrasound thyroid examinations resulted in an explosion in the rate of benign thyroid cancers being detected and needless surgeries occurring. Despite this, the death rate from thyroid cancer has remained the same.|$|E
