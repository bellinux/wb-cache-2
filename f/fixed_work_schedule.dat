To encourage and incentivise it, transport practitioners and researchers must understand its private motivations and deterrents. Existing studies often report conflicting results or non-generalisable findings. Thus, a quantitative systematic review of the literature body is needed. Using meta-analysis, this study synthesised 22 existing empirical studies (representing over 79, 000 observations) to produce an integrated review of the carpooling literature. The meta-analysis determined 24 non-household carpooling factors, and their effect sizes. Factors such as number of employees (r̅ = 0. 42), partner matching programs (r̅ = 0. 42), female (r̅ = 0. 22) and <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> (r̅ = 0. 15) were found to have strong effects on carpooling while judgmental factors (such as the motivation to save costs) only exhibited small influence (r̅ < 0. 1). Based on the significant effects, the paper discussed prospects for improving carpooling uptake by developing: (i) target demographics, (ii) selling points for marketing, (iii) carpooling partner programs and (iv) multiple employer ‘super-pools’. The results warrant caution due to the small amount of studies synthesised.

40|$|Buildings {{are known}} to be the largest {{consumers}} of electricity in the United States, and often times the dominant energy consumer is the HVAC system. Despite this fact, in most buildings the HVAC system is run using primitive static control algorithms based on <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> causing wasted energy during periods of low occupancy. In this paper we present a novel control architecture that uses occupancy sensing to guide the operation of a building HVAC system. We show how we can enable aggressive duty-cycling of building HVAC systems – that is, turn them ON or OFF – to save energy while meeting building performance requirements using inexpensive sensing and control methods. We have deployed our occupancy sensor network across an entire floor of a university building and our data shows several periods of low occupancy with significant opportunities to save energy over normal HVAC schedules. Furthermore, by interfacing with the building Energy Management System (EMS) directly and using real-time occupancy data collected by our occupancy nodes, we measure electrical energy savings of 9. 54 % to 15. 73 % and thermal energy savings of 7. 59 % to 12. 85 % for the HVAC system by controlling just one floor of our four floor building...|$|R

Subjects and Methods: A total of 123 professional drivers, 32 indifferent preference drivers and 91 morning preference drivers of an intermunicipality and interstate bus transportation company were evaluated. All drivers underwent polysomnographic recordings after their shifts. Furthermore, they filled out a questionnaire that contained sociodemographic and health questions. the Home and Ostberg questionnaire was used to assess the subjects' morningness-eveningness preference. Results: the mean age was 42. 54 +/- 6. 98 years and 82 (66. 66 %) of the drivers had worked for = 15 years. A significant effect on rapid eye movement (REM) was observed in the morning preference drivers. They showed an increased sleep latency and an REM sleep percentage of 5 % of the total REM time. This reveals a significant effect on sleep architecture associated with work time. Conclusion: the drivers reported that morning preference had a significant effect on their sleep pattern indicating less REM sleep and longer REM sleep latency in the morning preference group. Thus, it is important to evaluate interactions between individual aspects of health and other parameters, such as sleep quality and work organizational factors, to promote night shift workers' health and well-being.

40|$|Amongst {{the varied}} <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> {{shiftwork}} {{is the one}} which enables organizations to extend operating hours. Shiftwork, particularly shift systems involving night <b>work</b> in a <b>fixed</b> or alternate <b>work</b> <b>schedule,</b> is associated with several disorders which, in a generic way, can be classified in three interconnected domains: i) health (e. g. circadian and sleep disturbance), ii) family and social life (e. g. conflict between parental and/or conjugal roles); iii) occupational/organizational (e. g. disturbance in performance and safety). The present study examines the possible differences between three work shifts – morning, afternoon and night – in dimensions related to health, social and family life, social support and evaluation of one's <b>work</b> <b>schedule,</b> in a particular sector of activity (textile industry). 903 workers from five textile companies participated in this study. 66 % were male workers and they were predominant in the night shift. The mean age was 39. 7 (SD= 10. 62) and the mean time working in the shift was 14. 15 years (SD= 11. 84). Besides the gender distribution, {{no differences were found}} among the three shifts. These shifts were compared according to the following variables: health (digestive and sleep problems), evaluation of shift schedule (satisfaction and intention to leave), social support (supervisor, co-workers and family) and satisfaction in the interface between the shift schedule and family or social activities. Data were collected by means of published questionnaires (e. g. Standard Shiftwork Index) and especially designed ones. When compared with the morning and the afternoon shifts, the night shift was significantly associated with higher sleep disturbance and less satisfaction with shift schedule. In its turn, the morning shift was significantly associated with less intention to leave it and with a greater satisfaction with the interface between the shift schedule and extra-organizational life. Finally, the morning shift was significantly associated to a higher perception of family support in managing the <b>work</b> <b>schedule,</b> when compared with the night shift. Results show that the night shift is the most negatively evaluated <b>work</b> <b>schedule.</b> Moreover, the payment of a shift bonus to night shift workers represents in some way that the legislator recognizes the hardship of working this shift. The bonus in that sector of activity consists of 40 % of the monthly salary. In spite of this compensation (frequently the only form of compensation offered), workers evaluated more negatively their shift schedule as they also presented greater sleep problems. Results also suggest that the night work, even if it is a fixed one (and therefore more regular from a social point of view) and it involves experienced shiftworkers, would hardly be positively evaluated when compared with other <b>work</b> <b>schedules.</b> In spite of this conclusion, the implementation of other intervention strategies (e. g. educational programmes, longer holidays) may {{have an impact on the}} <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the association between parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> that fall outside the span of 6 a. m. and 6 p. m. and children 2 ̆ 7 s academic outcomes, {{using data from the}} National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and its Child Supplement on 5, 089 children who were followed from birth to age 13 or 14. With a concern about the potential adverse impact of parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on children, previous research tended to paint a negative image of the toll related to parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedule.</b> However, this study, based on fixed-effect regression models, found that the impact of parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic achievement may differ by parents who undertake nonstandard schedules, children 2 ̆ 7 s developmental stages, types of nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> and family structure. For early childhood children (age 3 or 4) in two-parent families, maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly varying hours, were associated with better academic outcomes, while paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly rotating shift and varying hours, were associated with lower academic outcomes. However, the positive impact of maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> disappeared for early childhood children in single-parent families. For middle childhood children (age 5 - 10), maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> were found to have no impact on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic achievement both in two-parent and single-parent families, whereas paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly evening shift, had a negative effect in two-parent families. For early adolescents (age 11 - 14), both maternal and paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> had no impact. These findings suggest that the impact of parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic outcomes are not uniformly negative or positive, implying that parental nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> have a dual potential to become a family-unfriendly schedule and {{to be used as a}} family-friendly work option.
