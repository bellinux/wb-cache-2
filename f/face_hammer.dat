50|$|A {{parallel}} storyline involves Shy (Orlando Bloom), a Cayman native. He is in {{love with}} Andrea (Zoë Saldaña), the daughter of his boss, Mr. Sterling, a very influential person in the island. But for an unknown reason, Andrea's brother Hammer (Anthony Mackie) despises Shy. To protect their secret affair, whenever Shy would visit Andrea at home his good friend Kimo would watch the house in case Andrea's father were to arrive. On Andrea's birthday Shy visits her house and has sex with her, but Kimo falls asleep and fails to warn Shy of Sterling's arrival. Shy escapes out the window, but not without being identified by Hammer. Later on, to avenge his sister's lost womanhood, Hammer attacks Shy with acid which leaves a permanent scar on Shy's <b>face.</b> <b>Hammer</b> is sent to jail for four months.|$|E

40|$|We {{explored}} {{variation in}} patterns of percussive stone-tool use on coastal foods by Burmese long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis aurea) from two islands in Laem Son National Park, Ranong, Thailand. We catalogued variation into three hammering classes and 17 ac-tion patterns, after examining 638 tool-use bouts across 90 individuals. Hammering class {{was based on the}} stone surface used for striking food, being face, point, and edge hammer-ing. Action patterns were discriminated by tool material, hand use, posture, and striking mo-tion. Hammering class was analyzed for associations with material and behavioural elements of tool use. Action patterns were not, owing to insufficient instances of most pat-terns. We collected 3077 scan samples from 109 macaques on Piak Nam Yai Island’s coasts, to determine the proportion of individuals using each hammering class and action pattern. Point hammering was significantly more associated with sessile foods, smaller tools, faster striking rates, smoother recoil, unimanual use, and more varied striking direc-tion, than were <b>face</b> and edge <b>hammering,</b> while both point and edge hammering were sig-nificantly more associated with precision gripping than <b>face</b> <b>hammering.</b> Edge hammerin...|$|R

50|$|Another {{method for}} drawing {{is to use}} a tool called a fuller, or the peen of the hammer, to hasten the drawing out of a thick piece of metal. (The {{technique}} is called fullering from the tool.) Fullering consists of hammering a series of indentations with corresponding ridges, perpendicular to the long section of the piece being drawn. The resulting effect looks somewhat like waves {{along the top of the}} piece. Then the smith turns the hammer over to use the flat <b>face</b> to <b>hammer</b> the tops of the ridges down level with the bottoms of the indentations. This forces the metal to grow in length (and width if left unchecked) much faster than just hammering with the flat <b>face</b> of the <b>hammer.</b>|$|R

50|$|Though {{the process}} of peening (surface {{hardening}} by impact) has become rarer in metal fabrication, the ball-peen hammer remains useful for many tasks, such as striking punches and chisels (usually performed with the flat <b>face</b> of the <b>hammer).</b> The peening <b>face</b> is useful for rounding off edges of metal pins and fasteners, such as rivets. The ball <b>face</b> of the <b>hammer</b> {{can also be used}} to make gaskets for mating surfaces. A suitable gasket material is held over the surface where a corresponding gasket is desired, and the operator will lightly tap around the edges of the mating surface to perforate the gasket material.|$|R

50|$|The game {{features}} digital voice samples. At {{the start}} of the game, up to three players control Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard. Players must help the Three Stooges find their fiancees, Cora, Nora and Dora, who were kidnapped by the Mad Scientist. In all rooms, players must find the three hidden keys that unlock the exit. Interfering socialites and cops are dealt within typical Stooges-style: <b>face</b> slaps, <b>hammer</b> hits, and the ever-dependable cream pie throws. In the bonus rounds, players must avoid the sour notes of the opera singer, as well as cops, while collecting the three keys to the exit. In the Mad Scientist's laboratory, the players will be able to save only one fiancee, before players must find the other two fiancees. After all fiancees are saved, the game starts over.|$|R
50|$|The fuller is used {{mainly to}} spread the metal. The fuller is placed against the metal stock, and then either the fuller (for an upper fuller) or the stock (for a lower fuller) is struck with a hammer. The rounded nose of the fuller spreads the metal more {{efficiently}} than the flat <b>face</b> of the <b>hammer.</b> The process leaves ridges in the stock, which may then be flattened out later with the hammer or other tools.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} {{applications}} packaged in the Source SDK: Hammer Editor, Model Viewer, and <b>Face</b> Poser. <b>Hammer</b> Editor, the engine's official level editor, uses compilation tools {{included in the}} SDK. The tool was originally known as Worldcraft and was developed independently by Ben Morris before Valve acquired it. The Model Viewer is a program that allows users to view models {{and can be used}} for a variety of different purposes, including development. Developers may use the program to view models and their corresponding animations, attachment points, bones, and so on. Face Poser is the tool used to access facial animations and choreography systems. This tool allows one to edit facial expressions, gestures and movements for characters, lip sync speech, and sequence expressions and other acting cues and preview what the scene will look like in the game engine.|$|R

50|$|The {{combining}} process; {{the five}} basic forging process are often combined {{to produce and}} refine the shapes necessary for finished products. For example, to fation a cross peen hammer head, a smith would start with a bar roughly {{the diameter of the}} <b>hammer</b> <b>face,</b> the handle hole would be punched and drifted (widened by inserting or passing a larger tool through it), the head would be cut (punched, but with a wedge), the peen would be drawn to a wedge and the face would be dressed by upsetting.|$|R
2500|$|Cameron and {{his brother}} Tyler are both played by actor Armie Hammer in The Social Network (2010), a film {{directed}} by David Fincher about the founding of Facebook.

50|$|The tumbler {{provides}} the automation. When reset, a provision is made {{such that the}} tumbler rod is cocked slightly, so that its resting position is skewed and the tip contacts the hammer mass on the <b>face</b> of the <b>hammer</b> slightly offset to the hole. This is commonly done by using a special bent end on the tumbler spring or using an out-of-flat face on the bottom end of the pin or top of the punch. It bears on the hammer mass and pushes it back against its spring as the punch is pressed, storing energy in the hammer spring.|$|R

50|$|A hammer mill, hammer forge or hammer works was a {{workshop}} in the pre-industrial era that was typically used to manufacture semi-finished, wrought iron products or, sometimes, finished agricultural or mining tools, or military weapons. The feature that gave {{its name to}} these workshops was the water-driven trip hammer, or set of hammers, used in the process. The shaft, or 'helve', of the hammer was pivoted {{in the middle and}} the hammer head was lifted by the action of cams set on a rotating camshaft that periodically depressed the end of the shaft. As it rose and fell, the head of the hammer described an arc. The <b>face</b> of the <b>hammer</b> was made of iron for durability.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the moment}} the <b>face</b> of the <b>hammer</b> head {{contacts}} the surface being struck, the sand or shot within the head is effectively trailing it (due to inertia, it is collected {{at the opposite end}} of the head). The force imparted by this additional loose mass within the head is not imparted to the struck surface at the moment of contact. Instead, this force is spread out over some period of time, as the sand or shot descends to fill the [...] "face" [...] end of the head. Such a blow is less [...] "sharp" [...] than that of the conventional hammer and feels more [...] "dead" [...] (less elastic rebound) to the user, hence the name.|$|R
50|$|Post mauls {{are similar}} to sledgehammers in shape, but are meant to drive wooden fence posts or tree stakes into the earth. Newer mauls have broad, flat {{circular}} faces that are significantly larger in diameter than {{the body of the}} head (where the handle attaches). Older post mauls are significantly larger than sledgehammers like their newer counterparts except the outside diameter (body) of older post maul designs remained the same large diameter as that of the <b>faces</b> of the <b>hammer</b> {{from one side to the}} other side. Sledgehammers usually have octagonal faces that are the same diameter or slightly smaller than the body of the head, and they are not nearly as large in overall diameter as a post maul.|$|R
50|$|The RPD is hammer {{fired from}} an open bolt, the hammer forming part of {{the rear of the}} bolt carrier (which is {{connected}} to the gas piston), which continues moving forward for a short distance after the round is chambered and the bolt locked, the <b>hammer</b> <b>face</b> then striking the rear of the free floating firing pin which passes through the length of the bolt. Locking occurs by means of lateral flaps located along the sides of the bolt, which are forced outwards (by the angled sides of the hammer) into recesses cut into the receiver body, after which firing occurs when the <b>face</b> of the <b>hammer</b> strikes the rear of the firing pin; the mechanism is simple, rugged and reliable, It features a trigger mechanism that is limited to fully automatic fire only. The bolt is equipped with a spring-loaded casing extraction system and a fixed insert inside the receiver housing which passes between the feed horns of the bolt serves as the ejector. Spent cartridge casings are ejected downward through an opening in the bolt carrier and receiver. The RPD has a manually operated lever-type safety mechanism that secures the weapon against accidental firing by blocking the bolt catch when engaged. Unlike Degtyarov's earlier firearm patents, the RPD's return spring is located inside the butt. Like many other rugged Russian-made firearms, the chamber and bore are chrome-lined, greatly decreasing the risk of corrosion and jamming.The weapon has a non-removable barrel with a 3-position gas adjustment valve used to control the performance of the gas system. It is also equipped with a folding integral bipod, wooden shoulder stock, foregrip and pistol grip. The firearm strips down into the following major groups: the receiver and barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, feed tray and feed cover, the recoil mechanism and the trigger group and stock.|$|R
