25|$|Applying {{the concept}} of <b>hormesis</b> on anti-ageing medicine, Kyriazis {{controversially}} suggested that leading a stressful, irregular and constantly stimulating lifestyle may {{be a way of}} reducing the impact of age-related dysfunction. The rationale for this was based on the suggestion that ageing is accompanied by a loss of physiological complexity, and it is thus necessary {{to increase the amount of}} external stimulation in order to restore the loss.|$|E
2500|$|Partly in {{an attempt}} to diversify and apply the concept of <b>hormesis</b> in real life, Kyriazis set up the Caridi Estate in Liguria, Italy, {{transforming}} [...] of abandoned scrap-land into an organised estate of vineyards, orchards and woodland.

2500|$|On March 16, 2011, {{discussing}} the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, Coulter, citing research into radiation <b>hormesis,</b> wrote {{that there was}} [...] "burgeoning evidence that excess radiation operates {{as a sort of}} cancer vaccine." [...] Her comments were criticized by figures across the political spectrum, from Fox News' Bill O'Reilly (who told Coulter, [...] "You have to be responsible ... in something like this, you gotta get the folks out of there, and you have to report worst-case scenarios") to MSNBC's Ed Schulz (who stated that [...] "You would laugh at her if she wasn't making light of a terrible tragedy.") ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} research {{done on the}} effect of low-level radiation on humans. [...] Debate on the applicability of Linear no-threshold model versus Radiation <b>hormesis</b> and other competing models continues, however, the predicted low rate of cancer with low dose means that large sample sizes are required in order to make meaningful conclusions. [...] A study conducted by the National Academy of Science found that carcinogenic effects of radiation does increase with dose. The largest study on nuclear industry workers in history involved nearly a half-million individuals and concluded that a 1–2% of cancer deaths were likely due to occupational dose. [...] This was on the high range of what theory predicted by LNT, but was [...] "statistically compatible".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hormesis</b> {{remains largely}} {{unknown to the}} public. Government and {{regulatory}} bodies disagree {{on the existence of}} radiation <b>hormesis</b> and research points to the [...] "severe problems and limitations" [...] with the use of <b>hormesis</b> in general as the [...] "principal dose-response default assumption in a risk assessment process charged withensuring public health protection." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hormesis</b> is any {{process in}} a cell or {{organism}} that exhibits a biphasic response to exposure to increasing amounts of a substance or condition. Within the hormetic zone there is generally a favorable biological responses to low exposures to toxins and other stressors. <b>Hormesis</b> comes from Greek <b>hórmēsis</b> [...] "rapid motion, eagerness", itself from ancient Greek hormáein [...] "to set in motion, impel, urge on". A pollutant or toxin showing <b>hormesis</b> thus has the opposite effect in small doses as in large doses. Hormetics is the term proposed for the study and science of <b>hormesis.</b> A related concept is Mithridatism, which refers to the willful exposure to toxins {{in an attempt to}} develop immunity against them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hormesis</b> {{remains largely}} {{unknown to the}} public. Any policy change ought to {{consider}} <b>hormesis</b> first {{as a public health}} issue (versus an industrial regulatory issue). This would include the assessment of the public concern regarding exposure to small toxic doses. In addition, impact of <b>hormesis</b> policy change upon the management of industrial risks should be studied.|$|E
5000|$|Hueppe {{is remembered}} for his pioneer {{investigations}} of <b>hormesis</b> {{in regards to}} chemical stimulation/inhibition of bacterial growth. The eponymous [...] "Hueppe’s rule" [...] is an historical term synonymous with <b>hormesis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In toxicology, <b>hormesis</b> is a dose {{response}} phenomenon {{characterized by}} a low dose stimulation, high dose inhibition, resulting in either a J-shaped or an inverted U-shaped dose response. Such environmental factors {{that would seem to}} produce positive responses have also been termed [...] "eustress". The <b>hormesis</b> model of dose response is vigorously debated. The notion that <b>hormesis</b> is important for chemical risks regulations is not widely accepted.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} claimed that this relationship, {{characterized}} by positive effects at an intermediate {{dose of the}} stressor (exercise), is characteristic of <b>hormesis.</b> However, {{it is important to}} point out that there is evidence that the oxidative stress associated with intensive exercise may have long-term health benefits. This would imply that oxidative stress, itself, provides an example of <b>hormesis</b> (see section on Mitochondrial <b>hormesis),</b> but physical exercise does not.|$|E
50|$|While {{proponents of}} <b>hormesis</b> argue that {{changing}} to a <b>hormesis</b> model would likely change exposure standards for these toxicants in air, water, food and soil, making the standards less strict, other scientists {{point out that}} low dose stimulation can have extremely adverse effects. Similarly, low doses of the phthalate DEHP cause increased allergic responses to allergens, while higher doses have no effect. Wider use of the <b>hormesis</b> model would affect how scientists design and conduct studies and the selection of models that estimate risk. In all likelihood, recognizing that low dose effects can't be predicted from high dose experiments would force a strengthening of public health standards, not their weakening, as <b>hormesis</b> proponents would argue.|$|E
50|$|Radiation <b>hormesis</b> {{proposes that}} {{radiation}} exposure comparable to and {{just above the}} natural background level of radiation is not harmful but beneficial, while accepting that much higher levels of radiation are hazardous. Proponents of radiation <b>hormesis</b> typically claim that radio-protective responses in cells and the immune system not only counter {{the harmful effects of}} radiation but additionally act to inhibit spontaneous cancer not related to radiation exposure. Radiation <b>hormesis</b> stands {{in stark contrast to the}} more generally accepted linear no-threshold model (LNT), which states that the radiation dose-risk relationship is linear across all doses, so that small doses are still damaging, albeit less so than higher ones. Opinion pieces on chemical and radiobiological <b>hormesis</b> appeared in the journals Nature and Science in 2003.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{radiation}} <b>hormesis</b> is considered unproven by regulatory bodies. If the <b>hormesis</b> model {{turns out to}} be accurate, it is conceivable that current regulations based on the LNT model will prevent or limit the hormetic effect, and thus {{have a negative impact on}} health.|$|E
50|$|Eustress means {{beneficial}} stress—either psychological, physical (e.g. exercise), or biochemical/radiological (<b>hormesis).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Suresh Rattan's major {{intellectual}} {{contribution in}} gerontology is {{the formulation of}} the concepts of essential lifespan and virtual gerontogenes http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7781932?ordinalpos=7&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum regarding the nature of genes involved in ageing that real gerontogenes do not exist. Additionally, {{in the area of}} ageing modulation, Suresh Rattan is credited with the sole inventorship for discovering the anti-ageing effects of kinetin and zeatin in human skin cells; and these compounds are being used in several skin-care cosmetics throughout the world, for example Valeant product Kinerase.His areas of expertise include ageing, anti-ageing and healthy ageing of human cells, specially fibroblasts, keratinocytes, osteoblasts, and bone marrow stem cells. His current research focuses on the beneficial effects of mild stress, <b>Hormesis,</b> and discovering hormetins (a new category of natural and synthetic compounds which bring about their beneficial effects through <b>hormesis)</b> for slowing down ageing and improving {{the quality of life in}} old age. The first skincare product to come out of the theory of <b>hormesis</b> is the Vaxin for Youth from Givenchy. He has also put forward the terms for the science and study of <b>hormesis,</b> and [...] "hormetin" [...] for any condition that can bring about <b>hormesis</b> [...] "hormetics".|$|E
50|$|The {{hypothesis}} of <b>hormesis</b> has generated the most controversy {{when applied to}} ionizing radiation. This theory is called radiation <b>hormesis.</b> For policy making purposes, the commonly accepted model of dose response in radiobiology is the linear no-threshold model (LNT), which assumes a strictly linear dependence between the risk of radiation-induced adverse health effects and radiation dose.|$|E

50|$|Quoting {{results from}} a {{literature}} database research, the Académie des Sciences - Académie nationale de Médecine (French Academy of Sciences - National Academy of Medicine) stated in their 2005 report concerning the effects of low-level radiation that many laboratory studies have observed radiation <b>hormesis.</b> However, they cautioned {{that it is not}} yet known if radiation <b>hormesis</b> occurs outside the laboratory, or in humans.|$|E
50|$|Mitochondrial <b>hormesis</b> was {{a purely}} {{hypothetical}} concept until late 2007, when {{work on a}} small worm named Caenorhabditis elegans suggested that the restriction of glucose metabolism extends life span primarily by increasing oxidative stress to stimulate the organism into having an ultimately increased resistance to further oxidative stress. This is probably the first experimental evidence for <b>hormesis</b> being the reason for extended life span following caloric restriction.|$|E

50|$|Reports by the United States National Research Council and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) {{argue that}} there is no {{evidence}} for <b>hormesis</b> in humans {{and in the case of}} the National Research Council <b>hormesis</b> is outright rejected as a possibility. Therefore, estimating Linear no-threshold model (LNT) continues to be the model generally used by regulatory agencies for human radiation exposure.|$|E
50|$|A report {{commissioned}} by the French National Academy concluded that there is sufficient evidence for <b>hormesis</b> occurring at low doses and that LNT should be reconsidered as the methodology used to estimate risks from low level sources of radiation, like deep geological repositories for nuclear waste. On the other hand, the United States-based National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements states that there is insufficient evidence for radiation <b>hormesis</b> and that radiation protection authorities should continue to apply the LNT model for purposes of risk estimation.|$|E
50|$|Radiation <b>hormesis</b> is the {{hypothesis}} that low doses of ionizing radiation (within the region of and just above natural background levels) are beneficial, stimulating the activation of repair mechanisms that protect against disease, that are not activated in absence of ionizing radiation. The reserve repair mechanisms are hypothesized to be sufficiently effective when stimulated as to not only cancel the detrimental effects of ionizing radiation but also inhibit disease not related to radiation exposure (see <b>hormesis).</b> This counter-intuitive hypothesis has {{captured the attention of}} scientists and public alike in recent years.|$|E

Thus 100 mSv is considered twice in the table below - once as received over a 5-year period, and once as an acute dose, received over a short period of time, with differing predicted effects. The table describes doses and their official limits, rather than effects.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the areas}} where the concept of <b>hormesis</b> has been {{explored}} extensively with respect to its applicability is aging. Since the basic survival capacity of any biological system depends on its homeodynamic (homeostatic) ability, biogerontologists proposed that exposing cells and organisms to mild stress should result in the adaptive or hormetic response with various biological benefits. This idea has now gathered {{a large body of}} supportive evidence showing that repetitive mild stress exposure has anti-aging effects. Exercise is a paradigm for <b>hormesis</b> in this respect. Some of the mild stresses used for such studies on the application of <b>hormesis</b> in aging research and interventions are heat shock, irradiation, prooxidants, hypergravity and food restriction. Some other natural and synthetic molecules, such as celasterols from medicinal herbs and curcumin from the spice turmeric have also been found to have hormetic beneficial effects. Such compounds which bring about their health beneficial effects by stimulating or by modulating stress response pathways in cells have been termed [...] "hormetins". Hormetic interventions have also been proposed at the clinical level, with a variety of stimuli, challenges and stressful actions, that aim to increase the dynamical complexity of the biological systems in humans.|$|E
5000|$|CERRIE also {{considered}} and rejected by 10 to 2 consensus the biphasic (bimodal) curve of Burlakova et al.
