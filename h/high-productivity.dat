5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a <b>high-productivity</b> welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a {{covering}} layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E

5000|$|In {{economic}}s, {{economic transformation}} {{refers to the}} continuous process of (1) moving labour and other resources from lower- to higher-productivity sectors (structural change or structural transformation) and (2) raising within-sector productivity growth. As such, economic transformation emphasises the movement from low- to <b>high-productivity</b> activities within and across all sectors (which can be tasks or activities that are combinations of agriculture, manufacturing and services). This movement of resources from lower productivity to higher-productivity activities is a key driver of economic development.|$|E
50|$|The Augsburger became popular, {{and spread}} {{to the area of}} Stuttgart {{and as far as the}} Black Forest.

50|$|During the Last Glacial Maximum, {{the mammoth}} steppe was the Earth’s most {{extensive}} biome. It spanned from Spain eastwards across Eurasia to Canada {{and from the}} arctic islands southwards to China. It had a cold, dry climate, the vegetation was dominated by palatable <b>high-productivity</b> grasses, herbs and willow shrubs, and the animal biomass was dominated by the bison, horse, and the woolly mammoth.

5000|$|In a later paper, Hausmann, Rodrik and {{co-author}} Jason Hwang nuance the previous conclusions on self-discovery. [...] They argue that some products {{are associated with}} higher productivity levels than other. Thus, self-discovery is mainly beneficial for countries if it is discovered that <b>high-productivity</b> goods can be profitably produced there. This is because the new products enhance the profitability of the country's export basket, {{which in turn is}} associated with higher growth. In other words, some products are more interesting to discover than others, and these products are what really causes the beneficial effect of self-discovery.|$|E
50|$|Inter{{national}} {{or national}} productivity growth {{stems from a}} complex interaction of factors. Some {{of the most important}} immediate factors include technological change, organizational change, industry restructuring and resource reallocation, as well as economies of scale and scope. A nation's average productivity level can also be affected by the movement of resources from low-productivity to <b>high-productivity</b> industries and activities. Over time, other factors such as research and development and innovative effort, the development of human capital through education, and incentives from stronger competition promote the search for productivity improvements and the ability to achieve them. Ultimately, many policy, institutional and cultural factors determine a nation's success in improving productivity.|$|E
50|$|Europe, and in {{particular}} northern Eurasia, being far colder and drier than today, was largely hegemonized by the mammoth steppe, an ecosystem dominated by palatable <b>high-productivity</b> grasses, herbs and willow shrubs. This supported an extensive biota of grassland fauna, and stretched eastwards from Spain in the Iberian Peninsula to the Yukon in modern-day Canada. The area was populated by many species of grazers which assembled in large herds similar in size to those in Africa today. Populous species which roamed the great grasslands included the woolly mammoth, woolly rhinocerous, Elasmotherium, steppe bison, Pleistocene horse, muskox, Cervalces, reindeer, antelope (Parabubalis, Procapra, Saiga, Spirocerus) and steppe pika. Carnivores included cave lion, Homotherium, cave hyena, grey wolf, dhole, and the arctic fox.|$|E

5000|$|Economic {{growth in}} the U.S. and other {{developed}} countries went through phases that affected growth through changes {{in the labor force}} participation rate and the relative sizes of economic sectors. The transition from an agricultural economy to manufacturing increased the size of the sector with high output per hour (the <b>high-productivity</b> manufacturing sector), while reducing the size of the sector with lower output per hour (the lower productivity agricultural sector). Eventually high productivity growth in manufacturing reduced the sector size, as prices fell and employment shrank relative to other sectors. [...] The service and government sectors, where output per hour and productivity growth is low, saw increases in their shares of the economy and employment during the 1990s. The public sector has since contracted, while the service economy expanded in the 2000s.|$|E

5000|$|The method {{seems to}} reward the {{replacement}} of original ecosystems with <b>high-productivity</b> agricultural monocultures by assigning a higher biocapacity to such regions. For example, replacing ancient woodlands or tropical forests with monoculture forests or plantations may improve the ecological footprint. Similarly, if organic farming yields were {{lower than those of}} conventional methods, this could result in the former being [...] "penalized" [...] with a larger ecological footprint. Of course, this insight, while valid, stems from the idea of using the footprint as one's only metric. If the use of ecological footprints are complemented with other indicators, such as one for biodiversity, the problem could maybe be solved. Indeed, WWF's Living Planet Report complements the biennial Footprint calculations with the Living Planet Index of biodiversity. Manfred Lenzen and Shauna Murray have created a modified Ecological Footprint that takes biodiversity into account for use in Australia.|$|E
50|$|The paleo-environment changed across time, a {{proposal}} that is supported from mammoth dung samples found in northern Yakutia. During Pleniglacial interstadials, alder, birch, and pine trees survived in northern Siberia, however during the Last Glacial Maximum only a treeless steppe vegetation existed. At {{the onset of the}} Late Glacial Interstadial (15,000-11,000 BP), global warming resulted in shrub and dwarf birch in northeastern Siberia, which was then colonized by open woodland with birch and spruce during the Younger Dryas (12,900-11,700 YBP). By the Holocene (10,000 YBP), patches of closed larch and pine forests developed. Past researchers had once assumed that the mammoth steppe was very unproductive because they had assumed that the carbon content of its soils were very low, however these soils (yedoma) were preserved in the permafrost of Siberia and Alaska and are the largest reservoir of organic carbon known. It was a highly productive environment. The vegetation was dominated by palatable <b>high-productivity</b> grasses, herbs and willow shrubs.|$|E

40|$|A {{model in}} which a <b>high-productivity</b> region and a low-productivity region bargain with each firm {{in a group of}} mobile firms is constructed. It differs from the Han and Leach [7] model in that the firms are identical, so that its {{comparative}} statics are more tractable. The model is used to examine the allocative effects of equalization payments (both non-contingent payments and "corrective subsidies"). The equilibrium is characterized by misallocation of capital and underprovision of public goods. Underprovision is more severe in the low-productivity region than the <b>high-productivity</b> region. A transfer of revenue from the <b>high-productivity</b> region to the low-productivity region augments public goods provision in the low-productivity region, allowing that region to make more generous offers to the firms.
