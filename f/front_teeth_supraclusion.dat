The work is aimed at improving the methods for determining the amount of defects in dental hard tissues in the frontal area, that will help develop an index of the destruction of coronal portion of <b>front</b> <b>teeth.</b> The objective of the research was to optimize the diagnostic process in treatment of damaged coronal portions of frontal teeth developing the methods for determining the amount of defects in dental hard tissues in the frontal area. Materials and methods. We conducted experimental research of defects of dental hard tissues of different size and location on diagnostic models and 20 extracted teeth with preserved coronal portion. Results. When researching diagnostic models, we determined the volumetric percentage ratio of dental defects to the volume of dental crown in different defects of <b>front</b> <b>teeth.</b> Conclusions. Methods of determining the amount of hard tissue defects in <b>front</b> <b>teeth</b> placing creamy substance on the model of investigated <b>teeth</b> or <b>front</b> <b>teeth</b> impressions using insulin syringe will allow us to make a correct detailed diagnosis in case of damage to coronal portion of <b>front</b> <b>teeth</b> and monitor the reasonableness of orthopedic treatment...|$|R
