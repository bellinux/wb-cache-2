Chang et al. (2010) investigated optimal ordering policies for <b>deteriorating</b> items using a discounted cash-flow analysis when trade credit {{is linked to}} order quantity. Wu et al. (2006) investigated non-instantaneous <b>deteriorating</b> inventory model with stock-dependent demand. Further, Ouyang et al. (2006) developed model for non-instantaneous <b>deteriorating</b> items with permissible delay in payments. Yang and Wee (2002, 2003) have conducted research on the inventory policy for <b>deteriorating</b> item in the supply chain including a single vendor and multi-buyers. Yang and Wee (2002) developed a multi-lot-size production and inventory model for <b>deteriorating</b> items with constant production and demand rates. The studies on stochastic <b>deteriorating</b> items inventory in the supply chain at present are {{much less than the}} ones on the deterministic <b>deteriorating</b> items inventory. Du et al. (2007) studied the <b>deteriorating</b> item stock replenishment and shipment policy for vendor-managed inventory (VMI) system with the assumption that the demand process follows a typical Poisson process. Taleizadeha et al. (2015) addressed VMI model for a two-level supply chain in which demand is deterministic and price sensitive for <b>deteriorating</b> products.|$|R
30|$|<b>Deteriorating</b> rate {{is another}} {{key factor in}} the study of <b>deteriorating</b> items inventory, which {{describes}} the deterioration nature of the items. When it comes to the study of <b>deteriorating</b> rate, there are several situations. In the early stage of the study, most of the <b>deteriorating</b> rates in the models are constant, such as Ghare and Schrader (1963), Shah and Jaiswal (1977), Aggarwal (1978), Padmanabhana and Vratb (1995), and Bhunia and Maiti (1999). In recent research, more and more studies have begun to consider the relationship between time and <b>deteriorating</b> rate. In this situation there are several scenarios: <b>deteriorating</b> rate is a linear increasing function of time (Mukhopadhyay et al. 2004), <b>deteriorating</b> rate is three-parameter Weibull distributed (Chakrabarty et al. 1998), and <b>deteriorating</b> rate is other function of time (Abad 2001). Under fuzzy environment, the readers are referred to Taleizadeh et al. (2010); Taleizadeha et al. (2013 c) and their references.|$|R
30|$|The {{inventory}} {{problem of}} <b>deteriorating</b> items was first studied by Whitin (1957), {{in which he}} addressed the fashion items <b>deteriorating</b> {{at the end of}} the storage period. Then, Ghare and Schrader (1963) concluded in their study that the consumption of the <b>deteriorating</b> items was closely relative to a negative exponential function of time. Deb and Chaudhri (1986) derived inventory model with time-dependent deterioration rate. Dave and Patel (1994) studied an inventory model for <b>deteriorating</b> items without shortages and the time-dependent demand patterns. Ting and Chung (1994) analyzed the inventory replenishment model for <b>deteriorating</b> items with a linear trend in demand considering shortages. Aggarwal and Jaggi (1995) proposed a model for <b>deteriorating</b> items without shortages. Balkhi and Benkherouf (1996 a, b) investigated the optimal replenishment schedule for production lot size model with <b>deteriorating</b> items.

5|$|As the {{relations}} between the West and the Soviet Union <b>deteriorated</b> with the US and the UK backing Turkey, Soviet claims were out of the agenda by 1947. However, it was not until 1953, after Stalin's death, that they officially abandoned their claims, thus ending the dispute.|$|E
30|$|Rework {{is common}} in semiconductor, pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries. The {{products}} are considered as <b>deteriorating</b> items, because their utility is lost with time of storage due to the price reduction, product useful life expiration, decay, and spoilage. Consideration of <b>deteriorating</b> items in rework process was created by Flapper and Teunter (2004). They developed a logistic planning model with <b>deteriorating</b> recoverable product. Inderfuth et al. (2005) dealt with an EPQ model with rework and <b>deteriorating</b> recoverable products. Since the recoverable products <b>deteriorate,</b> it will increase rework time and rework cost per unit.|$|R
30|$|It can be {{seen that}} there is a {{decrease}} in total cost for the non-instantaneous <b>deteriorating</b> item model. This implies that if the retailer can convert the instantaneously <b>deteriorating</b> items to non-instantaneous <b>deteriorating</b> items by improving stock control, then the total cost per unit time will decrease.|$|R

30|$|The {{journey of}} {{inventory}} modelling {{was started in}} second decade of nineteenth century when Harris (1915) developed the first inventory model and this model was generalized by Wilson (1934) by deriving the formula to obtain the economic order quantity (EOQ).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the earthquake response of <b>deteriorating</b> systems. A model for stiffness degrading or <b>deteriorating</b> systems is used to describe six different singledegree- of -freedom systems. A numerical investigation of the response of these six systems is performed using an ensemble of twelve earthquakes. The response is studied at nine nominal periods of oscillation. The numerical results are presented as response spectra corresponding to six different ductilities. An approximate analytical method for calculating the earthquake response of <b>deteriorating</b> systems from a linear response spectrum is presented. The method, called the average stiffness and energy method, is based upon the premise that a linear system may be defined which is in some sense equivalent to the <b>deteriorating</b> system. The criterion for equivalence in this method is that the average stiffness of the <b>deteriorating</b> system be equal to the stiffness of the linear system and the average energy dissipated by the linear system be the same as the average energy dissipated by the <b>deteriorating</b> system. The new analytical method is compared to existing methods. Comparison with the numerical results is also made. Based upon these comparisons, it is concluded that the average stiffness and energy method represents a significant improvement over currently available methods for predicting the earthquake response of <b>deteriorating</b> and nondeteriorating systems...|$|R
