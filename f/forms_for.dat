5|$|A {{number of}} subtypes of Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} are recognized. Despite this, {{many people have}} overlapping symptoms that can make the classification difficult in individual cases.

5|$|Possessive pronouns {{exist in}} {{dependent}} and independent forms; the dependent form {{functions as a}} determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone {{as if it were}} a noun (e.g. the chair is mine).

Scalar fields having only a slight amount of spatial inhomogeneity would be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant.|$|E
5|$|After 1066, William did {{not attempt}} to {{integrate}} his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws. His seal from after 1066, of which six impressions still survive, was made for him after he conquered England and stressed his role as king, while separately mentioning his role as Duke. When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed fealty to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgement was made– further evidence that the various parts of William's lands were considered separate. The administrative machinery of Normandy, England, and Maine continued to exist separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own <b>forms.</b> <b>For</b> example, England continued the use of writs, which were not known on the continent. Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy differed in formulas from those produced in England.|$|E

5|$|Greenlandic verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four {{are used in}} independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further {{complicated by the fact}} that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Reynolds and Reynolds won a {{contract}} to provide all of the business <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> Chevrolet dealerships. The company opened new offices throughout the U.S. in the 1930s, and had 19 sales offices {{by the end of}} the decade. A controlling interest in the company was acquired in 1939 by Senior Richard Hallam Grant, ending the Reynolds family ownership. He became the company's president in 1941. A new printing facility was built in 1948 in Celina, Ohio, and another in 1953 in Dallas, Texas, in addition to the one built in Los Angeles in 1928. Reynolds became a public company in 1961. In the 1960s, Reynolds opened new printing facilities in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, New Jersey and Canada. In 1963, Reynolds expanded into Canada through the acquisition of the automotive business unit of Windsor Office Supply, forming Reynolds and Reynolds (Canada) Ltd. By the end of the decade it had about $50 million in revenues.|$|E
5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and in the choir of York.|$|E
2500|$|Old English was a {{moderately}} inflected language, using an extensive case system {{similar to that}} of modern Icelandic or German. Middle and Modern English lost progressively more of the Old English inflectional system. Modern English is considered a weakly inflected language, since its nouns have only vestiges of inflection (plurals, the pronouns), and its regular verbs have only four forms: an inflected <b>form</b> <b>for</b> the past indicative and subjunctive (looked), an inflected <b>form</b> <b>for</b> the third-person-singular present indicative (looks), an inflected <b>form</b> <b>for</b> the present participle (looking), and an uninflected <b>form</b> <b>for</b> everything else (look). While the English possessive indicator s (as in [...] "Jane's book") is a remnant of the Old English genitive case suffix, it is now considered not a suffix but a clitic.|$|R

5|$|Major {{memorial}} themes, such as {{victory and}} death all had their symbols. Many Canadian and British soldiers are shown raising a hat or a rifle, {{a sign of}} victory first introduced into Boer War memorials. The Greek goddess Nike herself frequently appears on civic memorials, particularly in Britain and Canada, personifying victory, often pointing the way to soldiers: the image is far less, common, however, on more sombre memorials in battlefields and graveyards. Personifications of Death rarely feature on these memorials, however, probably because the emphasis is typically on the self-sacrifice of the soldiers involved, rather than their being taken or claimed by Death. Death is more typically presented through images of widows, orphans and elderly parents on memorials, all popular inter-war allegorical <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> death and grieving. Figures of women often represented peace, civilisation or wider humanity.|$|E
5|$|Odes {{were first}} {{developed}} by poets writing in ancient Greek, such as Pindar, and Latin, such as Horace. Forms of odes appear {{in many of}} the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins. The ode generally has three parts: a strophe, an antistrophe, and an epode. The antistrophes of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. Odes have a formal poetic diction, and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode. Over time, differing <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode. One non-Western form which resembles the ode is the qasida in Persian poetry.|$|E
5|$|On leaving school, Headley was {{appointed}} {{as a temporary}} clerk in a magistrate's court; this enabled him to play competitive cricket for the St Andrew's Police side in 1926, in a cup competition. Some impressive performances for the club earned him an invitation to practice with the Jamaica Colts team. However, his job {{made it impossible to}} attend, and he was not considered for the Jamaican side against Lord Tennyson's English touring side in 1927. That year, Headley began working for Keeling–Lindo Estates, in St Catherine. The firm were enthusiastic cricket patrons, allowing employees time off to play in matches, so that Headley was able to attend practice with the Jamaica team on a regular basis. He also moved to the St Catherine Cricket Club, captained by his immediate superior in Keeling–Lindo. To generate more income, Headley took a second job, working for the Jamaica Fruit and Shipping Company, but he wanted a secure profession. To this end, he planned to move to America to pursue a career in dentistry. However, he was now on the verge of the Jamaica team and a delay in the arrival of the application <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> his American work permit allowed him to make his first-class debut for Jamaica against another touring team led by Lord Tennyson.|$|E
