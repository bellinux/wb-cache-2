The spectrum did not closely match other type I SLSNe and previous SLSNe have been discovered in relatively small active star-producing galaxies, not in the central regions of large galaxies. The <b>double-peaked</b> light curve is not expected from a SLSN and the total energy output approaches theoretical limits.|$|E
50|$|Although roughly circular, {{this is a}} {{somewhat}} oddly shaped crater that is slightly elongated to the south. The western and eastern outer rims are slightly straightened, giving the crater a slightly hexagonal form. The inner wall is wider along the southern and southeastern sides than in the north. The crater is worn and its features have lost some definition. The interior floor is nearly level, {{with the exception of}} a <b>double-peaked</b> central rise. To the northwest of this ridge is a small, cup-shaped crater.|$|E
50|$|The {{spectrum}} of VV Cep {{can be resolved}} into two main components, originating from a cool supergiant and a hot small star surrounded by a disk. The material surrounding the hot secondary produces emission lines, including FeII forbidden lines, the Be phenomenon known from other stars surrounded by circumstellar disks. The hydrogen emission lines are <b>double-peaked,</b> caused by a narrow central absorption component. This is caused by seeing the disk almost edge on where it intercepts continuum radiation from the star. This is characteristic of shell stars.|$|E

5000|$|Varuna has a {{rotational}} {{period of}} approximately 6.34 hours. It has a <b>double-peaked</b> light curve. Given the rapid rotation, rare for objects so large, Varuna {{is thought to}} be an elongated spheroid (ratio of axis 2:3), with a mean density around 1 g/cm3 (roughly the density of water). Examination of Varuna's light curve has found that the best-fit model for Varuna is a triaxial ellipsoid with the axes a,b,c in ratios in the range of b/a = 0.63-0.80, and c/a = 0.45-0.52 and a bulk density of [...] g/cm3.|$|E
5000|$|In the outbursting state, stars show strong {{variability}} with {{periods of}} 20-40 minutes. The stars V803 Centauri and CR Bootes are stars that show outbursting behaviour. [...] These stars occasionally show longer, and sometimes little brighter, super-outbursts. The interval between outbursts is longer on average for stars with longer periods. The spectra show strong helium absorption lines during the outbursts, with many weaker emission lines of helium and iron near minimum. The spectral lines are typically doubled, producing broad flat-bottom absorption lines and sharp <b>double-peaked</b> emission lines. This {{is the most}} common type of AM CVn variable, possibly because they are most easily detected.|$|E
50|$|These are yellow supergiant stars (actually {{low mass}} post-AGB stars {{at the most}} {{luminous}} stage of their lives) which have alternating deep and shallow minima. This <b>double-peaked</b> variation typically has periods of 30-100 days and amplitudes of 3-4 magnitudes. Superimposed on this variation, there may be long-term variations over periods of several years. Their spectra are of type F or G at maximum light and type K or M at minimum brightness. They lie near the instability strip, cooler than type I Cepheids more luminous than type II Cepheids. Their pulsations are caused by the same basic mechanisms related to helium opacity, but they are at a very different stage of their lives.|$|E
5000|$|The {{spectral}} type {{over the}} same period has changed from a G0 hypergiant {{at the start of the}} 20th century, to early K in 1973, then rapidly back to G0 by 1977, continuing to reach A6 Ia+ in 2011. These spectral types are compatible with the observed colour changes, indicating changes in the temperature of the star or its dense winds. The spectrum contains nitrogen and helium emission lines with unusual P Cygni profiles, including [...] "inverse P Cygni" [...] and <b>double-peaked</b> line profiles. Forbidden NII lines and a triple-peaked Hα line have strengthened dramatically since 1993, and the profiles have also changed indicating developments in circumstellar material probably ejected from the star.|$|E
50|$|The Hoher Tenn, {{formerly}} {{also called}} the Hochtenn, is a <b>double-peaked</b> mountain in the Austrian federal state of Salzburg. It has a southwest summit, called the Bergspitze with a height of 3,368 metres, and a northeast summit, the Schneespitze, which is 3,317 metres high. The Tenn belongs to the Glockner Group in {{the central part of}} the High Tauern in the Austrian Central Alps. Between the two summits at a height of 3,293 metres is the Tenn Saddle (Tennsattel). Long knife-edge ridges run away to the northeast and northwest. It has a large topographical prominence, especially to the north, which, together with its easy accessibility, make it a popular climbing mountain.

50|$|Semisopochnoi, {{the largest}} subaerial volcano {{of the western}} Aleutians, is 20 km wide at sea level and {{contains}} a caldera 8 km wide that formed {{as a result of}} collapse of a low-angle, dominantly basaltic volcano following the eruption of a large volume of dacitic pumice. The high point of the island is 1,221 meter Anvil Peak, a <b>double-peaked</b> cone that forms much of the island's northern part. The three-peaked, 774-meter high Mount Cerberus is a volcano within the caldera. Each of the peaks contains a summit crater; lava flows on the northern flank of Cerberus appear younger than those on the southern side. Other post-caldera volcanoes include the symmetrical 855 m high Sugarloaf Peak south-southeast of the caldera and Lakeshore Cone, a small cinder cone at the edge of Fenner Lake in the northeast part of the caldera. Most documented historical eruptions have originated from Cerberus, although Coats (1950) considered that both Sugarloaf and Lakeshore Cone within the caldera could have been active during historical time.|$|E

5000|$|In chapter {{eight of}} the book Downs {{explains}} how the concept of ideology is central to his theory. Depending on the ideological distribution of voters in a given political community, electoral outcomes can be stable and peaceful or wildly varied and even result in violent revolution. The likely number of political parties can also be identified if one also considers the electoral structure. If the ideological positions of voters are displayed {{in the form of}} a graph and if that graph shows a single peak, then a median voter can be identified and in a representative democracy, the choice of candidates and the choice of policies will gravitate toward the positions of the median voter. Conversely, if the graph of ideological distribution is <b>double-peaked,</b> indicating that most voters are either extremely liberal or extremely conservative, the tendency toward political consensus or political equilibrium is difficult to attain because legislators representing each mode are penalized by voters for attempting to achieve consensus with the other side by supporting policies representative of a middle position.

5000|$|The oblique {{portion of}} this area (9 to 16°E), the [...] "oblique supersegment" [...] is highly {{variable}} in axial orientation, ranging from orthogonal to 56°, and its series of magmatic and amagmatic segments results in abruptly fluctuating magmatism and ultra-slow spreading.West of a discontinuity at 16°E axial depth drops 500 m {{and there is an}} abrupt change in morphology and magnetism.In the western end of this area (9°30'-11°45') a short magmatic ridge segment intersects the Shaka FZ.

40|$|In this manuscript, {{we study}} {{properties}} of long-term optical variability {{of a large}} sample of 106 SDSS spectroscopically confirmed AGN with <b>double-peaked</b> broad low-ionization emission lines (<b>double-peaked</b> emitters). The long-term optical light curves over 8 years are collected from the Catalina Sky Surveys Data Release 2. And, the Damped Random Walk (DRW) process is applied to describe the long-term variability of the <b>double-peaked</b> emitters. Meanwhile, the same DRW process is applied to long-term optical light curves of more than 7000 spectroscopically confirmed normal quasars in the SDSS Stripe 82 Database. Then, we can find that the DRW process determined rest-frame intrinsic variability timescales (τ/ days) are about 5. 8 and about 4. 8 for the <b>double-peaked</b> emitters and for the normal quasars, respectively. The statistically longer intrinsic variability timescales can be confirmed in the <b>double-peaked</b> emitters, after considerations of necessary effects, such as the effects from different distributions of redshift, BH mass and accretion rate between the <b>double-peaked</b> emitters and the normal quasars. Moreover, a radial dependence of accretion rate ṁ_ R ∝ R^β with larger values of β could be an acceptable interpretation of the longer intrinsic variability timescales in the <b>double-peaked</b> emitters. Therefore, there are different intrinsic properties of emission regions between the <b>double-peaked</b> emitters and the normal quasars. The <b>double-peaked</b> emitters can be well treated as an unique subclass of AGN. Comment: 17 pages, 2 tables, 10 figures, Accepted {{to be published in}} MNRA...|$|E
