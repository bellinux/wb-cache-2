5|$|At {{his death}} Gov. Belcher left {{instructions}} {{that he be}} buried with his ardent friend and cousin, <b>Judge</b> Jonathan Remington (1667-1745, father-in-law of William Ellery, a signer of the Declaration of Independence). The body of <b>Judge</b> Jonathan Remington was disinterred and placed by his side. The monument which the governor had directed to be raised over his resting-place was never erected. The tomb became the family vault of Jennisons (Gov. Belcher's granddaughter married Dr. Timothy Lindall Jennison). The site of their grave was forgotten and long search has been made for it. In the late 1800s, local historians found that Gov. Jonathan Belcher and <b>Judge</b> Jonathan Remington were buried in one grave in Old Burying Ground, Cambridge, Ma. Their tomb is contiguous to that of <b>Judge</b> Edmund Trowbridge and Edmund Trowbridge Dana. In that of <b>Judge</b> Trowbridge rest the remains of Washington Allston; of Chief Justice Francis Dana; of the poet Richard Henry Dana and others of the family.|$|E

The American <b>Judges</b> Association is a special {{organization}} with special attributes that no other judicial organization possesses. We are uniquely an association of <b>judges,</b> run by <b>judges,</b> for <b>judges.</b> And, we are uniquely an independent association of all <b>judges.</b> Every other judicial organization that I’m aware of has either a limited membership criterion (trial <b>judges,</b> Missouri <b>judges,</b> juvenile <b>judges,</b> federal <b>judges,</b> appellate <b>judges,</b> presiding <b>judges,</b> etc.) or it has an open membership but is controlled by someone else and is divided into impervious sections. These are all important and vital associations but {{not one of them}} does what the AJA does. We exist to serve all <b>judges...</b>|$|R

5|$|Each {{state is}} divided into {{judicial}} districts presided over by a District and Sessions <b>Judge.</b> He {{is known as a}} District <b>Judge</b> when he presides over a civil case, and a Sessions <b>Judge</b> when he presides over a criminal case. He is the highest judicial authority below a High Court <b>judge.</b> Below him, there are courts of civil jurisdiction, known by different names in different states. Under Article 141 of the Constitution, all courts in India (which includes High Courts) are bound by the judgments and orders of the Supreme Court of India by precedence.|$|E
50|$|The <b>judges</b> who {{normally}} {{sit in the}} Crown Court are High Court <b>judges,</b> Circuit <b>judges</b> and Recorders. Circuit <b>judges</b> also sit in the County Court.

50|$|Appellate <b>judges,</b> {{district}} court <b>judges,</b> Denver Probate Court <b>judges,</b> juvenile court <b>judges</b> and county court <b>judges</b> in larger counties {{are required to}} be lawyers. Trial courts also often have magistrates with many judicial powers appointed by the court who must also be lawyers. County court <b>judges</b> in smaller counties {{are not required to}} be lawyers, but currently there are no more than four non-lawyer state <b>judges</b> in Colorado, all of whom are part-time, and at least three of whom are college educated. Preference in hiring municipal <b>judges</b> must be given to lawyers. Municipal <b>judges</b> in courts of record must be lawyers, while municipal <b>judges</b> in courts not of record need not be lawyers. In practice, all of the larger municipalities in Colorado have municipal courts of record with <b>judges</b> who are lawyers. Many municipal <b>judges</b> who are lawyers serve on multiple municipal courts and/or are part-time county court <b>judges.</b>|$|R

He was appointed a district <b>judge</b> in 1960 and a <b>judge</b> of the Supreme Court in 1963.

5|$|Honório Hermeto {{pursued a}} typical course open to 19th century Brazilians who became {{affluent}} through family connections and patronage: a judicial career, with expectations of entering politics. On 14 October 1826, {{he was named}} to a three-year term as juiz de fora (external <b>judge)</b> with jurisdiction over the three villages {{in the province of}} São Paulo. On 25 August 1828, Honório Hermeto left São Paulo upon being promoted to the post of auditor da marinha (admiralty <b>judge)</b> in Rio de Janeiro, the imperial capital located in the province of same name. His tenure in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro helped expand his connections.

5|$|In 2009, a {{jury found}} for Heffernan and awarded him damages {{from the police}} {{officials}} and the city. Despite the verdict, Heffernan sought a retrial because <b>Judge</b> Peter G.

While considering these motions, <b>Judge</b> Sheridan became aware of a conflict of interest through a former law firm and set aside the verdict, setting a new date for trial before <b>Judge</b> Dennis M.

The other is the <b>Judge</b> Arc, unlockable after beating the main three hundred missions.
