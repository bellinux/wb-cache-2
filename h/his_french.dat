5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>his</b> <b>French</b> chansons, he wrote {{at least three}} pieces {{in the manner of}} the Italian frottola, a popular Italian song form which he would have encountered during his years in Milan. These songs include Scaramella, El grillo, and In te domine speravi. They are even simpler in texture than <b>his</b> <b>French</b> chansons, being almost uniformly syllabic and homophonic, and they remain among the most frequently sung portions of his output.|$|E
5|$|Charles of Bavaria needed {{military}} assistance {{to take the}} imperial title by force, which he secured the treaty of Nymphenburg (July 1741). During the subsequent War of the Austrian Succession, he successfully captured Prague, where he was crowned King of Bohemia. He invaded Upper Austria, planning to capture Vienna, but diplomatic exigencies complicated his plans. <b>His</b> <b>French</b> allies redirected their troops into Bohemia, where Frederick the Great, himself newly King of Prussia, had {{taken advantage of the}} chaos in Austria and Bavaria to annex Silesia.|$|E
5|$|During the French Revolution and Napoleonic era, Louis XVIII {{lived in}} exile in Prussia, the United Kingdom and Russia. When the Sixth Coalition finally {{defeated}} Napoleon in 1814, Louis XVIII was placed in what he, and the French royalists, considered his rightful position. Napoleon escaped from his exile in Elba, however, and restored <b>his</b> <b>French</b> Empire. Louis XVIII fled and a Seventh Coalition declared war on the French Empire, defeated Napoleon, and restored Louis XVIII to the French throne.|$|E

5|$|In {{gratitude}} {{for protecting the}} Christians in Nazareth and Acre, Napoleon III of France presented Aqil a gun and the Legion of Honor medal in April 1861 aboard <b>his</b> <b>French</b> vessel docked at Haifa Bay. Edward, Prince of Wales (later King of the United Kingdom) personally visited Aqil two years later to show his appreciation. Aqil offered Edward four Arabian horses, but Edward politely declined. As a token of his appreciation, Edward gave Aqil a revolver.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti {{accepted}} {{the commission and}} created plaster models of the reliefs. He installed one of the models in his château in France, where it remains today, while the other was set into {{the wall of a}} gardener's cottage adjoining <b>his</b> <b>French</b> estate. The bronze relief of the deathbed scene was added to the pedestal in August 1866, while the Taking of Ascalon was installed in March 1867. The Art Journal criticised the deathbed scene as being excessively stretched lengthways and noted similarities with a painting displayed in the Houses of Parliament, created by John Cross, that depicted the same subject.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{was born}} on 7 or 8 December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland, to King James V and <b>his</b> <b>French</b> second wife, Mary of Guise. She {{was said to have}} been born prematurely and was the only {{legitimate}} child of James to survive him. She was the great-niece of King Henry VIII of England, as her paternal grandmother, Margaret Tudor, was Henry VIII's sister. On 14December, six days after her birth, she became Queen of Scots when her father died, perhaps from the effects of a nervous collapse following the Battle of Solway Moss, or from drinking contaminated water while on campaign.|$|E

5|$|Nadal {{struggled}} {{early in}} the clay season at his traditional favorite tournaments of Monte-Carlo and Barcelona. A third loss, to Djokovic in {{the final of the}} Rome Masters, was the first time Nadal had lost more than two matches on clay in a season for a decade. He did, however, win the Madrid Masters after Nishikori got injured while dominating Nadal 6–2, 4–2 in that final. Nadal went on to defend <b>his</b> <b>French</b> Open title, defeating Murray in the semi-final and Djokovic in the final.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to the {{continent}} from England, Henry sought to secure <b>his</b> <b>French</b> lands and quash any potential rebellion. As a result, in 1154 Henry and Louis agreed a peace treaty, under which Henry bought back the Vernon and the Neuf-Marché from Louis. The treaty appeared shaky, however, and tensions remained—in particular, Henry had not given homage to Louis for <b>his</b> <b>French</b> possessions. In an attempt to improve relations, Henry met with Louis at Paris and Mont-Saint-Michel in 1158, agreeing to betroth Henry's eldest living son, the Young Henry, to Louis's daughter Margaret. The marriage deal would have involved Louis granting the disputed territory of the Vexin to Margaret on her marriage to the Young Henry: while this would ultimately give Henry the lands that he claimed, it also cunningly implied that the Vexin was Louis's to give away in the first place, in itself a political concession. For a short while, a permanent peace between Henry and Louis looked plausible.|$|E
5|$|The English court viewed John of Brittany as {{a trusted}} diplomat. He was a skilled negotiator, and <b>his</b> <b>French</b> {{connections}} were a useful asset. By 1307 {{he was also}} one of the kingdom's oldest earls. As the relationship between Edward II and his nobility deteriorated, Richmond remained loyal to the king; in 1309 he went on an embassy to Pope Clement V on behalf of Edward's favourite Piers Gaveston. John was allegedly Gaveston's close personal friend, and did not share the antagonistic attitudes held by certain other earls.|$|E

5|$|After the action, {{one of the}} English privateers quarrelled {{with one}} of <b>his</b> <b>French</b> shipmates and stabbed him in the back, killing him. Before a riot between the French and English sailors could begin, Morgan arrested the English sailor, and promised the French sailors that the man would be hanged on his return to Port Royal. Morgan kept his word and the sailor was hanged. After {{dividing}} the spoils of the conquest of Puerto Principe, Morgan announced a plan to attack Porto Bello (now in modern-day Panama). The city was the third largest and strongest on the Spanish Main, and {{on one of the}} main routes of trade between the Spanish territories and Spain. Because {{of the value of the}} goods passing through its port, Porto Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another in the town. The 200 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure and the murder of their countryman, left Morgan's service and returned to Tortuga. Morgan and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for Porto Bello.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long tolerated the Catholic {{faith of}} <b>his</b> <b>French</b> allies and {{permitted}} unimpeded missionary activities {{out of respect}} to his benefactors. The missionary activity was dominated by the Spanish in Tonkin and French in the central and southern regions. At {{the time of his}} death, there were six European bishops in Vietnam. The population of Christians was estimated at 300,000 in Tonkin and 60,000 in Cochinchina. However, he expressed dismay at the Catholic condemnation of the traditional ancestor worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture. Gia Long was also known for his disdain for Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of the population. Despite its popularity among ladies of the court, Gia Long often restricted the activities of Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long's {{rule was}} {{noted for its}} Confucian orthodoxy. He overcame the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} and reinstated the classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi south to Huế as the country's populace had also shifted south over the preceding centuries, and built up fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, he modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. In deference to the assistance of <b>his</b> <b>French</b> friends, he tolerated the activities of Roman Catholic missionaries, something that became increasingly restricted under his successors. Under his rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siamese forces from Cambodia and {{turning it into a}} vassal state.|$|E

5|$|Gia Long's {{rule was}} {{noted for its}} strict Confucian orthodoxy. Upon {{toppling}} the Tây Sơn, he repealed their reforms and reimposed a classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi in the north to Huế in central Vietnam to reflect the southward migration of the population over the preceding centuries. The emperor built new fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, Gia Long modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. In deference to the assistance of <b>his</b> <b>French</b> friends, he tolerated the activities of Catholic missionaries, something that was increasingly restricted by his successors. Under Gia Long's rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siam from Cambodia and {{turning it into a}} vassal. Despite this, he was relatively isolationist in outlook towards European powers.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} {{his career with}} scoring totals of 512 goals and 814 assists for 1326 points in 1191 games. At {{the time of his}} retirement, Perreault was the sixth leading scorer in NHL history. Along with the other two members of the French Connection, Perreault was inducted into the Buffalo Sabres Hall of Fame in 1989. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1990, and the Sabres retired his number 11 in the same year, having been the only player to ever wear number 11 for the Buffalo Sabres; his #11 was the first number retired by the Sabres. When <b>his</b> <b>French</b> Connection linemates' numbers were retired, Perreault's #11 was lowered and raised back between Martin's #7 and Robert's #14, as the Buffalo Sabres retired the French Connection line as a group, marking the first three players to have their numbers retired by the Sabres.|$|E
5|$|He inaugurated {{his career}} as a {{legislator}} under Prince Ghica. On December 22, 1855, legislation he drafted with Petre Mavrogheni regarding the abolition of slavery was passed by the Boyar Divan. This involved the freeing of privately owned Roma slaves, as those owned by the state had been set free by Prince Sturdza in January 1844. Kogălniceanu claimed to have personally inspired the measure. Ghica was prompted to complete the process of liberation by the fate of Dincă, an educated Roma cook who had murdered <b>his</b> <b>French</b> wife and then killed himself after being made aware {{that he was not going}} to be set free by his Cantacuzino masters.|$|E

5|$|Hoàng Cao Khải, the French-installed viceroy of Tonkin, {{perceived}} Phan's {{intent to}} a degree that <b>his</b> <b>French</b> masters did not. Khai was from a scholar-gentry family from the same village as Phan. He became the main backer of a determined effort to crush Phan's forces, using every means available: political, psychological and economic. By late 1894, relatives and suspected sympathisers of the insurgents were intimidated and more resistance commanders had been killed. Communications were disrupted, and the rebel hideouts became increasingly insecure. In an attempt to force Phan to surrender, the French arrested his family and desecrated the tombs of his ancestors, publicly displaying the remains in Hà Tĩnh.|$|E
5|$|In 1270 Roger Bigod, the 5th Earl, {{inherited}} the castle and undertook extensive renovations there whilst living in considerable luxury and style. Although still extremely wealthy, the Bigods were now having to borrow increasing sums from first the Jewish community at Bungay and then, after {{the expulsion of}} the Jews, Italian merchants; {{by the end of}} the century, Roger was heavily in debt to Edward I as well. As a result, Roger led the baronial opposition to Edward's request for additional taxes and support for <b>his</b> <b>French</b> wars. Edward responded by seizing Roger's lands and only releasing them on the condition that Roger granted them to the Crown after his death. Roger agreed and Framlingham Castle passed to the Crown on his death in 1306.|$|E
5|$|In 1297 he {{accompanied}} Edward I on {{a campaign}} to Flanders, and {{seems to have been}} knighted by this time. With <b>his</b> <b>French</b> connections he was in the following years a valuable diplomat in France for the English King. He also served as military commander in occupied Scotland. In 1298 at Blackearnside, a forest of alders, to the east of the village of Newburgh in Fife, he suffered an ignominious defeat from a force commanded by Wallace, Guardian of Scotland. In 1306 at the Battle of Methven, he won the day over Robert the Bruce only to be soundly defeated by Bruce at Loudoun Hill the next year.|$|E
