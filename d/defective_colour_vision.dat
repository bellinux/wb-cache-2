Helmholtz (1909) and other German physiologists and physicists made the first precise colorimetric-investigations of human vision. Since this "German period" the study of colour vision was pursued principally by Anglo-saxon physicists and physiologists. In 1935, Pitt published his monograph Characteristics of Dichromatic Yision and W. D. Wright published his Researches on Normal and <b>Defective</b> <b>Colour</b> <b>Vision</b> in 1947. Both these publications continue to form a foundation for current research in <b>defective</b> <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b> Whilst our knowledge of "red-green" <b>defective</b> <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> became remarkably accurate and detailed the so called "Blue-yellow" defects were neglected. Wright (1947) refers briefly to tritahopia and tritanomaly commenting that "the amount of reliable information about tritanopia is meagre" (p 297) and that "no tritanomalous observers have yet been discovered who could make tests at the colorimeter" (p 320). The comparitive rarity of these blue-yellow colour vision defects was the principal reason for the neglect. Wright (1947) at the time suggested the incidences of tritanopia and tritanomaly were both one in a million but warned that these figures "are necessarily very approximate" (p 303). However Schmidt (1943) had screened 21, 000 visitors to an exhibition and found one case of tritanomaly. The rarity of these two defects is to some extent the product of the kind of screening tests employed. The Ishihara plates make no attempt to test for "blue-yellow" defects and the Nagel anomaloscope uses the Rayleigh equation. An attempt to modify the Nagel anomaloscope to provide a BG equation was not successful (Jaeger 1955). The Stilling pseudo-iso chromatic plates included some plates for the detection of blue-yellow defects, but the Ishihara suplanted this test in many countries. The identification of blue-yellow defects in mass and routine colour vision testing was made practicable by Farnsworth. Farnsworth (1943) produced his Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test and has devised single pseudoisomatic plates which have been shown to be a very effective means of identifying this class of colour vision defect (Jaeger, 1955). One of these plates was used by Wright (1952) in a mass survey which yielded 17 confirmed cases of tritanopia. On the basis of this survey Wright calculated that the incidence of tritanopia was between 1 in 13, 000 and 1 in 65, 000, the higher freauency being the more likely. This is a much higher incidence than the 1 in 1, 000, 000 that had suggested previously, but much lower than the 2 in 100 of red-green dichromats among men. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} involved with coloured products were surveyed {{to assess the}} role of visual colour judgement in the processes and determine the industrial handicap of <b>defective</b> <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b> The colour vision testing policies of the individual companies were investigated and {{an attempt was made}} to discover the industrial mistakes which could be attributed to <b>defective</b> <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b> Visits were made to selected Industries to supplement information obtained from a postal survey. Discussions with Employment Medical Advisers and Industrial Medical Officers proved to be valuable. A field trial to determine the performance of paper colour matchers at standard colour vision tests was undertaken. A number of industrial jobs involving colour judgement were simulated in the laboratory. One hundred colour defective observers and a group of colour normals took part in the tasks, and an analysis of their performance is presented. In particular, comparisons are drawn between performance at these tasks and scores on standard colour vision tests. An enquiry into the colour vision tests used in school medical examinations was made and the career guidance given to colour defective children throughout England and Wales was studied. A list of occupations, jobs and careers which are likely to cause difficulty to the colour defective are presented. Finally recommendations concerning colour vision testing in industry are given...|$|E

Results were analysed using the colour difference vector technique of Vingrys and King-Smith (Vingrys & King-Smith 1988). Vector analysis yields three indices {{which can be used}} to quantify a cap arrangement: the C-index (severity), the S-Index (polarity) and the angle (axis). ROC analysis was performed on the C-index in order to identify the optimum fail criterion for each test. Our data indicate that the efficiencies of the panel tests (D- 15 = 1. 63, desat D- 15 = 1. 67 and FM 100 -hue = 1. 72) are much poorer than the Ishihara plate test efficiency (1. 98) for screening defects of <b>colour</b> <b>vision,</b> indicating that panels need to be supplemented with plate tests in screening protocols. Bayesian probabilities indicate that panel tests are successful in detecting <b>colour</b> <b>defective</b> <b>vision</b> (Pr {defective given fail at criterion} ≥ 0. 99) when a C-index of 2. 0 is used on the D- 15 panel, 3. 0 on the desaturated D- 15 panel and 2. 2 on the FM 100 -hue test; at these criteria all panels have an equal probability of predicting normal vision (0. 99). We conclude that none of the panels is adequate for screening congenital <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> defects but that the desaturated D- 15 panel test is the best clinical test since it gives the highest efficiency for the shortest test tim...|$|R
40|$|<b>Colour</b> <b>vision</b> in {{the marine}} {{environment}} is on average simpler than in terrestrial environments with simple or no <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> through monochromacy or dichromacy.

40|$|<b>Colour</b> <b>vision</b> allows {{animals to}} {{reliably}} distinguish {{differences in the}} distributions of spectral energies reaching the eye.

Within that constraint, however, the utilization of these basic elements varies in striking ways in that they appear, disappear and emerge in altered form during the course of evolution.

40|$|AbstractClinicians {{usually do}} not have access to a lantern test when making an {{occupational}} assessment of the ability of a person with <b>defective</b> <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> to recognise signal light colours: they must rely on the results of ordinary clinical tests. While all colour vision defectives fail the Holmes Wright TypeB lantern test and most fail the Holmes Wright TypeA lantern, 35 % of colour vision defectives pass the Farnsworth lantern. Can clinical tests predict who will pass and fail the Farnsworth lantern? We find that a pass (less than two or more diametrical crossings) at the Farnsworth Panel D 15 Dichotomous test has a sensitivity of 0. 67 and specificity of 0. 94 in predicting a pass or fail at the Farnsworth lantern test; a Nagel range of > 10 has a sensitivity of 0. 87 and a specificity of 0. 57.

40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} the phenotype of a three generation consanguineous Pakistani family containing six individuals with autosomal recessive cone dystrophy caused by mutation in GNAT 2. METHODS: Five {{of the six}} affected individuals underwent an ophthalmological examination, electrodiagnostic testing, fundus photography, autofluorescence imaging, and detailed psychophysical testing. RESULTS: All five examined patients {{had a history of}} nystagmus from infancy, photophobia, <b>defective</b> <b>colour</b> <b>vision,</b> and poor visual acuity. The nystagmus in three of the individuals had lessened with time. Fundus examination revealed an abnormal foveal appearance, without frank atrophy or pigmentation. Electroretinography (ERG) revealed absent ISCEV cone flicker ERGs with some preservation of responses to short wavelength stimulation. Rod ERGs showed no definite abnormality, but maximal (mixed rod-cone) response a-wave amplitudes were mildly subnormal. Rudimentary residual colour vision was detected in three individuals. There is clinical evidence of progressive visual acuity reduction in two older individuals. CONCLUSION: Mutation in the alpha-subunit of cone specific transducin (GNAT 2) is characterised by an infantile onset cone dystrophy.

40|$|Daily {{experience}} {{shows that}} colour  {{of a very}} distant object cannot be accurately determined.   It is assumed that visual acuity (VA) loss {{is one of the}} factors at play in this case.   The effects of reduced VA as a result of refractive error or optical defocus on <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> have not been examined.   Such study will dictate the need or otherwise for optical correction before assessment of <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b>   The purpose of this study therefore, was to investigate the effects of optical defocus on <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> in individuals with normal <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b>   Twenty nine young adult subjects (11 male and 18 females) were included in this study. Their ages ranged from 11 to 29 years with a mean of 22. 1 ± 3. 4 years.   All subjects had VA of 6 / 6 or better and normal <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b>   The <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> was evaluated with the Farnsworth panel D- 15 (desaturated). Each subject was optically defocused to VA of 6 / 24, 6 / 60 and 1 / 60 (6 / 360) at 6 meters respectively and <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> was assessed at each reduced VA.   At VA of 6 / 24, <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> was not affected in all subjects. When the VA was reduced to 6 / 60, however, 15 (51 %) of the subjects failed the <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> test. When the VA was further reduced to 1 / 60 by optical defocus, 24 (83 %) of the subjects failed the <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> test.   It was concluded that optical defocus and reduced VA can adversely affect <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> test findings. While VA reduction to 6 / 24 may not affect the <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> results, VA of 6 / 60 can.   It is therefore, recommended that in clinical colour vision  testing and <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> screening, VA should first be assessed andcompensated, especially if uncorrected VA is 6 / 24 or worse.    <br /...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} loss of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> {{related to}} exposure to solvents {{and the role}} of three enzyme polymorphisms in modifying the risk in exposed workers.  METHODS—A sample was studied of 68  male dockyard workers and 42  male community controls with and without neuropsychological symptoms from a previous cross sectional study. Indices of cumulative and intensity based exposure to solvents were calculated for all subjects. Alcohol, drug, and smoking histories were obtained. <b>Colour</b> <b>vision</b> was tested by Lanthony D 15 d <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> test. Genotype of glutathione S-transferase M 1 and T 1 and N-acetyltransferase 2  polymorphisms were determined.  RESULTS—The relation between impairment of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> and exposure to solvents was investigated with multiple regression techniques. Increasing annual exposure to solvents was significantly associated with reduced <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> (p= 0. 029). Impairment of <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> was not associated with neuropsychological symptoms as measured by the Q 16 solvent symptom questionnaire.

Twelve patients satisfactorily completed the test with the affected eye at presentation. This number had increased to 23 by 6 weeks and to 27 by 6 months. No patient with a visual acuity of LogMAR 0. 86 (Snellen equivalent approx 6 / 43) or worse, could complete the test. The mean total error score of affected eyes showed significant improvement at each subsequent examination but was always worse than the non-affected eyes. There was a significant correlation between total error scores and visual acuities of affected eyes at presentation and after 6 months. Fourteen patients recovered a visual acuity of LogMAR 0. 0 (Snellen equivalent 6 / 6) or better but the total error scores of the affected eyes were significantly worse than the non-affected eyes (p = 0. 017), indicating that <b>defective</b> <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> is an indicator of a previous episode of DON despite the recovery of normal visual acuity. DON is reported to produce a red-green (Type II) axis of colour defect but individual F-M 100 polar diagrams were usually generally abnormal and did not show any predominance of recognisable axis of colour defect at any examination.

40|$|In recent years, <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> {{abilities}} {{have been}} rather generously awarded to vari-ous invertebrates and even bacteria. This uncertainty of when to diagnose colour vi-sion stems {{in part from}} confusing what <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> can do with what it is. What col-our vision can do is discriminate wavelength independent of intensity. However, if we take this as a definition of what <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> is, then we might indeed be obliged to conclude that some plants and bacteria have <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b> Moreover, there is a simi-lar confusion of what are necessary and what are sufficient mechanisms and behav-ioural abilities for <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b> To humans, seeing in colour means seeing an image in which objects/lights have chromatic attributes - {{in contrast to the}} sensation that we have when viewing monochrome movies, or our experience in dim light when only rod vision is possible. The necessary basic equipment for this is to have at least two types of photoreceptors that differ in spectral sensitivity, and at least one type of spectrally opponent cell to compare the signals from the photoreceptors. Clearly, however, a necessary additional prerequisite for <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> is to have vision, which entails the identification of shapes, sizes and locations of objects in the world. Thus if an animal has <b>colour</b> <b>vision,</b> it should see an image in which distinct objects/lights have colour attributes.

Whilst most studies to date have examined the functional relevance of polymorphic <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> in the context of foraging behaviour, alternative hypotheses proposed to explain the polymorphism have remained unexplored. In this study we examine <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> polymorphism, social group composition and breeding success in wild red-bellied tamarins Saguinus labiatus. We find that the association of males and females within tamarin social groups is non-random with respect to <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> genotype, with identified mating partners having the greatest allelic diversity. The observed distribution of alleles may be driven by inbreeding avoidance and implies an important new mechanism for maintaining <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> polymorphism. This study also provides the first preliminary evidence that wild trichromatic females may have increased fitness compared with dichromatic counterparts, as measured by breeding success and longevity...|$|R
40|$|Over {{a century}} ago workers such as J. Lubbock and K. von Frisch {{developed}} behavioural criteria for establishing that non-human animals see colour. Many animals in most phyla have since then {{been shown to have}} <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b> <b>Colour</b> is used for specific behaviours, such as phototaxis and object recognition, while other behaviours such as motion detection are colour blind. Having established the existence of <b>colour</b> <b>vision,</b> research focussed on the question of how many spectral types of photoreceptors are involved. Recently, data on photoreceptor spectral sensitivities have been combined with behavioural experiments and physiological models to study systematically the next logical question: `what neural interactions underlie <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> ?`This review gives an overview of the methods used to study animal <b>colour</b> <b>vision,</b> and discusses how quantitative modelling can suggest how photoreceptor signals are combined and compared to allow for the discrimination of biologically relevant stimuli...|$|R
