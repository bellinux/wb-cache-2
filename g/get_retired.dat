40|$|Objective: Our {{aim was to}} {{describe}} a patient with psychogenic movement disorder (PMD) who presented with tremor dominant involuntary movements, {{as well as to}} emphasize the clinical features important for establishing a correct diagnosis. Case-Report: A 48 -year-old man presented to our outpatient neurology clinic with gait and speech disturbance. He had jerky, tremor-like involuntary movements occurring during gait, voluntary movements and/or at rest. He was unemployed, willing to <b>get</b> <b>retired</b> as a disabled veteran. Neurological examination was normal except for involuntary movements. Psychiatric consultation revealed depressed mood, anhedonia, anxiety, irritability, impulsivity, insomnia, problems in interpersonal relations and sexual dysfunction. He was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and factitious disorder and was considered as having PMD. The involuntary movements of the patient, who benefited from risperidone treatment and supportive interviews, substantially disappeared. Discussion: Since PMDs are complex disorders, a multidisciplinary approach with cooperation of neurologist and psychiatrist is needed for proper diagnoses and treatment.

40|$|Distributed Energy Resource (DER) {{has been}} {{touted as a}} clean and {{efficient}} way to generate electricity at end-use sites, potentially allowing the exhaust heat {{to be put to}} good use as well. However, despite its environmental acceptability compared to many other types of generation, it has faced some disapproval because it may displace other, cleaner generation technologies. The end result could be more pollution than if the DER were not deployed. On the other hand, the DER may be competing against older power plants. If the DER is built then these other plants may be retired sooner, reducing their emissions. Or it may be that DER does not directly compete against either new or old plant capacity at the decision-maker level, and increased DER simply reduces the amount of time various plants operate. The key factor is what gets displaced if DER is added. For every kWh made by DER a kWh (or more with losses) of other production is not made. If enough DER is created, some power plants will <b>get</b> <b>retired</b> or not get built so not only their production but their capacity is displaced. Various characteristics of the power system in a region will influence how DER impacts the operation of the grid. The growth in demand in the region may influence whether new plants are postponed or old plants retired. The generation mix, including the fuel types, efficiencies, and emission characteristics of the plants in the region will factor into the overall competition. And public policies such as ease of new construction, emissions regulations, and fuel availability will also come into consideration...|$|E

This paper describes the problems that were encountered while migrating the data from the old databases of SAA to the new database designed for the iKnow application. The problems were resolved using the well-known solutions typical for an ETL process, since data migration can be considered as a type of ETL process.
