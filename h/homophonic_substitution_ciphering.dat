40|$|<b>Homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> {{employ a}} one-to-many key to encrypt plaintext. This is in {{contrast}} to a simple <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> where a one-to-one mapping is used. The advantage of a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> is that it makes frequency analysis more difficult, due to a more even distribution of plaintext statistics. Classic transposition ciphers apply diffusion to the ciphertext by swapping the order of letters. Combined transposition-substitution ciphers can be more challenging to cryptanalyze than either cipher type separately. In this research, we propose a technique to break a combined simple substitution- column transposition cipher. We also consider the related problem of breaking a combination homophonic substitution-column transposition cipher. These attacks extend previous work on <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers.</b> We thoroughly analyze our attacks and we apply the homophonic substitution-columnar transposition attack to the unsolved Zodiac- 340 cipher...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{example of}} the <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> is the one used by Duke of Mantua in the early 1400s. Homophonic cipher replaces each letter with multiple symbols depending on the letter frequency. The cipher is ahead of the time because it combines monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic features.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with random restarts as a mean of breaking a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b> Based on extensive experiments, we find that such an HMM-based attack outperforms a previously de- veloped nested hill climb approach, particularly when the ciphertext message is short. We then consider a combination cipher, consisting of a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> and a column transposition. We develop and analyze an attack on such a cipher. This attack employs an HMM (with random restarts), together with a hill climb to recover the column permutation. We show that this attack can succeed on relatively short ci- phertext messages. Finally, we test this combined attack on the unsolved Zodiac 340 cipher...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} utility and effect of running {{numerous}} random restarts when using EM to attack decipherment problems. We find that simple decipherment models {{are able to}} crack <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> with high accuracy if {{a large number of}} random restarts are used but almost completely fail with only a few random restarts. For particularly difficult homophonic ciphers, we find that big gains in accuracy are to be had by running upwards of 100 K random restarts, which we accomplish efficiently using a GPU-based parallel implementation. We run a series of experiments using millions of random restarts in order to investigate other empirical properties of decipherment problems, including the famously uncracked Zodiac 340. ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{can have}} problems; if a word {{appears in the}} {{plaintext}} {{but not in the}} book, it cannot be encoded. An alternative approach which gets around this problem is to replace individual letters rather than words. One such method, used in the second Beale cipher, substitutes the first letter of a word in the book with that word's position. In this case, the book cipher is properly a cipher [...] - [...] specifically, a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b> However, if used often, this technique has the side effect of creating a larger ciphertext (typically 4 to 6 digits being required to encipher each letter or syllable) and increases the time and effort required to decode the message.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} two improve-ments to the beam search {{approach}} for solving <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> presented in Nuhn et al. (2013) : An im-proved rest cost estimation {{together with an}} optimized strategy for obtaining the or-der in which the symbols of the cipher are deciphered reduces the beam size needed to successfully decipher the Zodiac- 408 cipher from several million down to less than one hundred: The search effort is re-duced from several hours of computation time {{to just a few}} seconds on a single CPU. These improvements allow us to success-fully decipher {{the second part of the}} fa-mous Beale cipher (see (Ward et al., 1885) and e. g. (King, 1993)) : Having 182 differ-ent cipher symbols while having a length of just 762 symbols, the decipherment is way more challenging than the decipher-ment of the previously deciphered Zodiac- 408 cipher (length 408, 54 different sym-bols). To the best of our knowledge, this cipher has not been deciphered automati-cally before. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel Bayesian approach for deciphering complex <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers.</b> Our method uses a decipherment model which combines information from letter n-gram language models {{as well as}} word dictionaries. Bayesian inference is performed on our model using an efficient sampling technique. We evaluate {{the quality of the}} Bayesian decipherment output on simple and <b>homophonic</b> letter <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> and show that unlike a previous approach, our method consistently produces almost 100 % accurate decipherments. The new method can be applied on more complex <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> and we demonstrate its utility by cracking the famous Zodiac- 408 cipher in a fully automated fashion, which has never been done before. ...|$|R
40|$|According to {{historical}} reports, many telegrams that {{date from the}} Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939) still remain undisclosed. It is believed that these telegrams were encrypted with a cryptosystem called the "Spanish Strip Cipher" (SSC). During this civil war, SSC was the most used cryptographic algorithm. This method corresponds to a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> in which a plaintext letter can map to between three and five ciphertext symbols. By means of cryptanalysis, the authors detect a weakness in the encryption process of the SSC. In this article, they describe how this vulnerability is exploited to efficiently reconstruct a plaintext from a relatively short ciphertext. The attack is based on combinatorial and statistical methods, and it {{is divided into three}} phases: homophones-table analysis, letter-frequency analysis, and dictionary search. The attack was implemented in Java and tested on a laptop with an i 7 processor and 4 GB of RAM. The tests were carried out with several real telegrams from the Spanish Civil War.

40|$|Computers have {{advanced}} to the stage that an inexpensive personal computer can perform millions of arithmetic calculations {{in less than a}} second. However, given such powerful machines, several mysteries have still remained unsolved due to their complexity. The Zodiac 340 -letter cipher is one such mystery [1]. Zodiac, the serial killer who terrorized Northern California in the late 1960 s, sent four ciphers to local newspapers [2]. The first cipher was separated into three different parts and each part was sent to Vallejo Times-Herald, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the San Francisco Examiner. The combination of all three parts formed a 408 -letter cipher (Z 408), which was decrypted one week after it was received [1, 2]. Zodiac also sent a 340 -letter cipher (Z 340) that remains unsolved to this day. The main purpose of this project is to determine whether the method used in the Z 340 was a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution,</b> which is an improved version of the well-known simple <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b> A <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution</b> employs a “one-to-many mapping” technique, as opposed to the one-to-one mapping of a simple substitution [3].

50|$|Because both ciphers classically {{employed}} novels as part {{of their}} key material, many sources confuse the book cipher and the running key cipher. They are really only very distantly related. The running key cipher is a polyalphabetic <b>substitution,</b> the book <b>cipher</b> is a <b>homophonic</b> <b>substitution.</b> Perhaps the distinction is most clearly made by the fact that a running cipher would work best of all with a book of random numbers, whereas such a book (containing no text) would be useless for a book cipher.|$|R

In some cases it is desired, that message stays secret, while in some other cases it is required to be revealed.
