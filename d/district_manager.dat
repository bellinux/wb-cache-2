25|$|The Devils Garden is {{also known}} as a Wilderness Study Area for the purpose of {{possible}} wilderness designation; however, wilderness status was not recommended by the BLM's <b>District</b> <b>Manager</b> in an Instant Study Area report submitted to the U.S. Congress in 1991. One of the stated reasons was that the existing roads, parking lot, picnic tables and toilet facilities are all in close proximity to the natural area. A second reason was the likelihood of several groups of people converging at the same time around the main formations of the site, which are located in a 10-acre area adjacent to the parking lot (1.6% of the total designated area of 640 acres). Both of those reasons diminish the wilderness experience of solitude in a remote natural setting.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of turning a profit on a single-screen theater in the age of multiplex cinemas, Landmark Theatres Corp. let its lease expire in September 1992. As owner of the building 20th Century Theaters sought to continue independent films at the Majestic and installed their <b>district</b> <b>manager</b> Jerry Fladen to oversee operations. The city of Madison designated the building a historic landmark in 1995, but its infamously uncomfortable seats and substandard sound did little to encourage attendance. The theater also suffered from its antiquated design, with a tiny lobby and concessions area, plus the only restrooms were in the balcony. Because the auditorium was never designed for movies, the pictures were difficult to keep in focus projected from such a steep angle. Ironically the widening popularity of independent films may have doomed the theater, with the Majestic no longer holding a monopoly on the art house films that were also shown regularly at the multi-screened Hilldale and Westgate Cinemas. As attendance declined, the union projectionists stopped working there so Fladen could save on expenses.|$|E

In 1983, her parents relocated to Los Angeles, California, where Norwood was schooled at the Hollywood High Performing Arts Center. Norwood's interest in music and performing increased after becoming a fan of singer Whitney Houston at the age of seven, but at school, she experienced trouble with persuading teachers to send her on auditions as she found no support among the staff.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Health {{facility}} stock-outs of life saving malaria medicines {{are common}} across Africa. Innovative ways of addressing this problem are urgently required. We evaluated whether SMS based reporting of stocks of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) {{can result in}} reduction of stock-outs at peripheral facilities in Kenya. METHODS/FINDINGS: All 87 public health facilities in five Kenyan districts were included in a 26 week project. Weekly facility stock counts of four AL packs and RDTs were sent via structured incentivized SMS communication process from health workers' personal mobile phones to a web-based system accessed by <b>district</b> <b>managers.</b> The mean health facility response rate was 97 % with a mean formatting error rate of 3 %. Accuracy of stock count reports was 79 % while accuracy of stock-out reports was 93 %. <b>District</b> <b>managers</b> accessed the system 1, 037 times {{at an average of}} eight times per week. The system was accessed in 82 % of the study weeks. Comparing weeks 1 and 26, stock-out of one or more AL packs declined by 38 percentage-points. Total AL stock-out declined by 5 percentage-points and was eliminated {{by the end of the}} project. Stock-out declines of individual AL packs ranged from 14 to 32 percentage-points while decline in RDT stock-outs was 24 percentage-points. <b>District</b> <b>managers</b> responded to 44 % of AL and 73 % of RDT stock-out signals by redistributing commodities between facilities. In comparison with national trends, stock-out declines in study areas were greater, sharper and more sustained. CONCLUSIONS: Use of simple SMS technology ensured high reporting rates of reasonably accurate, real-time facility stock data that were used by <b>district</b> <b>managers</b> to undertake corrective actions to reduce stock-outs. Future work on stock monitoring via SMS should focus on assessing response rates without use of incentives and demonstrating effectiveness of such interventions on a larger scale...|$|R
40|$|Background: Supportive {{supervision}} {{is a way}} {{to foster}} performance, productivity, motivation, and retention of health workforce. Nevertheless there is a dearth of evidence of the impact and acceptability of supportive supervision in low- and middle-income countries. This article describes a participatory process of transforming the supervisory practice of <b>district</b> health <b>managers</b> to create a supportive environment for primary healthcare workers. Objective: The objective {{of the study was to}} explore how <b>district</b> health <b>managers</b> can change their practice to create a more supportive environment for primary healthcare providers. Design: A facilitated co-operative inquiry group (CIG) was formed with Ngamiland health <b>district</b> <b>managers.</b> CIG belongs to the participatory action research paradigm and is characterised by a cyclic process of observation, reflection, planning, and action. The CIG went through three cycles between March 2013 and March 2014. Results: Twelve <b>district</b> health <b>managers</b> participated in the inquiry group. The major insights and learning that emerged from the inquiry process included inadequate supervisory practice, perceptions of healthcare workers’ experiences, change in the managers’ supervision paradigm, recognition of the supervisors’ inadequate supervisory skills, and barriers to supportive supervision. Finally, the group developed a 10 -point consensus on what they had learnt regarding supportive supervision. Conclusion: Ngamiland health <b>district</b> <b>managers</b> have come to appreciate the value of supportive supervision and changed their management style to be more supportive of their subordinates. They also developed a consensus on supportive supervision that could be adapted for use nationally. Supportive supervision should be prioritised at all levels of the health system, and it should be adequately resourced...|$|R

2500|$|The {{emergence}} of the new organizational strategies {{can be seen in}} the politics of Connecticut around 1806, which have been well documented by Cunningham. The Federalists dominated Connecticut, so the Republicans had to work harder to win. In 1806, the state leadership sent town leaders instructions for the forthcoming elections. Every town manager was told by state leaders [...] "to appoint a <b>district</b> <b>manager</b> in each district or section of his town, obtaining from each an assurance that he will faithfully do his duty". Then the town manager was instructed to compile lists and total the number of taxpayers and the number of eligible voters, find out how many favored the Republicans and how many the Federalists and to count the number of supporters of each party who were not eligible to vote but who might qualify (by age or taxes) at the next election. These highly detailed returns were to be sent to the county manager and in turn were compiled and sent to the state manager. Using these lists of potential voters, the managers were told to get all eligible people to town meetings and help the young men qualify to vote. The state manager was responsible for supplying party newspapers to each town for distribution by town and district managers. This highly coordinated [...] "get-out-the-vote" [...] drive would be familiar to modern political campaigners, but was the first of its kind in world history.|$|E
