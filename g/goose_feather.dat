2500|$|In 2004, {{actor and}} film {{director}} Ljubiša Samardžić recorded the film <b>Goose</b> <b>Feather</b> (originally known as Jesen stiže, dunjo moja), {{based on the}} ballad [...] "Priča o Vasi Ladačkom". The movie should have been recorded in cooperation between Samardžić and Balašević, however, the cooperation was not agreed. Balašević released the songs {{that should have been}} the soundtrack for the film on the album Rani mraz. The album's subtitle was Priča o Vasi Ladačkom.../Muzika iz nesnimljenog filma (Story of Vasa Ladački.../Music from the Film that was not Filmed). The album featured folk rock sound similar to the one on Na posletku.... The album featured rerecorded [...] "Priča o Vasi Ladačkom" [...] and the instrumental track based on it, [...] "Pričica o Vasi L." [...] ("Short Story about Vasa L."). The album also featured the song [...] "Maliganska", which Balašević wrote {{at the beginning of his}} career and unsuccessfully offered to Zvonko Bogdan, and which was previously released by pop rock/folk rock band Apsolutno Romantično under the title Đoletova pesma (Đole's Song). The album, beside old associates, featured Zoran and Pera Alvirović (of Apsolutno Romantično), Andrej Maglovski (accordion), Stevan Mošo (prim), Beni Ćibri (double bass), Agota Vitkai Kučera (soprano), St. George Choir, and others.|$|E

60|$|Then Robin {{took his}} good yew bow in his hand, and placing the tip at his instep, he strung it right deftly; then he nocked a broad clothyard arrow and, raising the bow, drew the gray <b>goose</b> <b>feather</b> to his ear; {{the next moment}} the bowstring rang and the arrow sped down the glade as a {{sparrowhawk}} skims in a northern wind. High leaped the noblest hart of all the herd, only to fall dead, reddening the green path with his heart's blood.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase [...] "goose bumps" [...] {{derives from}} the phenomenon's {{association}} with <b>goose</b> skin. <b>Goose</b> <b>feathers</b> grow from stores in the epidermis which resemble human hair follicles. When a <b>goose's</b> <b>feathers</b> are plucked, its skin has protrusions where the feathers were, and these bumps are what the human phenomenon resembles.|$|R

6000|$|Then Stutely {{arose from}} where he was lying. [...] "A plague of such ill luck!" [...] quoth he. [...] "Here have we abided all day, and no bird worth the shooting, so to speak, hath come within reach of our bolt. Had I gone forth on an {{innocent}} errand, I had met a dozen stout priests or a score of pursy money-lenders.

Verily, some eight or ten years ago I left thee a {{stripling}} lad, with great joints and ill-hung limbs, and lo! here thou art, as tight a fellow as e'er I set mine eyes upon. Dost thou not remember, lad, how I showed thee {{the proper way to}} nip the <b>goose</b> <b>feather</b> betwixt thy fingers and throw out thy bow arm steadily?

However, tossed about as I am, if I choose (and who would not choose) to bind down with the crampets of attention the brazen foundation of integrity, I may rear up the superstructure of Independence, and from its daring turrets bid defiance to the storms of fate.

40|$|YEAR: 2008 ROLE: Performer FORMAT: Live Art Event at Tiananmen Square Beijing, China (3 hours) and Later on Summit of Mt. Tai Shan, Shandong Province, China (6 hrs + 3 hrs). WITH: Solo WHAT: In the Hall of Reverence on Tiananmen Square, Beijing Mao Zedong's body lies {{in state}} {{surrounded}} by flowers and draped with a Red Flag of Communist China. His casket {{with a glass}} top lies on a black stone from Mt. Tai, reflecting the quotation from Sima Qian (China's Han Dynasty historian) that "One's life can be weightier than Mt. Tai or lighter than a goose feather". This pair of performances were a quiet, personal reflection upon what such a once revolutionary expression might mean in today's very different time and place. The work was conceived during the Olympic Cultural Festival showing of Intimate Transactions (www. intimatetransactions. com) - during the tumultuous times leading up to China's proudly staged August 2008 Olympics. The rise and rise of China had long been generating major geopolitical, ecological and cross-cultural shifts throughout the region and beyond. In this dramatic epicentre of change {{and at a time}} of such great national pride, how might we each act in ways that are ecologically 'mighty' and yet simultaneously have an impact lighter than a goosefeather? This is both a question for China in its relations with the autonomous provinces and the environment as it is for all of us in our own 'local' affairs. However ecologically speaking all that is of local concern is of global concern and noone can therefore be exempt from the need to sustain that which we share in common and must all protect for the future. Performance 1 : Tiananmen Square, Beijing: Dropping 100 <b>goose</b> <b>feathers.</b> Performance 2 : The summit of Mt Tai, Shandong Province. Building a mountain from <b>Goose</b> <b>Feathers.</b> SHOWING HISTORY: 1 : Anniversary of Protest Crackdown, Jun 8 th 2008. 2 : Dawn on Tai Shan's summit, 15 th June, 2008 DETAILS: Performance 1 : Begin an hour after dawn (5. 45 am) in Tiananmen Square Bring pre-prepared performance shirt, a bag of <b>goose</b> <b>feathers</b> tipped with red. Begin at the "Gate of Heavenly Peace" under the image of Chairman Mao. Circumnavigate the world's largest open and the most surveilled public space 5 times dropping feathers periodically. Meditate on Forces of Change. Finally enter Chairman Mao's mausoleum with the masses and move quietly past his preserved body. End the performance at the Gate of Heavenly Peace 3 hours later. Performance 2 : Walk up Mt. Tai Shan in silence meditating on Forces of Change (6 hours). Stay overnight on the summit. Begin an hour before dawn (3. 45 am) in silence. Bring performance shirt, a sack of <b>goose</b> <b>feathers</b> and a simple wooden structure. On the sunrise viewing side of the mountain build a miniature, fragile 'mountain' in <b>goose</b> <b>feathers</b> and sticks {{on the edge of a}} sheer precipice. Watch the sun rise as the feathers blow away into the valley deep below (3 hours) ...|$|R
5|$|Artificial trees made of <b>goose</b> <b>feathers</b> were {{in use in}} American homes {{since the}} 1880s.

60|$|Nought spake the {{stranger}} but took his place, while all was hushed, {{and no one}} spoke or even seemed to breathe, so great was the silence for wonder what he would do. Meanwhile, also, quite still stood {{the stranger}}, holding his bow in his hand, while one could count five; then he drew his trusty yew, holding it drawn but a moment, then loosed the string. Straight flew the arrow, and so true that it smote a gray <b>goose</b> <b>feather</b> from off Gilbert's shaft, which fell fluttering through the sunlit air as the stranger's arrow lodged close beside his of the Red Cap, and in the very center. No one spoke a word {{for a while and}} no one shouted, but each man looked into his neighbor's face amazedly.|$|E
6000|$|And now it {{was well}} for that yeoman that a tree stood nigh him beside the road, else had he had an ill chance of it. Ere one could say [...] "Gaffer Downthedale" [...] the hounds were upon him, and he had only time to drop his sword and leap lightly into the tree, around which the hounds gathered, {{looking up at him}} as though he were a cat on the eaves. But the Friar quickly called off his dogs. [...] "At 'em!" [...] cried he, {{pointing}} down the road to where the yeomen were standing stock still with wonder of what they saw. As the hawk darts down upon its quarry, so sped the four dogs at the yeomen; but when the four men saw the hounds so coming, all with one accord, saving only Will Scarlet, drew each man his <b>goose</b> <b>feather</b> to his ear and let fly his shaft.|$|E
60|$|At {{these words}} the Sheriff's men stood {{as still as}} stocks, for they knew right well that Little John would {{be as good as}} his word, and that to disobey him meant death. In vain the Sheriff roared at them, calling them cowards, and urging them forward in a body; they would not budge an inch, but stood and watched Little John as he moved slowly away toward the forest, keeping his gaze fixed upon them. But when the Sheriff saw his enemy thus {{slipping}} betwixt his fingers he grew mad with his rage, so that his head swam and he knew not what he did. Then of a sudden he turned his horse's head, and plunging his spurs into its sides he gave a great shout, and, rising in his stirrups, came down upon Little John like the wind. Then Little John raised his deadly bow and drew the gray <b>goose</b> <b>feather</b> to his cheek. But alas for him! For, ere he could loose the shaft, the good bow that had served him so long, split in his hands, and the arrow fell harmless at his feet. Seeing what had happened, the Sheriff's men raised a shout, and, following their master, came rushing down upon Little John. But the Sheriff was ahead of the others, and so caught up with the yeoman before he reached the shelter of the woodlands, then leaning forward he struck a mighty blow. Little John ducked and the Sheriff's sword turned in his hand, but the flat of the blade struck the other upon the head and smote him down, stunned and senseless.|$|E
