The paper {{presents}} {{the influence of}} the grain size and a little higher Cr content on the kinetics of austenite phase transformations during continuous cooling of hypo-eutectoid steel. The kinetics of austenite phase transformations during continuous cooling were determined by means of analysis of the <b>dilatometric</b> <b>curves</b> and structure investigations. The influence of the austenite grain size and the higher Cr content was analysed in two hypo-eutectoid steels containing about 0. 4 % C. One of them had, Cr content higher, by about 1 %. In both steels, the austenite grain size was changing insignificantly up to the austenitising temperature of about 950 fl. Above that temperature, the austenite grain size in carbon steel grew much quicker than that in the steel with Cr addition. The austenite grain in the Cr enriched steel was smaller than that in carbon steel and, in spite of that, the duration of cooled austenite transformations were several times longer. This means that the phase transformations are much more strongly influenced by the addition of chromium slowing down carbon diffusion in austenite, than by the austenite grain size. For each phase transformation in the examined steels, the activation energy of the transformation has been determined. The activation energy of all the phase transformations varied slightly with the increase of austenitising temperature. On the basis of the obtained results, curves of true isothermal transformations have been developed for the beginning of the phase transformations in both steels, related to infinitely quick cooling down to the transformation temperature...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence of heating rate and initial microstructure on the anisothermal formation of austenite. In this sense, the start (Ac 1) and finish (Ac 3) temperatures of austenite formation have been determined on <b>dilatometric</b> <b>curves</b> obtained at various heating rates in steels with ferrite and/or pearlite initial microstructures. As it was expected, Ac 1 and Ac 3 temperatures rises linearly with heating rate, except for steels with a pure ferrite initial microstructure where the Ac 1 temperature is almost insensitive to heating rate over the range studied. Experimental results in steels with a pearlite and ferrite-pearlite initial microstructures also show that the elevation of the critical temperatures with heating rate is quite sensitive to the morphology of pearlite. It seems that the higher the heating rate is, the stronger the influence of morphology on the critical temperatures are. This experimental study and {{the knowledge of the}} mechanisms that control the austenite formation process have allowed to establish the variables that most directly influence this reaction in steels with pearlite and ferrite-pearlite initial microstructures. Those are the heating rate and the two parameters that characterise the morphology of pearlite, the mean true interlamellar spacing and the edge length of the pearlite colonies interface in pearlitic steels, together with the volume fraction of pearlite and the mean free distance of pearlite in ferrite plus pearlite initial microstructures. Likewise, two equations have been proposed for the determination of the start (Ac 1) and (Ac 3) finish temperatures of austenite formation as a function of those variables. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|URL] {{audience}} 2 raw clays {{samples from}} Burkina Faso were analyzed {{in order to}} improve the ceramic process of roof tiles and small bricks manifacture. The major phases etected by X-ray diffraction in the 2 samples are kaolinite, illite, orthose and quartz. In addition, feeble quantities of albite and montmorillonite are also detected. The thermal behavior between 25 °C and 1100 °C studied by DTA and DTG is mainly explained by the individual role of clay minerals in studied samples. The sintering of clay ceramics at 1100 °C was characterized by dilatometry. In general, <b>dilatometric</b> <b>curves</b> shapes are characterized by successive stages of strain and/or densification in specific temperature ranges. The extend of the observed phenomena is mainly related to the clay mineral fraction in samples. It evidences that clay mineral have a critical role in the sintering of ceramic. A useful application of the terra cotta is found with roof tiles manufacture which imbibition rate and permeability during rain are connected with microstructure and porosity. The microstructure of sintered clays is studied by SEM and the open porosity and permeability are determined. In general, the distribution of size and open porosity appears to be similar in both materials and composite microstructures are evidenced with large grains embedded in a sintered clay matrix. But local heterogeneities are observed in one of the ceramics at interfaces between large grains and matrix phase. They are supposed to have an effective role in pore connectivity through the material. It confirms the importance of pore morphology and connectivity in ceramics, induced mostly by clay type and the sintering process...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{thermodynamic}} model of adsorption-induced deformation of microporous carbons. The model represents the carbon structure as a macroscopically isotropic disordered three-dimensional medium composed of stacks of slit-shaped pores {{of different sizes}} embedded in an incompressible amorphous matrix. Adsorption stress in pores is calculated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed model reproduces qualitatively the experimental nonmonotonic <b>dilatometric</b> deformation <b>curve</b> for argon adsorption on carbide-derived activated carbon at 243 K and pressure up to 1. 2 MPa. The elastic deformation (contraction at low pressures and swelling at higher pressures) results from the adsorption stress that depends strongly on the pore size. The pore size distribution determines {{the shape of the}} deformation curve, whereas the bulk modulus controls the extent of the sample deformation...|$|R
40|$|A {{model that}} {{describes}} the ferrite-austenite transformation during continuous heating in Armco iron and three very low carbon, low manganese steels with a fully ferritic initial microstructure is presented. This model allows calculation of the volume fractions of austenite and ferrite during transformation {{as a function of}} temperature, and hence knowledge of the austenite formation kinetics under non-isothermal conditions in fully ferritic steels. Moreover, since dilatometric analysis is a technique very often used to study phase transformations in steels, a second model, which describes the dilatometric behaviour of the material and calculates the relative change in length that occurs during the ferrite-austenite transformation, has also been developed. Both kinetics and dilatometric models have been validated by comparison of theoretical and experimental <b>dilatometric</b> heating <b>curves.</b> Predicted and experimental results are in satisfactory agreement.

40|$|Interaction {{of liquid}} copper with {{sintered}} iron {{is important in}} brazing, liquid phase sintering and infiltration. In brazing, the penetration of liquid copper into the pores is to be `avoided', whereas in infiltration processes it is `encouraged', and in liquid phase sintering it should be `controlled' so that optimum mechanical properties are achieved. The main objective of the research is to model the interaction by studying {{the effect of the}} process variables on the mechanisms of copper interaction in Fe-Cu and Fe-Cu-C systems. This involves both theoretical and experimental considerations. Dilatometric investigations at 950, 1125 and 1200 oC, together with metallographic analyses were carried out to clarify the copper growth phenomenon. It is shown that penetration of liquid copper into the iron grain boundaries is the major cause of dimensional changes. Infiltration profiles revealed that copper penetration between the iron interparticle contact points and along iron grain boundaries is a rapid process. The extent of copper penetration depends on the dihedral angle. Large dihedral angles hinder, and small angles promote copper penetration into the grain boundaries. Dihedral angle analysis shows that the addition of 0. 6 wt. % graphite reduces the number of zero dihedral angle from 27 to 3 o and increases the mean dihedral angle from 9. 8 to 41. 5 o. The dihedral angle was lowest at 1125 oC and then increased to higher values as the system approached its equilibrium condition. Elementally mixed (E. M.) Fe-Cu compacts showed a rapid expansion at the copper melting point. However, graphite additions reduced compact growth by increasing the mean dihedral angle. In order to reduce the copper growth phenomenon, iron powder was coated with a thin layer of copper by an immersion coating (I. C.) technique. The <b>dilatometric</b> <b>curves</b> revealed an overall shrinkage in the I. C. compacts compared to their corresponding E. M. compacts. Multiple regression models showed that temperature had the most effect on dimensional changes and density had the most contributing effect upon the copper penetration area in the infiltrated powder metallurgy compacts...|$|R
