40|$|The {{taxation}} {{of environmentally}} harmful inputs and activities {{is one of}} the most important environment-policy instruments, which is gaining in importance also in Austria considering the current share of environment-related taxes in the total tax revenue. According to a system of classification developed by the OECD and the EU, <b>environmental</b> <b>taxes</b> include <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>energy,</b> transport, <b>environmental</b> pollution and natural resources. To optimise the system of environment-related taxation, adequate allocation to the individual government levels is essential. Based on the general theory of fiscal federalism, relevant indications can be derived from the theory of environmental federalism, which deals especially with the distribution of competences in the field of environmental policy within the framework of federal structures.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{conditions}} under which a green tax reform not only benefits the environment but also enhances the efficiency of the tax system. The focus is on the consequences of international factor mobility for the scope of a double dividend. The investigation of the double-dividend claim is based on a general equilibrium model of a stylised small open economy. The simulations of equal-yield tax reform scenarios indicate that an <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> consumption yields a double dividend because the tax burden is partly shifted to transfer income, domestic capital or foreign labour. By contrast, with a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>energy</b> input the double-dividend claim fails, since the tax burden is mostly borne by domestic labour, resulting in an increase of the distortion in the labour market. ...|$|R

However, in 1992 it was replaced with a 50/50 carbon/energy <b>tax</b> called the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>on</b> Fuels, the <b>taxes</b> are assessed partly on carbon content and partly <b>on</b> <b>energy</b> content. The charge {{was transformed into a}} tax and became part of general tax revenues. As such, it fell under the administration of the Ministry of Finance. The general fuel <b>tax</b> is collected <b>on</b> all hydrocarbon fuels. Fuels used as raw materials are not subject to the tax. Tax rates are based 50/50 <b>on</b> the <b>energy</b> and carbon contents of fuels. In 1996 The Regulatory <b>Tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>Energy,</b> another 50/50 carbon/energy tax, was also implemented. The <b>Environmental</b> <b>tax</b> and the regulatory tax are 5.16 Dutch guilder, or NLG, (~$3.13) or per tonne of CO2 and 27.00 NLG (~16.40) per tonne CO2 respectively. Under the general fuel tax, electricity is not taxed, though fuels used to produce electricity are taxable. Energy-intensive industries used to benefit from preferential rates under this tax but the benefit was cancelled in January 1997. Also, since 1997 nuclear power has been taxed under the general fuel tax at the rate of NLG 31.95 per gram of uranium-235.38 The European Environment Agency put out an Executive Summary stating [...] "Although the 5th Environmental Action Programme of the EU in 1992 recommended the greater use of economic instruments such as <b>environmental</b> <b>taxes,</b> there has been little progress in their use since then at the EU level."

The research covers the local governments which are majorly affected by flood in Lagos state and copies of questionnaire were administered to the selected samples who are residents. The Spearman Rank Order Correlation which is a non-parametric test was used to measure the degree of association between the dependent and the independent variables. The findings revealed that there is a moderate positive correlation (Rs=. 398, p<. 005) between the imposition of <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> nylon packages and the reduction of flood and it is significant at 0. 01. The study concludes that the implementation of <b>environmental</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> nylon packaging companies will lead to a reduction in the use of nylon as the major packaging system in Nigeria. The study therefore recommends that there should be a change in the packaging system in Nigeria as most of our products are made by nylon.

40|$|In recent years, the {{accumulated}} environmental problems resulting from excessive usage {{of fossil fuels}} have gradually loomed. Thus, an <b>environmental</b> <b>tax,</b> as an important policy tool, {{has been put on}} the agenda in China. In this paper, a dynamic recursive multi-sector Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is applied to explore the impacts of the <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> China’s economy. To comprehensively analyze the impacts, we introduce four kinds of typical contaminants and set two kinds of scenarios: different tax rates and different tax refunds. The results show that the <b>environmental</b> <b>tax</b> is conducive to environmental improvement, but the economic variables are adversely affected, for example, the loss of GDP at the low level tax rate is 0. 46 %. In order to offset the negative impacts, we presume the government refunds the tax. The results show that this can indeed relieve the negative effects. When the government refunds the production tax and corporate income tax, 0. 49 % and 0. 34 % of GDP is relieved by respectively.

40|$|Environmentally-motivated <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>energy</b> {{products}} can effectively induce households and firms {{to take into}} account the environmental externalities of energy transformation and use. The levy of such taxes is, however, often hampered by public concerns over possible distributional effects. This paper analyses the macroeconomic relationship between <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>energy</b> products and income inequality. It also investigates whether this relationship is different in cases where explicit mechanisms to shift tax burden from labour and income to environmentally harmful activities have been established. In contrast to earlier empirical studies which analyse the distributional effects of <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the uses of household income, this paper focuses on their macroeconomic relationship with income sources. Using a panel of 34 OECD countries from 1995 to 2011, the paper shows that in the absence of explicit tax revenue recycling mechanisms there is a positive, although modest, relationship between the share of revenues from energy taxes in GDP and the Gini coefficient, which is the adopted measure of income inequality. In contrast, where such mechanisms have been implemented, there is an inverse and relatively stronger relationship between the share of energy tax revenues in GDP and inequality in income sources...|$|R
