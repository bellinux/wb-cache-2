50|$|Depending on the {{magnitude}} of the bottling endeavor, there are many different types of bottling machinery available. Liquid level <b>machines</b> <b>fill</b> bottles so they appear to be filled to the same line on every bottle, while volumetric <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> <b>fill</b> each bottle with exactly the same amount of liquid. Overflow pressure fillers are the most popular machines with beverage makers, while gravity <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> are most cost effective.

5|$|The Duck End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open <b>ditches</b> <b>filled</b> with {{stagnant}} water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. Faeces from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through cracks in the floors.|$|R

50|$|At {{some point}} after 100 AD the broch was {{abandoned}} and the <b>ditches</b> <b>filled</b> in. It {{is thought that}} settlement at the broch continued into the 5th century AD, the period known as Pictish times.

Until about the 8th century, the site was just a single farmstead.|$|R
50|$|Fort Anderson, {{located in}} Paducah, Kentucky {{was the site}} for the Battle of Paducah. Originally a supply depot, it was rebuilt as a seven-gun fort.

50|$|The Royal Walls are a land front {{running across}} the isthmus {{separating}} Ceuta {{from the rest of}} North Africa. The walls consist of two large bastions {{at each end of the}} wall, which are called Baluarte de la Coraza and Baluarte de la Bandera, and a smaller bastion at the north flank. They are protected by a <b>ditch</b> <b>filled</b> with seawater. Batteries were also built on breakwaters at either side of the walls.|$|R
40|$|Critical {{contamination}} {{sites and}} {{sources for the}} Gram-negative psychrotrophs (GNP) of the taxa Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae and Aeromonas, and the Gram-positive spore-forming (GPS) species Bacillus cereus, have been traced in the production line of pasteurised milk. Samples of raw and pasteurised milk from different sampling sites along the line were collected. After incubation at 7 °C until the total aerobic plate count reached 106 to 107 cfu/ml, {{or the number of}} GPS exceeded 104 cfu/ml isolates were picked randomly and identified. All GNP present in the raw milk were properly killed during pasteurisation. A recontamination by GNP was observed in 40 % of the consumer packages. This recontamination was focused to the filling procedure, and Pseudomonas was the dominating GNP in all packages. Environmental samples, as water from different water sources in the dairy plant, air collected by a RCS-sampler on water-agar strips, and empty, formed and sealed packages taken from the <b>filling</b> <b>machines,</b> were inoculated with sterile milk. GNP isolates were randomly picked and identified after incubation at 7 °C. Samples of water and air collected in the immediate surroundings of the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> contained large numbers of GNP causing growth in refrigerated milk. GNP isolates from the milk samples and from the environmental samples were genomically typed by the PCR-based method Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The RAPD-typing showed that there are many different RAPD-types involved in the recontamination of pasteurised milk. Several of the milk contaminating RAPD-types were found in condensed water on the filling nozzles, in waste-water {{at the bottom of the}} <b>filling</b> <b>machine,</b> and in air surrounding the <b>filling</b> <b>machine.</b> Some contaminating RAPD-types were present inside the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> over long periods, especially at the bottom of the <b>filling</b> <b>machine.</b> The effect on post-pasteurisation contamination by reducing the usage of water around the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> was studied. A clear link between the usage of water inside the machine and the frequency of consumer packages contaminated by GNP was found. B. cereus were involved in, and sometimes solely responsible for, the spoilage of pasteurised milk. The B. cereus infection can originate from heat-resistant spores present in the raw milk, but B. cereus can also enter the milk at the dairy plant. By using traditional microbiological methods and RAPD-typing, the pasteurised milk was once found to be contaminated by B. cereus while passing through one pasteuriser, and commonly found to be contaminated during the filling procedure...|$|R

5000|$|Sometime in the 2nd century AD, the Vallum was [...] "slighted"—that is, the ramparts {{were broken}} through and the <b>ditch</b> <b>filled</b> in at fairly regular {{intervals}} along its length. Archaeologists and historians {{have speculated that}} either the Vallum was then deemed unnecessary, or that it was {{proving to be a}} hindrance to military and authorised civilian traffic. Some have suggested that this coincided with the building of the Antonine Wall in Scotland and the temporary abandonment of Hadrian's Wall.|$|R

50|$|Fortifications are {{important}} in warfare. Early hill-forts were used to protect inhabitants in the Iron Age. They were primitive forts surrounded by <b>ditches</b> <b>filled</b> with water. Forts were then built out of mud bricks, stones, wood, and other available materials. Romans used rectangular fortresses built out of wood and stone. As long as there have been fortifications, there have been contraptions to break in, {{dating back to the}} times of Romans and earlier. Siege warfare is often necessary to capture forts.|$|R
