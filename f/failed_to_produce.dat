5|$|To resolve {{prolonged}} deadlocks in papal {{elections in}} the earlier years, local authorities often resorted to the forced seclusion of the cardinal electors, such as first {{in the city of}} Rome in 1241, and possibly before that in Perugia in 1216. In 1269, when the forced seclusion of the cardinals alone <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> a pope, the city of Viterbo refused to send in any materials except bread and water. When even this <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> a result, the townspeople removed the roof of the Palazzo dei Papi in their attempt to speed up the election.|$|E
5|$|After McKinley's inauguration, {{increases}} in gold availability from new discoveries and improved refining methods {{led to a}} considerable increase in the money supply. Even so, in 1900, Congress passed the Gold Standard Act, formally placing the United States on that standard. Although Bryan ran again on a silver platform in the 1900 presidential election, the issue <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> the same resonance with the voters. McKinley won more easily than in 1896, making inroads in the silver West.|$|E

For all his energy, Maslamah's campaigning <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> the desired results: {{by the time of}} his dismissal, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and been thrust once more into the defensive, with al-Jarrah again having to defend Adharbayjan against a Khazar invasion.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) {{rejected}} {{an injunction}} petition {{to halt the}} LHC's operation as unfounded, without hearing the case, stating that the opponents had <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> plausible evidence for their theories. A subsequent petition {{was rejected by the}} Administrative Court of Cologne in January 2011. An appeal against the latter ruling was rejected by the Higher Administrative Court of North Rhine-Westphalia in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September, the Allies {{commenced}} a 232 gun and 24 howitzer artillery barrage on the Bulgarian positions between Vardar and Doiran. Bulgaria {{responded in}} kind, with the artillery duel continuing {{during the following}} two days. On the night of 17–18 September, Bulgarian positions were targeted by nine salvos of gas shells, however the attack <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> any considerable effect due to the preceding arrival of new gas masks and the adequate training of the defenders.|$|E

5|$|Prince Henry {{showed no}} {{interest}} in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For the first ten years of the marriage, Catherine <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> any children. In 1537, Philippa Duci, one of Henry's mistresses, {{gave birth to a}} daughter, whom he publicly acknowledged. This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.|$|E
5|$|The conference <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> a settlement, {{breaking}} {{up on the}} same day it began with each side blaming the other for its unsuccessful outcome. Smith believed the nationalists were being unreasonable by requesting preconditions for talks—which they had previously agreed not to do—and asking for diplomatic immunity for their leaders and fighters. The nationalists contended that Smith was being deliberately intransigent and that they did not believe he was sincere in seeking an agreement if he was so adamant about not giving diplomatic immunity. Direct talks {{between the government and the}} Zimbabwe African People's Union followed in December 1975, but these also <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> any significant progress. The Victoria Falls Conference, the détente initiative and the associated ceasefire, though unsuccessful, did affect the course of the Rhodesian Bush War, as they gave the nationalist guerrillas significant time to regroup and reorganise themselves following the decisive security force counter-campaign of 1973–74. A further conference would follow in 1976, this time in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|The events {{surrounding}} {{the formation of}} the United Kingdom's government in 2010 took place between 7 May and 12 May 2010, following the 2010 general election, which <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> an overall majority for any of the country's three main political parties. The election, held on 6 May, resulted in the first hung parliament in the UK in 36 years, sparking a series of negotiations which would form the first coalition government since the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Aberdeen {{approached}} Craig Brown, who {{was working}} without a contract at Motherwell, to replace McGhee. Brown initially rebuffed an offer, but after further discussions with the club Brown resigned as manager at Motherwell to be announced as the next manager at Aberdeen two days later. The first act of the new management team of Brown and Archie Knox was to re-instate Leighton. Aberdeen <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> better results under Craig Brown's tenure, and in March 2013 he announced his retirement {{to take up a}} non-executive director role on the club's board.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1938, the Mingo Oak <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> leaves, and on May of that year, West Virginia state {{forester}} D.B. Griffin announced the tree's death. The prevailing {{theory is that the}} tree died from the release of poisonous gases and sulfur fumes from a burning spoil tip in nearby Trace Gap. The tree was felled with fanfare on September 23, 1938, with transections being sent to the Smithsonian Institution and the West Virginia State Museum. Under the terms of the Island Creek Coal Company's lease with the West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission, the land's lease around the former tree reverted to the company following the tree's felling.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the high}} numbers of UN {{casualties}} and under pressure from Clark, Van Fleet broke off Operation Showdown on November 28, thus ending the Battle of Triangle Hill.

On December 15, with the PVA 29th Division taking over the control of the battlefield from the 34th Division, the 12th Corps withdrew from the area and the 15th Corps settled back to the status quo prior to October 14.|$|E

5|$|In 1291 Pope Nicholas IV sent {{a letter}} to Joachim III, dated 23 March, {{reminding}} the Bulgarian Patriarch of their old friendship and urging him to join the Roman Church. The Pope also {{sent a letter}} to George Terter I expressing his hope to see Bulgaria return to the authority of Rome, alluding to the union between Bulgaria and Rome concluded in 1205 during the reign of emperor Kaloyan. Despite some hesitations Joachim III maintained the firm position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church on the matter and the papal initiative <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> any tangible results.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} an {{extension}} of the Bergen Light Rail to Sotra was to be made part of the extension plans in the period until 2040. For the light rail to use existing infrastructure, a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of public transport, whether by light rail or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the public transport, as they have <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> efficient public transport systems in Bergen.|$|E
5|$|No {{information}} on the bridge survives from ancient sources. The first descriptions appear in European travellers' accounts from the 19thcentury. The British archaeologist Charles Fellows {{was the first to}} explore the region of Lycia, and visited the bridge in May1840. Fellows, as well as T.A.B. Spratt and Edward Forbes, who visited the site two years later, describe it as having 25 arches. In 1882, an Austrian expedition, including Otto Benndorf, interpreted the structure as part of an ancient road that connected Limyra with the city of Attaleia (modern Antalya) to the east. However, this mission <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> any plans or sketches of the site.|$|E

Ore, who suffered several injuries during the 2006 season, <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> meaningful offensive yardage until late in the season, disappointing many fans who hoped he would repeat his excellent 2006performance on the field. With a 146-yard performance against Virginia in the final game of the regular season, Ore seemed to have regained his 2006form and promised success in the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|By 1351 the Byzantine {{civil war}} was over, and John VI Kantakouzenos had {{realized}} {{the threat posed}} by the Ottomans to the Balkan Peninsula. He appealed to the rulers of Serbia and Bulgaria for a united effort against the Turks and asked Ivan Alexander for money to construct warships, but his appeals fell on deaf ears as his neighbours distrusted his intentions. A new attempt for cooperation between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire followed in 1355, after John VI Kantakouzenos had been forced to abdicate and John V Palaiologos had been established as supreme emperor. To cement the treaty, Ivan Alexander's daughter Keraca Marija was married off to the future Byzantine Emperor Andronikos IV Palaiologos, but the alliance <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> concrete results.|$|E
5|$|Drama in {{the early}} 20th century thrived, but the country <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> a Welsh National Theatre company. After the Second World War the {{substantial}} number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two thirds. The increasing competition from television in the 1950s and 1960s led to a need for greater professionalism in the theatre. As a result, plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton, Rachel Roberts, Donald Houston and Stanley Baker, were establishing themselves as artistic talents. Anthony Hopkins was an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, and has since starred in Hollywood films.John Rhys-Davies is another well known actor, famous for his portrayal of Gimli in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the charismatic Arab excavator Sallah in the Indiana Jones films. Other Welsh actors to have crossed the Atlantic more recently include: Ioan Gruffudd; Rhys Ifans; Matthew Rhys; Michael Sheen; and Catherine Zeta-Jones.|$|E
