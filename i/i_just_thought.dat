5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
500|$|Yet, {{when asked}} what he liked about Youkilis, former Boston scout Matt Haas said: [...] "At first glance, not a lot. He was unorthodox. He had an extreme crouch—his thighs were almost {{parallel}} to the ground. And he was heavier than he is now. But the more I watched him, the more <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Throw the tools out the window. This guy can play baseball.'" ...|$|E
500|$|While {{fronting}} the band, Dickinson {{also came}} across Iron Maiden {{for the first}} time, who were supporting Samson at the Music Machine in 1980. As Dickinson recalls; [...] "I was watching them, and they were good, really fucking good, and at that moment, I remember thinking, 'I wanna fucking sing for that band. In fact, I'm going to sing for that band! I know I'm going to sing for that band!' ... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'This is really me. Not Samson.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|Suddenly I leapt up, {{knocked over}} my third egg, rushed for the window also. <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> of something. [...] "Nothing {{to be seen}} there," [...] cried the little man, rushing for the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't have to {{work very}} hard, Phrasie. You know I get out a good deal. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> thought--I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> I'd like to--sleep in the country--for a while." ...|$|R
500|$|In March 2000, Van Morrison {{told the}} Irish rock {{magazine}} Hot Press {{about the impact}} that Freewheelin made on him: [...] "I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what I thought at the time. The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens {{the whole thing up}} ... Dylan put it into the mainstream that this could be done." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} written by Jules Shear, and included on his 1983 debut solo album, Watch Dog. Shear later recalled in an interview, [...] " [...] {{like a big}} bonus really. Cyndi Lauper does a song ('All Through the Night') that's on a solo record of mine. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'No one's really going to hear this.' Then she does it, {{and it becomes a}} Top 5 song." [...] "I'm just glad people know the songs, really. I think they're really good. The only problem is with people who don't know I wrote them. I do them and they think, 'God, he's doing that Cyndi Lauper song,'" [...] Shear said.|$|E

500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, [...] "Because each episode is so wildly different {{there was nothing}} really linking them {{other than the fact}} they were all inside a Number Nine, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would be nice to}} have an object that you could hide and just have there on every set." [...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] on a table in Squires's fireplace. However, there is also a [...] "second" [...] hare. While it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown at the end of the episode, the crossword published in The Guardian contains a nina spelling ONELEPUS, Lepus being the generic name for hares.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Jackson {{started working}} on her ninth studio album, 20 Y.O., with her then partner, record {{producer}} Jermaine Dupri, who was commissioned as the executive producer. The discussion between the producers turned to how Jackson was feeling at the time her third studio album Control (1986) was recorded. [...] "I started asking questions like, 'What was the feeling of life when you were 20?' I was so intrigued with {{what was going on}} in her life then that <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> her album should be called that", Dupri commented. Jackson wanted to maintain a R sound from her most recent albums, but with an emphasis on dance music. In June 2006, rapper Khia was confirmed on a song titled [...] "So Excited". However producer Dupri said she would be not rapping on the track, ...|$|E
500|$|The dark, ironic {{lyrics of}} [...] "Today", {{describing}} {{a day when}} Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation. Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the song is [...] "downright pretty as rock ballads go" [...] but that [...] "Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks." [...] Corgan told Rolling Stone that [...] "I was really suicidal... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was funny to write a song that said today is the greatest day of your life because it can't get any worse." [...] Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of [...] "Today" [...] and [...] "Disarm" [...] to [...] "ripping [...] guts out." [...] They played the song live {{for the first time}} on September 20, 1993 on Late Night with David Letterman.|$|E
5000|$|For Olson, the {{conversation}} broke through a generalized conception of [...] "the homeless" [...] as she {{connected to the}} woman on a personal level. [...] "I learned {{a little bit about}} her life, and a barrier was sort of broken. Up until that point, <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> you <b>just</b> don’t go near homeless people,” Olson said.|$|R

500|$|Morrison {{recalled}} his {{first encounter with}} Dylan's music {{in an interview in}} 2000: [...] "I think I heard [...] in a record shop in Smith Street. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was just incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it... The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up." [...] Morrison's record producer at the time, Bert Berns, encouraged him to find models for his songs, so he bought Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home album in March 1965. One of the songs on the album held a unique fascination for Morrison and he soon started performing [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in small clubs and pubs as a solo artist (without Them).|$|E
500|$|Throughout 2016, PewDiePie's video style change {{became more}} {{apparent}} than the tweaks he implemented in the past (see above for more). As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. But I feel like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not proud of it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think {{the thing is that}} I have a lot of younger audience , and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E
500|$|When Cher was {{in fifth}} grade, she {{produced}} {{a performance of}} the musical Oklahoma! for her teacher and class. She organized a group of girls, directing and choreographing their dance routines. Unable to convince boys to participate, she acted the male roles and sang their songs. By age nine, she had developed an unusually low voice. Fascinated by film stars, Cher's role model was Audrey Hepburn, particularly due to {{her role in the}} 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Cher began to take after the unconventional outfits and behavior of Hepburn's character. She was disappointed by the absence of dark-haired Hollywood actresses whom she could emulate then. She had wanted to be famous since childhood but felt unattractive and untalented, later commenting, [...] "I couldn't think of anything that I could do... I didn't think I'd be a singer or dancer. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> well, I'll be famous. That was my goal." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> that is really not fair and I {{think we have to}} put something in that place, and that's really what this [...] is." ...|$|E
500|$|Zeta's Lad trainer John Upson {{was among}} those {{trainers}} who were particularly angry, feeling, correctly as it transpired, that this was his only {{chance to have a}} leading contender in a National. Before the race Upson had said: [...] "I'm not someone who always thinks their horse is going to win, but this year I just have a feeling." [...] The horse was in mid-division taking the water jump but was instantly pulled up as jockey Robbie Supple, riding in his third National, realised the race was not on. Upson later revealed: [...] "The reason I really blew my top was, that once the initial fiasco had happened, there was the starter standing there saying, 'Right, I'm disqualifying everything, apart from the nine that didn't go. I'll start the race again with nine runners.' At that stage <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> the world had gone completely mad. The adrenaline was going and I was jumping up and down." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{includes}} one acoustic song, [...] "Hero of War", {{which is}} about an Iraq War Veteran looking back on his war experiences. It is described by Rolling Stone as an [...] "ambivalent aggro-folk track". McIlrath said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to take the}} perspective [...] of 'What is the war going to be looked back on as?'" [...] In another interview McIlrath stated, [...] "It was a way to document what's going on, like other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come." [...] He went on to say, [...] "There are not many songs...talking about what's going on during eight years of occupation in Iraq. That, combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories {{about what is going on}} on the ground amid all the bullshit, showed me the differences from what is really happening to what is happening in the news media. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> that this needed to go into a song." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Daniel Chun, his fourth writing credit of the series.

The episode marked the first appearance of Will Ferrell's four-episode arc on the series and {{is also one of}} series star, Carell's last episodes as a regular on the series. Ferrell signed on to appear in Steve Carell's final three episodes, and the first episode without Carell, [...] "The Inner Circle", to make Carell's transition easier. Carell had decided to leave the series, because [...] "I just think it's time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was time for my character to go". Ferrell initially called the producers and offered to appear in Carell's last season, because he is [...] "a fan and wanted to commemorate Carell’s swan song".

500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Partition" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava and was shot at the Parisian cabaret club, Crazy Horse. It was filmed quickly as Jay-Z had to travel to London for a concert after the shooting.

And I remember thinking, 'Damn, these girls are fly.' <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was the ultimate sexy show I've ever seen.

[...] Talking about the video, Nava noted that for the shooting Beyoncé {{was trying to be}} [...] "even more risque than she's been in the past". While filming, he further tried to [...] "create and capture a bit of genuine intimacy" [...] between the singer and her husband. During a commentary about the video for the song, Beyoncé revealed her motivation to film it by saying, ...|$|E
500|$|The Frighteners was {{released}} in the United States in 1,675 theaters, and opened at #5, earning $5,565,495 during its opening weekend, averaging $3,335 per theater. The film eventually grossed a worldwide total of $29,359,216. The Frighteners ended up being a box office disappointment, mostly due to competition from Independence Day; in interviews conducted years after The Frighteners release, Jackson commented he was disappointed by Universal's ubiquitous marketing campaign, including a poster which [...] "didn't tell you anything about the picture", which he believed was the primary reason the film was not a financial success. Additionally, the film opened {{on the same day}} the Atlanta Summer Olympics began; when Jackson realized this and told the studio, they answered [...] "'We don't think so; our research indicates that's not the case...' And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> how the hell do they know? There had only ever been three Olympic Games held in the United States in one hundred years!" [...] Jackson acknowledged The Frighteners tone made it hard to pigeon-hole and sell, and his experience on the film made him understand the importance of marketing.|$|E
