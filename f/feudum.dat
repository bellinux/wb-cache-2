5000|$|In ancient Rome a [...] "benefice" [...] (from the Latin noun beneficium, meaning [...] "benefit") {{was a gift}} of land (precaria) {{for life}} {{as a reward for}} {{services}} rendered, originally, to the state. In medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service continued to be called a beneficium (Latin). Later, the term <b>feudum,</b> or feodum, began to replace beneficium in the documents.

5000|$|The term [...] "feudal" [...] or [...] "feodal" [...] {{is derived}} from the medieval Latin word feodum.

50|$|A fief (also fee, feu, feud, tenure or fiefdom, Lehen, <b>feudum,</b> feodum or beneficium) was {{understood}} to be a thing (land, property), which its owner, the liege lord (Lehnsherr), had transferred to the hereditary ownership of the beneficiary {{on the basis of}} mutual loyalty, with the proviso that it would return to the lord under certain circumstances.|$|E

5000|$|A theory {{put forward}} by Archibald R.

50|$|Although {{derived from}} the Latin word feodum or <b>feudum</b> (fief), then in use, the term feudalism and the system it {{describes}} were not conceived of as a formal political system by {{the people living in}} the Middle Ages.

5000|$|Linguistically {{the term}} Lehen is {{connected}} with the word leihen, to lend or loan, and meant something like [...] "loaned property" [...] (c.f. the modern German Darlehen, a loan), whilst the word <b>feudum,</b> which some etymologists suggest comes from the Latin fides (loyalty), {{is more likely to}} be derived from the Old High German feo, which meant Vieh i.e. [...] "cattle", but later generally meant [...] "goods" [...] or [...] "property".|$|E
50|$|Official {{positions}} (Ämter) and {{sovereign rights}} over a particular territory (feudal regalia) could be awarded as a fief. It {{was in this}} way that the House of Thurn and Taxis received its Postlehen or postal service rights. In addition, there were numerous enfeoffments of church rights, church fiefs (Stifte or feudal ecclesiastica) and enfeoffments of foundations associated with an altar (<b>feudum</b> altaragli). Also, cash payments from the royal treasury or profits from certain duties could be awarded as a fief.|$|E
50|$|About Faid’s beginnings, {{nothing can}} be said with any certainty. According to a legend, the village’s name comes from Fett - German for “fat” - from the story that holds that the village once had to supply the lordly kitchen with fat. It seems likelier, though, that the name comes from the Latin word <b>feudum,</b> which means “fief” (and which also yields the English word “feudal”). Another {{scholarly}} opinion, however, holds that the name is indeed of Latin origin, but that it rather comes from fagus, the word for “beech”.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} gain the support of Castile, he had his {{daughter}} Blanche engaged to the future Alfonso X.

But with Guipúzcoa he would have attained {{direct access to the}} Cantabrian Sea. This alliance was never effected, however, as it would have meant the incorporation of Navarre as a <b>feudum</b> of Castile. The next year, Theobald engaged his daughter to John I, Duke of Brittany, the son of his close crusading ally Peter of Dreux.|$|E
5000|$|A fief ( [...] ; <b>feudum)</b> was {{the central}} element of feudalism and {{consisted}} of heritable property or rights granted by an overlord to a vassal who held it in fealty (or [...] "in fee") {{in return for a}} form of feudal allegiance and service, usually given by the personal ceremonies of homage and fealty. The fees were often lands or revenue-producing real property held in feudal land tenure: these are typically known as fiefs or fiefdoms. However, not only land but anything of value could be held in fee, including governmental office, rights of exploitation such as hunting or fishing, monopolies in trade, and tax farms.|$|E

He founded Maillezais Abbey (1010) and Bourgueil Abbey. He rebuilt the cathedral and many other religious structures in Poitiers after a fire. He travelled widely in Europe, annually visiting Rome or Spain as a pilgrim. Everywhere he was greeted with royal pomp.

50|$|Manfred I (died 1175) was {{the first}} marquess of Saluzzo, serving in that {{capacity}} from 1125 until his death. He was the eldest son of Boniface del Vasto, the margrave of Western Liguria, of a noble stock which had ruled the region between Savona and Ventimiglia for generations. Boniface received the county of Saluzzo in <b>feudum</b> directly from its suzerain, Ulric Manfred, margrave of Turin, {{and gave it to}} his son. The county comprised the land between the Alps, the Po River, and the Stura. Manfred transmitted the marquistate to his son by Eleonara (possibly the daughter of Gonario II of Arborea because of Pisa's connection with Arborea), Manfred II, and the dynasty which reigned until the Renaissance was born.|$|E

As a result of this treaty, Ottone was forced to close the highway passing through this territory to merchants from Alba. In 1210 Ottone was a witness to the imperial privileges granted to Asti by the Emperor Otto IV during his stay there.

In 1035, he refounded the diocese of Palencia, which had been laid waste by the Moors. He gave the see and its several abbacies to Bernard, of French or Navarrese origin, to whom he also gave the secular lordship (as a <b>feudum),</b> which included many castles in the region.

5000|$|Though {{according}} to a 2012 genomic study, the Romani reached the Balkans {{as early as the}} 12th century, the first historical records of the Romani reaching south-eastern Europe are from the 14th century: in 1322 after leaving Ireland on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Irish Franciscan monk Symon Semeonis encountered a migrant group of Romani outside the town of Heraklion (Candia), in Crete, calling them [...] "the descendants of Cain"; his account is the earliest surviving description by a Western chronicler of the Romani in Europe. In 1350 Ludolphus of Sudheim mentioned a similar people with a unique language whom he called Mandapolos, a word some think derives from the Greek word mantes (meaning prophet or fortune teller).Around 1360, a fiefdom, called the <b>Feudum</b> Acinganorum was established in Corfu, which mainly used Romani serfs and to which the Romani on the island were subservient. [...] By the 1440s, they were recorded in Germany; and by the 16th century, Scotland and Sweden. Some Romani migrated from Persia through North Africa, reaching the Iberian Peninsula in the 15th century. The two currents met in France.|$|E

5000|$|A theory by Alauddin Samarrai {{suggests}} an Arabic origin, from fuyū (the plural of fay, which literally means [...] "the returned", {{and was used}} especially for 'land that has been conquered from enemies that did not fight'). Samarrai's theory is that early forms of 'fief' include feo, feu, feuz, feuum and others, the plurality of forms strongly suggesting origins from a loanword. First use of these terms was in Languedoc, one of the least-Germanized areas of Europe and bordered Muslim Spain, where the earliest use of feuum {{as a replacement for}} beneficium can be dated to 899, the same year a Muslim base at Fraxinetum (La Garde-Freinet) in Provence was established. It is possible, Samarrai says, that French scribes, writing in Latin, attempted to transliterate the Arabic word fuyū (the plural of fay), which was being used by the Muslim invaders and occupiers at the time, resulting in a plurality of forms - feo, feu, feuz, feuum and others - from which eventually <b>feudum</b> derived.

[...] "Valla," [...] said Bod, [...] "used historical, linguistic and philological evidence, including counterfactual reasoning, to rebut the document. ... Valla found words and constructions in the document that could not ... have been used by anyone in the time of Emperor Constantine I, {{at the beginning of the}} fourth century A.D. The late Latin word <b>Feudum</b> [...] "fief", for example, referred to the feudal system. But this was a medieval invention, which did not exist before the seventh century A.D." [...] Valla's methods were those of science, says Bod: [...] "He was skeptical, he was empirical, he drew a hypothesis, he was rational, he used very abstract reasoning (even counterfactual reasoning), he used textual phenomena as evidence, and he laid the foundations for one of the most successful theories: stemmatic philology, which can derive the original archetype text from extant copies (in fact, the much later DNA analysis was based on stemmatic philology)." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} and {{evaluates the}} social networks that typified the feudal system. Using tenth- to twelfth-century documents, it explores {{the institution of}} benefactoria and the associated concepts of beneficium, servitium, prestimonium, and <b>feudum</b> in order to approach the subject of lordship: personal lordship at its most elementary, distinguished from other forms of power such as public jurisdiction or private property. Benefactoria and its associated concepts {{played a key role}} not only during the formative period of Leonese and Castilian lordship, but also in its subsequent development as a territorial institution. This paper argues that lordship, the definitive power-structure of the feudal system, was established and widely disseminated through the agreement of benefactoria pacts. These pacts, which enshrined the exchange of services for ‘protection’, were established between individuals and institutions that were socially unequal, and extended throughout free society, from the level of the king to that of the humblest peasants. In this sense, all free men were homines de benefactoria, linked together through private relationships of domination and submission, lordship and servitude: the inhabitants of properties that were specifically designated as behetrías simply represented a more partial and restrictive expression of the original concept of benefactoria. The pace and intensity of the processes that determined the formation and development of feudalism in León and Castile were marked by the spread of this type of social relationship, which was therefore both a defining factor and a catalyst within that system...|$|E
