25|$|The <b>initial</b> <b>fire</b> {{from the}} mortars on shore was inaccurate, but a Signal Corps officer in Beaufort, Lieutenant William J. Andrews, acting {{on his own}} responsibility, was able to deliver {{messages}} to the battery commanders telling them how to adjust their range. After noon, virtually all shots were on target. Nineteen guns were dismounted. The walls of the fort began to crumble under the continued pounding, and in mid-afternoon Colonel White began to fear that the magazine would be breached. At 4:30p.m., he decided that the fort could no longer hold out, so he ordered that a white flag be raised. Firing on both sides then ceased.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, forests cover about 10% of {{the land}} area and yet harbor 70% of the country’s bird and {{terrestrial}} mammal species. Natural fire regimes are important in maintaining a diverse assemblage of vertebrate species in up to twelve different forest types in British Columbia. Different species have adapted to exploit the different stages of succession, regrowth and habitat change that occurs following an episode of burning, such as downed trees and debris. The characteristics of the <b>initial</b> <b>fire,</b> such as its size and intensity, cause the habitat to evolve differentially afterwards and influence how vertebrate species are {{able to use the}} burned areas.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to investigate the <b>initial</b> <b>firing</b> temperatures (IFT) of pottery from two archaeological sites in Northwest Alaska. Arctic ceramics are consistently described as low-fired technology in archaeological and ethnographic literature. However, regional and temporal variation in the quality and hardness of arctic ceramics suggests variation in firing temperatures. To describe all Arctic pottery as low-fired ignores variation in firing temperatures and ultimately in the production process. Sherds from two archaeological locales, the Cape Krusenstern site complex and the Ahteut village site, were selected to represent sites with differential access to fuel resources. IFT’s were estimated by measuring color change in a stepwise refiring experiment. Preliminary results indicate {{that a majority of}} sherds from Cape Krusenstern had lower <b>initial</b> <b>firing</b> temperatures than did sherds from Ahteut. Additionally, this experiment indicates that (1) a majority of the sherds contained residual organic content, (2) shows the effects of the presence of organic content on a refiring experiment, and (3) confirms that vessels from these two sites were originally fired under reducing atmospheres. These results do provide {{a better understanding of the}} production process of arctic ceramics. The difference between the <b>initial</b> <b>firing</b> atmosphere and the refiring atmosphere, as well as the presence of organic content, may be masking the true indications of <b>initial</b> <b>firing</b> temperatures. Because of these confounding factors additional research, including alternative methods of estimating <b>initial</b> <b>firing</b> temperatures, are necessary. Beyond reconstructing the production process of Northwest Alaskan ceramics, understanding <b>initial</b> <b>firing</b> temperatures provides important information regarding environmental constraints on the ceramic production process and the methods precontact potters used to overcome them. This work also adds to our understanding of fuel use and management...|$|R

Interior crews, using the [...] "two in, two out" [...] rule, may advance hose lines inside the building, find {{the fire and}} cool it with water. Exterior crews may direct water into windows or other openings, or against other nearby fuels exposed to the <b>initial</b> <b>fire.</b> Hose streams {{directed}} into the interior through exterior wall aperturtes may conflict with and jeopardize interior fire attack crews.

2500|$|The entire {{sequence}} of events from decision to launch to actual launch normally took about 36 seconds. This included about 30 seconds to develop a track for a target; 4 seconds for computer to develop a firing solution, and 2 seconds between the <b>initial</b> <b>fire</b> order command and missile launch. There was a 5-second allowance for the missile to launch, if it {{failed to do so}} it was marked [...] "rejected" [...] and another missile selected. A new missile could be launched about 11 seconds after detonation or rejecting the previous missile. Based on the 'time to fly' of the missile this limited overall battery rates to about one launch every couple of minutes.|$|E
2500|$|The Cinder Butte Fire was a {{wildfire}} {{that burned}} over [...] of Oregon rangeland {{during the summer}} of 2017. [...] The fire began on 2 August 2017.

[...] The fire consumed rangeland vegetation and juniper woodlands in the area east of Glass Buttes in northern Lake County and then spread into northwestern Harney County. [...] Most of the burned area was on public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. [...] Firefighters battled the blaze for over a week. [...] At the peak of the firefighting effort, there were 496 firefighters working on the Cinder Butte Fire.|$|E
2500|$|Ferret then {{sailed to}} St Helena again on 15 August 1815 {{as part of}} the {{squadron}} under [...] that was taking Napoleon Bonaparte into exile. On her way home she encountered the Spanish brigantine Dolores. At the time, Ferrets armament consisted of only eight carronades, while Dolores had a long 32-pounder gun on a pivot, four long 9-pounder guns, and two 12-pounder carronades. Ferret was therefore outranged. Doloress <b>initial</b> <b>fire</b> killed two men in Ferret. In the subsequent action, which lasted some three hours, Ferret lost another three men wounded, two of whom died later from their wounds, before she came alongside Dolores, at which point the Spaniard struck. Dolores was carrying 275 slaves, so Ferret took her to Sierra Leone for the vessel and cargo to be condemned for violating the British prohibition on the slave trade. This gave rise to a suit in which the Court found that Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn was entitled to the flag officer's share of the prize money.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park at Chimney Tops, {{very strong}} winds, with gusts {{recorded}} up to 87 miles per hour, compounded the extremely dry conditions due to drought and spread {{what had been}} a moderately contained wildfire down into Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Pittman Center, and other nearby areas. It forced mass evacuations. Governor Bill Haslam ordered the National Guard to the area. The center of Gatlinburg's tourist district escaped heavy damage, but the surrounding wooded region was called [...] "the apocalypse" [...] by a fire department lieutenant. Approximately 14,000 people were evacuated that evening, more than 2,400 structures were damaged or destroyed, and damages totaled more than $500 million. Fourteen lives were lost in the fires, some local citizens and others visiting tourists. Following the fires, the town of Gatlinburg was shut down and considered a crime scene. The city reopened to residents only after a few days but held a strict curfew {{for more than a week}} and was reopened to the public once the curfew was lifted. Two juveniles, a 17 year old and a 15 year old, were later arrested for starting the <b>initial</b> <b>fire</b> at the Chimney Tops that would later sweep through the city of Gatlinburg.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{location}} of the <b>initial</b> <b>fire,</b> its source of ignition, {{and the source of}} fuel remain subjects of debate. The cause of the accident has never been determined conclusively, although many hypotheses have been proposed. Sabotage theories notwithstanding, one hypothesis often put forth involves a combination of gas leakage and atmospheric static conditions. Escaping hydrogen gas (in this specific case from incomplete or damaged vents {{along the top of the}} vessel and especially near the rear upper tail fin) will typically burn after mixing with air and will explode when mixed with air in the right proportions. This, along with the high static collected from flying within stormy conditions could have combined to ignite the leaking gas and down the airship. In addition, a certain amount of gas may have been inexplicably lost out the top of the vessel for, at the same time, water ballast was noticeably released to slow the rate of descent. The initial explosion would therefore have been the result of the quickening fire reaching the gas bags themselves via the compromised aft-most vent at the vessel's stern. Another more recent theory involves the airship's outer covering. The silvery cloth covering contained material including cellulose nitrate which is highly flammable. This theory is controversial and has been rejected by other researchers because the outer skin burns too slowly to account for the rapid flame propagation and gaps in the fire correspond with internal gas cell divisions, which wouldn't be visible if the fire spread across the skin first. Hydrogen fires had previously destroyed many other airships.|$|E

40|$|A {{gate drive}} {{latching}} circuit for an auxiliary resonant commutation circuit for a power switching inverter includes a current monitor circuit providing a current signal {{to a pair}} of analog comparators to implement latching of one of a pair of auxiliary switching devices which are used to provide commutation current for commutating switching inverters in the circuit. Each of the pair of comparators feeds a latching circuit which responds to an active one of the comparators for latching the associated gate drive circuit for one of the pair of auxiliary commutating switches. An <b>initial</b> <b>firing</b> signal is applied to each of the commutating switches to gate each into conduction and the resulting current is monitored to determine current direction and therefore the one of the switches which is carrying current. The comparator provides a latching signal to the one of the auxiliary power switches which is actually conducting current and latches that particular power switch into an on state for the duration of current through the device. The latching circuit is so designed that the only time one of the auxiliary switching devices can be latched on is during the duration of an <b>initial</b> <b>firing</b> command signal...|$|R
40|$|Ca(2 +) sparks and Ca(2 +) waves play {{important}} roles in calcium release and calcium propagation during the excitation-contraction (EC) coupling process in cardiac myocytes. Although the classical Fick's law is widely used to model Ca(2 +) sparks and Ca(2 +) waves in cardiac myocytes, it fails to reasonably explain the full-width at half maximum(FWHM) paradox. However, the anomalous subdiffusion model successfully reproduces Ca(2 +) sparks of experimental results. In this paper, {{in the light of}} anomalous subdiffusion of Ca(2 +) sparks, we develop a mathematical model of calcium wave in cardiac myocytes by using stochastic Ca(2 +) release of Ca(2 +) release units (CRUs). Our model successfully reproduces calcium waves with physiological parameters. The results reveal how Ca(2 +) concentration waves propagate from an <b>initial</b> <b>firing</b> of one CRU at a corner or in the middle of considered region, answer how large in magnitude of an anomalous Ca(2 +) spark can induce a Ca(2 +) wave. With physiological Ca(2 +) currents (2 pA) through CRUs, it is shown that an <b>initial</b> <b>firing</b> of four adjacent CRUs can form a Ca(2 +) wave. Furthermore, the phenomenon of calcium waves collision is also investigated...|$|R
