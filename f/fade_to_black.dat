5|$|In early {{drafts of}} Final Fantasy VII, Tifa {{was to be}} a {{background}} character. Her role in AVALANCHE was to add support behind the scenes, and to cheer everyone up after missions, as well as having a particular fondness for Cloud. She was also supposed to have a large scar on her back caused by Cloud, and partial amnesia from the incident when she had received it. A scene intended to imply herself and Cloud having sex was proposed by Masato Kato, one of the event planners, but it was replaced with a toned down version by Kitase in which a risqué line is followed by a <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>black.</b> In an interview Nojima stated that none of the staff thought the scene would become such an issue at the time.|$|E
5|$|The man is now standing, {{his arms}} crossed, and watches with {{pleasure}} as Beyoncé continues the private dance. After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} smiling, and knocks a stack of papers off of his desk so she can rub against him. She then pulls open the blinds to let light in. At the same time, several other women are seen {{to be present in}} the room. They were apparently there all along, hidden in the darkness. Together, they give a choreographed teaser dance in front of their own respective antique fans while their hair is blowing. The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip their hair back and forth. The video ends with a <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>black</b> as Beyoncé approaches the man at his desk.|$|E
25|$|The film <b>Fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>Black</b> (2006) is {{a fictional}} thriller based on Davide Ferrario's novel, set during Welles's 1948 journey to Rome {{to star in}} the movie Black Magic. Danny Huston stars as Welles.|$|E

25|$|To further {{cater to}} the growing success of R, MTV {{introduced}} the weekly <b>Fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>Black</b> {{in the summer of}} 1991, which was hosted by Al B. Sure!. The show would be reformatted into the better known MTV Jams the following year, which incorporated mainstream hip-hop into the playlist. Bill Bellamy would become the new and ongoing host. The show became so successful it spawned its own Most Wanted spinoff titled Most Wanted Jams.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, The Roots {{released}} The Tipping Point, {{which contained}} a more mainstream sound, allegedly due to demands from Interscope Records. The album sold 400,000 copies. In 2004, Questlove appeared in Jay-Z's <b>Fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>Black.</b> In addition to {{appearing in the}} documentary portion of the film, Questlove was the drummer/musical director for all portions of the show with a live band. In 2005, Questlove appeared along with such luminaries as Madonna, Iggy Pop, Bootsy Collins, and Little Richard in a television commercial for the Motorola ROKR phone. Questlove also appears for a short clip in the 2005 film, The Longest Yard.|$|E
25|$|Madison {{was first}} {{publicly}} shown during E3 2009, {{the second of}} the four protagonists to be revealed (after Norman Jayden). Specifically shown was the level where Madison enters the Blue Lagoon to talk to Paco. The character also was shown topless in Playboys December 2009 issue. Paco's forced striptease would later lead to the release of a PEGI 16-rated version of the game, something that shocked and annoyed de Fondaumière – who believed the scene was not 18-worthy, and expected the finger scene over the striptease might need to be cut. After hearing the requested, complex changes, the developers decided to go for a <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>black,</b> where instead the player hears her beating him and getting the info.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the season}} four finale of Rescue Me, [...] "Good Times Roll" [...] played in its {{entirety}} as episode 13 <b>faded</b> <b>to</b> <b>black.</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{drawback}} of SECAM {{for production}} is that, unlike PAL or NTSC, certain post-production operations of encoded SECAM signals {{are not really}} possible without a significant drop in quality. As an example, a simple <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>black</b> is trivial in NTSC and PAL: you just reduce the signal level until it is zero. However, in SECAM the color difference signals, which are frequency modulated, need first to be decoded to e.g. RGB, then the fade-to-black is applied, and finally the resulting signal is re-encoded into SECAM. Because of this, much SECAM video editing was actually done using PAL equipment, then the resultant signal was converted to SECAM. Another drawback of SECAM is that comb filtering, allowing better color separation, is not possible in TV receivers. This was not, however, much of a drawback {{in the early days}} of SECAM as such filters did not become readily available in high-end TV sets before the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Psycho is now {{considered}} to be the first film in the slasher film genre, and has been referenced in films numerous times; examples include the 1974 musical horror film Phantom of the Paradise, 1978 horror film Halloween (which starred Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh's daughter), the 1977 Mel Brooks tribute to many of Hitchcock's thrillers, High Anxiety, the 1980 <b>Fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>Black,</b> the 1980 Dressed to Kill and Wes Craven's 1996 horror satire Scream. Bernard Herrmann's opening theme has been sampled by rapper Busta Rhymes on his song [...] "Gimme Some More" [...] (1998). Manuel Muñoz's 2011 novel What You See in the Dark includes a sub-plot that fictionalizes elements of the filming of Psycho, referring to Hitchcock and Leigh only as [...] "The Director" [...] and [...] "The Actress". In the comic book stories of Jonni Future, the house inherited by the title character is patterned after the Bates Motel.|$|E
500|$|In early drafts, Cloud {{would act}} as an alter ego for Sephiroth, {{influenced}} {{to believe he was}} a creation of Sephiroth's will. As in the finished game, Cloud would later realize that he is the real Cloud, and that the reason Sephiroth could control his mind and body was because of his weakened will and Shinra's experiments. Additionally, Cloud would have scarred Tifa prior to the game's events, although the reasons for as to why were unknown. Early materials listed Cloud's job as [...] and [...] Masato Kato, one of the event planners, proposed a scene involving Cloud walking out of the Highwind's Chocobo stable followed by Tifa the morning before the final battle. Kitase rejected it as too extreme, but maintained a scene written by Kato depicting the night before, in which a risqué line is spoken by Tifa followed by a <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>black.</b> In an interview, Nojima stated that none of the staff thought it would become an important issue at the time.|$|E
5000|$|The video then <b>fades</b> <b>to</b> <b>black,</b> {{showing an}} [...] "all persons fictitious" [...] {{disclaimer}} ending with [...] "...except the drummer from Def Leppard", who is referenced in the bridge.|$|R

50|$|Though not a Bressonian {{trademark}} itself, {{the film}} also utilizes more <b>fades</b> <b>to</b> <b>black</b> than {{is common in}} other French films of the time, showing an early experimentation with film editing.|$|R
500|$|Although Beyoncé did {{not perform}} the song in any {{televised}} appearances, the song {{was a part of}} her set list on her tours. During the Verizon Ladies First Tour, which also featured Alicia Keys, Missy Elliott and Tamia, Beyoncé performed [...] "Summertime" [...] in New York in front of more than 20,000 fans. Shaheem Reid of MTV News commented that Beyoncé [...] "stepped in the name of love" [...] during the breakdown of the song. Beyoncé also sung [...] "Summertime" [...] with an interpolation of R. Kelly's [...] "Step in the Name of Love" [...] on her first solo tour Dangerously in Love Tour (2003) at the Wembley Arena in London, England. Beyoncé performed the song in a yellow summer-dress that was bedazzled in rhinestones across the upper breast area and around the bottom of the dress. The song, alongside its live version, was included on a live DVD/CD titled Live at Wembley. [...] "Summertime" [...] serves as the twelfth track of the live DVD. A performance of the remix of the song was included on the Jay-Z documentary <b>Fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>Black</b> (2004), which features Beyoncé performing with Ghostface Killah.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Delphine Software {{released}} a 3D sequel to their popular 2D platformer [...] Entitled <b>Fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>Black,</b> {{it was the}} first attempt to bring a popular 2D platform game series into 3D. While it retained the puzzle-oriented level design style and step-based control, and bore a strong resemblance to its predecessor, it did not meet the criteria of a platform game, and was billed as an action adventure. It used true 3D characters and set pieces, but its environments were rendered using a rigid engine similar to the one used by Wolfenstein 3D, in that it could only render square, flat corridors, rather than suspended platforms that could be jumped between. <b>Fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>Black</b> would set the stage for other series, such as Metroid and Duke Nukem, that would gradually shift away from the traditional platform formula while retaining many of its gameplay conventions.|$|E
2500|$|About 2000, {{executive}} producers Michael Roth (Circuit), Joseph Wolf (<b>Fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>Black,</b> Hell Night, Halloween II, [...] ), and Karen Lee Wolf (Children of the Living Dead) {{conceived of}} the idea of a serial killer horror film featuring homosexual characters. They had little more than a concept involving Halloween, a masked murderer, and using West Hollywood, California, as the location. Paul Etheredge-Ouzts, an art director who had worked with Roth on two films, was working in the trio's production office. After reading a portion of a romantic comedy script Etheredge-Ouzts had written, the producers asked him to write and direct their gay-themed horror film. It was to be a micro budget picture with an minimal advertising budget.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, while someone finds Jason's broken mask in the wreckage, Tina and Nick {{are taken}} {{away in the}} {{ambulance}} and the screen <b>fades</b> <b>to</b> <b>black</b> while Jason's whispers can be heard from far away.|$|R

2500|$|On November 25, 2003, Jay-Z held a concert—billed as a [...] "retirement party" [...] at Madison Square Garden in New York City, {{which would}} later {{be the focus of}} his film <b>Fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>Black.</b> All {{proceeds}} went to charity. Other performers included collaborators like the Roots (in the form of his backing band), Missy Elliott, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Siegel, Freeway, Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Twista, Ghostface Killah, Foxy Brown, Pharrell Williams and R. Kelly with special appearances by Voletta Wallace and Afeni Shakur, the mothers of The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur respectively. While Jay-Z had attested to a retirement from making new studio albums, various side projects and appearances soon followed. Included in these were a greatest hits record, as well as the release and tour of Unfinished Business, the second collaborative album between Jay-Z and R. Kelly.|$|E
2500|$|A prologue {{was added}} to the {{beginning}} of all the fourth-series episodes for the American transmissions. This was to clarify some initial confusion audiences had regarding the characters and their mission. In the opener, a waiter holding a champagne bottle falls dead onto a human-sized chessboard; a dagger protruding from a target on his back. Steed and Mrs. Peel (dressed in her trademark leather catsuit) walk up to the body as the voice-over explains: [...] "Extraordinary crimes against the people, and the state, have to be avenged by agents extraordinary. Two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur. Otherwise known as The Avengers." [...] During this voice-over, Steed pours two drinks from the wine bottle and Mrs Peel replaces her gun in her boot. They clink glasses and depart together. <b>Fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>black</b> and then the opening titles proper begin.|$|E
2500|$|Times Matt Peckham {{felt that}} in {{comparison}} to the setup in Halo 5s marketing and the Hunt the Truth series, which suggested a novel direction for the series, [...] "What happens in Halo 5s story, by contrast, feels disappointingly by the numbers." [...] GameSpot's Mike Mahardy felt that while the plot had promise, the campaign did not effectively capitalize on its opportunities: [...] "Cutscenes <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>black</b> before they feel finished. Character motivations shift on a whim." [...] Forbes Paul Thier and GamesRadar's David Houghton complained that players did not suitably impact the story's progression, and that the game's cliffhanger ended the plot {{at the conclusion of the}} first act. Though he also found fault with parts of Halo 5s campaign, Albert praised Cortana's threat as [...] "less black and white" [...] in motives than previous antagonists, and the background chatter contributing to learning more about each character.|$|E
50|$|At 10:50pm on Saturday 2 July 2016, {{the channel}} closed with Feist singing 1,2,3,4 (the same Sesame Street song {{that was used}} to {{relaunch}} the channel in 2011); the channel then <b>faded</b> <b>to</b> <b>black.</b> The final show to play on Four was The Biggest Loser.|$|R
50|$|Arthur and Joe finally {{make it to}} the beach, {{where the}} former allows his bare feet to touch the sand. There, they reunite with Norman and Trisha. The film <b>fades</b> <b>to</b> <b>black</b> as the four of them happily {{continue}} walking on the beach in horizon.|$|R
50|$|However, {{monochromatic}} {{has also}} another meaning {{near to the}} words “boring” or “colorless” which sometimes leads to creating a design composed from true monochromatic color shades (one hue <b>fading</b> <b>to</b> <b>black),</b> and the colors created from the one hue but <b>faded</b> <b>to</b> all wavelengths (to white). This design should not be called as monochromatic in strictly scientific meaning.|$|R
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} The Beatles {{performing}} before cameras and a live audience. Ringo Starr begins to drum to the 1:00 to 1:08 segment of [...] "Glass Onion". John Lennon begins to sing while George Harrison and Paul McCartney nod {{their heads to}} the beat. After a few moments, the monitors in the director's booth begin to flicker, showing scenes of Jay-Z rapping [...] "Encore", and the lyrics of the chorus begin to show behind the group. Starr's drum kit becomes a set of turntables and mixer and he begins to scratch while John continues to sing [...] "Oh, yeah!" [...] as sampled from [...] "Glass Onion". As [...] "Encore" [...] moves into the second verse, the beat changes {{to a sample of}} [...] "Savoy Truffle". A John Lennon body double starts to breakdance, leading to a headspin. McCartney and Harrison are replaced by two dancers. The Lennon double backflips off the screen, flinging his wig off. Ringo walks off and the lights <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>black.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Chell then {{travels through}} {{the bowels of}} the Enrichment Center, battling natural hazards and further turrets until she reaches GLaDOS's chamber, where the final {{encounter}} occurs. In this encounter Chell dislodges [...] "personality cores" [...] (each also voiced by McLain, {{with the exception of the}} final core, which is voiced in a guttural fashion by Mike Patton) and incinerates them. During the battle, it is revealed that before the events of Portal, GLaDOS released a neurotoxin into the Enrichment Center (revealed to occur on Take Your Daughter to Work Day in the sequel), which resulted in the surviving scientists installing a morality core to prevent further incidents. After the cores are incinerated, the room is sucked into a vortex leading to the surface and GLaDOS is destroyed. Originally the game ended with a <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>black</b> leaving Chell on the surface. This ending was however replaced in a later patch to the game to a new one (to set up for Portal 2) in which an unconscious Chell is dragged away by the party escort robot (a character referenced earlier in the game). The final scene shows a room filled with more personality cores that begin to light up and a robotic hand puts out a candle on a cake.|$|E
2500|$|David Fisher {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the first realistic gay lead portrayed on television, and the character has been widely praised for the way he was written as well as his portrayal by Michael C. Hall. [...] The Essential HBO Reader noted how Six Feet Under offered [...] "an affirming but alternative version of image of non-traditional families and couples," [...] and concluded that, unlike their heterosexual counterparts on the show (Nate and Brenda), they emerge [...] "as the ideal couple at the end." [...] Sally Munt, in her book Queer Attachments: The Cultural Politics of Shame, said, [...] "For the first time in mass broadcasting, gay David is the 'everyman' whose quest for love and self-acceptance inculcates the viewer." [...] In reference to the scene when David comes out to his mother, Queer TV: Theories, Histories, Politics commented that it [...] "purposefully counters the predictability of most coming out scenes in film and television texts, in which a bold declaration is followed swiftly by angry rejection or emotional acceptance." [...] The book <b>Fade</b> <b>to</b> <b>Black</b> and White: Interracial Images in Popular Culture called the relationships between Keith, David, their niece Taylor and their adopted children a [...] "rare exception" [...] to the interracial relationships on television that advance negative stereotypes. Ellen Lewin, in her book Gay Fatherhood: Narratives of Family and Citizenship in America, cited David and Keith as [...] "realistic, if somewhat [...] " [...] examples of real gay fathers who adopt children that heterosexual couples – with [...] "more attractive options (presumably)" [...] – might not adopt, a trend that contrasts with the typical stereotype of the pleasure-seeking and self-indulgent gay male.|$|E

50|$|The cartoon <b>fades</b> <b>to</b> <b>black</b> after Rip van Winkle {{eliminates}} everyone into The Hurricane and Gone {{with the}} Wind pops up. As {{a result of}} this, the brief scene where the cuckoo bird's mouth is covered and van Winkle sleeping on the clock is also cut.|$|R
50|$|The {{final scene}} reveals that Dexter {{is still alive}} and living under an assumed identity, working for a lumber company in Oregon. After work, Dexter {{makes his way to}} an empty shack, sits at his desk, and stares into the camera as the screen <b>fades</b> <b>to</b> <b>black.</b>|$|R
