50|$|The known predators of Indian {{hedgehogs}} include foxes, <b>Indian</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mongooses</b> (Herpestes edwardsi), and rock-horned owls (Bubo bubo turcomanus). Predators have to {{be quick}} and resourceful to snatch the hedgehog before it curls up into its prickly ball.|$|R

40|$|The activity, movements, {{home range}} size, habitat selection, social structure, density, pattern of faeces deposition, anti-predator behaviour, diet, and {{availability}} {{and distribution of}} the main food sources of two mongoose species [the yellOW mongoose Cynictis penicillata and the Cape <b>grey</b> <b>mongoose</b> Galerella pulverulenta (= Herpestes pulverulentus) in a coastal area of South Africa are compared. Both species were diurnal. Galerella did not use dens, whereas Cynictis never rested outside a den. Total distance moved, home range size and density did not differ between the two species. Galerelfa frequented bush, whereas Cynictis frequented open fields. The yellow mongoose was more social than the <b>grey</b> <b>mongoose,</b> but the basic social structure was similar. Faeces of Cynictis were found in large clumps close to the dens, while those of Galerella were more scattered. This parallels the greater constancy of use of the sleeping sites by Cynictis. Rodents (> 90 % of Cape <b>grey</b> <b>mongoose</b> diet) were much more abundant in the bush, while availability of insects (main food source for the yellow mongoose) was higher in the open fields. Habitat selection, through its effects on anti-predator and feeding strategies, {{might have been the}} leading factor in the evolution of sociality in herpestids...|$|R
