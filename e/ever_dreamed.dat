They knew older anthracite coal fields in northwestern New Jersey, southern New York, and northern Pennsylvania were playing out. Under their auspices, the former AM was greatly expanded as the N into the coal fields and beyond and became a system larger and far more wealthy than Mahone probably had <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed.</b>|$|E

[...] After travelling at 400mph (644km/h), the 67-year-old Frenchman said [...] "C'était magnifique... It was all I <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> of in aviation—no propellers, no vibration."

500|$|Garfield and his {{supporters}} knew they would face a difficult election {{without the support of}} the New York Stalwarts and decided to offer one of them the vice presidential nomination. [...] Levi P. Morton, the first choice of Garfield's supporters, consulted with Conkling, who advised him to decline, which he did. [...] They next approached Arthur, and Conkling advised him to also reject the nomination, believing the Republicans would lose. Arthur thought otherwise and accepted. [...] According to a purported eyewitness account by journalist William C. Hudson, Conkling and Arthur argued, with Arthur telling Conkling, [...] "The office of the Vice-President is a greater honor than I <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> of attaining."

[...] Schweizer believed that many male improvisers felt threatened by FIG because of their use of humour, [...] "We were not that serious, like men, ... they take [...] so seriously". Georgie Born described FIG's humour as [...] "very iconoclastic and very surreal, or very silly. There were no big boys there standing judging."

Rolling Stone contributor Greg Kot pairs it with [...] "Taxman" [...] as two [...] "major contributions" [...] that saw Harrison [...] " [...] into his own as a songwriter" [...] on Revolver. Kot describes [...] "Love You To" [...] as [...] "a boldly experimental track" [...] and [...] "the first full-scale incorporation of Eastern instruments on a Beatles album".

His requests to the wealthy enthusiasts who had taken up the fashionable pursuit of growing rare orchids brought large numbers of specimens. These would be a test of his theory: previously aspects such as coloration {{of plants and animals}} had often been regarded as having no adaptive function. For example, Thomas Henry Huxley was strongly influenced by German idealism and in 1856 had asked if it was [...] "to be supposed for a moment that the beauty of colour and outline... are any good to the animals?...

500|$|... "Cherry on Top" [...] is a pop and R {{track with}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 48 seconds. Unlike the majority of Oh Land's songs, it is not an uptempo track. Instead, it contains [...] "piano instrumentals" [...] and [...] "light background harmonies". It features lyrics with a [...] "relatable" [...] message and [...] "figurative imagery". Oh Land herself stated that the song is about [...] "always going for the win, always focusing on the result and sometimes missing the process because you're such a perfectionist". According to Paul MacInnes from The Guardian, the lyrics serve as a [...] "plea to a lover about the pitfalls of excess"; the song opens with Oh Land singing, [...] "Small boy, big dreams / Going in for a bite", which is [...] "sublimely literal". She proceeds in the chorus: [...] "You can have it all but you never stop / 'Cause all you ever want is the cherry on top" [...] / [...] "And all you <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> of, it ain't enough / You'll never fill that hole with the cherry on top".|$|E
500|$|Garfield and the Ohio {{delegation}} desired a New York Stalwart as Garfield's {{vice presidential}} running mate, partly to placate Conkling, and partly {{to balance the}} ticket geographically. [...] Levi P. Morton declined after consulting with Conkling, who was still unhappy over Grant's loss and advised Morton not to accept. [...] The nomination was then offered to Chester A. Arthur, who had close Stalwart ties to Conkling, but who had impressed delegates with his work to broker the compromise on {{the selection of a}} convention chairman. Conkling tried to talk Arthur out of accepting, but Arthur insisted that he would, calling the Vice Presidency [...] "a greater honor than I <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> of attaining." [...] Arthur won the nomination after he received 468 votes, next to the 193 for Elihu Washburne, and 44 for the third major candidate, Marshall Jewell. Former Governor Edmund J. Davis of Texas and several others were also nominated, but received little support.

In the story, told in a non-lineal manner, she portrayed Cristina Peck, a grief-stricken woman living a suburban {{life after the}} killing {{of her husband and}} two children by Jack Jordan (Benicio del Toro), who started a relationship with the critically ill academic mathematician Paul Rivers (Sean Penn). She said of the nomination, [...] "It's far beyond what I <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> for – that would have been too far fetched". She also was nominated for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, as well as many other nominations and acclaim. The New York Times praised her: [...] "Because Ms. Watts reinvents herself with each performance, it's easy to forget how brilliant she is. She has a boldness that comes from a lack of overemphasis, something actresses sometimes do to keep up with Mr. Penn". The San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Watts is riveting, but she's much better in scenes of extreme emotion than in those requiring subtlety." ...|$|E

Greg Bone and Anderson played the guitars, while Anderson played the drums and keyboards. Produced by Brothers in Rhythm and Minogue, [...] "Did It Again" [...] is a pop rock song. Michael Dwyer from Western Australia magazine commented on Minogue's departure from dance music and bubblegum pop and her maturity since {{her work with}} Stock, Aitken and Waterman, stating [...] "Some Kind Of Bliss and Did It Again have already proved our Kylie has more tricks up her sleeve this time than Stock, Aitken and Waterman <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> of and her sixth album harbours more strings to her carefully-cultivated bow." [...] British writer Sean Smith, author of Kylie (2014), commented that [...] "Did It Again" [...] was another track, along with [...] "I Don't Need Anyone", from Impossible Princess that [...] "didn't really sound like Kylie". He further commented that [...] "Did It Again" [...] was [...] "a blend of drums and electric guitar that might have found its way onto The Beatles' famous Revolver album."

[...] Johnson recorded [...] "Walking in the Air" [...] as a duet with fellow Britain's Got Talent contestant Faryl Smith, and the song was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. The recording was finished by September 2008, after which Johnston began to make appearances to publicise the release, including appearances on GMTV, Channel 5 News, BBC Breakfast, This Morning and Radio 2's Friday Night Is Music Night. In preparation for the album's promotion, Johnston received confidence tutoring. He said that [...] "I've got no confidence and sometimes people get on at me for being moody so I've had some help with that." [...] Johnston also received vocal training from Yvie Burnett, who was, at the time, coaching Leona Lewis and Leon Jackson, and with whom Smith trained during Britain's Got Talent.

500|$|Conversely, Allmusic's Chris True had {{selected}} the song as an album stand {{out and a}} career stand out track.

Dark, noisy tracks like [...] "Limbo," [...] the trip-hoppy [...] "Jump," [...] and the more rock-oriented [...] "I Don't Need Anyone" [...] and [...] "Some Kind of Bliss"—both of which were co-written by the Manic Street Preachers' James Dean Bradfield—found her trying on different styles to replace the bubblegum pop of the past.” A reviewer from Who Magazine called the song [...] "Funky , Spunky, Rocky, Big." [...] Gareth Gorman {{said that while the}} song showcased Minogue's [...] "thin vocals", he followed saying [...] "it still works due to one of those melody lines that is inevitable stunning, simple and effective." [...] Michael Dwyer from Western Australia magazine stated [...] "Some Kind Of Bliss and Did It Again have already proved our Kylie has more tricks up her sleeve this time that Stock, Aitken and Waterman <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> of and her sixth album harbours more strings to her carefully-cultivated bow."
