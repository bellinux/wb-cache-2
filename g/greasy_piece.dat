6000|$|When the Lygonani had gone, {{one of us}} {{thought of}} opening the basket he had brought as a proof that Flossie was really their prisoner. On lifting the lid it was found to contain a most lovely {{specimen}} of both bulb and flower of the Goya lily, which I have already described, in full bloom and quite uninjured, and what was more a note in Flossie's childish hand written in pencil upon a <b>greasy</b> <b>piece</b> of paper {{that had been used}} to wrap up some food in: -- ...|$|E

60|$|After some minutes {{spent in}} wiping <b>greasy</b> <b>pieces</b> of steel which the chauffeur extracted, and {{subsequent}} ceaseless grinding on the crank, the engine started again, {{not without a}} series of protesting cracks like pistol shots. The chauffeur and Brent leaped in, the bystanders parted with derisive cheers, and away {{they went through the}} village, only to announce by another series of explosions a second disaster {{at the other end of}} the street. A crowd collected there, too.|$|R
2500|$|US writer, John M. Borack, {{rated the}} album at No.11 in {{his list of}} The 200Greatest Power Pop Albums, as it {{demonstrated}} [...] "a sublime concoction of equal parts '90s pop power and '60s melodicism" [...] with tracks full of [...] "meaty, beaty, big and ballsy guitar riffs living {{in a state of}} sheer bliss with non-cliched lyrics". An EP, 5 <b>Greasy</b> <b>Pieces,</b> was released that same year, while a compilation of b-sides and out takes, Garage Sale, was issued the following year. US label Bomp! Records also issued a compilation, Dig It the Most, in support of the band's 1997 tour. That year Italiano left and was replaced by ex-The Stems, bass guitarist, Matthews. DM Three's third album, Rippled Soul, appeared in September 1998. In 1999 Jeff Baker joined on guitar but the group disbanded later that year. Price declared that DM3 could [...] "arguably be called the best power pop band ever to come out of Australia".|$|R
2500|$|Ingram soon {{realized}} that the word burger evoked connotations of circus performances at livestock markets and <b>greasy</b> <b>pieces</b> of meat eaten in the poorest districts {{of the city in}} the collective mind of the American public. He tried to change those connotations from White Castle's earliest days. At the same time, he became known to some as the Henry Ford of the hamburger, while inventing a restaurant concept he called the [...] "White Castle System", which helped the hamburger achieve fame. Between 1923 and 1931, the [...] "White Castle System" [...] established almost a hundred restaurants in cities throughout the Midwestern United States. In order to raise awareness among White Castle employees, a newsletter entitled [...] "The hot hamburger" [...] was circulated throughout the company, which challenged the employees to improve the sale of the burgers with a simple idea: to be able to prepare burgers rapidly so anyone could purchase and eat them anytime and anywhere. Instead of waiting for half an hour to be served at a traditional restaurant, the White Castle System provided rapid service and a menu centered around the hamburger. At the time, the hamburger was typically served with coffee. Upton Sinclair's The Jungle had already caused public outrage over the safety of processed meat, so by the 1920s, the general public had come to expect a clean and hygienic hamburger. In addition to offering clean and safe food, White Castle offered regularity and standardization, ensuring that each patty was served in the same manner in each restaurant. At the time, this was an entirely novel idea that would revolutionize the sale of food itself with a style that would {{come to be known as}} fast food. During its early years, White Castle emphasized providing quality coffee, and collaborated with universities to publish studies on the nutritional quality of their hamburgers.|$|R
6000|$|The French milliner, who {{occupies}} {{one of the}} corners, {{begins to}} remove the <b>greasy</b> <b>pieces</b> of paper which have enveloped her locks during the journey. She withdraws the [...] "Madras" [...] of dubious hue which has bound her head for the last five-and-twenty hours, and replaces it by the black velvet bonnet, which, bobbing against your nose, has hung from the Diligence roof since your departure from Boulogne. The old lady in the opposite corner, who has been sucking bonbons, and smells dreadfully of anisette, arranges her little parcels in that immense basket of abominations which all old women carry in their laps. She rubs her mouth and eyes with her dusty cambric handkerchief, she ties up her nightcap into a little bundle, and replaces it by a more becoming head-piece, covered with withered artificial flowers, and crumpled tags of ribbon; she looks wistfully at the company for an instant, and then places her handkerchief before her mouth:--her eyes roll strangely about for an instant, and you hear a faint clattering noise: the old lady has been getting ready her teeth, which had lain in her basket among the bonbons, pins, oranges, pomatum, bits of cake, lozenges, prayer-books, peppermint-water, copper money, and false hair--stowed away there during the voyage. The Jewish gentleman, who has been so attentive to the milliner during the journey, and is a traveller and bagman by profession, gathers together his various goods. The sallow-faced English lad, who has been drunk ever since we left Boulogne yesterday, and is coming to Paris to pursue the study of medicine, swears that he rejoices to leave the cursed Diligence, is sick of the infernal journey, and d--d glad that the d--d voyage is so nearly over. [...] "Enfin!" [...] says your neighbor, yawning, and inserting an elbow {{into the mouth of}} his right and left hand companion, [...] "nous voilà." ...|$|R
