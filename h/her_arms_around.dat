25|$|According to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Kennedy {{was waving}} to the crowds {{on his right}} with his right arm upraised {{on the side of}} the limo when a shot entered his upper back, {{penetrated}} his neck and slightly damaged a spinal vertebra and the top of his right lung. The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side of his suit tie knot. He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and left. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, then put <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him in concern.|$|E
25|$|A woman's legs {{can remain}} flat or raised toward her chest, or {{wrapped around the}} {{penetrating}} partner at various heights: {{at the back of}} the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the Wiener Auster or Viennese oyster. In the higher leg positions the woman's legs may need some support, which may be achieved by crossing the ankles behind the partner or resting on his shoulders. She may also hold them with her hands or cross <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> them at the knees. Some are flexible enough to cross the legs behind their heads. Alternatively, her partner may hold her legs up. Separating straight legs carry the risk of muscle pull of thigh muscles. The laying by the partner on raised legs puts excessive pressure on the woman's back.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the strict}} bail conditions, {{three days later}} Wotton {{attended}} a protest march through Townsville and laid flowers {{on the steps of}} the north Queensland city's police station in memory of Doomadgee. Wotton was being hailed a hero even before Doomadgee's sister put <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> Wotton's neck on 9 December, saying [...] "you're my warrior". After a subsequent court hearing, Wotton was allowed to return home to Palm Island in early May 2005.|$|E

500|$|After President Nixon {{told his}} family he would resign {{the office of}} the presidency, she replied, [...] "But why?" [...] She {{contacted}} White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new official china pattern from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings. On August 7, 1974, the family met in the solarium of the White House for their last dinner. Pat {{sat on the edge of}} a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband. When the president walked in, she threw <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him, kissed him, and said, [...] "We're all very proud of you, Daddy." [...] Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, [...] "Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling." ...|$|E
500|$|Faced {{with intense}} {{competition}} from the other astronauts, particularly John Glenn, Shepard quit smoking, and adopted Glenn's habit of taking a morning jog, {{although he did not}} {{go so far as to}} give up the cocktails or the philandering. On January 19, 1961, Robert R. Gilruth, the director of NASA's Space Task Group, informed the seven astronauts that Shepard had been chosen for the first American manned mission into space. Shepard later recalled Louise's response when he told her that she had <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> the man who would be the first man in space: [...] "Who let a Russian in here?" [...] During training he flew 120 simulated flights. Although his flight was originally scheduled for April 26, 1960, it was postponed several times by unplanned preparatory work, initially to December 5, 1960, then mid-January 1961, March 6, 1961, April 25, 1961, May 2, 1961, and finally to May 5, 1961. On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth. It was another body blow to American pride. When Shepard heard the news he slammed his fist down on a table so hard a NASA public relation officer feared he might have broken it.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{was five}} years old, in 1963, her mother, Madonna Ciccone, {{died of breast cancer}} at the age of30. Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's {{behavior}} and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> her mother tenderly. [...] "I remember feeling stronger than she was", Madonna recalled, [...] "I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child." [...] Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. [...] "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> the pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table and stares at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E
2500|$|Gunnhild was {{the patron}} and lover of Hrut Herjolfsson (or Hrútur Herjólfsson), an Icelandic {{chieftain}} who visited Norway {{during the reign}} of Gunnhild's son Harald. This dalliance was all the more scandalous given the difference in their ages; the fact that Gunnhild was a generation older than Hrut was considered noteworthy. Gunnhild engaged in public displays of affection with Hrut that were normally reserved for married couples, such as putting <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his neck in an embrace. Moreover, Gunnhild had Hrut sleep with her alone in [...] "the upper chamber." [...] Laxdaela Saga in particular describes the extent to which she became enamored of Hrut: ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his 'need to know', Sherrington {{states that}} [...] "as a teacher he had himself a wide and devoted following". His ward rounds were often crowded with students, attracted, as Brain puts it, by his [...] "gift of exposition, enthusiasm, {{and sense of}} the dramatic." [...] He endeared people to him with mannerisms which Sherrington states to have been [...] "very symbols of him." [...] One example of Head's {{confidence}} and unflappability occurred when he was listening to a female patient's heart. Without warning the patient threw <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> the doctor and kissed him. Without hesitation, Head turned to his students, telling them calmly that this was [...] "typical, gentlemen, typical".|$|E

2500|$|In April 1919, Rheinschild {{was tried}} and {{found not guilty}} of {{complicity}} in an automobile theft; Rheinschild {{had been accused of}} hiding the automobile after it was stolen by another person. [...] In September 1919, Rheinschild was suspended from the practice of law for 18 months after being accused of unethical conduct in representing both parties in a loan transaction. [...] The Los Angeles Times reported that [...] "tears of mortification" [...] came into his eyes when the suspension was announced, and [...] "his young and attractive wife ran up to him and threw <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his neck and tenderly kissed him." [...] Two weeks later, the same judge reversed the suspension. [...] The following month, a different judge ordered Rheinschild disbarred, stating that the action was needed to set an example for other lawyers to restrain from similar conflicts of interest.|$|E
