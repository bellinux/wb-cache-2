5|$|Like {{a typical}} mobile ransomware, <b>it</b> <b>employs</b> scare tactics to extort {{people to pay}} a ransom. The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, {{demanding}} the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.|$|E
5|$|The 55th Rescue Squadron {{operates}} the Sikorsky HH-60G Pave Hawk and deploys combat rescue forces worldwide. <b>It</b> <b>employs</b> its helicopter and aircrews in hostile environments to recover downed aircrew and isolated personnel during day, night, or marginal weather conditions.

5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. <b>it</b> <b>employs</b> hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
5|$|Jahangir's Quadrangle {{occupies}} the northeastern {{corner of the}} fort. Though named for Jahangir, construction on the site began in 1617 or 1618 {{during the reign of}} Akbar, but was completed in 1620 under Jahangir. Akbar's syncretic style is noted in the quadrangle, as <b>it</b> <b>employs</b> column brackets carved in the form of animals. The quadrangle's layout differs from other Mughal quadrangles which are based upon the layout of a Persian paradise garden, and instead is formed by concentric rectangles with a fountain in its centre.|$|E
5|$|The Isobarik is {{so named}} as <b>it</b> <b>employs</b> the {{isobaric}} loading principle invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted {{in a sealed}} container and driven in parallel so as to effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used {{a variant of the}} isobaric principle and patented the use of two bass drive units ("woofers") facing forward in an isobaric arrangement in early 1974.|$|E

5|$|Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Miami is a {{separate}} non-profit organization operated by the Archdiocese of Miami. It {{is part of a}} national network of organizations that are operated in each U.S. diocese. This organization claims to be the largest nongovernmental provider of services to the needy in South Florida. It began in 1931 during the Great Depression with four Miami-area pastors and lay members of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. <b>It</b> <b>employs</b> over 600 staff and operates on an annual budget of over $38 million. In 2006, it served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties. Some of these services include transitional housing, homeless shelters, elderly day care, child day care, addiction recovery, HIV/AIDS programs, family and school counseling, meals for the elderly and various immigrant and refugee help programs among others.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong is {{the first}} example of a {{complete}} narrative told in video game form, and like 1980's Pac-Man, <b>it</b> <b>employs</b> cutscenes to advance its plot. The game opens with the gorilla climbing a pair of ladders {{to the top of}} a construction site. He sets Pauline down and stomps his feet, causing the steel beams to change shape. He then moves to his final perch and sneers. This brief animation sets the scene and adds background to the gameplay, a first for video games. Upon reaching the end of the stage, another cutscene begins. A heart appears between Mario and Pauline, but Donkey Kong grabs the woman and climbs higher, causing the heart to break. The narrative concludes when Mario reaches the end of the rivet stage. He and Pauline are reunited, and a short intermission plays. The gameplay then loops from the beginning at a higher level of difficulty, without any formal ending.|$|E

5|$|Halo 3 {{utilizes}} a proprietary, in-house graphics engine. As detailed on the Bungie website, <b>it</b> <b>employs</b> advanced graphics {{technologies such}} as high dynamic range, global lighting and depth of field effects within cutscenes. Motion blurring was absent from the beta, but {{was added to the}} final game. Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows on themselves and the environment around them, including the game's plant life. Halo 3 uses normal, bump, and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons. Players can see distances of up to ten miles (16km) away, all fully three-dimensional. Real time reflections were written into the engine; however, they are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources.|$|E
5|$|KNI and its {{subsidiary}} Pilersuisoq, a state-owned {{chain of}} all-purpose general stores in Greenland, {{are based in}} Sisimiut. The Pilersuisoq chain operates in all small settlements in the country, as well as smaller towns which {{are not covered by}} supermarket chains. A range of shops operate in Sisimiut, from chain supermarkets of Pisiffik and Brugsen to independent outlets, also serving supplies to the smaller settlements in the region. Polaroil, a liquid fuel distribution company, is headquartered in Sisimiut. <b>It</b> <b>employs</b> 70 staff and operates 70 stations in Greenland. The headquarters were moved from Maniitsoq to Sisimiut in the late 2000s. In 2010 KNI announced plans to also move the operational base of Polaroil from Maniitsoq to Sisimiut, causing protests in the former community already experiencing depopulation. Other facilities include two banks, a library, a Post Greenland office and a small hospital/health center with 19 beds.|$|E
5|$|The academy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} in Europe, operating at a cost of £5million a year. The main cost is the dormitory, La Masia itself. The minimum age for the youth program is six years; each year, more than 1,000boys from the ages of six to eight try out for admittance. The best 200 are selected. The club also actively seeks for prospective students; <b>it</b> <b>employs</b> a system in which 15scouts are deployed in Catalonia, 15 in the rest of Spain and 10 scattered throughout the world. To alleviate the expenses of this scouting, the club has an agreement with 15 local clubs for them to train players who are not ready for entry into the youth academy. In return, FC Barcelona gives money, coaching and technical advice to these clubs for their services. While expanding its operations abroad, the club established five schools in Mexico and one in Egypt; successful applicants to these schools become full-time students, receiving academic education and football training.|$|E

5|$|The film {{operates}} on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. <b>It</b> <b>employs</b> {{some of the}} conventions of film noir, among them {{the character of a}} femme fatale; narration by the protagonist (in the original release); chiaroscuro cinematography; and giving the hero a questionable moral outlook—extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity. It is a literate science fiction film, thematically enfolding the philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery of genetic engineering in the context of classical Greek drama and hubris. It also draws on Biblical images, such as Noah's flood, and literary sources, such as Frankenstein. Linguistically, the theme of mortality is subtly reiterated in the chess game between Sebastian and Tyrell, supposedly based on the famous Immortal Game of 1851 (though Scott has said this was merely coincidental).|$|E
5|$|The poem is an elegy in {{name but}} not in form; <b>it</b> <b>employs</b> a style {{similar to that of}} {{contemporary}} odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be good and bad, and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, the obscure and the known, the poem has possible political ramifications, but it does not make any definite claims on politics to be more universal in its approach to life and death.|$|E
5|$|BS Fire Emblem: Archanea Senki-hen, {{commonly}} referred to as BS Fire Emblem, is an episodic tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and released in 1997 following the release of Genealogy of the Holy War. It acts as a prequel to the events of the first Fire Emblem title and Mystery of the Emblem. The four episodes of BS Fire Emblem were broadcast between September and October 1997 on the Satellaview peripheral service, a system where short games were downloaded via satellite at given times of day. While <b>it</b> <b>employs</b> the same tactical gameplay as the mainline titles, it throws waves of enemies at the main party during a three-hour time limit. BS Fire Emblem was directed and designed by Kaga, while the music was composed by Tsujiyoko in her role as composer and sound director. The character artwork was done by Rika Suzuki, a newcomer to the Fire Emblem series who would later go on to create character illustrations for Fire Emblem Awakening. It was the first title in the Fire Emblem series to include voice acting, created using livestreaming during the original broadcast. The game used the technology created for Mystery of the Emblem.|$|E
