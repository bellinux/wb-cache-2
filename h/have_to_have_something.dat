My dad was chief then, and we knew we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> present to the governor; so we went to a turkey farm, bought a live turkey, brought it back to the reservation and killed it.

Stahl said Jurassic Park: Survival was [...] "one of the more challenging" [...] projects he had worked on: [...] "In {{a lot of ways}} it was the worst because I was taking design ques from the other two films as far as some of the props, locations, and stuff but {{this was supposed to be}} an official game that ties or is in conjunction with Jurassic Park III so I really <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> that film <b>to</b> base my stuff on.

Many Cherokee people believed that stories came from ancestors and were worried that Indian Removal would end this tradition, but Glancy reveals through the Basket Maker the importance of telling stories orally {{as a way to}} preserve the reality of history and as a way to maintain aspects of the Cherokee culture despite the Trail of Tears.

Released in August to critical acclaim, it showcased Cooder's return to his early work's musical style and told topical stories about political and social corruption, various economic victims, and an emerging class war. With the album finished, Cooder had developed a penchant for writing such songs and wanted to continue writing more storyline-inspired songs. A month after the album's release, Cooder had his first short-story collection, Los Angeles Stories, published by City Lights Bookstore.
