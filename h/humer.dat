40|$|A specter is {{haunting}} Hume scholarship: {{the specter}} of the “New Hume. ” Contrary to more traditional interpretations, according to which Hume rejects belief in any conception of causation that invokes (metaphysically) necessary connections between distinct existences, proponents of the New Hume hold that Hume at the least allowed {{for the possibility of}} such connections—it’s just that he thought we couldn’t know much, if anything, about them, if we assume that they do exist. I will argue that the views of the “New Humers” (as I shall call them) are mistaken. I will begin by discussing their reading of Hume on causation, using Galen Strawson as a foil. I then examine the relation between Hume’s view of relations (pun intended) and his account of “necessary connexions”. Next, I argue that this account, once properly understood, shows that he did not believe in what we would think of as necessary connections {{while at the same time}} explaining why, as the New <b>Humers</b> point out, Hume sometimes writes in ways that can make it sound like he does, as well as reconciling Hume’s two definitions of causation. After that, I answer objections, and then raise some doubts about Hume’s account before finally concluding the paper...|$|R

40|$|The broad {{aspirations}} {{of social policy}} in the EU {{continue to be the}} preserve of the Member States as the particular histories, ideas, and institutions upon which national social policies are based remain quite heterogeneous.

30|$|We know {{of only a}} {{few studies}} {{directly}} addressing the issue of subsidies/employment quotas for disabled workers. A paper by <b>Humer</b> et al. (2007) examines the impact of the Austrian Employment Act for the Disabled that grants extended employment protection, requires a hiring quota for firms, and subsidizes the employment of severely disabled (SD) workers. Estimating fixed effects regressions on disabled workers, they show that workers holding a job when acquiring legal SD-status have substantially better subsequent employment prospects after an SD-award than before, while the opposite is the case {{for those who do not}} hold a job at the date of SD-entry. These findings suggest that employment protection legislation places substantial firing costs on firms and has a major impact on the decisions of firms to hire disabled workers. The endogeneity of disability status is modeled as time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity captured via fixed effects. However, the SD award combines subsidies with other types of incentives to firms so it is difficult to conclude which part of the policy promotes employment of the disabled.|$|E

Compared with insulating materials used in room temperature, the cryogenic temperature resistant insulating materials were fabricated in room temperature but used in cryogenic temperature, such as 77, 4.2, 1.8  K and so on. Due to different thermal shrinkage rate of metal and insulating material, thermal stress will be come into being during cool-down from room temperature to cryogenic temperature. As a result, excellent mechanical properties at cryogenic temperature of the cryogenic temperature resistant insulating materials are expected (Usami et al. 1999).

40|$|The {{access to}} Services of General Interest (SGI) {{is a highly}} {{relevant}} factor for territorial cohesion and in creating economic opportunity. Although the topic of SGI {{was not on the}} top of the policy agenda during the last decade, it attracts far more interest since the start of the economic crisis. Moreover, it is likely to be high on the regional development policy agenda for the years to come. The timely and consistent delivery of SGI is critical to the functioning of the modern welfare state which provides implicit and explicit support for the innovative and economically productive parts of the economy. Empirical evidence demonstrates the emergence of such trends in some regions of Europe (ESPON 2013). Historically, rural areas have been disadvantaged when it comes to what is today named as SGI. This has changed during the last decades and three arguments are usually given for this: (1) One of the EU?s key political goals is territorial cohesion, which aims at improving the conditions for the least advantaged regions; (2) SGI forms a central element in the ?European Model of Society?, i. e. access to services is considered a central element of quality of life, and increasing service accessibility a mechanism for overcoming social exclusion and isolation; and (3) SGI addresses the crucial question of what role public authorities should play in societies that are committed to both free markets and social goals (Nugera-Tur et al. 2009). This conclusion can thus be criticised as it only cover the period up to the financial crisis and mainly focuses on infrastructure, i. e. Services of General Economic Interest. SGI is not a homogeneous concept, but contains Services of General Economic Interest and Social Services of General Interest (Foss et al. 2013), and there are significant differences in the provision of Social Services of General Interest (SSGI) at a regional level in the EU (<b>Humer</b> & Palma 2013, <b>Humer</b> 2014). The knowledge gap when it comes to SSGI in rural areas calls for investigation. This paper aims at discussing the provision of SSGI in rural areas and three questions will be addressed: (1) what determines the provision of SSGI in rural areas. (2) How is SSGI provided in rural areas? If we find a gap between how SSGI can be provided and how it is actually provided we face a challenge to overcome which raises the question (3) how can this challenge be addressed...|$|E

It provides definitions of young adult fiction from various authors and touches on the topic of family and the way it appears in this genre in Slovenia. The final chapter of the theoretical part discusses family, various types of families and the typology of families. As for the empirical part of the thesis, it presents literary analyses of the motif of family in order to identify it in all 60 fairy tale stories in Svetlana's Fairy Tales. The goal is to analyse the motif of family in all 60 fairy tale stories in Svetlana's Fairy Tales, particularly the way it is featured in the anthology. Using the typology conceived by Rener, Švab, Žakelj and <b>Humer</b> (2005) we classified the types of families found in the fairy tales according the main literary character. The goal is to analyse the motif of family in all 60 fairy tale stories in Svetlana's Fairy Tales {{on the basis of the}} said typology. We tried to determine which type of family predominates, whether the mother or the father are the main characters, and how the main children characters are depicted. The empirical part concludes with the analysis of the motif of siblings and grandparents. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to discuss the impact of {{polycentric}} structures and other regional patterns on the provision of Social Services of General Interest (SSGI). Polycentricity has been a favoured spatial pattern of EU policies since the European Spatial Development Perspective ESDP 1999 which is promoted alongside efficient and resilient spatial structuring for socio-economic activities. The objective of a polycentric development was also taken further in the debate about European territorial cohesion policy (Faludi, 2006; Council of the European Union, 2006), being considered a key element to achieve territorial cohesion (Territorial Agenda, 2011). The theoretical background on SSGI provision builds upon the elaborations of ESPON/SeGI project (Rauhut et al. 2013) that defines SSGI as an open, normative EU policy field, nevertheless linked to national understandings of public services (Bj 8 rnsen et al. 2013). First attempts of discussing the influence of polycentricity on SSGI provision have been made by Borges and Johansson (2013). In this study, the analysis shall be carried forward by using the single SSGI indicators as well as calculated SSGI indices by <b>Humer</b> and Palma (2013) as the dependent variables in a set of multivariate regression analyses. A multivariate cross-section OLS regression model will be used to estimate the relative impact of polycentricity on our dependent variables which is the provision of educational and health care SSGI in EU and EFTA countries. Besides a polycentricity index provided by ESPON, further explanatory/ independent variables about population densities, settlement structures as well as macro-economic indicators will help in the regression model to decipher the impact of polycentricity. An additional space-sensitive step is included by running the regression model for various dependent variables (i. e. SSGI of educational and health care sectors) of different centrality scales. We expect to see different importance of polycentricity according to the range and frequency of usage of certain services such as for instance primary schooling (local centrality), hospitals (regional centrality) or universities (supra-regional centrality) The chosen method enables to control for a subset of explanatory variables and examine the effect of selected independent variables when estimating the impact of polycentricity to the provision of SSGI.

40|$|Graphene growth: The 2 D {{structure}} of graphene combined with its excellent physical properties make it attractive {{for improving the}} performance {{of a wide range of}} practical applications, particularly in the fields of high frequency electronics, optoelectronics, energy harvesting, and micro/nano-electro-mechanical systems. So far, the best graphene synthesis results — in terms of structural quality, thickness, uniformity and scalability — have been achieved using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on a copper catalyst. In order to fabricate graphene-based high- performance devices, graphene has to be transferred from the synthesis substrate onto a more device-compatible substrate. This transfer step is likely to damage the delicate single-layer which is prone to tearing, ripping and folding. Obviously, it is of first importance for devices performance and yield that graphene physical integrity is not degraded upon the transfer process. To improve graphene quality and processability, the CVD synthesis of graphene is performed onto a Cu thin film pre-deposited onto an oxidized Si wafer as catalytic substrate instead of a conventional Cu foil. Using a smooth, flat and rigid Cu film instead of a corrugated Cu foil leads to a more planar graphene film, which, in turn, causes less wrinkles and cracks after transfer. Moreover, this synthesis substrate improves graphene processability as it allows the direct processing of graphene by conventional CMOS technologies. ￼￼ Conventional transfer: Up to now, numerous techniques have been reported to transfer graphene from the Cu foil to a device- compatible substrate. The application of these techniques to graphene grown on a rigid Cu film is not straightforward. These techniques, and more particularly, the supporting materials (including PMMA, PDMS and thermal release tape) — used to facilitate graphene handling during the removal of the growth substrate — are investigated and compared. Physical integrity, degree of contamination, chemical purity of the transferred graphene film as well as the presence of transfer-induced internal stress are used as figure of merit in the quest to the development of a robust, reliable and scalable transfer process. Proximity transfer: Synthesizing graphene on a Cu thin film pre-deposited onto a device-compatible substrate can be used to circumvent the delicate and cumbersome conventional transfer procedure. Using the Cu film as a sacrificial layer after the CVD process allows the direct deposition of graphene on the underlying substrate. The incomplete etching of the Cu film can be exploited to suspend graphene micro-ribbons or obtain metallic pads acting as electrodes. The key process parameters for a reliable proximity transfer consists in preventing graphene from tearing upon the Cu wet etching process step as well as enhancing the contact between graphene and the underlying so that fluid agitation cannot wash away graphene. Nano-indentation of graphene/Cu system: Recent studies demonstrated that mixing graphene flakes in a metal matrix causes a strengthening effect of the metal characterized by an enhancement of both Young’s modulus and yield strength [1]. In this work, we perform nano-indentation experiments on CVD-grown graphene on Cu film. The strengthening is investigated by measuring the response of bare Cu film and Cu/graphene stack to deformation. To better understand the mechanisms responsible for this strengthening, and more particularly how dislocations move and interact during nanoindenting Cu, TEM analyses have been performed on cross sections prepared by focused ion beam. It is found that the presence of graphene on the Cu surface reduces the plastic burst of the load-displacement curve for nanoindenting Cu. This means that dislocations nucleated in Cu are blocked at the interface between Cu and graphene and do not escape the surface. A single layer graphene acts as a very efficient and strong dislocations barrier. Energy Harvesting: In this work, we investigate the fabrication of graphene-based geometric diodes in order to develop rectenna solar cells able to harvest the energy of the electromagnetic spectrum in the teraHertz region. THz rectennas consist of micron-size antennas coupled to high-speed diodes to convert the high frequency AC field collected by the antenna to useable DC power. Geometric diodes use the ballistic transport of charge carriers in planar structures smaller than the mean free path to induce an asymmetric electrical characteristic. The 2 D structure and the great charge carriers mean free path at room temperature make graphene a promising material for the realization of an efficient diode-like electrical device. The extremely low capacitance due to the planar configuration of this diode makes it suitable for high frequency operation, i. e. several tens of THz. Networks of rectennas could be used in solar cells for thermophotovoltaic energy harvesting as well as in imaging sensors, requiring high quality graphene at wafer-scale. Optoelectronics: The use of graphene as an ultra-wideband and ultrafast absorber has been suggested for photo-detectors operating above 40 GHz modulation frequency [2]. Optical interconnects using the coupling of graphene with silicon photonic waveguides have been reported for the telecommunications wavelengths using graphene flakes obtained by exfoliation [3, 4]. We present our progress on fabricating graphene photo-detectors coupled with silicon photonic waveguides using CVD graphene. [1] J. Hwang, T. Yoon, S. H. Jin, J. Lee, T. -S. Kim, S. H. Hong and S.
