The structural scheme of gyroscopic gravimeter is proposed in a paper for multiple precision. This construction is providing immediate measurements of acceleration of gravity.

5000|$|In the {{beginnings}} of <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> technology, the hardware was just a collection of modules, and the functions of those modules had {{to be linked to}} accommodate different calculating operations. This linking was usually done by connecting some wires between modules and disconnecting others. For many mechanical <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>machines,</b> such as the IBM punched card accounting machines, their calculating operations were directed by the use of a quick-swap control panel wired to route signals between module sockets.|$|R
