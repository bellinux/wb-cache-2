5|$|The stomach in the {{cephalothorax}} {{acts as a}} pump {{that sends}} the food deeper into the <b>digestive</b> <b>system.</b> The mid gut bears many digestive ceca, compartments with no other exit, that extract nutrients from the food; most are in the abdomen, which {{is dominated by the}} <b>digestive</b> <b>system,</b> but a few are found in the cephalothorax.|$|E

5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short {{undifferentiated}} intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptomatic}} (determinate) chronic stage {{affects the}} nervous system, <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> and heart. About two-thirds {{of people with}} chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including dilated cardiomyopathy, which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> damage, resulting in dilation of the digestive tract (megacolon and megaesophagus), accompanied by severe weight loss. Swallowing difficulties (secondary achalasia) {{may be the first}} symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera {{juice is}} marketed {{to support the}} health of the <b>digestive</b> <b>system,</b> but there is neither {{scientific}} evidence nor regulatory approval to support this claim. The extracts and quantities typically used for such purposes appear to be dose-dependent for toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with larger organisms. For example, the bacteria that {{live within the}} human <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> contribute to human health through gut immunity, the synthesis of vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and the fermentation of complex indigestible carbohydrates.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{is valued}} for its peppery flavor and eaten after {{suitable}} preparation in Russia and Finland, {{the species is}} highly irritating to the <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> when eaten raw. The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or acrid taste, are destroyed by cooking. Studies have identified several chemicals present in the mushrooms, including ergosterol and derivatives thereof, and the pungent-tasting velleral.|$|E
5|$|During his {{military}} career he had blood vomits, such as before the Battle of Salta; {{he was almost}} too ill {{to participate in the}} battle. It is thought that those vomits originated in the <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> and were caused by stress, and not in the respiratory system, because the vomits were sporadic, the condition did not become chronic, and it eventually cured itself. Nothing was revealed in the autopsy.|$|E
5|$|Oats are {{the most}} popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower {{digestible}} energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the equine <b>digestive</b> <b>system.</b> They are also more palatable and digestible than other grains.|$|E

25|$|In human beings, phytoestrogens {{are readily}} absorbed, {{circulate}} in plasma and are excreted in the urine. Metabolic influence {{is different from}} that of grazing animals due to the differences between ruminant versus monogastric <b>digestive</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is practically harmless. However, ingestion of stronger solutions is dangerous to human and animal life. It can cause severe damage to the <b>digestive</b> <b>system,</b> and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the blood.|$|E
5|$|The Neocallimastigomycota were earlier {{placed in}} the phylum Chytridomycota. Members of this small phylum are {{anaerobic}} organisms, living in the <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> of larger herbivorous mammals and in other terrestrial and aquatic environments enriched in cellulose (e.g., domestic waste landfill sites). They lack mitochondria but contain hydrogenosomes of mitochondrial origin. As in the related chrytrids, neocallimastigomycetes form zoospores that are posteriorly uniflagellate or polyflagellate.|$|E
5|$|An insect {{uses its}} <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> to extract {{nutrients}} and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion.|$|E
50|$|During {{the final}} stages of {{transformation}} when the tadpoles have four limbs and a tail, they stop feeding for a short time while their mouths widen and their <b>digestive</b> <b>systems</b> adjust from herbivorous to carnivorous.|$|R
50|$|Zebras feed {{almost entirely}} on grasses, but may {{occasionally}} eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their <b>digestive</b> <b>systems</b> allow them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for other herbivores.|$|R
50|$|Mucor is a {{microbial}} genus {{of approximately}} 6 species of moulds {{commonly found in}} soil, <b>digestive</b> <b>systems,</b> plant surfaces, some cheeses like tomme de savoie, rotten vegetable matter and iron oxide residue in the biosorption process.|$|R
5|$|Horses {{and other}} members of the genus Equus are adapted by {{evolutionary}} biology to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, horses ate prairie grasses in semi-arid regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition. Therefore, their <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> was made to work best with a small but steady flow of food that does not change much from day to day.|$|E
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} {{begin to develop}} as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form {{the upper part of}} the <b>digestive</b> <b>system.</b> When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E
5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E
50|$|Colobuses are {{important}} for seed dispersal through their sloppy eating habits, {{as well as through}} their <b>digestive</b> <b>systems.</b> They are prey for many forest predators, and are threatened by hunting for the bushmeat trade, logging, and habitat destruction.|$|R
30|$|The {{use of a}} {{locoregional}} anesthetic with {{a long-term}} effect makes the administration of morphine preparations unnecessary, {{and the effect of}} this absence of morphine on the lungs and the urinary and <b>digestive</b> <b>systems</b> contributes to the patients’ postoperative well-being.|$|R
50|$|Also, as {{indicated}} by the study of Helen Newing, there is a correlation between body size and diet. Larger animals have more robust <b>digestive</b> <b>systems,</b> stronger jaws, and wider necks, which allow them to consume lower quality foods, larger fruits and seeds.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the main}} methods of {{removing}} thallium (both radioactive and normal) from humans is to use Prussian blue, a material which absorbs thallium. Up to 20g per day of Prussian blue is fed by mouth to the person, and it passes through their <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> and comes out in the stool. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are also used to remove thallium from the blood serum. At later stage of the treatment additional potassium is used to mobilize thallium from the tissue.|$|E
5|$|Prevention mostly {{involves}} eliminating kissing {{bugs and}} avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine {{has not been}} developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end–stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and <b>digestive</b> <b>system</b> irritation.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurs had {{self-sharpening}} {{teeth that}} would have been useful for cropping and slicing tough plant material. Unlike later ceratopsians, they did not have teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used gastroliths—stones swallowed to wear down food as it passed through the <b>digestive</b> <b>system.</b> Sometimes numbering more than fifty, these stones are occasionally found in the abdominal cavities of psittacosaurs, and may have been stored in a gizzard, as in modern birds.|$|E
50|$|Dead spores of {{the soil}} {{bacterium}} Bacillus thuringiensis, especially Bt israelensis (BTI) interfere with larval <b>digestive</b> <b>systems.</b> It can be dispersed by hand or dropped by helicopter in large areas. BTI loses effectiveness after the larvae turn into pupae, because they stop eating.|$|R
50|$|Macrorhabdus ornithogaster, {{also known}} by the common name avian gastric yeast, is an {{infectious}} fungus usually found in the <b>digestive</b> <b>systems</b> of birds, causing a number of health complications. Formerly {{believed to be a}} bacterium, it has been determined to be a yeast.|$|R
50|$|Coprophagous insects consume and redigest the feces {{of large}} animals. These feces contain {{substantial}} amounts of semi-digested food, {{particularly in the case}} of herbivores, owing to the inefficiency of the large animals' <b>digestive</b> <b>systems.</b> Two feces-eating insects are the dung-beetle and certain species of fly.|$|R
